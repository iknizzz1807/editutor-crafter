# Audit Report: bioinformatics-pipeline

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Exceptionally well-structured spec with clear technical depth and appropriate scope for advanced learners. The progression from basic parsing through DP alignment to heuristic methods and HMMs mirrors real bioinformatics workflows.

## Strengths
- Excellent progression from basic file parsing through optimal alignment to heuristic methods, multiple alignment, and HMMs
- Measurable acceptance criteria with specific performance benchmarks (e.g., "< 10 seconds for 10,000 bases")
- Comprehensive pitfalls section addressing domain-specific gotchas like Phred+33 vs Phred+64 encoding
- Realistic scope with appropriate time estimates for advanced difficulty
- Strong resource links to authoritative sources (Compeau & Pevzner, Durbin, Rosalind)
- Covers essential bioinformatics algorithms with practical considerations

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
