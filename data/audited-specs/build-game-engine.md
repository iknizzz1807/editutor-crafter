# Audit Report: build-game-engine

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
This is an exceptionally well-crafted expert-level game engine specification. The technical content is accurate, milestones build logically on each other, acceptance criteria are measurable, and the pitfalls section demonstrates deep domain expertise. The scope is realistic for 120-250 hours at expert difficulty.

## Strengths
- Excellent technical depth with accurate ECS, physics, and rendering concepts
- All acceptance criteria are objectively measurable (FPS counts, specific algorithm requirements, benchmark numbers)
- Logical progression from basic window/input → rendering → ECS → physics → full scene system
- Pitfalls section is thorough and covers real implementation traps that learners encounter
- Appropriate scope for expert level - ambitious but achievable with proper time estimates
- Prerequisites are well-defined and realistic
- Resource references are high-quality (Jason Gregory's book, Handmade Hero, Learn OpenGL)
- Security considerations addressed through resource handle validation and proper memory management
- Performance considerations integrated throughout (batching, spatial partitioning, cache-friendly data structures)

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
