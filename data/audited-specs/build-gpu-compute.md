# Audit Report: build-gpu-compute

**Score:** 7/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Solid GPU computing project with good technical coverage and progression, though final milestone could benefit from more quantitative optimization targets.

## Strengths
- Clear progression from CUDA fundamentals through memory optimization to profiling
- Good coverage of critical concepts (coalescing, shared memory, bank conflicts, streams)
- Appropriate scope for advanced difficulty (50-70 hours)
- Performance benchmarks and comparisons (naive vs optimized, CPU vs GPU)
- Practical pitfalls section addressing common GPU programming mistakes

## Minor Issues (if any)
- Profiling acceptance criteria are somewhat vague - 'Identify limiting factor' and 'Optimize based on profiling data' lack objective pass/fail metrics
