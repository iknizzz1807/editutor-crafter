# Audit Report: cache-optimized-structures

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Outstanding spec with rigorous technical content and measurable benchmarks. The progression from cache hierarchy detection through AoS/SoA transformations to cache-oblivious algorithms is well-designed.

## Strengths
- Excellent technical depth with hardware performance counters and cache profiling
- All acceptance criteria are measurably testable with specific benchmark outputs
- Clear progression from fundamentals (M1) through advanced optimization (M5)
- Strong pitfalls section identifying real implementation challenges like compiler optimizations eliminating memory access
- Well-specified estimated hours per milestone (7-12 hours range)
- Properly scoped for advanced difficulty with appropriate prerequisites
- Comprehensive coverage of cache-oblivious algorithms, memory layout transformations, and blocked operations

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
