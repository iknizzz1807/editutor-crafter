# Audit Report: computer-vision-pipeline

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Solid computer vision project with good technical accuracy and measurable outcomes. The progression from backbone to evaluation is logical, and acceptance criteria are verifiable.

## Strengths
- Clear milestone progression from CNN backbone through detection head to training and evaluation
- Measurable acceptance criteria with specific metrics (mAP at IoU 0.5:0.95, >30 FPS, IoU calculation)
- Good coverage of core CV concepts: convolutions, anchors, NMS, loss functions, data augmentation
- Appropriate warnings about common pitfalls (class imbalance, coordinate transforms, small objects)
- References to foundational papers (YOLO, SSD, FPN)
- Realistic scope for advanced difficulty

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
