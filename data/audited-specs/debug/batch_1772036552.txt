I've completed the audit of all 5 projects. Here's a summary:

## Audit Results Summary

| Project | Score | Verdict | Key Findings |
|---------|-------|---------|--------------|
| **auth-system** | 9/10 | ✅ Good | Excellent security-first approach with clear progression from password auth → JWT → OAuth → refresh tokens → hardening. Comprehensive pitfall coverage. |
| **background-job-processor** | 10/10 | ✅ Good | Masterclass in spec writing. Extremely detailed with specific Redis commands, perfect distributed systems coverage (at-least-once semantics, idempotency, crash recovery). |
| **benchmark-framework** | 9/10 | ✅ Good | Strong statistical methodology with confidence intervals, significance testing, and realistic pitfalls (dead code elimination, JIT effects). Good progression. |
| **bigtable-like-storage** | 10/10 | ✅ Good | Outstanding expert-level spec with deep LSM-tree architecture, specific performance targets (> 100K ops/sec), and excellent prerequisite alignment. |
| **binary-patcher** | 9/10 | ✅ Good | Exceptionally detailed with x86-64 instruction-level specifics, comprehensive security research skills, and excellent progression from static to runtime patching. |

## Overall Assessment

**All 5 projects are rated GOOD (scores 9-10/10)**. These specs demonstrate:

1. **Technical Accuracy**: All concepts are current and technically sound
2. **Measurability**: Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
3. **Progression**: Milestones build logically on each other
4. **Completeness**: Learning paths are comprehensive with no gaps
5. **Realism**: Scope is appropriate for difficulty levels
6. **Security**: Security considerations are well-covered where applicable
7. **Performance**: Performance considerations are addressed throughout

The **background-job-processor** stands out as the most detailed with its precise algorithm specifications (exponential backoff formulas, specific Redis commands) making it a model for distributed systems education.
