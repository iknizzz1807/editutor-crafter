I've audited all 5 projects. Here's the summary:

**4 projects rated GOOD (8-10/10):**
- **tokenizer** (9/10): Excellent beginner compiler project with clear progression and measurable criteria
- **topdown-shooter** (9/10): Strong intermediate game dev project with concrete numerical requirements
- **transformer-scratch** (10/10): Exceptional advanced ML project with rigorous verification standards
- **unit-testing-basics** (9/10): Well-designed testing tutorial with practical outcomes

**1 project needs fixes:**
- **type-checker** (7/10): M3 needs explicit constraint representation structure; M4 needs more verification criteria

The only real issues found:
1. M3 constraint representation should explicitly define what a constraint data structure looks like
2. M4 acceptance criteria are sparse and need concrete examples beyond the identity function

All other projects are well-specified with excellent measurability, logical progression, and appropriate scope for their difficulty levels.
