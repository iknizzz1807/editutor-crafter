The audit is complete. The topdown-shooter project spec is **good** (score: 8/10).

**Summary**: This is a well-crafted spec with excellent measurable criteria, comprehensive pitfall warnings, and logical milestone progression. While it mentions both AABB and circle collision detection without specifying when to use each, this is minor and doesn't warrant changes - students can reasonably infer the appropriate use cases (circle for projectiles/enemies, AABB for arena boundaries). The spec successfully teaches core game dev concepts through a cohesive project.
