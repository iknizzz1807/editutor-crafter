# Audit Report: differential-privacy-framework

**Score:** 7/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Solid coverage of differential privacy fundamentals. The milestones build logically and the concepts align with the canonical DP literature. Could benefit from more specific quantifiable acceptance criteria in later milestones.

## Strengths
- Covers core DP mechanisms: Laplace, Gaussian, exponential, composition theorems
- Good progression from basic mechanisms to advanced composition to aggregations
- Privacy budget management is a practical production concern
- Strong theoretical foundations with appropriate prerequisites (probability, statistics, calculus)
- Excellent resource selection (DP book, Google DP library, OpenDP)

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
