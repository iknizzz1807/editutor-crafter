# Audit Report: ecs-arch

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Excellent technical depth with measurable benchmarks and clear progression. The spec effectively teaches cache-aware programming and data-oriented design through concrete, verifiable milestones.

## Strengths
- Excellent measurable acceptance criteria with specific performance benchmarks (100ms for 1M entities, 2x speedup for archetypes)
- Strong progression from basic entity management through sparse sets to advanced archetype optimization
- Comprehensive pitfalls section covering subtle issues like generation counter overflow and sparse array growth
- Well-defined deliverables that build incrementally
- Clear distinction between sparse-set and archetype approaches with performance comparison
- Appropriate complexity for advanced level - 25-40 hours is realistic

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
