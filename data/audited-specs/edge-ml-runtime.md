# Audit Report: edge-ml-runtime

**Score:** 7/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Solid spec covering essential edge ML concepts, but acceptance criteria need more quantifiable performance targets for objective verification.

## Strengths
- Clear progression from memory management through quantization to optimization and hardware backends
- Good coverage of real edge ML concerns: quantization, operator fusion, hardware abstraction
- Prerequisites well-specified requiring neural network basics
- Pitfalls section appropriately covers numerical stability and embedded constraints

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
