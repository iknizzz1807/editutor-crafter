# Audit Report: formal-verification-logic

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
A well-designed formal methods project with clear progression and realistic scope. The only minor gap is that M5's 'tool building' acceptance criteria could be more specific about what constitutes a 'domain-specific verification tool' - students might build something too trivial.

## Strengths
- Excellent progression from basic SMT solving through program encoding to concurrent protocols
- Clear, measurable acceptance criteria throughout
- Strong pitfall warnings about solver limitations and quantifier issues
- Good balance of theory and practice with both Z3 and CVC5 mentioned
- Well-structured learning outcomes covering the full formal verification pipeline
- Prerequisites clearly defined for this expert-level content

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
