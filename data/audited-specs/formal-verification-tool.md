# Audit Report: formal-verification-tool

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
A solid implementation-focused formal methods project. The progression through specification language → weakest preconditions → SMT integration → invariant inference → modular verification is pedagogically sound. Could benefit from a reference simple language specification to scope M1 appropriately.

## Strengths
- Strong theoretical foundation with weakest precondition calculation clearly specified
- Excellent acceptance criteria in M2 with precise WP formulas
- Good separation of concerns across milestones (spec language → WP → SMT → invariants → modular)
- Realistic acknowledgment of undecidability limitations in M4
- Strong prerequisites ensure students have necessary PL background
- Clear distinction from 'formal-verification-logic' - this focuses on building the tool itself

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
