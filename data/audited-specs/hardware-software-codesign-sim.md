# Audit Report: hardware-software-codesign-sim

**Score:** 7/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Expert-level project with appropriate complexity and good validation requirements. Could benefit from more specific acceptance criteria for timing model accuracy beyond mentioning 'performance reports'.

## Strengths
- Clear milestone progression from ISA design through functional simulation to timing accuracy
- Appropriate expert-level scope with realistic time estimates (90-120 hours)
- Strong emphasis on validation against reference implementations
- Good coverage of performance analysis techniques (roofline modeling)
- Practical workload examples (matrix multiplication, neural network layers)

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
