# Audit Report: hyperparameter-optimization-engine

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Solid advanced ML engineering project with good coverage of AutoML fundamentals. The progression from basic configuration through Bayesian optimization to early stopping strategies is logical, and the measurable criteria ensure students implement working optimization algorithms rather than just calling libraries.

## Strengths
- Good progression from basic search space definition through multiple optimization algorithms (GP, TPE) to advanced pruning strategies
- Measurable acceptance criteria with specific algorithm requirements (EI, UCB acquisition functions)
- Strong resource links to foundational papers (Bergstra & others) and modern tools (Optuna, Ray Tune)
- Appropriate coverage of both sequential and parallel optimization approaches
- Realistic pitfalls covering practical issues (dimensionality, numerical instability, pruning aggressiveness)
- Good balance between theory (surrogate models) and practice (visualization, experiment tracking)

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
