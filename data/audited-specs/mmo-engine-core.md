# Audit Report: mmo-engine-core

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Exceptional spec with precise quantitative acceptance criteria and comprehensive expert-level content. The rollback scope constraint (<500 entities, not all 100k) is correctly documented to prevent physically impossible requirements.

## Strengths
- Outstanding measurability with explicit quantitative benchmarks throughout (2x SIMD speedup, <10ms clock sync, <2ms reconciliation, >50% bandwidth reduction)
- Comprehensive expert-level coverage with realistic constraints
- Excellent security considerations (encryption, anti-amplification, IP spoofing prevention)
- Strong technical accuracy with proper citations (Gaffer On Games, Valve, ENet)
- Logical progression from spatial partitioning through networking to prediction

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
