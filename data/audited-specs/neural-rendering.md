# Audit Report: neural-rendering

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Strong spec covering cutting-edge neural rendering techniques. The dual approach (NeRF + Gaussian Splatting) gives learners breadth while the milestones provide depth. Appropriate for learners targeting computer vision and graphics research roles.

## Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of both NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting - two major approaches in neural rendering
- Clear mathematical foundation with volume rendering equations and transmittance computation
- Measurable acceptance criteria including PSNR metrics and >30 FPS target for real-time rendering
- Realistic scope for expert difficulty - 70-90 hours for both NeRF and Gaussian Splatting
- Strong progression from core architecture → volume rendering → training → Gaussians → optimization
- Good prerequisite chain requiring transformer-scratch or equivalent deep learning experience
- Relevant to current industry trends - neural rendering skills are in high demand

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
