# Audit Report: platformer

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
This is a well-structured spec with technically accurate content, measurable acceptance criteria, and logical progression. The milestone breakdown effectively separates concerns (tile system -> core physics -> jump feel -> animation -> enemies), and the inclusion of game feel mechanics (coyote time, input buffering) demonstrates understanding of what makes platformers actually playable.

## Strengths
- Excellent technical depth with semi-implicit Euler integration and separate-axis collision resolution
- All acceptance criteria are objectively measurable and testable
- Milestones progress logically from static world -> basic physics -> polished movement -> presentation -> gameplay
- Comprehensive coverage of 'game feel' mechanics (coyote time, jump buffering, variable jump height)
- Well-documented common pitfalls that anticipate real implementation bugs
- Good balance between theory (concepts) and practice (skills)
- Resources are relevant and high-quality
- Realistic time estimates for intermediate difficulty
- Fixed timestep requirement addresses frame-rate independence properly

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
