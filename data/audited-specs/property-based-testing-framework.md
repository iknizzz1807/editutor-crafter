# Audit Report: property-based-testing-framework

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
This is a well-designed spec that accurately captures the core concepts of property-based testing frameworks. The progression is logical, acceptance criteria are measurable, and the prerequisites are appropriate for the advanced difficulty level.

## Strengths
- Well-structured milestone progression from basic generators → running → shrinking → stateful testing → integration
- Excellent prerequisite alignment - unit testing experience and type system knowledge are clearly necessary
- Comprehensive and realistic pitfalls section that addresses actual implementation challenges (non-termination, biased distribution, precondition explosion)
- Strong resource selection with original QuickCheck paper and modern Hypothesis docs
- Measurable acceptance criteria throughout (e.g., 'Integer generator with configurable range', 'Shrinking terminates with local minimum')
- Appropriate scope for advanced difficulty - stateful testing and coverage guidance are challenging but achievable
- Good balance between theory (concepts) and practice (skills deliverables)

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
