# Audit Report: reinforcement-learning-framework

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Outstanding RL framework spec with technically accurate concepts, measurable acceptance criteria, and logical progression. The pitfalls section is particularly strong with domain-specific guidance.

## Strengths
- Excellent milestone progression from basic components to DQN, then policy gradients, then PPO, then Atari
- Acceptance criteria are highly measurable with specific performance thresholds (e.g., 'average return > 195 over 100 episodes')
- Common pitfalls are highly specific and technically accurate (e.g., 'Bootstrap from terminal states should use reward only, not r + gamma * V')
- Comprehensive coverage of RL fundamentals: experience replay, target networks, policy gradients, GAE, CNN feature extraction
- Realistic scope estimation for advanced difficulty (60-90 hours)
- Excellent resource selection including seminal papers and practical implementations

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
