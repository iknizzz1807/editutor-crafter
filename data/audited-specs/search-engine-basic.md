# Audit Report: search-engine-basic

**Score:** 8/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Well-structured information retrieval project with clear milestones and measurable outcomes. Covers essential search engine concepts with appropriate depth for intermediate level.

## Strengths
- Clear progression from text preprocessing → inverted index → boolean queries → scoring → search API
- Measurable acceptance criteria throughout (e.g., 'Tokenizer splits text', 'Inverted index maps terms to list of (doc_id, positions)')
- Comprehensive coverage of IR fundamentals: tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, TF-IDF, BM25, boolean queries
- Realistic pitfalls that address common implementation bugs (apostrophe handling, Unicode normalization, operator precedence)
- Good prerequisite alignment (basic data structures, string manipulation, file I/O)
- Excellent resource references (Stanford IR book, Lucene docs, BM25 explanation)
- Estimated hours (25-35) are realistic for intermediate difficulty

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
