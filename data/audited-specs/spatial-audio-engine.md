# Audit Report: spatial-audio-engine

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Outstanding spec with excellent technical depth and logical milestone progression. Acceptance criteria are measurable and the scope is realistic for advanced game development.

## Strengths
- Excellent technical accuracy - HRTF, ITD/ILD, FDN reverb, and occlusion are correctly described
- Clear progression from basic 3D audio → HRTF → room acoustics → occlusion → real-time optimization
- Measurable acceptance criteria with specific technical requirements (e.g., <20ms latency)
- Realistic scope for advanced difficulty - 50-70 hours is reasonable
- Comprehensive pitfalls section covering real implementation challenges
- Good balance of theory (HRTF datasets) and practical implementation

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
