  "strengths": [
    "Excellent measurability with specific thresholds (diagonal speed ±1%, 100ms fire rate, 200 bullet pool)",
    "Comprehensive pitfalls section that anticipates common mistakes (division by zero, diagonal speed boost, state staleness)",
    "Clear progression: player → projectiles → enemies → full game loop",
    "Strong technical depth covering FSM AI, object pooling, delta-time physics, vector math",
    "Well-defined deliverables for each milestone",
    "Prerequisites and resources appropriately set expectations"
  ],
  "critique": "This is a well-structured spec with excellent technical depth and highly measurable acceptance criteria. The learning outcomes are clear and build logically from basic movement to complete game state management. While the spec mentions both AABB and circle collision detection in the essence, it doesn't explicitly specify when to use each - but this is minor and students can reasonably infer (e.g., circle for projectiles/characters, AABB for walls/arena boundaries). Overall, a solid intermediate game development project.",
