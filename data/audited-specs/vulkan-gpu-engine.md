# Audit Report: vulkan-gpu-engine

**Score:** 7/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
Decent Vulkan spec covering core API concepts. The milestones follow standard Vulkan initialization order. Could benefit from more specific performance measurability criteria and rendering output verification, but the fundamentals are sound.

## Strengths
- Logical Vulkan API progression: instance/device → pipeline → buffers → descriptors → sync → compute
- Appropriate for expert level with explicit GPU management focus
- Good reference to canonical Vulkan tutorial
- Covers all foundational Vulkan concepts needed for basic rendering
- Realistic time estimates for each milestone
- Pitfalls section addresses common Vulkan gotchas

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
