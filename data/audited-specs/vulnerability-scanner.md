# Audit Report: vulnerability-scanner

**Score:** 9/10
**Verdict:** ✅ GOOD - No significant issues

## Summary
A well-structured security project with strong technical accuracy, ethical considerations, and realistic acknowledgment of limitations. The progression from basic scanning to authenticated checks and CVE correlation is pedagogically sound.

## Strengths
- Excellent technical depth with raw socket programming, ARP/ICMP protocols, and TCP/IP stack internals
- Strong security emphasis - properly warns about legal/ethical considerations and defaults (default credential testing is opt-in, not default)
- Clear acknowledgment of real-world limitations (UDP scanning unreliability, CVE false positives from backported patches)
- Measurable acceptance criteria throughout with specific performance targets (e.g., 'scan 1000 ports in under 30 seconds')
- Logical progression: host discovery → port scanning → vulnerability correlation → reporting
- Appropriate scope for advanced level (45-65 hours)
- Addresses false-positive problem explicitly - a critical real-world concern in security tools

## Minor Issues (if any)
- None
