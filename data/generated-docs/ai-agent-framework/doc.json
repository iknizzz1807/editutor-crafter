Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>Building an AI agent that can autonomously complete multi-step tasks in the real world is not just a technical challenge—it&#39;s an architectural one. This section establishes the core problem space, introduces an intuitive mental model for thinking about the solution, and analyzes the landscape of existing frameworks to identify the specific gap this project aims to fill.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-delegating-executive\">Mental Model: The Delegating Executive</h3>\n<p>Imagine you are a senior executive with a broad goal: &quot;Improve our company&#39;s market position.&quot; You cannot accomplish this alone. Instead, you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decompose the goal:</strong> You break it into concrete tasks: &quot;Research competitors,&quot; &quot;Analyze Q3 financials,&quot; &quot;Draft a strategy memo.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Delegate to specialists:</strong> You assign the research to an analyst, the financials to an accountant, and the memo to a writer. You don&#39;t need to know <em>how</em> they perform their work, only <em>what</em> they need (the task) and <em>what</em> they produce (the result).</li>\n<li><strong>Manage a plan:</strong> You track task dependencies (the memo can&#39;t start until research and analysis are complete), sequence them, and adjust when something goes wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn from a corporate memory:</strong> You refer to past reports and meeting notes to inform decisions, and you archive the outcomes of this project for future reference.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Project Archon</strong> is the system architecture for an <strong>&quot;AI Executive.&quot;</strong> Its core components are direct analogs to this real-world scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Planner</strong> is the executive&#39;s project management skill, responsible for breaking down nebulous goals into actionable subtasks.</li>\n<li><strong>The Tool System</strong> represents the team of specialized employees (the analyst, the accountant, the writer). Each tool is a well-defined capability with a clear interface (a job description and expected inputs/outputs).</li>\n<li><strong>The ReAct Loop</strong> is the executive&#39;s daily operating rhythm: <code>Think</code> (consider the next step), <code>Act</code> (delegate a task), <code>Observe</code> (review the result), and repeat.</li>\n<li><strong>The Memory System</strong> is the executive&#39;s notebook (short-term), whiteboard (working memory for the current project), and corporate archive (long-term, searchable memory).</li>\n<li><strong>The Orchestrator</strong> (in multi-agent setups) is the department head, coordinating multiple executives (agents) who each have their own specialized teams (tools).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mental model transforms an abstract engineering problem into a relatable system design challenge. The goal is not to build a monolithic &quot;AI brain,&quot; but to design the <strong>organizational and operational framework</strong> that enables a Large Language Model (LLM) to function as a competent, autonomous executive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem-of-autonomous-action\">The Problem of Autonomous Action</h3>\n<p>A raw Large Language Model (LLM) is a brilliant strategist trapped in a conference room. It can reason, analyze, and propose plans with remarkable sophistication, but it cannot <em>act</em> on the world. It lacks the ability to execute code, query a database, call an API, or manipulate a file. This fundamental limitation stems from several interconnected challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Tool Use &amp; Integration:</strong> An LLM&#39;s knowledge is static, frozen at its training cut-off. It cannot access real-time information (stock prices, weather) or perform concrete computations. To be useful, it must be able to <strong>safely and reliably invoke external tools</strong>. This requires a consistent interface for describing tools, validating their inputs, executing them, and interpreting their outputs—all while the LLM operates in unstructured natural language.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Planning &amp; State Management:</strong> Real-world tasks are rarely single-step. &quot;Book a business trip&quot; involves checking calendars, finding flights, booking hotels, and submitting an expense report—a graph of dependent steps. An agent must be able to <strong>decompose a high-level goal, formulate a plan, track its progress through multiple states, and adapt when steps fail</strong>. This requires maintaining a persistent, structured representation of the task&#39;s state beyond the LLM&#39;s limited context window.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Loop Control &amp; Halting:</strong> If you give an LLM the ability to act, you must also give it the ability to <strong>know when to stop</strong>. An agent without a termination condition can loop infinitely, retrying failed actions or pursuing irrelevant tangents. The system must enforce guardrails like iteration limits, provide clear signals for task completion, and have fallback mechanisms to gracefully abort unproductive loops.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Context &amp; Memory Limitation:</strong> An LLM&#39;s context window is a small, volatile scratchpad. To work on a long task, an agent must <strong>selectively remember and recall relevant information</strong>. This includes the immediate conversation history, key facts learned during execution, and lessons from past similar tasks. Without effective memory management, the agent suffers from &quot;amnesia,&quot; repeatedly re-discovering the same information or losing track of its overall objective.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling &amp; Robustness:</strong> The external world is messy. Tools time out, APIs return errors, and user instructions are ambiguous. An autonomous agent cannot simply crash. It must <strong>detect failures, classify them (transient vs. permanent), attempt recovery (e.g., retries), and escalate unsolvable problems</strong> to a fallback strategy or the user. This requires a systematic approach to error propagation and observability throughout the execution pipeline.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The core architectural challenge is <strong>bridging the semantic gap</strong> between the LLM&#39;s unstructured reasoning and the structured, procedural world of software tools, while maintaining safety, observability, and control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"existing-approaches-and-trade-offs\">Existing Approaches and Trade-offs</h3>\n<p>Several frameworks have attempted to solve parts of this problem. Understanding their strengths and weaknesses clarifies the design space for Project Archon.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Framework</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Primary Strength</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Key Weakness / Trade-off</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Relevance to Our Goals</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>LangChain / LangGraph</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Ecosystem &amp; Integration.</strong> Offers a vast, pre-built collection of tools, agents, and memory implementations. Excellent for rapidly prototyping common patterns (ReAct, OpenAI Functions).</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Abstraction Leak &amp; Complexity.</strong> The high-level <code>AgentExecutor</code> can feel like a black box. Debugging requires understanding intricate chains of callbacks and intermediate states. Its &quot;kitchen sink&quot; approach can lead to bloated, hard-to-reason-about applications for custom needs.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Reference Implementation.</strong> We will study its patterns (especially the ReAct and tool-calling designs) but aim for a more transparent, modular, and explicit architecture where data flow and state are first-class concepts.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>AutoGPT / BabyAGI</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Ambition &amp; Goal-Oriented Design.</strong> Pioneered the concept of a fully autonomous agent with long-running tasks, planning, and internet-enabled tools. Strong focus on recursive decomposition and persistent memory.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Instability &amp; Brittleness.</strong> Early versions were notorious for getting stuck in loops or making poor planning decisions. Highlights the critical need for robust loop control, planning validation, and failure recovery—problems we must solve directly.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Cautionary Tale &amp; Inspiration.</strong> We embrace its vision of full autonomy but must engineer far greater reliability through structured planning (DAGs vs. simple lists), better termination logic, and systematic error handling.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>OpenAI Assistants API / GPTs</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Simplicity &amp; Managed Infrastructure.</strong> Provides a hosted, easy-to-use platform for creating agents with file search, code execution, and function calling. Handles much of the orchestration and context management automatically.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Vendor Lock-in &amp; Limited Control.</strong> The agent loop and memory are opaque and controlled by the provider. It&#39;s difficult to implement custom planning logic, complex tool interactions, or fine-grained monitoring. Not a framework for building <em>systems</em>.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Non-Goal.</strong> Our framework is inherently multi-provider and requires deep, customizable control over the agent&#39;s internals for research and complex applications. We are building the <em>platform</em>, not a client for one.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>CrewAI</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Multi-Agent Specialization.</strong> Explicitly models roles, goals, and backstories for collaborative agents. Good abstraction for defining workflows of specialized agents.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Higher-Level Abstraction.</strong> While good for orchestrating agent <em>crews</em>, it often builds upon other frameworks (like LangChain) for the core agent logic, potentially inheriting their complexities. Focuses more on choreography than the engine of a single agent.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Inspiration for Milestone 5.</strong> We will adopt its mental model of role-based specialization and task delegation but implement it within our own, more transparent agent core and communication protocol.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Raw LLM + Function Calling</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Maximum Control &amp; Simplicity.</strong> Directly using an LLM provider&#39;s function-calling API with a handwritten loop offers complete transparency and minimal dependencies.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Reinventing the Wheel.</strong> Requires manually implementing planning, memory, error handling, and tool orchestration for any non-trivial task. Scales poorly and is error-prone.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Foundation.</strong> This is essentially the starting point for Milestone 2 (ReAct Loop). Our framework systematizes and extends this pattern with essential production-grade features.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Build a Transparent, Modular Framework Over a Monolithic Library</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context:</strong> Learners and developers need to understand the internal mechanics of an AI agent, not just wire together opaque components. Existing libraries often hide critical logic, making debugging and customization difficult.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered:</strong><ol>\n<li><strong>Wrap an existing library (e.g., LangChain):</strong> Provide a simplified interface over a complex, battle-tested codebase.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a new, integrated monolithic framework:</strong> Create a tightly-coupled system optimized for our specific use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a modular, explicit framework:</strong> Design independent, composable components with clear interfaces and data flow.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision:</strong> <strong>Option 3: Build a modular, explicit framework.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The primary goal is <em>educational clarity</em> and <em>architectural control</em>. A modular design forces clean separation of concerns (Tools, Planning, Memory, Loop), making each component&#39;s responsibility and data model explicit. This allows learners to understand, implement, and test each piece in isolation. It also accommodates future evolution, as components can be swapped (e.g., different memory backends, planning algorithms) without breaking the entire system.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> We must design and document clear interfaces between components. There will be some initial overhead compared to using a pre-built library, but the resulting system will be more debuggable, customizable, and pedagogically valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following table summarizes the key design trade-offs we are consciously making:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Design Choice</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Our Approach</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Rationale &amp; Consequence</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Modularity</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">High - Strict separation between Tool, Planning, Memory, and Loop components.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Pro:</strong> Enables testing, understanding, and replacement in isolation. <strong>Con:</strong> Requires careful interface design and more initial &quot;glue&quot; code.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Transparency</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Data flow and state are explicit, logged, and inspectable.</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Pro:</strong> Essential for debugging and learning.

Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<p>This section defines the explicit requirements the framework must satisfy and clearly outlines what is out of scope to bound the project. Establishing these boundaries is critical for a project of this complexity—without them, scope creep and unclear expectations would inevitably derail development. We approach this by first defining what the framework <strong>must</strong> achieve (functional and non-functional goals), then explicitly stating what it <strong>will not</strong> do (non-goals). This clarity ensures that all engineering effort is focused on solving the core problem: building a robust, extensible system where an AI agent can reliably translate high-level goals into a sequence of tool-using actions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"21-functional-goals\">2.1 Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>Functional goals define the core capabilities the framework must deliver. Each goal maps directly to one of the five project milestones and addresses a specific aspect of the <strong>Semantic Gap</strong>—the disconnect between an LLM&#39;s natural language reasoning and the structured world of executable software tools. The framework succeeds when an <strong>AI Executive</strong> can autonomously navigate this gap to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> Think of functional goals as the &quot;job description&quot; for the framework. Just as you would hire an executive by evaluating their ability to plan, delegate, and adapt, we evaluate the framework by its ability to perform these cognitive functions through code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The table below enumerates the primary functional requirements, organized by the milestone they originate from and the core capability they enable.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Milestone</th>\n<th>Core Capability</th>\n<th>Functional Goal</th>\n<th>Success Criteria (How We Measure It)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>1: Tool System</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Action Execution</strong></td>\n<td>Provide a standardized, safe interface for the agent to interact with the external world.</td>\n<td>The agent can correctly invoke any registered tool with validated parameters, receive structured results, and handle execution failures gracefully.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Extensibility</strong></td>\n<td>Allow new capabilities to be added at runtime without modifying the core agent logic.</td>\n<td>A developer can write a new Python class implementing the <code>Tool</code> interface, register it, and the agent immediately recognizes and can use it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2: ReAct Loop</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Reasoned Decision-Making</strong></td>\n<td>Implement the core cognitive cycle where the agent reasons about a situation, selects an action, observes the outcome, and repeats.</td>\n<td>For a given query (e.g., &quot;What&#39;s the weather in Tokyo and translate the summary to French?&quot;), the agent produces a coherent chain of thought, tool calls, and observations leading to a correct final answer.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Structured Output Handling</strong></td>\n<td>Reliably parse the LLM&#39;s free-form text output into structured tool-calling instructions.</td>\n<td>The action parser successfully extracts <code>tool_name</code> and <code>tool_args</code> from LLM responses 95%+ of the time, with clear error fallbacks for malformed outputs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3: Planning &amp; Decomposition</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Complex Task Breakdown</strong></td>\n<td>Automatically decompose a high-level, ambiguous user goal into a concrete sequence (or graph) of executable subtasks.</td>\n<td>Given &quot;Plan a 3-day trip to Paris,&quot; the agent produces a logical DAG of subtasks like &quot;Research flights,&quot; &quot;Find hotels near attractions,&quot; and &quot;Create daily itinerary.&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Adaptive Execution</strong></td>\n<td>Execute subtasks in correct dependency order, detect failures, and re-plan when the initial approach fails.</td>\n<td>If a &quot;Book hotel&quot; subtask fails due to no availability, the agent replans to &quot;Search for alternative hotels&quot; or &quot;Adjust travel dates&quot; without human intervention.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4: Memory &amp; Context</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Context Retention</strong></td>\n<td>Maintain, retrieve, and manage conversation history and task state across multiple interaction turns.</td>\n<td>In a multi-turn dialogue, the agent remembers user preferences stated earlier (e.g., &quot;I&#39;m vegetarian&quot;) and uses them to filter restaurant recommendations in later steps.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Relevant Recall</strong></td>\n<td>Retrieve semantically relevant past experiences from long-term storage to inform current reasoning.</td>\n<td>When asked &quot;How do I debug a Python segmentation fault?&quot;, the agent retrieves and references a past conversation where the user successfully used <code>gdb</code> for C++ debugging.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5: Multi-Agent Collaboration</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Specialized Coordination</strong></td>\n<td>Enable multiple agents with different roles to work together on a single task through structured communication.</td>\n<td>A &quot;Research &amp; Write&quot; task is automatically decomposed: a <code>ResearcherAgent</code> finds sources, a <code>WriterAgent</code> drafts content, and an <code>EditorAgent</code> reviews for clarity, all coordinated by an <code>Orchestrator</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></td>\n<td>Merge or adjudicate contradictory outputs from different agents into a coherent final result.</td>\n<td>When two <code>CoderAgent</code> instances propose different implementations, the <code>Orchestrator</code> applies a defined strategy (e.g., choose the simpler one, merge features, or ask for clarification).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>These functional goals combine to create a complete <strong>AI Executive</strong> system. The agent can perceive a goal (via user query), formulate a plan (decomposition), execute the plan through a cycle of reasoning and tool use (ReAct), while drawing on both immediate context and past experience (memory), and if needed, delegate parts of the work to specialized peers (multi-agent collaboration). The ultimate functional goal is encapsulated in the primary public API method: <code>Agent.run_task(user_query: str) -&gt; str</code>, which must return a useful, actionable result for any well-formed query within the system&#39;s capability boundaries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"22-non-functional-goals\">2.2 Non-Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>Non-functional goals define the <em>quality attributes</em> of the system—how it should behave, rather than what it does. These are critical for the framework&#39;s usability, maintainability, and safety in production-like scenarios. A system that meets all functional goals but is brittle, opaque, or dangerous would fail as a foundation for building reliable AI agents.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Framework as Public Infrastructure.</strong> Think of the framework as a city&#39;s electrical grid. Functional goals ensure it delivers power (the lights turn on). Non-functional goals ensure it&#39;s reliable during storms, extensible for new neighborhoods, safe to avoid electrocution, and maintainable so engineers can fix outages quickly. All are equally vital for public trust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Quality Attribute</th>\n<th>Goal</th>\n<th>Rationale &amp; Concrete Measurement</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Extensibility</strong></td>\n<td>The framework must allow new components (tools, memory backends, planning strategies) to be added with minimal changes to existing code.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> AI capabilities evolve rapidly; the framework must not become a bottleneck. <strong>Measurement:</strong> A developer can add a new tool by creating a single Python class and registering it, without modifying any core framework files.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Safety &amp; Guardrails</strong></td>\n<td>The agent must operate within defined safety boundaries, with mechanisms to prevent harmful, unauthorized, or infinitely looping actions.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> Autonomous tool use carries inherent risk (e.g., deleting files, making unauthorized API calls). <strong>Measurement:</strong> All tool executions are wrapped with timeouts, permission checks (if configured), and a maximum iteration limit for the ReAct loop. Critical tools (e.g., file write, shell exec) require explicit opt-in.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Debuggability &amp; Observability</strong></td>\n<td>The internal state and decision-making process of the agent must be inspectable at runtime, with structured logs tracing the complete thought-action chain.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> AI agents are non-deterministic; when they fail, developers need clear visibility into <em>why</em>. <strong>Measurement:</strong> Every agent run produces a chronological log of <code>Thought</code>, <code>Action</code>, <code>Observation</code> tuples, and the state of the task DAG is queryable at any point.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Performance &amp; Latency</strong></td>\n<td>The framework should minimize overhead, allowing the agent&#39;s speed to be bounded primarily by LLM API latency and tool execution time.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> Complex tasks may require dozens of LLM calls and tool invocations; inefficient framework code would make tasks impractically slow. <strong>Measurement:</strong> Framework overhead (parsing, state management, memory retrieval) adds &lt;100ms per agent iteration. Independent subtasks can execute in parallel when dependencies allow.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>LLM Agnosticism</strong></td>\n<td>The core agent logic should be decoupled from any specific LLM provider or API, allowing easy swapping of models (GPT-4, Claude, open-source, etc.).</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> LLM landscape is competitive and evolving; lock-in is undesirable. <strong>Measurement:</strong> The LLM interface is abstracted behind a generic <code>LLMClient</code> class; switching providers requires changing only configuration, not core agent code.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Modularity &amp; Clean Boundaries</strong></td>\n<td>Components (Tool System, Memory, Planner) must have well-defined interfaces and minimal cross-dependencies, allowing them to be tested, developed, and replaced in isolation.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> Enables incremental development (per our milestones) and allows users to customize or replace components (e.g., use a different vector database). <strong>Measurement:</strong> Each component&#39;s public interface is documented and has &lt;3 direct dependencies on other framework components.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Error Resilience</strong></td>\n<td>The system must degrade gracefully when components fail (LLM unavailable, tool times out, network error) and provide clear, actionable error messages to the calling application.</td>\n<td><strong>Rationale:</strong> In a distributed, API-dependent system, failures are inevitable. <strong>Measurement:</strong> Tool failures are caught and presented as structured <code>ToolResult</code> with <code>ERROR</code> status; the agent can replan. LLM API errors trigger retries with exponential backoff. No unhandled exception should crash the entire agent process.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>These non-functional goals are not afterthoughts—they are first-class design constraints that will shape the architecture. For instance, <strong>safety</strong> drives the design of the tool execution engine with sandboxing and timeouts. <strong>Debuggability</strong> leads to the structured logging of the entire ReAct loop. <strong>Modularity</strong> justifies the clear separation between the Planner, Memory, and Tool System components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"23-explicit-non-goals\">2.3 Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Explicitly stating what the framework will <strong>not</strong> do is equally important. It sets realistic expectations, prevents scope creep, and allows the team to focus on the core value proposition. A common pitfall in ambitious projects is trying to solve every related problem, resulting in a bloated, half-finished system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle: Sharp Boundaries Foster Focus.</strong> A sculptor removes marble to reveal the statue. Similarly, we define non-goals to chisel away peripheral concerns, leaving a sharp, focused framework that excels at its primary mission: autonomous task execution via LLM-driven planning and tool use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Non-Goal</th>\n<th>Explanation &amp; Rationale</th>\n<th>What We Might Do Instead</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Train or fine-tune LLM models</strong></td>\n<td>The framework is a <em>consumer</em> of LLMs, not a model trainer. We assume a capable pre-trained LLM is available via API or local inference.</td>\n<td>We will provide interfaces for popular LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) and local inference servers (vLLM, Ollama), but the training/fine-tuning process is entirely out of scope.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) or chatbot frontend</strong></td>\n<td>The framework is a backend library/engine. It provides a programmatic API (<code>Agent.run_task()</code>). Building web UIs, Discord bots, or mobile apps is left to the application layer.</td>\n<td>We will ensure the API is clean and well-documented so that others can easily build UIs on top. Example CLI drivers may be provided for testing, but they are not the primary deliverable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Guarantee 100% safety or prevent all misuse</strong></td>\n<td>While we will implement significant guardrails (timeouts, permission checks), we cannot eliminate all risk from autonomous AI systems. Malicious users or poorly designed tools can still cause harm.</td>\n<td>We will design for &quot;safety by default&quot; (tools are opt-in, sandboxed where possible) and provide clear warnings and configuration knobs for dangerous operations. Ultimate responsibility lies with the developer integrating the framework.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Solve general artificial intelligence (AGI)</strong></td>\n<td>The framework orchestrates LLM reasoning and tool use; it does not create new cognitive capabilities. The agent&#39;s intelligence is bounded by the underlying LLM&#39;s capabilities and the tools provided.</td>\n<td>We focus on the <em>orchestration</em> problem: effectively using the capabilities that LLMs and tools already provide. Breakthroughs in LLM reasoning must come from model research, not our framework.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Replace human judgment in critical domains</strong></td>\n<td>The framework is an augmentation tool, not an autonomous decision-maker for high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis, legal advice, or financial trading without human oversight.</td>\n<td>We will include features like human-in-the-loop confirmation for specific tool calls (a future extension), but the base framework assumes the agent operates autonomously within its defined sandbox.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Handle multi-modal inputs/outputs natively (images, audio, video)</strong></td>\n<td>The initial framework is designed for text-centric tasks. While tools could be built to process images/audio, the core agent reasoning, memory, and communication are text-based.</td>\n<td>The architecture can be extended later to support multi-modal LLMs and tools, but for Milestones 1-5, we assume textual interaction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Provide built-in tools for every possible domain</strong></td>\n<td>We will include a few illustrative built-in tools (calculator, web search, safe code execution). However, we will not build hundreds of domain-specific tools (e.g., for CRM, accounting, CAD).</td>\n<td>The framework&#39;s value is in enabling <em>others</em> to build tools easily. We will focus on making the tool interface and registry exceptionally simple and powerful.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Manage infrastructure scaling (load balancing, Kubernetes)</strong></td>\n<td>The framework is a library that runs within a single process. Scaling horizontally to handle thousands of concurrent agent sessions is an application/deployment concern.</td>\n<td>We will ensure the framework is stateless where possible (persisting state via provided memory interfaces) to facilitate scaling by the embedding application.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>By declaring these non-goals, we make intentional trade-offs. We choose depth over breadth, focusing on creating the best possible <em>engine</em> for AI autonomy, not the entire <em>vehicle</em>. This allows us to invest engineering effort where it matters most: robust loops, clean abstractions, and reliable execution—the foundations upon which countless AI agent applications can be built.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3-high-level-architecture\">3. High-Level Architecture</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section presents the architectural blueprint for Project Archon—the high-level component structure, their responsibilities, and the flow of control and data between them. Before diving into the intricate details of each subsystem, we establish the mental model of how the entire framework fits together as a cohesive unit capable of transforming vague user requests into concrete, executed actions.</p>\n<p>At its core, the framework must bridge the <strong>semantic gap</strong> between the natural language reasoning of an LLM and the structured, deterministic world of software tools. It does this by constructing an <strong>AI Executive</strong>—an entity that can receive a high-level goal, formulate a plan, delegate work to specialized capabilities (tools), track progress, adapt to failures, and ultimately deliver a result. This executive is not monolithic but composed of five interacting pillars, each with a clear separation of concerns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview\">Component Overview</h3>\n<p>Think of the framework as a modern corporate office building. Each floor houses a specialized department with its own expertise and workflows, yet they all work together under shared leadership to accomplish complex projects. The blueprints for this building are captured in the system component diagram below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-system-component.svg\" alt=\"System Component Diagram\"></p>\n<p><strong>Table 3.1: The Five Pillars of the AI Executive</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Mental Model</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Data It Owns</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Agent Core</strong></td>\n<td>The CEO&#39;s Office</td>\n<td>The central coordination point and public API.

It handles role assignment, task delegation, inter-agent communication, and result aggregation.</td>\n<td>Registry of <code>Agent</code> instances with their roles, <code>Message</code> queue/bus, delegation rules.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>The Agent Core: The Conductor of the Orchestra</strong>\nThe Agent Core is the central nervous system. It exposes the primary <code>Agent.run_task(user_query: str) -&gt; str</code> method that users call. Internally, it does not perform the reasoning or tool execution itself. Instead, it acts as a conductor:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Receives the user&#39;s goal</strong> and initializes a new <code>Task</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Invokes the Planner</strong> to decompose the goal into a <code>Plan</code> (a list or DAG of <code>SubTask</code> objects).</li>\n<li><strong>For each <code>SubTask</code></strong>, it triggers the <strong>ReAct Loop Engine</strong> to execute it (think -&gt; act -&gt; observe).</li>\n<li><strong>Throughout this process</strong>, it consults the <strong>Memory System</strong> to retrieve relevant context and store new observations.</li>\n<li><strong>Manages the agent&#39;s lifecycle state</strong> (<code>AgentState</code>: IDLE, PLANNING, EXECUTING, etc.), handling errors and transitioning between phases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Tool System: The Agent&#39;s Swiss Army Knife</strong>\nTools are how the agent interacts with the external world. Each tool is a well-defined interface with a name, description, parameter schema (using JSON Schema), and an <code>execute</code> function. The Tool System&#39;s registry pattern allows capabilities to be added at runtime—imagine plugging a new attachment into a multi-tool. The system ensures safety via parameter validation, execution timeouts, and sandboxing where necessary (e.g., for code execution). Built-in tools provide foundational capabilities like web search, calculation, and file operations.</p>\n<p><strong>The Planner: The Strategic Mapmaker</strong>\nWhen a user says &quot;Research the market and write a summary report,&quot; the Planner&#39;s job is to translate this into a sequence like: 1) Web search for &quot;current market trends Q3 2024,&quot; 2) Extract key points from search results, 3) Draft report outline, 4) Write introduction, etc. It models these steps as a <strong>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</strong>, where some steps depend on the outputs of others. This allows for parallel execution of independent tasks and structured handling of failures.</p>\n<p><strong>The Memory System: Context as a Layered Cake</strong>\nAn agent without memory is amnesic—it forgets the conversation history and past learnings after each interaction. Our Memory System has three distinct layers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Episodic/Conversation Memory:</strong> A simple, in-order buffer of the dialogue (user queries, agent thoughts, tool outputs). This is the agent&#39;s &quot;short-term recall&quot; of the current session.</li>\n<li><strong>Working Memory:</strong> A scratchpad for the <em>current</em> task. It holds intermediate results, partial conclusions, and the state of the execution plan. Think of it as the whiteboard in a meeting room.</li>\n<li><strong>Long-Term Memory:</strong> A vector database that stores embeddings of past interactions, facts, and outcomes. It allows the agent to perform semantic search (&quot;What did we learn about API X last week?&quot;) and inject relevant past knowledge into new tasks, enabling learning across sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Orchestrator: The Manager of Specialists</strong>\nFor complex tasks that benefit from specialization, the framework supports multiple agents. The Orchestrator assigns roles (e.g., Researcher, Writer, Coder) and coordinates them. It receives a high-level task, decomposes it, and routes subtasks to the agent whose advertised capabilities best match the requirement. It then manages the conversation between agents, collects their outputs, and synthesizes a final result. This enables a single &quot;virtual&quot; executive to leverage a team of specialized sub-agents.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Architectural Insight:</strong> The separation between the <strong>Planner</strong> (which decides <em>what</em> to do) and the <strong>ReAct Loop Engine</strong> (which figures out <em>how</em> to do each subtask) is critical. This mirrors human problem-solving: we first make a high-level plan (&quot;Go to the store, buy ingredients, then cook&quot;), and then for each step, we engage in moment-to-moment reasoning and action (&quot;To go to the store, I need my keys, then open the door, then start the car...&quot;).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"interaction-flow\">Interaction Flow</h3>\n<p>To understand how these components interact dynamically, let&#39;s trace the lifecycle of a single user query through a <strong>single-agent</strong> scenario: <code>&quot;What was the weather in Tokyo last Tuesday, and what&#39;s the current price of Bitcoin in JPY?&quot;</code></p>\n<p><strong>Table 3.2: End-to-End Task Execution Flow</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Component Involved</th>\n<th>Action &amp; Data Transformation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>1. Initiation</strong></td>\n<td>User → Agent Core</td>\n<td>The user calls <code>agent.run_task(&quot;Weather in Tokyo last Tues &amp; BTC price in JPY&quot;)</code>. The Agent Core creates a new <code>Task</code> object, assigns it a unique ID, sets the initial <code>AgentState</code> to <code>PLANNING</code>, and stores the original query.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>2. Context Enrichment</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core → Memory System</td>\n<td>Before planning, the Agent Core asks the Memory System: &quot;Given this query, what relevant past context should we include?&quot; The Memory System queries its vector store (long-term memory) for semantically similar past tasks (e.g., previous weather or crypto queries) and returns a few relevant memory snippets.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>3. Task Decomposition</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core → Planner</td>\n<td>The Agent Core passes the enriched query and context to the Planner. The Planner uses an LLM call with a specialized prompt to break the compound question into atomic subtasks. It outputs a <code>Plan</code> containing two independent <code>SubTask</code> objects: <br>1. <code>SubTask A</code>: Description=&quot;Get historical weather for Tokyo on [last Tuesday&#39;s date]&quot;, tool=&quot;web_search&quot;. <br>2. <code>SubTask B</code>: Description=&quot;Get current Bitcoin to Japanese Yen exchange rate&quot;, tool=&quot;web_search&quot;. <br>The Planner notes no dependencies between them, allowing parallel execution.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4. Plan Execution (Loop)</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core → ReAct Loop Engine</td>\n<td>The Agent Core&#39;s state changes to <code>EXECUTING</code>. It identifies that Subtask A and B are independent and can be executed concurrently. It calls <code>_execute_subtask(subtask)</code> for each.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4a. ReAct for Subtask A</strong></td>\n<td>ReAct Loop Engine → Tool System → LLM</td>\n<td>For Subtask A, the ReAct Engine begins its cycle: <br>1. <strong>THINK:</strong> LLM is prompted with the subtask description, available tools, and context. It reasons: &quot;I need to find last Tuesday&#39;s date, then search for weather.&quot; <br>2. <strong>ACT:</strong> LLM outputs an action: <code>{&quot;tool&quot;: &quot;calendar&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: {&quot;operation&quot;: &quot;compute_date&quot;, &quot;offset&quot;: -7}}</code>. The parser validates and extracts this. <br>3. <strong>OBSERVE:</strong> Tool System executes the <code>calendar</code> tool, returns: &quot;Last Tuesday was 2024-04-09.&quot; This observation is fed back. <br>4. <strong>THINK (again):</strong> LLM reasons: &quot;Now I have the date, I can search.&quot; <br>5. <strong>ACT:</strong> Outputs: <code>{&quot;tool&quot;: &quot;web_search&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: {&quot;query&quot;: &quot;Tokyo weather April 9 2024&quot;}}</code>. <br>6. <strong>OBSERVE:</strong> Tool executes, returns a summary of weather data. The ReAct Loop detects this is a final answer for the subtask, packages it into a <code>ToolResult</code>, and returns.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>4b. Parallel Execution</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core</td>\n<td>While Subtask A is in its ReAct cycle, Subtask B begins its own, independent ReAct process, potentially using a different tool (like a financial API).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>5. Result Synthesis</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core → Memory System</td>\n<td>Both subtasks complete. The Agent Core aggregates their <code>ToolResult</code> contents. It then invokes the Memory System to store the entire interaction: the original query, the generated plan, tool calls, and final results are appended to the conversation memory and embedded into the long-term vector store for future retrieval.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>6. Final Response</strong></td>\n<td>Agent Core → User</td>\n<td>The Agent Core formats the aggregated results into a coherent natural language answer: &quot;Last Tuesday (April 9), Tokyo had sunny skies with a high of 18°C. Currently, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately 8,450,000 Japanese Yen.&quot; It updates its <code>AgentState</code> to <code>FINISHED</code> and returns the final string to the user.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle: Structured Concurrency.</strong> The Agent Core manages subtasks as concurrent units of work. Independent subtasks run in parallel (using Python&#39;s <code>asyncio</code>) to minimize latency, while dependent subtasks are sequenced according to their DAG. This makes efficient use of resources during I/O-bound operations like LLM calls and web requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The flow for a <strong>multi-agent</strong> scenario adds an extra layer of delegation. The Orchestrator acts as a meta-agent: it receives the task, performs its own decomposition, and then routes each subtask to the most suitable specialized agent (e.g., sending a research subtask to a <code>ResearcherAgent</code> and a writing subtask to a <code>WriterAgent</code>). Each of those agents then runs its own internal Agent Core flow (Plan → ReAct). The Orchestrator collects their results and synthesizes the final output.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-filemodule-structure\">Recommended File/Module Structure</h3>\n<p>A well-organized codebase is paramount for maintainability and extensibility.

Implementation details are kept internal.</li>\n<li><strong>Separate <code>llm/</code> Layer</strong>: Abstracting the LLM provider behind a common <code>LLMClient</code> interface ensures the framework is not locked into a single vendor and makes testing with mock LLMs straightforward.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated <code>tests/</code> Hierarchy</strong>: Mirroring the <code>src/</code> structure with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests supports the testing pyramid strategy outlined later in the document.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This structure provides a solid foundation that can scale as new tools, memory backends, or planning strategies are developed.

Data Model</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The data model forms the backbone of our framework—it&#39;s the DNA that defines how information flows, how state is tracked, and how components communicate. Without a well-designed data model, even the most sophisticated algorithms become brittle spaghetti code. This section defines the core types, their fields, and their relationships, providing the structural foundation for all five milestones.</p>\n<p>Think of the data model as <strong>the standardized paperwork of our AI Executive&#39;s office</strong>. Just as a well-run company uses consistent forms for purchase orders (with fields for item, quantity, vendor) and employee records (with name, role, contact info), our framework needs standardized data structures for tools, tasks, memories, and agent states. This consistency ensures that when the Planner hands off a task to the ReAct Engine, both understand exactly what &quot;task status&quot; means; when the Memory System retrieves a past conversation, it returns it in a format the Agent Core can immediately use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-types-and-enums\">Core Types and Enums</h3>\n<p>Below are the foundational data types that appear throughout the framework. Each is presented as a table showing all fields, their types, and detailed descriptions. These types are <strong>immutable by design</strong>—once created, their fields shouldn&#39;t be modified directly. Instead, we create new instances with updated values (functional updates) to maintain predictable state transitions and avoid subtle bugs from shared mutable state.</p>\n<h4 id=\"agent-state-enum\">Agent State Enum</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>AgentState</code></td>\n<td><code>Enum</code></td>\n<td>The high-level operational state of an agent instance.

When state needs to change (e.g., subtask status updates), create a new instance with the updated field. This prevents race conditions in concurrent execution and makes debugging easier—you can log the entire history of state changes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Principle 2: Optional Fields for Progressive Enhancement</strong>\nMany fields are <code>Optional</code> (like <code>SubTask.expected_output</code>, <code>MemoryEntry.embedding</code>) because they&#39;re only relevant in certain contexts or advanced configurations. This keeps the core data model simple while allowing extensibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Principle 3: String IDs for Loose Coupling</strong>\nAll relationships use string IDs (<code>SubTask.dependencies</code> lists IDs, not object references). This allows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Serialization to JSON for storage/transmission</li>\n<li>Loose coupling between components (Planner doesn&#39;t need actual SubTask objects, just their IDs)</li>\n<li>Easy debugging (IDs appear in logs)\nThe trade-off is an extra lookup step to resolve IDs to objects, but this is minimal compared to the benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Principle 4: Metadata Bags for Extensibility</strong>\nThe <code>metadata</code> fields in <code>ToolResult</code> and <code>MemoryEntry</code> follow the &quot;bag of properties&quot; pattern. Instead of adding specific fields for every possible piece of auxiliary data (which would cause constant type changes), we use a dictionary. Different components can agree on conventions for metadata keys (e.g., <code>&quot;token_usage&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;confidence_score&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;source_url&quot;</code>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-data-modeling\">Common Pitfalls in Data Modeling</h4>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mutating Shared Data Structures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Directly modifying a <code>SubTask</code> object&#39;s <code>status</code> field while multiple components hold references to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: In concurrent execution (parallel subtasks), this causes race conditions.

Hints</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Python dataclasses</strong>: Use <code>@dataclass(frozen=True)</code> for truly immutable types, but note that frozen dataclasses can&#39;t have default mutable fields like <code>List</code>. Use <code>field(default_factory=list)</code> instead of <code>default=[]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Functional updates</strong>: The <code>replace()</code> function from <code>dataclasses</code> creates a new instance with updated fields. This is cleaner than manual <code>copy()</code> and update.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Enum serialization</strong>: Python Enums serialize to their value (string) when using <code>json.dumps()</code>. For <code>ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS</code>, JSON becomes <code>&quot;success&quot;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type hints</strong>: Use <code>from typing import Optional</code> for nullable fields. Add <code>-&gt; None</code> to <code>__post_init__</code> methods for proper type checking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>ID generation</strong>: <code>uuid.uuid4().hex</code> gives a 32-character hex

1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tool System is the foundation upon which the AI Executive extends its capabilities into the external world. Just as a CEO cannot personally type every email or analyze every spreadsheet, the AI Executive cannot directly interact with databases, APIs, or calculation engines. Instead, it must delegate these actions to specialized tools. This component defines the contract, registration, and safe execution of these tools, bridging the <strong>semantic gap</strong> between the LLM&#39;s natural language reasoning and the structured world of software interfaces.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-agent39s-toolbox\">Mental Model: The Agent&#39;s Toolbox</h3>\n<p>Imagine giving a skilled but disembodied assistant a Swiss Army knife. The assistant understands language and can reason about problems, but it needs physical attachments (blades, scissors, screwdrivers) to manipulate the world. Each attachment has a specific purpose, a safe way to hold it, and clear instructions for use. The <strong>Tool System</strong> is this Swiss Army knife—a curated, well-documented, and safely accessible collection of capabilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Well-Defined Interfaces:</strong> Each tool has a precise name, a clear description of what it does, and an exact specification for its inputs (like which screwdriver head fits which screw). This eliminates ambiguity for the LLM when choosing which tool to use.</li>\n<li><strong>Safe Handling:</strong> Tools are designed with guards—input validation, timeouts, and error handling—to prevent the assistant from accidentally cutting itself (crashing the system) or applying the wrong force (corrupting data).</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Attachment:</strong> New tools can be added to the knife&#39;s handle at any time, even while the assistant is working, without needing to rebuild the entire knife. The assistant can immediately discover and use these new capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This mental model emphasizes that tools are not arbitrary code snippets but are <strong>controlled, observable, and predictable extensions</strong> of the agent&#39;s will.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interface-and-contract\">Interface and Contract</h3>\n<p>Every tool in the framework must adhere to a strict interface. This consistency enables the LLM to reason about tool usage, the registry to manage them uniformly, and the execution engine to invoke them safely.</p>\n<p>The <code>Tool</code> interface defines the following mandatory properties and method:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Property/Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>name</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>str</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">A unique, descriptive identifier for the tool (e.g., <code>&quot;web_search&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;execute_python_code&quot;</code>). Must be lowercase with underscores. This is the primary key the LLM uses to invoke the tool.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>description</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>str</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">A natural language explanation of the tool&#39;s purpose, its inputs, and the nature of its output. This is injected into the LLM&#39;s prompt and is critical for accurate tool selection. A good description answers: &quot;What does this do? When should I use it? What do I give it, and what do I get back?&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>parameters_schema</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">A <strong>JSON Schema</strong> object that rigorously defines the expected parameters. This schema is used for runtime validation before execution. It specifies required fields, data types, allowed values, and constraints (e.g., <code>&quot;maxLength&quot;</code> for strings).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>execute(self, **kwargs) -&gt; ToolResult</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Method</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The core implementation. Accepts keyword arguments validated against the <code>parameters_schema</code>. It must return a <code>ToolResult</code> object, which standardizes success/error outcomes and includes metadata for debugging. Execution must be idempotent where possible and must not have hidden side effects beyond those described.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ToolResult</code> type, as defined in the naming conventions, is the universal wrapper for all tool outputs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Field</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>content</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>str</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">The primary output of the tool, formatted as text consumable by the LLM (e.g., a search result summary, a calculation answer). For errors, this may contain a user-friendly error message.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>status</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>ToolResultStatus</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">An enum (<code>SUCCESS</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>TIMEOUT</code>) indicating the categorical outcome. This allows the agent&#39;s loop logic to handle failures differently from successes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>error_message</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Optional[str]</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">For <code>ERROR</code> or <code>TIMEOUT</code> statuses, a detailed, technical error message for logging and debugging. This is separate from the LLM-consumable <code>content</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">A <strong>bag of properties</strong> for extensible, tool-specific information (e.g., <code>{&quot;latency_ms&quot;: 120, &quot;result_count&quot;: 5}</code>). This enables observability and advanced post-processing without polluting the primary <code>content</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Factory methods (<code>ToolResult.success</code>, <code>.error</code>, <code>.timeout</code>) should be used to ensure consistent construction of these objects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tool-registry-pattern\">Tool Registry Pattern</h3>\n<p>The Tool Registry acts as the central directory and dispatcher for all available tools. It follows the <strong>Service Locator</strong> pattern, providing a single point of lookup. Its primary responsibilities are dynamic registration, discovery by name, and providing a complete list of tools for prompt construction.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Design Points:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Singleton/Global Access:</strong> The registry should be accessible throughout the agent&#39;s runtime. This is typically implemented as a class with class-level methods or a module-level global instance, though dependency injection is preferred for testability.</li>\n<li><strong>Thread-Safe Registration:</strong> Since tools can be added at runtime (e.g., by plugins), registration operations must be thread-safe to prevent race conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Immutable Tool Definitions:</strong> Once registered, a tool&#39;s interface (<code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>schema</code>) should be treated as immutable. The <code>execute</code> method&#39;s behavior is the tool author&#39;s responsibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Namespacing:</strong> Consider supporting namespaced tool names (e.g., <code>&quot;math.calculator&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;web.search&quot;</code>) to avoid collisions in large tool ecosystems, though a simple unique <code>name</code> suffices for the initial implementation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The registry&#39;s interface is simple:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Method</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Parameters</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Returns</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>register_tool</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>tool: Tool</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>None</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Adds a tool instance to the registry. Raises a <code>ValueError</code> if a tool with the same name already exists.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>get_tool</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>name: str</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>Optional[Tool]</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Retrieves a tool by its unique name. Returns <code>None</code> if not found.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>list_tools</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>None</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>List[Tool]</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Returns a list of all registered tools, typically for inclusion in the LLM&#39;s system prompt.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"execution-engine-with-safety\">Execution Engine with Safety</h3>\n<p>The Execution Engine is the critical safety layer that sits between the LLM&#39;s action choice and the actual tool code. It transforms a raw tool call request (&quot;use <code>calculator</code> with <code>expression: &#39;2+2&#39;</code>&quot;) into a safe, validated, observed, and error-handled execution. This process follows a strict pipeline:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lookup &amp; Existence Check:</strong> The engine receives a requested tool <code>name</code> and <code>arguments</code> dict. It first queries the registry. If the tool does not exist, it immediately returns a <code>ToolResult.error</code> with a message like &quot;Tool &#39;foo&#39; not found.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Schema Validation:</strong> Using the tool&#39;s <code>parameters_schema</code>, the engine validates the provided <code>arguments</code>. It checks for required fields, correct data types (e.g., ensuring a parameter expecting a number isn&#39;t given a string), and value constraints. Any validation failure results in a descriptive <code>ToolResult.error</code> (e.g., &quot;Parameter &#39;expression&#39; must be a string, got type int&quot;).</li>\n<li><strong>Safe Execution Wrapping:</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>Timeout Enforcement:</strong> The tool&#39;s <code>execute</code> method is invoked inside a timeout context (e.g., using <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> or <code>threading.Timer</code>). This prevents buggy or long-running tools from hanging the entire agent loop indefinitely. A timeout triggers a <code>ToolResult.timeout</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Exception Isolation:</strong> The call is wrapped in a try-except block. Any uncaught exception from the tool is caught, logged, and converted into a <code>ToolResult.error</code>. The <code>error_message</code> should include the exception type and traceback for debugging, while the <code>content</code> may have a simpler message for the LLM (e.g., &quot;The tool encountered an internal error.&quot;).</li>\n<li><strong>Sandboxing (Advanced):</strong> For tools that execute code (e.g., Python), the engine should spawn execution in an isolated sandbox (like a restricted subprocess or a <code>seccomp</code>-confined environment) with limits on CPU, memory, and filesystem access. This is a <strong>non-goal</strong> for Milestone 1 but is a critical consideration for production.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Result Standardization:</strong> The raw output from <code>tool.execute</code> must already be a <code>ToolResult</code>. The engine ensures this contract is upheld. It may also attach engine-level metadata to the result&#39;s <code>metadata</code> field (e.g., <code>validation_time_ms</code>, <code>execution_time_ms</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Observability Logging:</strong> The engine logs the tool call attempt, validation result, execution duration, and final outcome. This is essential for debugging agent behavior and monitoring tool performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight is that <strong>the execution engine treats all tools as potentially hostile or buggy</strong>. It assumes nothing about the tool&#39;s internal reliability and enforces safety and observability at the boundary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"adr-json-schema-for-parameter-validation\">ADR: JSON Schema for Parameter Validation</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use JSON Schema for Tool Parameter Definition and Validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The LLM outputs unstructured text that must be parsed into structured arguments for tool execution. We need a robust, declarative way to define the expected structure of these arguments and validate them before execution to prevent runtime errors and improve LLM guidance.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Unstructured Strings (Free-form)</strong>: The LLM provides arguments as a concatenated string (e.g., <code>&quot;2 + 2&quot;</code>), and the tool function parses it internally.</li>\n<li><strong>Pydantic/Type-Hinted Python Models</strong>: Define tool parameters as Pydantic <code>BaseModel</code> classes. Validation uses Python&#39;s type system and Pydantic&#39;s validators.</li>\n<li><strong>JSON Schema</strong>: Define parameters as a JSON Schema (Draft 7 or 2020-12) dictionary.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use <strong>JSON Schema</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Language Agnosticism</strong>: JSON Schema is a universal standard, not tied to Python. This aligns with our potential future TypeScript/JavaScript runtime and makes tool definitions portable.</li>\n<li><strong>Rich Validation Ecosystem</strong>: JSON Schema supports complex validations (regex patterns, number ranges, array item constraints) that are cumbersome to express purely with Python type hints.</li>\n<li><strong>LLM-Native Format</strong>: Modern LLMs are extensively trained on JSON and JSON Schema. Providing the schema directly in the prompt (as used by OpenAI&#39;s function calling) is a highly effective technique for guiding the LLM to produce correctly formatted arguments.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Separation of Concerns</strong>: The schema is a pure declaration. The validation logic (using a library like <code>jsonschema</code>) is separate from the tool&#39;s business logic, promoting cleaner code.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>:<ul>\n<li><strong>Positive</strong>: Enables high-quality validation and excellent LLM guidance. Tool definitions become declarative and portable.</li>\n<li><strong>Negative</strong>: Adds a dependency on a JSON Schema validation library. Schema definitions are slightly more verbose than Python dataclasses. Developers must learn JSON Schema syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Option</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Pros</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Cons</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Unstructured Strings</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Simple to implement; mirrors some early agent frameworks.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Extremely brittle; shifts parsing burden to each tool; no validation before execution; poor LLM guidance.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">❌</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Pydantic Models</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Leverages Python&#39;s strong typing; excellent IDE support; validation logic can be embedded in model methods.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Ties the framework to Python; schema extraction for LLM prompts requires extra work; less rich constraint language than JSON Schema.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">❌</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>JSON Schema</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Universal standard; rich validation; excellent LLM compatibility; declarative and separate from logic.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Slightly more verbose; requires a validation library dependency.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">✅</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-and-mitigations\">Common Pitfalls and Mitigations</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Vague or Incomplete Tool Descriptions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Writing a <code>description</code> like &quot;Searches the web&quot; provides insufficient context for the LLM. When should it use this versus a &quot;query_database&quot; tool? What format does the query take? What kind of results are returned?</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong</strong>: The LLM will guess incorrectly, leading to wasted iterations and failed tasks. The description is the primary documentation for the LLM.</li>\n<li><strong>How to Fix</strong>: Write descriptions as if instructing a new employee. Example: &quot;<code>web_search</code>: Performs a general internet search using the DuckDuckGo API. Use this to find current information, general knowledge, or news. Input: a <code>query</code> string (required). Output: A list of up to 5 search results, each with a <code>title</code>, <code>snippet</code>, and <code>url</code>. Does not access specific databases or internal documents.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing or Weak Parameter Validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Relying on the tool&#39;s internal code to validate inputs, or defining a schema that&#39;s too permissive (e.g., <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;</code> for an expression that should be a mathematical formula).</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong</strong>: Allows malformed data to reach the tool, causing cryptic runtime exceptions (e.g., <code>KeyError</code>, <code>TypeError</code>). These are harder for the agent to recover from than a clear validation error.</li>\n<li><strong>How to Fix</strong>: Use JSON Schema&#39;s full power. Define <code>required</code> fields, specific <code>types</code>, <code>pattern</code> regex for strings, <code>minimum</code>/<code>maximum</code> for numbers, and <code>enum</code> for allowed values. The validation error message should be specific enough for the LLM to correct its input.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Tool Execution Without Timeout</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Calling <code>tool.execute()</code> directly without any timeout guard.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong</strong>: A network call that hangs, or a tool with an infinite loop, will freeze the entire agent loop indefinitely. The system becomes unresponsive.</li>\n<li><strong>How to Fix</strong>: <strong>Always</strong> wrap tool execution in a timeout mechanism. Use <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> for async tools or <code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code> with a timeout for synchronous ones. The timeout should be configurable per-tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Sensitive Tools Without Permission Checks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Providing tools like <code>execute_shell_command</code> or <code>delete_database_record</code> without any authorization layer, allowing the LLM to invoke them based purely on its reasoning.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong</strong>: Creates massive security vulnerabilities. The LLM&#39;s goal is to satisfy the user&#39;s query, which could inadvertently or maliciously lead to destructive actions.</li>\n<li><strong>How to Fix</strong>: Implement a permission system. Tools can have required permission flags (e.g., <code>&quot;requires_permission&quot;: [&quot;fs_write&quot;, &quot;shell_exec&quot;]</code>). The agent&#39;s runtime context should include the user&#39;s or session&#39;s permissions. The execution engine checks permissions after validation but before execution, rejecting unauthorized calls with a clear error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

Language-Specific Hints:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use <code>asyncio</code> for Concurrency:</strong> The framework is async-first. All tool <code>execute</code> methods should be <code>async def</code>. Use <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> for timeouts.</li>\n<li><strong>JSON Schema Validation with <code>jsonschema</code>:</strong> Install via <code>pip install jsonschema</code>. Use <code>jsonschema.validate()</code> in the <code>validate_args</code> helper.

While the Tool System (Milestone 1) provides the <em>capabilities</em> and the Planner (Milestone 3) provides the <em>strategy</em>, the ReAct Loop is the <em>tactical executor</em> that navigates the immediate terrain of a single subtask, making micro-decisions to overcome obstacles in real time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-ooda-loop\">Mental Model: The OODA Loop</h3>\n<p>Think of the ReAct Loop not as a simple script, but as the agent&#39;s <strong>OODA Loop</strong>—the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycle used by fighter pilots for rapid, adaptive decision-making under pressure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Observe</strong>: The agent receives the current state of the world—the user&#39;s query, the results of previous tool executions, and any relevant context from memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Orient</strong>: The agent <em>thinks</em>—it processes this information using the LLM to understand the situation, assess options, and form a hypothesis about what action to take next.</li>\n<li><strong>Decide</strong>: The agent selects a specific tool and formulates the exact parameters needed to execute it.</li>\n<li><strong>Act</strong>: The agent executes the chosen tool and observes the result, which feeds back into the next Observation phase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This cyclical process allows the agent to adapt to unexpected outcomes. If a tool fails, the next cycle re-orients and decides on a corrective action. If new information emerges, the agent can change course. The loop continues until the subtask is complete or a termination condition is met. This mental model emphasizes <strong>adaptability</strong> and <strong>continuous feedback</strong>—the agent isn&#39;t following a rigid script but piloting toward a goal, constantly adjusting based on what it observes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"loop-controller-interface\">Loop Controller Interface</h3>\n<p>The ReAct Loop is encapsulated within a <code>ReActAgent</code> class that serves as the controller for a single subtask execution. Its primary interface is the <code>_execute_subtask</code> method, which implements the full Thought-Action-Observation cycle until completion. This method is called by the higher-level Planner (Milestone 3) for each <code>SubTask</code> in the plan.</p>\n<p>The controller&#39;s interface is defined in the following table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>_execute_subtask</code></td>\n<td><code>subtask: SubTask</code></td>\n<td><code>ToolResult</code></td>\n<td><strong>Primary entry point.</strong> Executes a single subtask by running the ReAct loop until the subtask&#39;s goal is satisfied, a final answer is produced, or a loop limit is reached.

Below is the detailed, step-by-step procedure explained in prose. This algorithm assumes a subtask has been provided by the Planner, and the agent&#39;s goal is to produce a <code>ToolResult</code> containing either the final answer or an error.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Initialization</strong>: The agent receives a <code>SubTask</code> object. It extracts the <code>description</code> and <code>expected_output</code> as the goal. It initializes an empty <code>conversation_history</code> list to store the sequence of thoughts, actions, and observations. It sets an <code>iteration_counter</code> to 0 and defines a <code>max_iterations</code> (e.g., 10) to prevent infinite loops.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Context Preparation</strong>: The agent retrieves any relevant context from the Memory System (Milestone 4)—both short-term conversation history from previous subtasks and relevant long-term memories retrieved via semantic search based on the subtask description. This context is formatted and included in the initial prompt.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cycle Start (Think)</strong>: The agent enters the <code>THINKING</code> state. It constructs a prompt using <code>_format_react_prompt</code>, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The subtask goal and any <code>expected_output</code> criteria.</li>\n<li>The current conversation history (initially empty).</li>\n<li>A list of available tools from the <code>ToolRegistry</code>, each with its <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>parameters_schema</code>.</li>\n<li>Explicit formatting instructions: the LLM must output its reasoning in a &quot;Thought:&quot; section, then either an &quot;Action:&quot; section (with JSON) or a &quot;Final Answer:&quot; section.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>LLM Reasoning</strong>: The prompt is sent to the LLM via the configured provider (e.g., OpenAI API). The agent waits for the response and increments the <code>iteration_counter</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Output Parsing</strong>: The agent parses the LLM&#39;s response using <code>_parse_llm_output</code>. This function looks for three possible patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action Pattern</strong>: Extracts a tool name and a JSON dictionary of arguments from the &quot;Action:&quot; section.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Answer Pattern</strong>: Detects a &quot;Final Answer:&quot; section and extracts the content.</li>\n<li><strong>Malformed Output</strong>: If neither pattern is found, it&#39;s a parsing error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Action Execution</strong>: If an action was parsed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The agent transitions to the <code>ACTING</code> state.</li>\n<li>It validates that the tool name exists in the <code>ToolRegistry</code> via <code>ToolRegistry.get_tool()</code>.</li>\n<li>It calls <code>ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call(tool_name, arguments, timeout_seconds)</code> to safely run the tool with schema validation, timeout, and error handling.</li>\n<li>The engine returns a <code>ToolResult</code> object with <code>status</code>, <code>content</code>, and any <code>error_message</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Observation Formatting</strong>: The agent transitions to the <code>OBSERVING</code> state. It formats the <code>ToolResult</code> into a textual observation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>status</code> is <code>SUCCESS</code>: &quot;Observation: [tool result content]&quot;</li>\n<li>If <code>status</code> is <code>ERROR</code> or <code>TIMEOUT</code>: &quot;Observation: Error: [error message]&quot;\nThis observation is appended to the <code>conversation_history</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Loop Continuation Check</strong>: The agent checks termination conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Final Answer Detected</strong>: If step 5 found a &quot;Final Answer:&quot;, the loop breaks, and the answer content is packaged into a <code>ToolResult.success()</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Iteration Limit Reached</strong>: If <code>iteration_counter &gt;= max_iterations</code>, the loop breaks with a <code>ToolResult.error()</code> indicating timeout.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtask Goal Satisfied</strong>: Optionally, the agent can evaluate if the <code>expected_output</code> criteria have been met based on observations (simple string matching or LLM evaluation). If satisfied, break with success.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, return to step 3 for the next cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Result Packaging</strong>: Once the loop terminates, the agent packages the final output or error into a <code>ToolResult</code> and returns it to the Planner. The entire <code>conversation_history</code> is also attached as metadata for debugging.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This algorithm creates a self-contained execution unit for a single subtask. The sequence of interactions between components during this loop is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-react-sequence.svg\" alt=\"ReAct Loop Sequence Diagram\"></p>\n<p><strong>Example Walkthrough</strong>: Consider a subtask with description &quot;Find the current population of Tokyo.&quot; The agent initializes, then in cycle 1 thinks: &quot;I need to search for Tokyo&#39;s population. I can use the web_search tool.&quot; It outputs an Action to call <code>web_search</code> with query &quot;Tokyo current population 2024&quot;. The tool returns a search result snippet. The observation is formatted and added to history. Cycle 2 thinks: &quot;The search result says Tokyo&#39;s population is about 37 million. I should present this as the final answer.&quot; It outputs a Final Answer. The loop terminates with success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"action-parsing-strategies\">Action Parsing Strategies</h3>\n<p>A critical technical challenge is reliably extracting structured tool calls from the LLM&#39;s free-form text. The LLM is instructed to output an &quot;Action:&quot; block with JSON, but it may hallucinate formats, omit brackets, or produce malformed JSON. The parsing strategy must be robust to these variations while rejecting invalid input.</p>\n<p>We evaluate three primary strategies:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strategy</th>\n<th>How It Works</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Regular Expression (Regex) Extraction</strong></td>\n<td>Use regex patterns to find text between <code>Action:</code> and newlines, then extract a JSON-like structure. Can be lenient with whitespace and minor syntax errors.</td>\n<td>Simple to implement, fast, no external dependencies. Can handle some LLM formatting quirks.</td>\n<td>Fragile to complex JSON nesting. Difficult to maintain as patterns multiply. May incorrectly parse nested quotes or brackets.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Function-Calling API</strong></td>\n<td>Use the LLM provider&#39;s native function-calling feature (e.g., OpenAI&#39;s <code>tools</code> parameter). The LLM returns a structured JSON object in a separate field.</td>\n<td>Highly reliable, native support from major providers. Guaranteed valid JSON. Offloads parsing complexity to the provider.</td>\n<td>Vendor lock-in. Not all LLM providers support it. Less transparent (harder to debug the raw prompt).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>JSON-in-Text Parsing with Fallback</strong></td>\n<td>Use a dedicated parser (like <code>jtoken</code> or <code>json5</code>) that scans the text for the first valid JSON object after &quot;Action:&quot;. If that fails, use a regex fallback to extract a likely JSON string and attempt repair.</td>\n<td>Balances robustness and independence. Can handle many edge cases. Works with any LLM provider.</td>\n<td>More complex implementation. Repair logic can introduce its own bugs. Slower than regex.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: JSON-in-Text Parsing with Fallback</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need a parsing strategy that works reliably across different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) while handling the common formatting mistakes LLMs make. The parser must be part of our open framework, not dependent on proprietary APIs.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Regex extraction, 2) Function-calling API, 3) JSON-in-text parsing with fallback.</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement <strong>JSON-in-text parsing with a lenient fallback</strong> as the primary strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach provides the best balance of independence, robustness, and debuggability. Using a library like <code>jtoken</code> allows us to find and parse JSON even if it&#39;s embedded in markdown or has trailing commas. The fallback to regex and JSON repair (e.g., using <code>json5</code> or simple string patching) handles cases where the LLM outputs malformed JSON. This keeps the framework provider-agnostic while still being tolerant of LLM errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: We must implement and maintain a moderately complex parser. However, this complexity is isolated to a single module, and the increased robustness will reduce learner frustration when their agent gets stuck due to parsing failures. The parser will also provide detailed error messages to aid debugging.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Parsing Process Details</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The raw LLM response is searched for the string &quot;Action:&quot; (case-insensitive).</li>\n<li>The substring after &quot;Action:&quot; up to the next &quot;Thought:&quot; or &quot;Final Answer:&quot; (or end of text) is extracted as the <code>action_text</code>.</li>\n<li>A JSON tokenizer scans <code>action_text</code> to find the first complete JSON object (starting with <code>{</code> and ending with matching <code>}</code>).</li>\n<li>If found, parse it with the standard <code>json</code> module.</li>\n<li>If not found, apply a fallback: use regex to find text between curly braces, then attempt to repair common issues (add missing quotes, fix trailing commas) using a simple heuristic or <code>json5</code> library.</li>\n<li>Validate that the parsed object contains <code>&quot;tool&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;arguments&quot;</code> keys.</li>\n<li>If all fails, raise a <code>ParsingError</code> with the problematic text, which the loop will treat as an observation error, feeding back to the LLM for correction.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"adr-loop-termination-strategy\">ADR: Loop Termination Strategy</h3>\n<p>Knowing when to stop the loop is non-trivial. The agent might keep taking actions indefinitely, or it might declare victory prematurely. We need a robust termination strategy that balances autonomy with safety.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hybrid Termination Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The ReAct loop must eventually stop—either because the task is complete or because it&#39;s stuck. We need deterministic guarantees against infinite loops while allowing the agent to finish naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Fixed Iteration Limit</strong>: Stop after N cycles (e.g., 10) regardless of progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Explicit Final Answer Token</strong>: Only stop when the LLM outputs a special &quot;Final Answer:&quot; section.</li>\n<li><strong>External Monitor with Goal Checking</strong>: Use a separate LLM call or rule-based evaluator each cycle to assess if the subtask goal has been satisfied.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement a <strong>hybrid strategy combining a fixed iteration limit with explicit final answer detection, augmented by optional goal satisfaction checking</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: A fixed iteration limit is essential as a safety net—it guarantees termination even if the agent is stuck in a loop. The explicit final answer token gives the agent control to finish early when it believes it has the answer. The optional goal checker (configurable) adds an extra layer of validation, ensuring the agent&#39;s final answer actually addresses the subtask&#39;s <code>expected_output</code>. This three-layer approach provides both safety and flexibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: This increases implementation complexity slightly, as we need to manage multiple termination conditions. However, each condition is simple to implement, and together they create a robust stopping mechanism. The iteration limit should be configurable per subtask, as complex tasks may require more steps.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Termination Condition Comparison:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Trigger</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Implementation Priority</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Iteration Limit</strong></td>\n<td><code>iteration_counter &gt;= max_iterations</code></td>\n<td>Guarantees termination, simple to implement.</td>\n<td>May cut off productive loops prematurely.</td>\n<td><strong>Required</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Explicit Final Answer</strong></td>\n<td>LLM output contains &quot;Final Answer:&quot; section.</td>\n<td>Agent-controlled, natural, follows ReAct paper.</td>\n<td>Agent may output final answer incorrectly or prematurely.</td>\n<td><strong>Required</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Goal Satisfaction Check</strong></td>\n<td><code>expected_output</code> is met (string match or LLM evaluation).</td>\n<td>Ensures objective completion, catches hallucinated final answers.</td>\n<td>Adds latency (if using LLM) or complexity (rule-based).</td>\n<td><strong>Optional</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The recommended default is to use iteration limit (configurable, default 10) + explicit final answer detection. The goal satisfaction check can be enabled for subtasks where <code>expected_output</code> is specified and precise verification is needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-and-mitigations\">Common Pitfalls and Mitigations</h3>\n<p>Implementing a ReAct loop seems straightforward, but several subtle traps can cause the agent to fail in frustrating ways. Below are the most common pitfalls, why they occur, and how to avoid them.</p>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 1: Infinite Loops with No Progress</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The agent repeatedly takes the same action or cycles through a set of actions without getting closer to the goal. Example: searching for the same query over and over.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Consumes API credits and time, never produces a result.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement <strong>progress tracking</strong>. Maintain a set of (tool, arguments) pairs from previous cycles. If the same action is about to be repeated, inject a warning observation: &quot;You already tried this action with the same arguments. Consider a different approach.&quot; Also, enforce the iteration limit strictly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 2: Hallucinated Tools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The LLM invokes a tool that doesn&#39;t exist in the registry (e.g., <code>send_email</code> when only <code>web_search</code> is available).</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The parser may extract the tool name, but execution will fail because the tool is missing, breaking the loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: <strong>Validate tool existence immediately after parsing</strong>. Before calling <code>ToolExecutionEngine</code>, check <code>ToolRegistry.get_tool(tool_name)</code>. If missing, format an observation: &quot;Tool <code>{tool_name}</code> is not available. Available tools are: [list]. Please choose from these.&quot; This turns the error into a learning opportunity for the agent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 3: Parsing Failures on Valid LLM Output</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The LLM outputs a correctly formatted action, but the parser fails to extract it due to subtle formatting differences (extra spaces, line breaks, markdown code blocks).</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The agent stalls because it cannot proceed, even though the LLM did its job correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Use the <strong>robust JSON-in-text parsing with fallback</strong> described above. Additionally, log the raw LLM response and the parsing error for debugging. Consider adding a &quot;graceful degradation&quot; where if parsing fails, you ask the LLM to reformat: &quot;Could not parse your action. Please output Action: as valid JSON only.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 4: Context Window Mismanagement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The <code>conversation_history</code> grows with each cycle, eventually exceeding the LLM&#39;s token limit, causing truncation or API errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Critical early context (the original goal, key observations) gets truncated, leading to incoherent behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement <strong>context window management</strong> (detailed in Milestone 4). For the ReAct loop specifically, you can:<ul>\n<li>Keep only the last K thought-action-observation triples.</li>\n<li>Summarize older triples into a concise summary using an LLM.</li>\n<li>Include the original subtask description in every prompt, not just the first.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 5: No Error Feedback for Tool Failures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: When a tool returns a <code>ToolResult</code> with <code>status=ERROR</code>, the agent simply passes the raw error (e.g., &quot;HTTP 500&quot;) to the LLM without context.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The LLM may not understand how to recover from technical errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: <strong>Enrich error observations</strong>. Format tool errors with suggestions: &quot;Observation: The web_search tool failed with error &#39;Connection timeout&#39;. This might be a temporary network issue. You could retry the same action or try a different search query.&quot; This guides the LLM toward appropriate recovery actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚡ <strong>Pitfall 6: Missing Timeout on LLM Calls</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The LLM API call hangs indefinitely due to network issues or provider slowness, freezing the entire agent.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The agent becomes unresponsive, requiring manual restart.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Wrap the LLM API call in a <strong>timeout</strong>. Use <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> or a thread with a timeout. If the call times out, treat it as a tool-like error and format an observation: &quot;The LLM is not responding. Please retry your last thought.&quot; Also, consider implementing a retry with exponential backoff for transient failures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides concrete code and structure to implement the ReAct Loop Engine.

For now, keep the ReAct loop sequential.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeout Handling</strong>: Always wrap LLM calls and tool executions in <code>asyncio.wait_for</code>. Catch <code>asyncio.TimeoutError</code> and convert to a <code>ToolResult.timeout</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Immutable Updates</strong>: Since <code>ReActLoopContext</code> is a dataclass, use <code>dataclasses.replace(context, iteration=context.iteration + 1)</code> for functional updates. This makes debugging easier.</li>\n<li><strong>Logging</strong>: Use structured logging (Python&#39;s <code>logging</code> module with JSON formatter) to log each cycle&#39;s state, action, and observation.

While the ReAct Loop excels at tactical execution of single steps, it lacks the ability to look ahead, anticipate dependencies, and optimize the order of operations for complex, multi-faceted goals. This component gives the agent the ability to <strong>break down ambitious objectives into manageable steps, sequence them intelligently, and adapt when reality diverges from the plan</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-project-manager-and-gantt-chart\">Mental Model: Project Manager and Gantt Chart</h3>\n<p>Imagine you&#39;re a project manager handed a complex objective: &quot;Redesign the company website.&quot; You wouldn&#39;t start coding immediately. Instead, you&#39;d create a <strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong>, listing all required activities: &quot;conduct user research,&quot; &quot;create wireframes,&quot; &quot;develop frontend,&quot; &quot;write content,&quot; &quot;perform QA testing.&quot; Crucially, you&#39;d identify <strong>dependencies</strong>: wireframes must come before development, and QA can&#39;t start until development is complete. You&#39;d then sequence these tasks into a <strong>Gantt chart</strong>—a visual timeline showing what runs in sequence and what can run in parallel.</p>\n<p>The Planning component embodies this project manager. The <strong>Planner</strong> is responsible for creating the WBS (decomposing the goal into <code>SubTask</code> objects). The <strong>Executor</strong> is responsible for walking the Gantt chart (the Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG) in the correct order, dispatching each subtask to the ReAct engine, and tracking progress. When a task fails (e.g., a tool is unavailable), the manager must <strong>replan</strong>—adjusting the remaining work based on new information.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-planning-dag.svg\" alt=\"Task Planning DAG Example\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"planner-and-executor-interface\">Planner and Executor Interface</h3>\n<p>The planning subsystem is composed of two primary interfaces: the <code>Planner</code> (which creates the plan) and the <code>Executor</code> (which runs it).

It creates a new <code>Task</code> object, storing the <code>original_query</code> and setting the <code>goal</code> field (which may be a cleaned-up version of the query). An initial <code>context</code> dictionary is populated with any relevant information from the user&#39;s session or retrieved memories.</li>\n<li><strong>LLM Prompting for Decomposition:</strong> The <code>Planner</code> formats a prompt for the LLM containing: the <code>goal</code>, a list of available tools (names and descriptions), and instructions for decomposition. The instructions mandate the output to be a list of subtasks, each with an <code>id</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>expected_output</code>, optional <code>tool_name</code> and <code>tool_args</code>, and a list of <code>dependencies</code> by <code>id</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Structured Output Parsing:</strong> The LLM&#39;s response is parsed (e.g., extracting a JSON list). Each parsed object is validated and used to instantiate a <code>SubTask</code> with status <code>PENDING</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Graph Construction:</strong> The <code>Planner</code> builds the <code>subtask_dag</code> adjacency list by inverting the <code>dependencies</code> lists from each <code>SubTask</code>. It then performs a <strong>cycle detection</strong> algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search) to ensure the graph is acyclic. If a cycle is found, the planner attempts to break it by removing the minimal number of dependencies or requests a re-decomposition from the LLM.</li>\n<li><strong>Topological Sort:</strong> The planner runs a topological sort (Kahn&#39;s algorithm) on the DAG to produce the <code>execution_order</code> list. This order is stored within a <code>Plan</code> object linked to the <code>Task</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"stage-2-plan-execution\">Stage 2: Plan Execution</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Executor Initialization:</strong> The <code>Executor</code> receives the <code>Task</code> and its associated <code>Plan</code>. It sets the overall <code>AgentState</code> to <code>EXECUTING</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Iterative Subtask Processing:</strong> The executor iterates through the <code>execution_order</code>. For each subtask ID:\na. <strong>Readiness Check:</strong> It retrieves the <code>SubTask</code> and calls <code>SubTask.is_ready()</code>, which checks if all tasks in its <code>dependencies</code> list have status <code>COMPLETED</code>. If not, the subtask&#39;s status is set to <code>BLOCKED</code>, and the executor skips to the next available task.\nb. <strong>Status Transition:</strong> The ready subtask&#39;s status is updated to <code>EXECUTING</code> via a <strong>functional update</strong> (<code>Task.update_subtask(subtask.with_status(EXECUTING))</code>).\nc. <strong>Context Preparation:</strong> The executor prepares an execution context by merging the <code>Task.context</code> (shared state) with the subtask&#39;s specific <code>tool_args</code>.\nd. <strong>ReAct Loop Invocation:</strong> The executor calls <code>Agent._execute_subtask(subtask)</code>, which runs the full ReAct loop using the subtask&#39;s <code>description</code> as the query and the prepared context.\ne. <strong>Result Capture:</strong> The returned <code>ToolResult</code> is attached to the subtask via another functional update (<code>subtask.with_result(result)</code>). The subtask status is set to <code>COMPLETED</code> (if <code>result.status</code> is <code>SUCCESS</code>) or <code>FAILED</code>.\nf. <strong>Context Update:</strong> If the subtask succeeded, any outputs or new facts are written back into the <code>Task.context</code> dictionary so subsequent subtasks can access them.</li>\n<li><strong>Parallel Execution (Optional):</strong> The executor can identify independent subtasks (those with no dependencies on each other) and dispatch them to separate worker threads or asynchronous tasks, joining their results before proceeding to dependent tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Completion Detection:</strong> After all subtasks in the <code>execution_order</code> have been processed (reaching <code>COMPLETED</code> or <code>FAILED</code>), the executor evaluates the overall <code>Task</code>. If all subtasks are <code>COMPLETED</code>, it aggregates the final results from the <code>Task.context</code> or the last subtask, sets <code>AgentState</code> to <code>FINISHED</code>, and returns a final <code>ToolResult.success()</code>. If any subtask <code>FAILED</code> and cannot be recovered, it transitions to <code>ERROR</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"dag-representation-and-execution\">DAG Representation and Execution</h3>\n<p>The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is the mathematical model for our task dependencies. It ensures tasks are executed in a logical, deadlock-free order.</p>\n<p><strong>Representation:</strong> We use an <strong>adjacency list</strong> stored in the <code>Plan.subtask_dag: Dict[str, List[str]]</code>. The convention <code>{A: [B, C]}</code> means &quot;B and C depend on A&quot; (A must complete before B and C). This is efficient for querying dependents.</p>\n<p><strong>Traversal - Topological Sort (Kahn&#39;s Algorithm):</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compute the in-degree (number of dependencies) for each node.</li>\n<li>Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0 (no dependencies).</li>\n<li>While the queue is not empty:\na. Dequeue a node <code>n</code>, add it to the <code>execution_order</code>.\nb. For each dependent <code>m</code> in <code>subtask_dag[n]</code>, decrement its in-degree.\nc. If <code>m</code>&#39;s in-degree becomes 0, enqueue <code>m</code>.</li>\n<li>If the <code>execution_order</code> contains all nodes, the sort succeeded. If some nodes remain, a cycle exists.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Execution with State Management:</strong> During execution, the <code>Executor</code> must respect the topological order but also dynamically manage state. A subtask can only run if its status is <code>PENDING</code> <em>and</em> all its dependencies are <code>COMPLETED</code>. The <code>SubTask.is_ready()</code> method encapsulates this check. The executor maintains a work queue of ready tasks, which can be processed by a pool of workers for parallelism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Parallel execution must handle shared access to the <code>Task.context</code> dictionary. A thread-safe structure (like <code>asyncio.Lock</code> or <code>threading.Lock</code>) or immutable updates (functional updates that create a new context dict) are required to prevent race conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"adr-replanning-trigger-strategy\">ADR: Replanning Trigger Strategy</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Replan on Critical Failure with Adaptive Thresholds</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context:</strong> During plan execution, subtasks can fail for various reasons: tool errors, unexpected outputs, or changing external conditions. The agent must decide when to abandon the current plan and create a new one versus retrying the failed step or proceeding with a degraded plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered:</strong><ol>\n<li><strong>Replan on Every Failure:</strong> Trigger a full re-decomposition whenever any subtask fails.</li>\n<li><strong>Threshold-Based Replanning:</strong> Replan only after N consecutive failures, or if a failure occurs in a &quot;critical path&quot; subtask.</li>\n<li><strong>Confidence-Guided Replanning:</strong> Use the LLM to assess the severity of the failure and decide whether to replan, retry, or adjust the goal.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Implement <strong>Threshold-Based Replanning</strong> with the ability to mark subtasks as &quot;critical.&quot; The default is to replan after 3 failures of the same subtask, or immediately upon the failure of any subtask explicitly marked as critical during planning.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Replanning on every failure is inefficient and can lead to oscillation. Confidence-guided replanning adds significant LLM latency and complexity for marginal gain. A threshold-based approach is simple, predictable, and allows for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts) to be retried without discarding a potentially sound plan. Marking critical path tasks (those with many dependents) allows the system to recognize when a failure jeopardizes the entire plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> The executor must track failure counts per subtask. The planner must optionally annotate critical subtasks (e.g., based on graph centrality). This approach may sometimes continue executing a doomed plan (Type II error) but avoids wasteful replanning (Type I error).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Option</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Pros</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Cons</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Replan on Every Failure</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Maximally adaptive, quickly abandons flawed plans.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Highly unstable, wastes cycles on transient errors, can lead to infinite replanning loops.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">❌</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Threshold-Based</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Stable, predictable, efficient.

This makes topological sort impossible and deadlocks execution.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong:</strong> The executor will enter an infinite loop waiting for a task that can never become ready, or the sorting algorithm will fail.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> <strong>Always run cycle detection</strong> after graph construction. If a cycle is found, feed the error back to the LLM with a request to break the cycle, or implement a heuristic to remove the dependency with the weakest semantic link (e.g., the one not mentioning a shared resource).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-Decomposition (Nano-Tasks)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> The LLM breaks a simple goal into an excessive number of tiny subtasks (e.g., &quot;Move mouse to icon,&quot; &quot;Click mouse,&quot; &quot;Wait for dialog,&quot; &quot;Read dialog text&quot; for &quot;Open the settings menu&quot;). This creates overhead, consumes context window, and increases the chance of error propagation.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong:</strong> Slows execution, increases token costs, and can make the plan brittle and hard for the LLM to reason about coherently.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> In the planner&#39;s prompt, specify <strong>granularity guidelines</strong> (e.g., &quot;Each subtask should correspond to a single, meaningful tool call or a coherent unit of thought&quot;). Implement a post-processing step to merge overly simplistic sequential subtasks that use the same tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Context Loss Between Subtasks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> Subtask B needs information produced by Subtask A, but the executor fails to pass the result of A into B&#39;s execution context. The LLM running B is missing critical information.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong:</strong> The agent appears to &quot;forget&quot; what it just did, leading to incorrect actions or repeated work.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Design a <strong>structured context passing mechanism</strong>. The <code>Task.context</code> dictionary is the shared blackboard. The <code>Executor</code> must explicitly extract key results from a completed subtask&#39;s <code>ToolResult</code> (or its <code>metadata</code>) and write them into <code>context</code> under agreed-upon keys (e.g., <code>context[&quot;research_findings&quot;]</code>). Subsequent subtasks&#39; <code>tool_args</code> should be able to reference these keys via a template syntax (e.g., <code>{&quot;query&quot;: &quot;{research_findings}&quot;}</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Replanning Loops</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> The agent enters a cycle: Plan fails → Replan → New plan fails in a similar way → Replan again, ad infinitum. Common when the root cause is an unreachable goal or a missing tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s Wrong:</strong> Consumes resources without making progress. Frustrating for users.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Implement a <strong>global replanning limit</strong> (e.g., maximum of 3 replans per original task). When the limit is hit, transition to a graceful failure state, inform the user, and suggest a simplified goal. Log the sequence of failed plans for analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-agent-state-machine.svg\" alt=\"Agent Core State Machine\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

While the ReAct loop handles immediate reasoning and the Planner builds the roadmap, the Memory system ensures the agent learns from past experiences, retains crucial context across long conversations, and efficiently manages the finite &quot;attention&quot; budget of the LLM&#39;s context window. Without sophisticated memory, an agent is amnesic—unable to build upon prior work or maintain coherent state across complex, multi-step tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-agent39s-notebook-and-filing-cabinet\">Mental Model: The Agent&#39;s Notebook and Filing Cabinet</h3>\n<p>Imagine the AI Executive as a seasoned project manager in a physical office. Their memory system operates on three distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Episodic/Conversation Memory (The Open Notebook):</strong> This is the agent&#39;s immediate working space—a notebook open on the desk. It contains the <em>verbatim transcript</em> of the current conversation: every user query, every thought, every tool result, in chronological order. It&#39;s perfect for short-term recall but grows unwieldy for long sessions. Like a notebook, you can flip back to recent pages quickly, but finding a specific fact from hours ago requires a different system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Working Memory (The Whiteboard):</strong> This is the dynamic, erasable space where the <em>current task&#39;s intermediate state</em> lives. It holds the agent&#39;s current goals, partial results, and contextual variables (e.g., &quot;user&#39;s name is Alice&quot;, &quot;we are analyzing Q3 financial data&quot;). It&#39;s like a whiteboard where the manager jots down the current plan, key numbers, and temporary notes. This memory is highly contextual and typically cleared or updated when a task completes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Long-Term Memory (The Indexed Filing Cabinet):</strong> This is the agent&#39;s institutional knowledge—a vast, organized archive. Past conversations, learned facts, and important outcomes are stored here. Unlike the notebook, you can&#39;t scan every document. Instead, you use an <strong>index</strong> (a vector embedding) to retrieve only the most <em>semantically relevant</em> memories when starting a new, related task. It&#39;s like having a filing cabinet where you can ask, &quot;Find me everything related to &#39;market analysis in Europe,&#39;&quot; and getting the top 5 relevant reports, regardless of when they were filed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This three-layer model balances immediacy, relevance, and persistence, allowing the agent to operate effectively across time scales. <img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-memory-layers.svg\" alt=\"Multi-Layer Memory Architecture\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-system-interfaces\">Memory System Interfaces</h3>\n<p>The memory system is composed of three primary interfaces, each corresponding to one layer of the mental model. They are designed to be swappable, allowing different storage backends while maintaining a consistent API for the Agent Core.</p>\n<h4 id=\"episodicmemory-interface\">EpisodicMemory Interface</h4>\n<p>This interface manages the linear sequence of dialogue turns.

These processes form a continuous cycle during agent operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"memory-retrieval-algorithm\">Memory Retrieval Algorithm</h4>\n<p>When the Agent Core prepares a prompt for the LLM (e.g., within <code>ReActAgent._format_react_prompt</code>), it must enrich the prompt with relevant context. This follows a multi-source retrieval strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Extract Query Keywords:</strong> From the current <code>ReActLoopContext</code> (specifically the <code>subtask_description</code> and recent conversation turns), extract a set of keywords or rephrase the current goal into a concise query string (e.g., &quot;current user question: {subtask_description}&quot;).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Query Long-Term Memory:</strong> Pass the query string to <code>LongTermMemory.query()</code>. This performs a vector similarity search, returning a list of semantically related past <code>MemoryEntry</code> objects.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Filter and Format:</strong> Process the retrieved memories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove duplicates or extremely similar entries.</li>\n<li>Format each memory into a natural language string suitable for inclusion in the prompt (e.g., <code>&quot;[Memory from past session] User asked about Python decorators. We explained the @ syntax and gave examples.&quot;</code>).</li>\n<li>Optionally, include relevance scores or timestamps as metadata in the formatted text.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Retrieve Recent Episodic Memory:</strong> Call <code>EpisodicMemory.get_recent(max_tokens=recent_budget)</code> to get the most recent turns of the current conversation. This provides immediate continuity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Inject Working Memory:</strong> Serialize the contents of <code>WorkingMemory.to_dict()</code> into a structured string (e.g., <code>&quot;Current Context: user_name=Alice, analysis_target=Q3_sales&quot;</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Assemble Context Window:</strong> The final prompt is assembled by concatenating, in order:\na. <strong>System Instructions</strong> (fixed).\nb. <strong>Working Memory Context</strong>.\nc. <strong>Retrieved Long-Term Memories</strong> (if any).\nd. <strong>Recent Episodic Memory</strong>.\ne. <strong>Current Step Instructions</strong> (e.g., the ReAct template).</p>\n<p>The total token count of (a) through (e) must be less than the LLM&#39;s context limit, leaving room for the LLM&#39;s response.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"memory-compression-and-eviction-strategy\">Memory Compression and Eviction Strategy</h4>\n<p>As conversations grow long, the episodic memory buffer will eventually exceed the token budget. A naive &quot;last-N&quot; truncation risks losing critical information from earlier in the dialogue. A more sophisticated strategy involves compression:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Monitor Token Usage:</strong> After each agent turn, calculate the total tokens of the full episodic history.</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger Compression:</strong> When the history exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 70% of the context window), initiate compression.</li>\n<li><strong>Summarize Old Turns:</strong> Select the oldest contiguous segment of conversation (e.g., the first 10 turns) that hasn&#39;t been summarized yet.</li>\n<li><strong>Generate Summary:</strong> Use the LLM itself (with a dedicated prompt) to produce a concise, third-person summary of that segment (e.g., &quot;The user introduced themselves as Bob and asked for an overview of project management methodologies. The agent explained Agile and Waterfall.&quot;).</li>\n<li><strong>Store and Replace:</strong><ul>\n<li><code>store</code> the generated summary in <strong>LongTermMemory</strong>, ensuring it&#39;s available for future retrieval.</li>\n<li>Replace the original, verbose conversation turns in <strong>EpisodicMemory</strong> with a single <em>pointer message</em>, like <code>&quot;[Earlier conversation summarized: {summary_text}]&quot;</code>. This pointer is much shorter but preserves the semantic gist.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this process, sliding the compression window forward, as the conversation grows.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> This compression strategy transforms the memory system from a passive log into an active, lossy compressor. It prioritizes <em>recent detail</em> and <em>summarized relevance</em> over <em>complete verbatim history</em>, which aligns well with how human memory works and is a practical necessity given token limits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"storage-backends-and-choices\">Storage Backends and Choices</h3>\n<p>Each memory layer can be backed by different storage technologies, depending on the required persistence, performance, and complexity.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Layer</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Simple Option (Development/Prototyping)</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Advanced Option (Production)</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Episodic Memory</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>In-memory list (<code>list</code>)</strong>.

A dedicated DB simplifies operations at scale and provides better tooling for updates and deletions.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Embedding Model Choice:</strong> The quality of long-term memory retrieval hinges on the embedding model. For an all-Python stack, the <code>sentence-transformers</code> library (e.g., <code>all-MiniLM-L6-v2</code>) provides excellent quality and speed locally. For maximum compatibility with LLM APIs, using the same provider&#39;s embedding API (e.g., OpenAI&#39;s <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code>) ensures consistency but adds latency and cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adr-context-window-management-strategy\">ADR: Context Window Management Strategy</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hybrid Sliding Window with LLM-Based Summarization for Episodic Memory</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context:</strong> LLMs have a fixed context window (e.g., 4K, 8K, 128K tokens). The agent&#39;s conversation history, tool outputs, and retrieved memories can easily exceed this limit. We need a strategy to decide what information to include in each prompt to the LLM without losing critical context.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered:</strong><ol>\n<li><strong>Naive Truncation (Keep Last N Tokens):</strong> Always include the most recent N tokens from the episodic memory, discarding the oldest.</li>\n<li><strong>Recursive Summarization:</strong> After each agent turn, use the LLM to summarize the entire conversation so far into a fixed-length summary. Use only this summary as context for the next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid Sliding Window with Summarization:</strong> Maintain a sliding window of recent, verbatim turns. When the window is full, summarize the oldest segment, store the summary in long-term memory, and replace the original turns with a short pointer.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision:</strong> <strong>Option 3 (Hybrid Sliding Window with Summarization)</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale:</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>Option 1</strong> is simple but suffers from <strong>catastrophic forgetting</strong>. Crucial details established early in a long task (e.g., &quot;the user&#39;s name is Alice&quot;) are permanently lost once pushed out of the window.</li>\n<li><strong>Option 2</strong> maintains a very compact state but is <strong>lossy by construction</strong>. Every summarization step discards information, and errors in summarization compound. It also requires an LLM call on <em>every</em> turn, increasing cost and latency.</li>\n<li><strong>Option 3</strong> offers the best balance. It preserves <strong>high fidelity for recent interactions</strong> (critical for step-by-step reasoning), while <strong>conserving the semantic essence of older interactions</strong> via summaries stored in long-term memory. The summaries are retrievable via semantic search if they become relevant again. The summarization cost is amortized over many turns, only paid when necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences:</strong><ul>\n<li><strong>Enables:</strong> Long-running, coherent dialogues that can reference early details via summary recall. Efficient use of the context window.</li>\n<li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Increased implementation complexity. Introduces a delay during summarization steps.

It also pollutes the memory with irrelevant, outdated information, reducing retrieval quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Implement <strong>automatic summarization and eviction policies</strong>. For episodic memory, use the hybrid sliding window. For long-term memory, implement a <strong>least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy</strong> or <strong>time-based expiration</strong> for certain types of memories. Periodically run a cleanup job that removes low-importance or very old entries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Retrieved Memories Are Not Relevant to the Current Task</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> The vector search returns past memories that are semantically similar at the word level but not contextually useful (e.g., retrieving a memory about &quot;Python&quot; when the task is about &quot;snakes&quot;).</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong:</strong> Irrelevant memories waste precious context window tokens and can confuse the LLM, leading to incoherent or off-topic responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> <strong>Improve the query formulation.</strong> Don&#39;t just use the current subtask description. Augment the query with metadata filters (e.g., only retrieve memories from the same user or session) or use a more sophisticated query expansion technique (e.g., generate multiple query aspects from the current context). <strong>Tune the similarity threshold</strong> to be more restrictive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Lossy Summarization Discards Critical Details</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> The LLM-based summarization step oversimplifies or omits key facts, numbers, or instructions from the original conversation.</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong:</strong> When the agent later relies on the summary, it may act on incorrect or incomplete information, leading to task failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> <strong>Craft a detailed summarization prompt.</strong> Explicitly instruct the LLM to preserve specific types of information: names, numbers, dates, URLs, and explicit user instructions. <strong>Store critical facts separately.</strong> Extract key entities (using an NER tool or the LLM) and store them as structured key-value pairs in working memory or a dedicated fact store, rather than relying solely on the narrative summary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: High Latency from Vector Database Calls</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> Every call to <code>LongTermMemory.query()</code> involves a network round-trip to an external vector database, adding hundreds of milliseconds to each agent cycle.</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong:</strong> Makes the agent feel sluggish and severely impacts performance for tasks requiring many reasoning cycles.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix:</strong> <strong>Implement caching.</strong> Cache the results of frequent or similar queries in-memory. <strong>Batch retrievals.</strong> If the agent&#39;s plan is known, pre-fetch potentially relevant memories at the start of a task phase. <strong>Use a local vector store</strong> (FAISS) for development and smaller deployments to eliminate network latency entirely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"a-technology-recommendations-table\">A.

Language-Specific Hints (Python)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Token Counting:</strong> Use the <code>tiktoken</code> library for OpenAI models or <code>transformers</code> for open-source models to accurately count tokens. Create a utility function <code>estimate_tokens(text: str) -&gt; int</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>FAISS Installation:</strong> For most setups, <code>pip install faiss-cpu</code> is sufficient. For GPU acceleration, use <code>faiss-gpu</code> but note the compatibility challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>SentenceTransformers Caching:</strong> The first call to <code>SentenceTransformer.encode()</code> downloads the model (if not cached). Specify <code>cache_folder</code> in the constructor to control where models are stored.</li>\n<li><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> The in-memory implementations (<code>ListEpisodicMemory</code>, <code>DictWorkingMemory</code>) are not thread-safe.

While a single agent can handle many tasks, complex real-world problems often require specialized expertise working in concert—much like a software project needs developers, designers, and testers collaborating. This component provides the communication protocols, role management, and orchestration patterns that enable multiple AI agents to work together toward a common goal, distributing cognitive load and leveraging specialized capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-a-corporate-department\">Mental Model: A Corporate Department</h3>\n<p>Imagine a corporate department working on a complex project. There&#39;s a <strong>department manager</strong> (the orchestrator) who receives the high-level objective from leadership. The manager breaks the project down into specialized tasks and assigns them to team members based on their roles: a <strong>researcher</strong> gathers information, a <strong>writer</strong> drafts content, a <strong>software engineer</strong> writes code, and a <strong>quality analyst</strong> tests the results. Team members communicate through structured channels (email, meetings, shared documents), report progress back to the manager, and occasionally collaborate directly when their work intersects. The manager tracks overall progress, resolves conflicts, and integrates everyone&#39;s contributions into the final deliverable.</p>\n<p>In our framework, this mental model maps directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orchestrator Agent</strong> = Department manager: oversees the overall task, decomposes work, assigns subtasks, and synthesizes final results</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Worker Agents</strong> = Team members: each has a specific role (Researcher, Writer, Coder, Validator) with a tailored set of tools and expertise</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Protocol</strong> = Corporate communication channels: structured messages that pass requests, data, and results between agents</li>\n<li><strong>Shared Context</strong> = Shared documents and meetings: common workspace where agents can access relevant information and intermediate outputs</li>\n<li><strong>Role Assignment</strong> = Job descriptions and organizational chart: defines each agent&#39;s capabilities and responsibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This corporate metaphor helps visualize how autonomy and coordination balance each other: each agent operates independently within its domain while remaining aligned toward the shared objective through clear communication and managerial oversight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"communication-protocol-and-roles\">Communication Protocol and Roles</h3>\n<p>Effective collaboration requires a <strong>structured communication protocol</strong> that defines how agents exchange information. Unlike human teams that can interpret vague instructions, AI agents need unambiguous message formats with clear semantics. The protocol must support request-response patterns, broadcast announcements, and error notifications while maintaining context across conversations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"message-structure\">Message Structure</h4>\n<p>Every inter-agent communication uses the <code>Message</code> data structure, which provides the necessary metadata for routing, correlation, and interpretation:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sender_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier of the sending agent (e.g., &quot;orchestrator&quot;, &quot;researcher_agent_1&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>receiver_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Identifier of the intended recipient agent, or <code>&quot;broadcast&quot;</code> for all agents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>message_type</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Semantic type of message, determines how content is interpreted. Common types: <code>&quot;task_request&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;task_response&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;status_update&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;error&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;information_share&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>content</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td>Structured payload of the message.

A role is more than just a label—it defines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tool Set</strong>: Which tools the agent has access to (a Researcher agent might have web search, database query, and summarization tools)</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt Templates</strong>: Role-specific instructions that shape how the agent interprets tasks (a Writer agent might be prompted to focus on clarity and structure)</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Patterns</strong>: Which message types the agent can send/receive and to whom</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Characteristics</strong>: Expected latency, cost constraints, or quality trade-offs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The role assignment is typically configured at agent creation and registered with the orchestrator:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Agent ID</th>\n<th>Assigned Role</th>\n<th>Advertised Capabilities (Tools)</th>\n<th>Special Instructions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>agent_researcher_1</code></td>\n<td><code>&quot;Researcher&quot;</code></td>\n<td><code>[&quot;web_search&quot;, &quot;wikipedia_lookup&quot;, &quot;document_summarizer&quot;]</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Focus on factual accuracy, cite sources&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>agent_writer_1</code></td>\n<td><code>&quot;Writer&quot;</code></td>\n<td><code>[&quot;draft_outline&quot;, &quot;write_section&quot;, &quot;proofread&quot;]</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Maintain consistent tone, avoid jargon&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>agent_coder_1</code></td>\n<td><code>&quot;Software Engineer&quot;</code></td>\n<td><code>[&quot;code_generator&quot;, &quot;code_executor&quot;, &quot;debugger&quot;]</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Write clean, commented code with error handling&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>agent_validator_1</code></td>\n<td><code>&quot;Quality Analyst&quot;</code></td>\n<td><code>[&quot;unit_test_generator&quot;, &quot;code_reviewer&quot;, &quot;fact_checker&quot;]</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Be thorough, identify edge cases&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Role-based specialization reduces cognitive load on individual agents. Instead of every agent needing to master all tools, each focuses on a domain, leading to more reliable tool use and less hallucination of inappropriate actions. The orchestrator&#39;s job is to match tasks to roles, not to micromanage how each agent accomplishes its work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"orchestration-and-delegation-flow\">Orchestration and Delegation Flow</h3>\n<p>The orchestrator agent coordinates the multi-agent system using a well-defined flow that balances autonomy with oversight.

Our framework implements a hybrid approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orchestrator-Managed Context</strong>: The orchestrator maintains a central <code>Dict[str, Any]</code> of key findings, decisions, and artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Selective Broadcast</strong>: When an agent produces a result relevant to others, the orchestrator broadcasts an <code>&quot;information_share&quot;</code> message with the essential data</li>\n<li><strong>On-Demand Querying</strong>: Agents can request specific context elements from the orchestrator via <code>&quot;context_request&quot;</code> messages</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: Context items are timestamped and versioned to prevent stale information from causing conflicts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach avoids the bottleneck of requiring all communication to flow through the orchestrator while still maintaining coherence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-orchestration-patterns\">Common Orchestration Patterns</h3>\n<p>Different collaboration scenarios call for different orchestration patterns. Our framework supports three primary patterns that can be mixed and matched.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-hierarchical-manager-worker-pattern\">1. Hierarchical (Manager-Worker) Pattern</h4>\n<p>The most common pattern, matching our corporate department metaphor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Single orchestrator at the root, multiple specialized workers as leaves</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Flow</strong>: All task assignments flow from orchestrator to workers; all results flow back to orchestrator</li>\n<li><strong>Coordination</strong>: Workers typically don&#39;t communicate directly with each other</li>\n<li><strong>Best For</strong>: Well-structured tasks with clear decomposition, centralized quality control</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Writing a technical report (orchestrator → researcher → writer → validator)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"2-broadcast-committee-pattern\">2. Broadcast (Committee) Pattern</h4>\n<p>Useful for consensus-building or gathering diverse perspectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure</strong>: No single orchestrator; all agents have equal standing</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Flow</strong>: Any agent can broadcast messages to all others</li>\n<li><strong>Coordination</strong>: Agents self-organize through voting or reputation systems</li>\n<li><strong>Best For</strong>: Subjective tasks, creative brainstorming, error detection</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Code review where multiple engineers independently review then discuss</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"3-market-based-auction-pattern\">3. Market-Based (Auction) Pattern</h4>\n<p>Efficient for resource-constrained environments or when agents have overlapping capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Task issuer (could be orchestrator or any agent) acts as auctioneer</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Flow</strong>: Task issuer broadcasts task requirements; agents bid with estimated cost/quality/timeline; issuer selects best bid</li>\n<li><strong>Coordination</strong>: Market dynamics (supply/demand) determine task allocation</li>\n<li><strong>Best For</strong>: Load balancing, cost optimization, real-time task scheduling</li>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Processing a batch of heterogeneous data analysis tasks where agents have varying availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/ai-agent-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-multi-agent-org.svg\" alt=\"Multi-Agent Hierarchical Orchestration\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"adr-agent-to-agent-communication-medium\">ADR: Agent-to-Agent Communication Medium</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Message Bus with Topic-Based Routing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Multiple agents need to communicate asynchronously in various patterns (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

Error Handling and Edge Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Autonomous AI agents operate in a fundamentally unpredictable environment—they interface with unreliable LLMs, external APIs with variable latency, user inputs of varying quality, and complex state machines that can enter unexpected configurations. A robust error handling strategy is not merely a defensive programming practice; it is the <strong>safety net that prevents the AI Executive from falling into infinite loops, corrupting data, or delivering nonsensical results</strong>. This section catalogs the expected failure modes across all framework components and defines systematic recovery strategies that transform the agent from a brittle script into a resilient, self-correcting system.</p>\n<p>Think of error handling in an AI agent framework as the <strong>emergency response protocols in a nuclear power plant</strong>. You cannot prevent all possible malfunctions, but you can design layers of defense: automated sensors (error detection), redundant systems (retry mechanisms), containment vessels (sandboxed execution), and emergency shutdown procedures (graceful fallbacks). Each component has its own failure signatures, and the system must coordinate responses across components to maintain overall stability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"71-failure-mode-taxonomy\">7.1 Failure Mode Taxonomy</h3>\n<p>Failures in an AI agent system follow a predictable pattern aligned with the five architectural pillars.

Testing Strategy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Testing an autonomous AI agent framework presents unique challenges that go beyond traditional software testing. We must verify not only that the <em>code</em> works correctly, but also that the <em>AI reasoning</em> produces reliable outcomes within the constraints of our system. This section outlines a multi-faceted testing strategy that combines traditional software testing techniques with specialized approaches for evaluating AI-driven systems.</p>\n<p>The core philosophy is the <strong>Testing Pyramid for Agent Systems</strong>, which prioritizes fast, deterministic unit tests at the base, followed by integration tests that validate component interactions, and finally end-to-end tests that verify the system&#39;s ability to accomplish real tasks. Each milestone in the project has specific <strong>Verification Checkpoints</strong>—concrete test commands and expected outputs that serve as objective completion criteria.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-pyramid-for-agent-systems\">Testing Pyramid for Agent Systems</h3>\n<p>Think of testing our AI agent framework as <strong>quality control for a manufacturing pipeline</strong>. At the lowest level, we test individual components (like testing each gear in isolation). Next, we test assembled subsystems (like testing that the conveyor belt moves parts between stations correctly). Finally, we test the entire production line with real materials to ensure it manufactures the intended product. This layered approach catches issues early where they&#39;re cheapest to fix and provides confidence that the system works as a whole.</p>\n<p>The pyramid consists of three primary layers:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Layer</th>\n<th>Focus</th>\n<th>Test Frequency</th>\n<th>Execution Speed</th>\n<th>Determinism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Unit Tests</strong></td>\n<td>Individual components in isolation: tools, parsers, data structures, utilities</td>\n<td>High (after every change)</td>\n<td>Fast (milliseconds)</td>\n<td>Fully deterministic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Integration Tests</strong></td>\n<td>Component interactions: ReAct loop with mocked LLM, planner with tool registry, memory retrieval</td>\n<td>Medium (daily/CI)</td>\n<td>Medium (seconds)</td>\n<td>Mostly deterministic (depends on mock behavior)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>End-to-End Tests</strong></td>\n<td>Full system with real LLM (lightweight model): complete agent completing simple real-world tasks</td>\n<td>Low (weekly/release)</td>\n<td>Slow (minutes)</td>\n<td>Non-deterministic (LLM variance)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"unit-tests-the-foundation-of-reliability\">Unit Tests: The Foundation of Reliability</h4>\n<p>Unit tests validate the smallest testable parts of the framework—data structures, pure functions, and isolated components. These tests should be <strong>fast, deterministic, and comprehensive</strong>, covering edge cases and error conditions. They form the foundation of our testing strategy because they catch bugs early and provide rapid feedback during development.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Unit Test Categories:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Test Focus</th>\n<th>Example Test Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Data Structures</strong> (<code>ToolResult</code>, <code>SubTask</code>, <code>Task</code>, <code>Message</code>, etc.)</td>\n<td>Factory methods, immutability, validation, serialization</td>\n<td>- <code>ToolResult.success()</code> creates result with <code>SUCCESS</code> status<br>- <code>SubTask.is_ready()</code> returns <code>False</code> when dependencies not met<br>- <code>Message.to_dict()</code> and <code>from_dict()</code> are inverses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tool System</strong></td>\n<td>Parameter validation, execution safety, error handling</td>\n<td>- <code>ToolExecutionEngine._validate_arguments()</code> rejects invalid types<br>- Tool timeout triggers <code>ToolResult.timeout()</code><br>- JSON schema validation produces descriptive errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Parsers &amp; Utilities</strong></td>\n<td>String parsing, JSON extraction, state transitions</td>\n<td>- <code>parse_llm_action_response()</code> extracts tool name and args from text<br>- <code>extract_json_from_text()</code> handles nested JSON and malformed brackets<br>- State machine transitions follow defined rules</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Components</strong></td>\n<td>Storage, retrieval, compression logic (without vector DB)</td>\n<td>- <code>EpisodicMemory.get_recent()</code> respects token limits<br>- <code>WorkingMemory</code> stores and retrieves key-value pairs<br>- Memory summarizer produces coherent summaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Communication Layer</strong></td>\n<td>Message passing, subscription management</td>\n<td>- <code>MessageBus.publish()</code> delivers to correct subscribers<br>- Unsubscribe removes agent from all topics<br>- Message serialization preserves all fields</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Component Specification Sheet</strong>\nEach unit test acts like a quality control checklist for a manufactured component. Just as a gear has specifications for tooth count, diameter, and material hardness, our <code>ToolResult</code> has specifications for status, content, and metadata. The unit test verifies that each instance meets these specifications under all expected conditions (and gracefully handles unexpected ones).</p>\n<h4 id=\"integration-tests-validating-component-interactions\">Integration Tests: Validating Component Interactions</h4>\n<p>Integration tests verify that components work together correctly when connected. For AI agent systems, this is particularly critical because the interfaces between components (LLM prompting, action parsing, observation formatting) are where many subtle bugs emerge. We use <strong>mocking</strong> to isolate the framework from external dependencies (LLM APIs, vector databases, external tool APIs) to maintain determinism.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Integration Test Patterns:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Components Involved</th>\n<th>Mock Strategy</th>\n<th>Verification Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>ReAct Loop with Mocked LLM</strong></td>\n<td><code>ReActAgent</code>, <code>ToolRegistry</code>, <code>ToolExecutionEngine</code></td>\n<td>Mock LLM returns predetermined responses in sequence</td>\n<td>- Loop progresses through think-act-observe cycles<br>- Tool calls are made with correct arguments<br>- Loop terminates after final answer or iteration limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Planner with Tool Registry</strong></td>\n<td><code>Planner</code>, <code>ToolRegistry</code>, <code>Task</code> decomposition</td>\n<td>Mock LLM returns predetermined decomposition JSON</td>\n<td>- Generated <code>Task</code> has valid DAG structure<br>- Subtasks reference available tools<br>- Dependencies respect logical ordering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Retrieval &amp; Context Injection</strong></td>\n<td><code>MemoryRetriever</code>, <code>EpisodicMemory</code>, <code>LongTermMemory</code> (mock)</td>\n<td>Mock vector store returns predetermined relevant memories</td>\n<td>- Retrieved context fits within token budget<br>- Most relevant memories are included<br>- Formatting follows prompt template</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-Agent Message Passing</strong></td>\n<td><code>OrchestratorAgent</code>, <code>WorkerAgent</code>, <code>MessageBus</code></td>\n<td>Mock agents with predefined response behaviors</td>\n<td>- Messages are routed to correct recipients<br>- Task delegation follows role matching<br>- Results are aggregated correctly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Error Recovery Flow</strong></td>\n<td><code>RecoveryOrchestrator</code>, <code>ToolExecutionEngine</code>, <code>ReActAgent</code></td>\n<td>Mock tools that fail in specific patterns</td>\n<td>- Errors are classified correctly by severity<br>- Appropriate recovery handlers are invoked<br>- Circuit breakers open after repeated failures</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Assembly Line Test Station</strong>\nIntegration tests are like testing stations along an assembly line where we verify that partially assembled units function together. We test that the robotic arm (ReAct loop) correctly picks up a component (tool call) from the conveyor belt (tool registry) and places it in the assembly (task execution). By mocking the external power source (LLM), we can run these tests repeatedly without variation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"end-to-end-tests-the-reality-check\">End-to-End Tests: The Reality Check</h4>\n<p>End-to-end (E2E) tests validate the complete system with minimal mocks—typically using a real but lightweight LLM (like a small local model) to perform actual reasoning. These tests are <strong>non-deterministic</strong> due to LLM variance but provide essential confidence that the system works in practice. We run them less frequently and accept some flakiness, focusing on high-level success criteria rather than exact outputs.</p>\n<p><strong>E2E Test Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>LLM Selection</strong></td>\n<td>Use small, fast local model (e.g., Phi-3-mini, Gemma-2B) or free tier of cloud API</td>\n<td>Balances realism with cost/speed; avoids production API costs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Task Complexity</strong></td>\n<td>Simple, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria (e.g., &quot;What is 15% of 200?&quot;)</td>\n<td>Reduces LLM reasoning errors; makes pass/fail assessment unambiguous</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Validation Method</strong></td>\n<td>Approximate matching (contains keywords, numeric range, regex patterns)</td>\n<td>Accommodates LLM output variance while verifying core intent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flakiness Handling</strong></td>\n<td>Retry failed tests, mark as non-blocking in CI, maintain stability dashboard</td>\n<td>Accepts that LLMs are stochastic; focuses on trend analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tool Mocking</strong></td>\n<td>Mock only external APIs (web search, database), keep calculator/filesystem real</td>\n<td>Isoles network unreliability while testing actual tool execution</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Example E2E Test Scenario:</strong> <code>test_agent_calculates_percentage</code></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Setup</strong>: Register <code>CalculatorTool</code>, initialize agent with simple ReAct loop</li>\n<li><strong>Input</strong>: User query: &quot;What is 15% of 200?&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Execution</strong>: Run <code>Agent.run_task()</code> with lightweight LLM</li>\n<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Output should contain &quot;30&quot; (or reasoning leading to 30)</li>\n<li><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>: Test passes if output contains &quot;30&quot; within 3 ReAct iterations</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The testing pyramid for AI systems <em>inverts</em> the traditional cost-benefit ratio at the top. While E2E tests are valuable for validating the full system, they&#39;re expensive, slow, and flaky. Therefore, we invest heavily in comprehensive unit and integration tests that catch 90% of issues, using E2E tests as periodic sanity checks rather than primary quality gates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"milestone-verification-checkpoints\">Milestone Verification Checkpoints</h3>\n<p>Each project milestone has concrete verification checkpoints—specific tests or commands that objectively demonstrate the milestone&#39;s acceptance criteria are met.

Debugging Guide</h2>\n<p>Autonomous AI agents represent a complex, non-deterministic system where traditional debugging approaches often fall short. When an agent fails—getting stuck in a loop, producing incorrect results, or crashing unexpectedly—the root cause can be buried in multiple layers: the LLM&#39;s reasoning, the tool execution, the planning logic, or the memory system. This section provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and fixing common issues that arise during development of the framework.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-bug-symptoms-and-fixes\">Common Bug Symptoms and Fixes</h3>\n<p>The following table catalogs the most frequent failure modes observed when building AI agent systems, organized by their primary symptoms. Each entry includes the observable behavior, the underlying technical causes, and concrete step-by-step fixes to implement.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Cause(s)</th>\n<th>Step-by-Step Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Agent gets stuck in an infinite loop, repeating the same tool call</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Missing termination condition</strong>: The LLM isn&#39;t being prompted with a clear &quot;final answer&quot; format or the parser isn&#39;t detecting it.<br>2. <strong>Tool result not informative</strong>: The observation returned to the LLM doesn&#39;t provide enough context to progress.<br>3. <strong>Maximum iteration limit not enforced</strong>: The <code>ReActLoopContext.iteration</code> counter isn&#39;t being checked or <code>max_iterations</code> is set too high.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Inspect the prompt template</strong>: Ensure your <code>_format_react_prompt</code> includes explicit instructions like &quot;If you have the final answer, respond with <code>Final Answer:</code> followed by the answer.&quot;<br>2. <strong>Check the action parser</strong>: Verify <code>parse_llm_action_response</code> correctly identifies both <code>Action:</code> and <code>Final Answer:</code> patterns.<br>3. <strong>Add loop detection</strong>: Track previous actions in <code>ReActLoopContext.previous_actions</code> and detect when the same tool with same arguments is called repeatedly; break with an error observation.<br>4. <strong>Set conservative limits</strong>: Start with <code>max_iterations=10</code> during development and incrementally increase only after verifying loop stability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>LLM hallucinates non-existent tools</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Tool descriptions too vague</strong>: The LLM cannot distinguish between similar-sounding tools.<br>2. <strong>Tool list not updated in prompt</strong>: Available tools aren&#39;t being dynamically injected into each cycle&#39;s prompt.<br>3. <strong>No validation before execution</strong>: The system attempts to execute a hallucinated tool name instead of rejecting it.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Improve tool descriptions</strong>: Rewrite tool <code>description</code> fields to be distinct and action-oriented (e.g., &quot;Search the web for current information using DuckDuckGo&quot; vs. &quot;Get data from the internet&quot;).<br>2. <strong>Implement tool validation</strong>: In <code>ReActAgent._run_single_cycle</code>, after parsing the action, call <code>ToolRegistry.get_tool(tool_name)</code> and if <code>None</code>, return an error observation: &quot;Tool {tool_name} does not exist. Available tools: ...&quot;<br>3. <strong>Include tool signatures in prompt</strong>: Format available tools with their JSON schema parameters so the LLM understands required arguments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Action parsing fails silently</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>LLM output format mismatch</strong>: The LLM is producing free-form text instead of the expected <code>Action: {&quot;tool&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;args&quot;: {...}}</code> format.<br>2. <strong>JSON parsing too strict</strong>: The <code>extract_json_from_text</code> function fails on valid but slightly malformed JSON (trailing commas, single quotes).<br>3. <strong>Regex pattern incomplete</strong>: The regex in <code>parse_llm_action_response</code> doesn&#39;t capture all valid variations of the action format.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Add robust JSON parsing</strong>: Implement a fallback in <code>extract_json_from_text</code> that attempts to fix common JSON issues (replace single quotes with double quotes, add missing closing braces).<br>2. <strong>Log the raw LLM response</strong>: Always log the complete LLM output before parsing to see what format is actually being produced.<br>3. <strong>Use function calling if available</strong>: If your LLM provider supports structured function calling (OpenAI, Anthropic), switch to that API instead of text parsing.<br>4. <strong>Improve prompt engineering</strong>: Add explicit examples of correct action format in the few-shot examples within your prompt template.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tool execution hangs forever</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Missing timeout</strong>: Tool execution is not wrapped in a timeout context manager.<br>2. <strong>Network dependency unresponsive</strong>: External API calls (web search, database) may hang indefinitely.<br>3. <strong>Synchronous blocking in async context</strong>: A synchronous tool is blocking the entire event loop.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Implement mandatory timeouts</strong>: In <code>ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call</code>, wrap the execution in <code>_timeout_context(timeout_seconds)</code> with a sensible default (e.g., 30 seconds).<br>2. <strong>Use async for I/O-bound tools</strong>: Implement tools with async <code>execute</code> methods and use <code>asyncio.wait_for</code> for timeout control.<br>3. <strong>Add circuit breakers</strong>: Use <code>ToolExecutionEngine._update_circuit_breaker</code> to temporarily disable tools that repeatedly timeout or fail.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Subtask dependencies cause deadlock</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Circular dependency in DAG</strong>: Subtask A depends on B, and B depends on A, either directly or transitively.<br>2. <strong>Dependency not marked complete</strong>: A subtask&#39;s <code>status</code> remains <code>EXECUTING</code> after completion due to missing <code>SubTask.with_status(COMPLETED)</code> call.<br>3. <strong>Missing dependency tracking</strong>: The <code>Plan.execution_order</code> doesn&#39;t respect all dependencies during topological sort.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Validate DAG acyclicity</strong>: In <code>Planner.create_plan</code>, after building the dependency graph, run a cycle detection algorithm (DFS with three-color marking) and reject circular plans.<br>2. <strong>Implement proper status transitions</strong>: Ensure every subtask moves from <code>EXECUTING</code> to <code>COMPLETED</code> (or <code>FAILED</code>) via immutable updates: <code>task.update_subtask(subtask.with_status(COMPLETED).with_result(result))</code>.<br>3. <strong>Use topological sort with dependency checking</strong>: In <code>ExecutionFlow.get_next_ready_subtask</code>, verify <code>subtask.is_ready(completed_task_ids)</code> checks all dependencies, not just immediate ones.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory retrieval returns irrelevant context</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Poor embedding quality</strong>: Using a generic sentence transformer not tuned for the domain.<br>2. <strong>No query expansion</strong>: The raw user query is used for vector search without augmentation.<br>3. <strong>Missing metadata filtering</strong>: Retrieved memories aren&#39;t filtered by recency or task relevance.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Improve query formulation</strong>: In <code>MemoryRetriever.retrieve_context</code>, expand the query with context from <code>WorkingMemory</code> (current goal, subtask description) before embedding.<br>2. <strong>Add hybrid search</strong>: Combine vector similarity with keyword matching (BM25) and recency boosting.<br>3. <strong>Implement relevance threshold</strong>: In <code>LongTermMemory.query</code>, filter out results with similarity score below a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.7).<br>4. <strong>Add metadata filters</strong>: Store task ID, agent role, or tool names in <code>MemoryEntry.metadata</code> and filter retrievals by current context.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-agent delegation creates infinite loops</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Delegation loop</strong>: Agent A delegates to B, who delegates back to A for the same subtask.<br>2. <strong>No timeout on delegated tasks</strong>: A worker agent never responds, leaving the orchestrator waiting indefinitely.<br>3. <strong>Missing conflict resolution</strong>: Contradictory results from agents cause the orchestrator to repeatedly request re-execution.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Track delegation chain</strong>: In <code>OrchestratorAgent._delegate_subtask</code>, store the chain of delegations in <code>DelegatedTask.metadata</code> and reject if the same agent appears twice.<br>2. <strong>Set deadlines on delegated tasks</strong>: Each <code>DelegatedTask</code> should have a <code>deadline</code> timestamp; implement a background cleanup task that marks overdue tasks as failed.<br>3. <strong>Implement voting or authority</strong>: In <code>OrchestratorAgent._resolve_conflicts</code>, use a simple voting scheme (majority wins) or designate an expert agent as tie-breaker.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Context window exceeds token limit</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Unbounded conversation history</strong>: <code>EpisodicMemory.append</code> is called for every turn without summarization or eviction.<br>2. <strong>Too many retrieved memories</strong>: <code>MemoryRetriever.retrieve_context</code> fetches more context than fits in the token budget.<br>3. <strong>Inefficient prompt formatting</strong>: The prompt template includes verbose tool descriptions or examples on every cycle.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Implement token counting</strong>: In <code>EpisodicMemory.get_recent</code>, count tokens (approximately 4 chars per token) and truncate when exceeding <code>max_tokens</code>.<br>2. <strong>Dynamic context budgeting</strong>: Allocate token budgets: 50% for conversation history, 30% for retrieved memories, 20% for prompt template.<br>3. <strong>Summarize old turns</strong>: When history grows beyond threshold, call <code>LongTermMemory.summarize_recent</code> to compress older messages into a single summary entry.<br>4. <strong>Streamline prompt</strong>: Remove redundant instructions after the first cycle; use placeholders that only expand when needed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tool returns success but incorrect data</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Tool schema mismatch</strong>: The tool&#39;s <code>parameters_schema</code> doesn&#39;t validate all required constraints (e.g., numeric ranges, string patterns).<br>2. <strong>LLM misinterpretation</strong>: The LLM passes arguments in wrong format (string vs number) that passes validation but produces wrong results.<br>3. <strong>External API changed</strong>: The underlying service API updated but the tool wrapper wasn&#39;t updated.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Strengthen schema validation</strong>: Use JSON Schema <code>minimum</code>, <code>maximum</code>, <code>pattern</code>, <code>enum</code> constraints to catch invalid arguments before execution.<br>2. <strong>Add example validation</strong>: Include example valid/invalid parameter sets in tool documentation for LLM few-shot learning.<br>3. <strong>Implement result validation</strong>: After tool execution, validate the <code>ToolResult.content</code> against an expected output schema when possible.<br>4. <strong>Monitor tool health</strong>: Track tool success/failure rates in <code>ToolExecutionEngine</code> and alert when error rates spike.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Agent state becomes inconsistent after error</strong></td>\n<td>1. <strong>Partial state updates</strong>: An error occurs mid-update, leaving some components updated and others not.<br>2. <strong>Missing error recovery rollback</strong>: The <code>RecoveryOrchestrator</code> doesn&#39;t revert partial changes when recovery fails.<br>3. <strong>Race conditions in async code</strong>: Concurrent modifications to <code>ExecutionFlow.active_flows</code> without proper locking.</td>\n<td>1. <strong>Use immutable updates</strong>: Follow the <strong>functional update</strong> pattern: <code>flow = flow.mark_subtask_complete(subtask_id)</code> returns a new instance rather than mutating.<br>2. <strong>Implement transaction-like boundaries</strong>: Group related state changes into a single update operation protected by a lock.<br>3. <strong>Add state validation checks</strong>: Periodically validate invariants (e.g., a <code>COMPLETED</code> subtask must have a <code>result</code>) and trigger recovery if violated.<br>4. <strong>Use <code>asyncio.Lock</code> for shared mutable state</strong>: In <code>MessageBus</code> and <code>FlowController</code>, protect critical sections with locks.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-techniques-and-tools\">Debugging Techniques and Tools</h3>\n<p>Debugging autonomous agents requires moving beyond traditional print statements to systematic inspection of the agent&#39;s internal reasoning process. The key insight is that the agent&#39;s &quot;thought process&quot; is partially observable through the sequence of thoughts, actions, and observations it generates. Below are proven techniques for illuminating the black box.</p>\n<h4 id=\"structured-logging-of-the-thought-action-chain\">Structured Logging of the Thought-Action Chain</h4>\n<p>The most powerful debugging tool is comprehensive, structured logging of every ReAct cycle. Instead of logging raw text, create a machine-readable log that captures the complete state at each step:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: Log with enough context to replay any agent session offline for analysis. Every log entry should include the full <code>ReActLoopContext</code> and the raw LLM response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Implementation Approach</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Create a logging decorator</strong> that wraps <code>ReActAgent._run_single_cycle</code> and logs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cycle number (<code>context.iteration</code>)</li>\n<li>The formatted prompt sent to the LLM (truncated)</li>\n<li>The raw LLM response</li>\n<li>The parsed action (or final answer)</li>\n<li>The tool execution result (status, content snippet)</li>\n<li>The updated <code>AgentState</code></li>\n<li>Timestamps for performance analysis</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use structured JSON logging</strong> so logs can be queried and analyzed programmatically:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">python</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   # Example log entry structure (conceptual, not code in main body)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">   {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"timestamp\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"2023-10-05T14:30:00Z\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"component\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"ReActAgent\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"cycle\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">3</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"state\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"ACTING\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"action\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"tool\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"web_search\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"args\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"query\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"current weather NYC\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}},</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"observation_preview\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Weather report: 72°F, sunny...\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     \"context_snapshot\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        \"subtask_description\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Find current weather in New York\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        \"completed_actions\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">: [</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"search_weather_api\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">     }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">   }</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Add correlation IDs</strong>: Pass a unique <code>correlation_id</code> through the entire execution flow (from <code>Agent.run_task</code> down to individual tool calls) to trace requests across components.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"inspecting-the-prompt-sent-to-the-llm\">Inspecting the Prompt Sent to the LLM</h4>\n<p>Often, the root cause of agent misbehavior lies in the prompt construction.

Think of the agent as an autonomous spacecraft and human operators as mission control. The spacecraft operates independently most of the time, but for critical decisions, unforeseen situations, or when explicit approval is needed, it establishes a communication channel with mission control, awaits guidance, then proceeds with the updated instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The current framework operates in fully autonomous mode. A human-in-the-loop extension would introduce controlled interruption points where humans can review, approve, redirect, or provide additional information. This addresses the fundamental tension between agent autonomy and safety/control requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration Design:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Interception Points in the Execution Flow:</strong> The <code>FlowController.execute_task()</code> method would gain configuration options to define interception triggers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pre-execution approval:</strong> Before starting a <code>Task</code> with specific characteristics (uses certain tools, involves sensitive operations)</li>\n<li><strong>Mid-execution checkpoints:</strong> After completing specific <code>SubTask</code> milestones or when confidence scores fall below threshold</li>\n<li><strong>Exception handling:</strong> When <code>RecoveryOrchestrator</code> encounters errors above a certain severity level</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Human Interaction as Special Tools:</strong> Human input would be modeled as special <code>Tool</code> instances (e.g., <code>HumanApprovalTool</code>, <code>HumanGuidanceTool</code>) that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Block execution until human response (with configurable timeout)</li>\n<li>Format requests in human-readable form (e.g., Markdown, with context summary)</li>\n<li>Parse and validate human responses back into structured data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Async Notification System:</strong> A new <code>NotificationService</code> component would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Push interruption requests to configured channels (web UI, email, Slack)</li>\n<li>Maintain request state with correlation to the paused <code>ExecutionFlow</code></li>\n<li>Resume execution when human response arrives or timeout expires</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Human Response Handling Pattern</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Async-Await with Timeout Fallback for Human Responses</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context:</strong> Human responses are inherently asynchronous and unpredictable. The agent must wait for input but cannot block indefinitely if the human is unavailable.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered:</strong><ol>\n<li><strong>Synchronous blocking:</strong> Agent thread blocks indefinitely waiting for human response (simple but risks deadlock)</li>\n<li><strong>Async with timeout:</strong> Agent pauses execution, stores state, continues when response arrives or after timeout (preserves resources but requires state management)</li>\n<li><strong>Optimistic continuation with rollback:</strong> Agent proceeds with best guess, human can later approve/correct (maintains flow but complex rollback logic)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Option 2 (async with timeout) balances responsiveness with robustness. The agent pauses the specific <code>ExecutionFlow</code>, allowing other tasks to continue, and implements a timeout fallback to predefined policies (abort, continue with default, escalate to another human).</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This pattern matches real-world operational practices (pilots awaiting ATC clearance), allows efficient resource use (single agent can manage multiple paused flows), and provides clear failure modes when humans are unresponsive.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Requires persistent storage of paused flow states, adds complexity to <code>FlowController</code> state management, introduces latency for tasks requiring human input.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"1012-advanced-tool-chaining-amp-composition\">10.1.2 Advanced Tool Chaining &amp; Composition</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mental Model:</strong> <strong>Function Composition in Mathematics.</strong> Just as mathematical functions can be composed (f(g(x))) to create more complex operations, tools can be chained together where the output of one tool becomes the input to another.

By adhering to clean interfaces, modular components, and well-defined data flows, the framework can accommodate a wide range of advanced capabilities beyond the initial five milestones. The extension ideas presented here—from human oversight to experiential learning—demonstrate how the foundation can evolve to address increasingly complex real-world applications of autonomous AI agents.</p>\n<p>Each extension builds upon existing patterns: human interaction extends the <code>Tool</code> interface, composite tools leverage the <code>ToolExecutionEngine</code>, learning modules enhance the <code>MemorySystem</code>, and so on. This evolutionary approach ensures that advanced capabilities integrate seamlessly rather than requiring disruptive rewrites.</p>\n<p>As with any extensible system, the key to successful expansion lies in maintaining the core architectural principles: clear separation of concerns, well-defined interfaces, and comprehensive observability. Future developers building upon this framework should prioritize these principles while exploring the exciting possibilities of autonomous AI systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"11-glossary\">11.

The key challenge is designing a robust, loop-safe execution engine that balances agent autonomy with predictable control, effectively translating high-level goals into reliable, observable actions.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n## 1. Context and Problem Statement\n\nBuilding an AI agent that can autonomously complete multi-step tasks in the real world is not just a technical challenge—it's an architectural one. This section establishes the core problem space, introduces an intuitive mental model for thinking about the solution, and analyzes the landscape of existing frameworks to identify the specific gap this project aims to fill.\n\n### Mental Model: The Delegating Executive\n\nImagine you are a senior executive with a broad goal: \"Improve our company's market position.\" You cannot accomplish this alone. Instead, you:\n\n1.  **Decompose the goal:** You break it into concrete tasks: \"Research competitors,\" \"Analyze Q3 financials,\" \"Draft a strategy memo.\"\n2.  **Delegate to specialists:** You assign the research to an analyst, the financials to an accountant, and the memo to a writer. You don't need to know *how* they perform their work, only *what* they need (the task) and *what* they produce (the result).\n3.  **Manage a plan:** You track task dependencies (the memo can't start until research and analysis are complete), sequence them, and adjust when something goes wrong.\n4.  **Learn from a corporate memory:** You refer to past reports and meeting notes to inform decisions, and you archive the outcomes of this project for future reference.\n\n**Project Archon** is the system architecture for an **\"AI Executive.\"** Its core components are direct analogs to this real-world scenario:\n\n*   **The Planner** is the executive's project management skill, responsible for breaking down nebulous goals into actionable subtasks.\n*   **The Tool System** represents the team of specialized employees (the analyst, the accountant, the writer). Each tool is a well-defined capability with a clear interface (a job description and expected inputs/outputs).\n*   **The ReAct Loop** is the executive's daily operating rhythm: `Think` (consider the next step), `Act` (delegate a task), `Observe` (review the result), and repeat.\n*   **The Memory System** is the executive's notebook (short-term), whiteboard (working memory for the current project), and corporate archive (long-term, searchable memory).\n*   **The Orchestrator** (in multi-agent setups) is the department head, coordinating multiple executives (agents) who each have their own specialized teams (tools).\n\nThis mental model transforms an abstract engineering problem into a relatable system design challenge. The goal is not to build a monolithic \"AI brain,\" but to design the **organizational and operational framework** that enables a Large Language Model (LLM) to function as a competent, autonomous executive.\n\n### The Problem of Autonomous Action\n\nA raw Large Language Model (LLM) is a brilliant strategist trapped in a conference room. It can reason, analyze, and propose plans with remarkable sophistication, but it cannot *act* on the world. It lacks the ability to execute code, query a database, call an API, or manipulate a file. This fundamental limitation stems from several interconnected challenges:\n\n1.  **Tool Use & Integration:** An LLM's knowledge is static, frozen at its training cut-off. It cannot access real-time information (stock prices, weather) or perform concrete computations. To be useful, it must be able to **safely and reliably invoke external tools**. This requires a consistent interface for describing tools, validating their inputs, executing them, and interpreting their outputs—all while the LLM operates in unstructured natural language.\n\n2.  **Planning & State Management:** Real-world tasks are rarely single-step. \"Book a business trip\" involves checking calendars, finding flights, booking hotels, and submitting an expense report—a graph of dependent steps. An agent must be able to **decompose a high-level goal, formulate a plan, track its progress through multiple states, and adapt when steps fail**. This requires maintaining a persistent, structured representation of the task's state beyond the LLM's limited context window.\n\n3.  **Loop Control & Halting:** If you give an LLM the ability to act, you must also give it the ability to **know when to stop**. An agent without a termination condition can loop infinitely, retrying failed actions or pursuing irrelevant tangents. The system must enforce guardrails like iteration limits, provide clear signals for task completion, and have fallback mechanisms to gracefully abort unproductive loops.\n\n4.  **Context & Memory Limitation:** An LLM's context window is a small, volatile scratchpad. To work on a long task, an agent must **selectively remember and recall relevant information**. This includes the immediate conversation history, key facts learned during execution, and lessons from past similar tasks. Without effective memory management, the agent suffers from \"amnesia,\" repeatedly re-discovering the same information or losing track of its overall objective.\n\n5.  **Error Handling & Robustness:** The external world is messy. Tools time out, APIs return errors, and user instructions are ambiguous. An autonomous agent cannot simply crash. It must **detect failures, classify them (transient vs. permanent), attempt recovery (e.g., retries), and escalate unsolvable problems** to a fallback strategy or the user. This requires a systematic approach to error propagation and observability throughout the execution pipeline.\n\n> The core architectural challenge is **bridging the semantic gap** between the LLM's unstructured reasoning and the structured, procedural world of software tools, while maintaining safety, observability, and control.\n\n### Existing Approaches and Trade-offs\n\nSeveral frameworks have attempted to solve parts of this problem. Understanding their strengths and weaknesses clarifies the design space for Project Archon.\n\n| Framework | Primary Strength | Key Weakness / Trade-off | Relevance to Our Goals |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **LangChain / LangGraph** | **Ecosystem & Integration.** Offers a vast, pre-built collection of tools, agents, and memory implementations. Excellent for rapidly prototyping common patterns (ReAct, OpenAI Functions). | **Abstraction Leak & Complexity.** The high-level `AgentExecutor` can feel like a black box. Debugging requires understanding intricate chains of callbacks and intermediate states. Its \"kitchen sink\" approach can lead to bloated, hard-to-reason-about applications for custom needs. | **Reference Implementation.** We will study its patterns (especially the ReAct and tool-calling designs) but aim for a more transparent, modular, and explicit architecture where data flow and state are first-class concepts. |\n| **AutoGPT / BabyAGI** | **Ambition & Goal-Oriented Design.** Pioneered the concept of a fully autonomous agent with long-running tasks, planning, and internet-enabled tools. Strong focus on recursive decomposition and persistent memory. | **Instability & Brittleness.** Early versions were notorious for getting stuck in loops or making poor planning decisions. Highlights the critical need for robust loop control, planning validation, and failure recovery—problems we must solve directly. | **Cautionary Tale & Inspiration.** We embrace its vision of full autonomy but must engineer far greater reliability through structured planning (DAGs vs. simple lists), better termination logic, and systematic error handling. |\n| **OpenAI Assistants API / GPTs** | **Simplicity & Managed Infrastructure.** Provides a hosted, easy-to-use platform for creating agents with file search, code execution, and function calling. Handles much of the orchestration and context management automatically. | **Vendor Lock-in & Limited Control.** The agent loop and memory are opaque and controlled by the provider. It's difficult to implement custom planning logic, complex tool interactions, or fine-grained monitoring. Not a framework for building *systems*. | **Non-Goal.** Our framework is inherently multi-provider and requires deep, customizable control over the agent's internals for research and complex applications. We are building the *platform*, not a client for one. |\n| **CrewAI** | **Multi-Agent Specialization.** Explicitly models roles, goals, and backstories for collaborative agents. Good abstraction for defining workflows of specialized agents. | **Higher-Level Abstraction.** While good for orchestrating agent *crews*, it often builds upon other frameworks (like LangChain) for the core agent logic, potentially inheriting their complexities. Focuses more on choreography than the engine of a single agent. | **Inspiration for Milestone 5.** We will adopt its mental model of role-based specialization and task delegation but implement it within our own, more transparent agent core and communication protocol. |\n| **Raw LLM + Function Calling** | **Maximum Control & Simplicity.** Directly using an LLM provider's function-calling API with a handwritten loop offers complete transparency and minimal dependencies. | **Reinventing the Wheel.** Requires manually implementing planning, memory, error handling, and tool orchestration for any non-trivial task. Scales poorly and is error-prone. | **Foundation.** This is essentially the starting point for Milestone 2 (ReAct Loop). Our framework systematizes and extends this pattern with essential production-grade features. |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Build a Transparent, Modular Framework Over a Monolithic Library**\n> - **Context:** Learners and developers need to understand the internal mechanics of an AI agent, not just wire together opaque components. Existing libraries often hide critical logic, making debugging and customization difficult.\n> - **Options Considered:**\n>     1.  **Wrap an existing library (e.g., LangChain):** Provide a simplified interface over a complex, battle-tested codebase.\n>     2.  **Build a new, integrated monolithic framework:** Create a tightly-coupled system optimized for our specific use cases.\n>     3.  **Build a modular, explicit framework:** Design independent, composable components with clear interfaces and data flow.\n> - **Decision:** **Option 3: Build a modular, explicit framework.**\n> - **Rationale:** The primary goal is *educational clarity* and *architectural control*. A modular design forces clean separation of concerns (Tools, Planning, Memory, Loop), making each component's responsibility and data model explicit. This allows learners to understand, implement, and test each piece in isolation. It also accommodates future evolution, as components can be swapped (e.g., different memory backends, planning algorithms) without breaking the entire system.\n> - **Consequences:** We must design and document clear interfaces between components. There will be some initial overhead compared to using a pre-built library, but the resulting system will be more debuggable, customizable, and pedagogically valuable.\n\nThe following table summarizes the key design trade-offs we are consciously making:\n\n| Design Choice | Our Approach | Rationale & Consequence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Modularity** | High - Strict separation between Tool, Planning, Memory, and Loop components. | **Pro:** Enables testing, understanding, and replacement in isolation. **Con:** Requires careful interface design and more initial \"glue\" code. |\n| **Transparency** | Data flow and state are explicit, logged, and inspectable. | **Pro:** Essential for debugging and learning. Agents are not black boxes. **Con:** Slightly more complex API surface than a single `run()` call. |\n| **Control** | The developer defines the loop, plans, and memory strategies. | **Pro:** Enables fine-tuning for specific reliability and safety needs. **Con:** More responsibility on the framework user; less \"magic.\" |\n| **Provider Agnosticism** | Core framework is LLM-agnostic; providers are injected via a standard interface. | **Pro:** Avoids vendor lock-in and allows benchmarking. **Con:** Must abstract over differences in function-calling formats and tokenization. |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nWhile this section is primarily conceptual, establishing a solid project foundation is critical. Here is the recommended starting structure and core type definitions.\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations Table**\n\n| Component | Simple Option (For Learning/MVP) | Advanced / Production Option |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Core Language & Runtime** | Python 3.11+ with `asyncio` | Python 3.11+ with `asyncio`; consider `anyio` for advanced task pools. |\n| **LLM Provider Interface** | Direct HTTP calls via `httpx` to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs. | Abstract `LLMProvider` class supporting multiple backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local via `llama.cpp`). |\n| **Serialization & Validation** | Pydantic V2 for data models and basic validation. | Pydantic V2 + `typeguard` for runtime type checks in performance-critical paths. |\n| **Logging & Observability** | Python `logging` module with JSON formatting. | `structlog` for structured logging, integrated with OpenTelemetry for traces. |\n\n**B.

Infrastructure Starter Code: Core Data Types**\n\nThese Pydantic models form the backbone of the framework's state and communication. Place them in `archon/core/state.py`.\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Union\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass ToolResultStatus(str, Enum):\n    \"\"\"Status of a tool execution.\"\"\"\n    SUCCESS = \"success\"\n    ERROR = \"error\"  # Permanent failure\n    TIMEOUT = \"timeout\"\n\nclass ToolResult(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Structured result from a tool execution.\"\"\"\n    content: str = Field(description=\"Textual result for the LLM.\")\n    status: ToolResultStatus = Field(default=ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS)\n    error_message: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"Populated if status is ERROR or TIMEOUT.\")\n    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description=\"Additional structured data (e.g., raw API response).\")\n\nclass SubTaskStatus(str, Enum):\n    \"\"\"Status of a subtask within a plan.\"\"\"\n    PENDING = \"pending\"\n    EXECUTING = \"executing\"\n    COMPLETED = \"completed\"\n    FAILED = \"failed\"\n    BLOCKED = \"blocked\"  # Waiting on a dependency\n\nclass SubTask(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A single, actionable step within a larger Task or Plan.\"\"\"\n    id: str = Field(description=\"Unique identifier for the subtask.\")\n    description: str = Field(description=\"Natural language description of what to do.\")\n    expected_output: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"What a successful completion looks like.\")\n    tool_name: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"Name of the tool to execute, if applicable.\")\n    tool_args: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(default=None, description=\"Arguments for the tool.\")\n    dependencies: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of `SubTask.id` that must complete before this one.\")\n    status: SubTaskStatus = Field(default=SubTaskStatus.PENDING)\n    result: Optional[ToolResult] = Field(default=None, description=\"Result after execution.\")\n\nclass Task(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"A user's high-level request, which may be decomposed into SubTasks.\"\"\"\n    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: f\"task_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}\")\n    original_query: str = Field(description=\"The user's initial request.\")\n    goal: str = Field(description=\"Refined, actionable objective.\")\n    subtasks: List[SubTask] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"The decomposition of this task.\")\n    context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict, description=\"Shared state/data across subtasks.\")\n\nclass AgentState(str, Enum):\n    \"\"\"High-level state of the Agent Core.\"\"\"\n    IDLE = \"idle\"\n    PLANNING = \"planning\"\n    EXECUTING = \"executing\"  # In the ReAct loop for a subtask\n    REPLANNING = \"replanning\"\n    FINISHED = \"finished\"\n    ERROR = \"error\"\n```\n\n**D. Core Logic Skeleton Code: The Agent's Main Loop**\n\nThis is a high-level skeleton for the Agent Core's main entry point (`archon/core/agent.py`). The detailed ReAct loop will be built in Milestone 2.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom archon.core.state import Task, AgentState\nfrom archon.planning.planner import Planner\nfrom archon.tools.base import ToolRegistry\n\nclass Agent:\n    \"\"\"The central controller for an autonomous AI agent.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, planner: Planner, tool_registry: ToolRegistry):\n        self.planner = planner\n        self.tools = tool_registry\n        self.state: AgentState = AgentState.IDLE\n        self.current_task: Optional[Task] = None\n\n    async def run_task(self, user_query: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Primary public method: takes a user query and returns a final answer.\n        This orchestrates the high-level flow: Plan -> Execute (ReAct) -> Return.\n        \"\"\"\n        # TODO 1: Transition state from IDLE to PLANNING.\n        # TODO 2: Use the planner to decompose the user_query into a Task object with subtasks.\n        # TODO 3: Transition state to EXECUTING.\n        # TODO 4: For each subtask in the plan (respecting dependencies):\n        #     a. Execute the subtask using the _execute_subtask method (which will run the ReAct loop).\n        #     b. If a subtask fails, trigger replanning (transition to REPLANNING, then back to EXECUTING).\n        # TODO 5: When all subtasks are complete, compile a final answer from the results.\n        # TODO 6: Transition state to FINISHED and return the final answer.\n        # TODO 7: Throughout, handle exceptions and transition to ERROR state if unrecoverable.\n        pass\n\n    async def _execute_subtask(self, subtask: SubTask) -> ToolResult:\n        \"\"\"\n        Executes a single subtask using the ReAct loop.\n        This is the core of Milestone 2.\n        \"\"\"\n        # TODO: This will be implemented in detail later.\n        # It will involve:\n        # 1. Setting up the LLM prompt with context, tools, and the subtask description.\n        # 2. Running the Think -> Act -> Observe loop.\n        # 3. Returning a structured ToolResult.\n        pass\n```\n\n**E. Language-Specific Hints (Python)**\n*   Use `asyncio` from the start for all I/O (LLM calls, tool execution). This is non-negotiable for performance in multi-tool or multi-agent scenarios.\n*   **Type Hint Everything:** Use Python's type hints (`str`, `List[SubTask]`, `Optional[ToolResult]`) combined with Pydantic for runtime validation and excellent IDE support.\n*   Use `Enum` for states (like `AgentState`, `SubTaskStatus`) to avoid string typos and make code more readable.\n*   For the project structure, use a `pyproject.toml` with `[project]` and `[build-system]` sections (modern Python standard). Specify dependencies like `pydantic>=2.5`, `httpx`, `openai`.\n\n---\n\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n## 2. Goals and Non-Goals\n\nThis section defines the explicit requirements the framework must satisfy and clearly outlines what is out of scope to bound the project. Establishing these boundaries is critical for a project of this complexity—without them, scope creep and unclear expectations would inevitably derail development. We approach this by first defining what the framework **must** achieve (functional and non-functional goals), then explicitly stating what it **will not** do (non-goals). This clarity ensures that all engineering effort is focused on solving the core problem: building a robust, extensible system where an AI agent can reliably translate high-level goals into a sequence of tool-using actions.\n\n### 2.1 Functional Goals\n\nFunctional goals define the core capabilities the framework must deliver. Each goal maps directly to one of the five project milestones and addresses a specific aspect of the **Semantic Gap**—the disconnect between an LLM's natural language reasoning and the structured world of executable software tools. The framework succeeds when an **AI Executive** can autonomously navigate this gap to accomplish complex, multi-step tasks.\n\n> **Design Insight:** Think of functional goals as the \"job description\" for the framework. Just as you would hire an executive by evaluating their ability to plan, delegate, and adapt, we evaluate the framework by its ability to perform these cognitive functions through code.\n\nThe table below enumerates the primary functional requirements, organized by the milestone they originate from and the core capability they enable.\n\n| Milestone | Core Capability | Functional Goal | Success Criteria (How We Measure It) |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **1: Tool System** | **Action Execution** | Provide a standardized, safe interface for the agent to interact with the external world. | The agent can correctly invoke any registered tool with validated parameters, receive structured results, and handle execution failures gracefully. |\n| | **Extensibility** | Allow new capabilities to be added at runtime without modifying the core agent logic. | A developer can write a new Python class implementing the `Tool` interface, register it, and the agent immediately recognizes and can use it. |\n| **2: ReAct Loop** | **Reasoned Decision-Making** | Implement the core cognitive cycle where the agent reasons about a situation, selects an action, observes the outcome, and repeats. | For a given query (e.g., \"What's the weather in Tokyo and translate the summary to French?\"), the agent produces a coherent chain of thought, tool calls, and observations leading to a correct final answer. |\n| | **Structured Output Handling** | Reliably parse the LLM's free-form text output into structured tool-calling instructions. | The action parser successfully extracts `tool_name` and `tool_args` from LLM responses 95%+ of the time, with clear error fallbacks for malformed outputs. |\n| **3: Planning & Decomposition** | **Complex Task Breakdown** | Automatically decompose a high-level, ambiguous user goal into a concrete sequence (or graph) of executable subtasks. | Given \"Plan a 3-day trip to Paris,\" the agent produces a logical DAG of subtasks like \"Research flights,\" \"Find hotels near attractions,\" and \"Create daily itinerary.\" |\n| | **Adaptive Execution** | Execute subtasks in correct dependency order, detect failures, and re-plan when the initial approach fails. | If a \"Book hotel\" subtask fails due to no availability, the agent replans to \"Search for alternative hotels\" or \"Adjust travel dates\" without human intervention. |\n| **4: Memory & Context** | **Context Retention** | Maintain, retrieve, and manage conversation history and task state across multiple interaction turns. | In a multi-turn dialogue, the agent remembers user preferences stated earlier (e.g., \"I'm vegetarian\") and uses them to filter restaurant recommendations in later steps. |\n| | **Relevant Recall** | Retrieve semantically relevant past experiences from long-term storage to inform current reasoning. | When asked \"How do I debug a Python segmentation fault?\", the agent retrieves and references a past conversation where the user successfully used `gdb` for C++ debugging. |\n| **5: Multi-Agent Collaboration** | **Specialized Coordination** | Enable multiple agents with different roles to work together on a single task through structured communication. | A \"Research & Write\" task is automatically decomposed: a `ResearcherAgent` finds sources, a `WriterAgent` drafts content, and an `EditorAgent` reviews for clarity, all coordinated by an `Orchestrator`. |\n| | **Conflict Resolution** | Merge or adjudicate contradictory outputs from different agents into a coherent final result. | When two `CoderAgent` instances propose different implementations, the `Orchestrator` applies a defined strategy (e.g., choose the simpler one, merge features, or ask for clarification). |\n\nThese functional goals combine to create a complete **AI Executive** system. The agent can perceive a goal (via user query), formulate a plan (decomposition), execute the plan through a cycle of reasoning and tool use (ReAct), while drawing on both immediate context and past experience (memory), and if needed, delegate parts of the work to specialized peers (multi-agent collaboration). The ultimate functional goal is encapsulated in the primary public API method: `Agent.run_task(user_query: str) -> str`, which must return a useful, actionable result for any well-formed query within the system's capability boundaries.\n\n### 2.2 Non-Functional Goals\n\nNon-functional goals define the *quality attributes* of the system—how it should behave, rather than what it does. These are critical for the framework's usability, maintainability, and safety in production-like scenarios. A system that meets all functional goals but is brittle, opaque, or dangerous would fail as a foundation for building reliable AI agents.\n\n> **Mental Model: The Framework as Public Infrastructure.** Think of the framework as a city's electrical grid. Functional goals ensure it delivers power (the lights turn on). Non-functional goals ensure it's reliable during storms, extensible for new neighborhoods, safe to avoid electrocution, and maintainable so engineers can fix outages quickly. All are equally vital for public trust.\n\n| Quality Attribute | Goal | Rationale & Concrete Measurement |\n|-------------------|------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Extensibility** | The framework must allow new components (tools, memory backends, planning strategies) to be added with minimal changes to existing code. | **Rationale:** AI capabilities evolve rapidly; the framework must not become a bottleneck. **Measurement:** A developer can add a new tool by creating a single Python class and registering it, without modifying any core framework files. |\n| **Safety & Guardrails** | The agent must operate within defined safety boundaries, with mechanisms to prevent harmful, unauthorized, or infinitely looping actions. | **Rationale:** Autonomous tool use carries inherent risk (e.g., deleting files, making unauthorized API calls). **Measurement:** All tool executions are wrapped with timeouts, permission checks (if configured), and a maximum iteration limit for the ReAct loop. Critical tools (e.g., file write, shell exec) require explicit opt-in. |\n| **Debuggability & Observability** | The internal state and decision-making process of the agent must be inspectable at runtime, with structured logs tracing the complete thought-action chain. | **Rationale:** AI agents are non-deterministic; when they fail, developers need clear visibility into *why*. **Measurement:** Every agent run produces a chronological log of `Thought`, `Action`, `Observation` tuples, and the state of the task DAG is queryable at any point. |\n| **Performance & Latency** | The framework should minimize overhead, allowing the agent's speed to be bounded primarily by LLM API latency and tool execution time. | **Rationale:** Complex tasks may require dozens of LLM calls and tool invocations; inefficient framework code would make tasks impractically slow. **Measurement:** Framework overhead (parsing, state management, memory retrieval) adds <100ms per agent iteration. Independent subtasks can execute in parallel when dependencies allow. |\n| **LLM Agnosticism** | The core agent logic should be decoupled from any specific LLM provider or API, allowing easy swapping of models (GPT-4, Claude, open-source, etc.). | **Rationale:** LLM landscape is competitive and evolving; lock-in is undesirable. **Measurement:** The LLM interface is abstracted behind a generic `LLMClient` class; switching providers requires changing only configuration, not core agent code. |\n| **Modularity & Clean Boundaries** | Components (Tool System, Memory, Planner) must have well-defined interfaces and minimal cross-dependencies, allowing them to be tested, developed, and replaced in isolation. | **Rationale:** Enables incremental development (per our milestones) and allows users to customize or replace components (e.g., use a different vector database). **Measurement:** Each component's public interface is documented and has <3 direct dependencies on other framework components. |\n| **Error Resilience** | The system must degrade gracefully when components fail (LLM unavailable, tool times out, network error) and provide clear, actionable error messages to the calling application. | **Rationale:** In a distributed, API-dependent system, failures are inevitable. **Measurement:** Tool failures are caught and presented as structured `ToolResult` with `ERROR` status; the agent can replan. LLM API errors trigger retries with exponential backoff. No unhandled exception should crash the entire agent process. |\n\nThese non-functional goals are not afterthoughts—they are first-class design constraints that will shape the architecture. For instance, **safety** drives the design of the tool execution engine with sandboxing and timeouts. **Debuggability** leads to the structured logging of the entire ReAct loop. **Modularity** justifies the clear separation between the Planner, Memory, and Tool System components.\n\n### 2.3 Explicit Non-Goals\n\nExplicitly stating what the framework will **not** do is equally important. It sets realistic expectations, prevents scope creep, and allows the team to focus on the core value proposition. A common pitfall in ambitious projects is trying to solve every related problem, resulting in a bloated, half-finished system.\n\n> **Design Principle: Sharp Boundaries Foster Focus.** A sculptor removes marble to reveal the statue. Similarly, we define non-goals to chisel away peripheral concerns, leaving a sharp, focused framework that excels at its primary mission: autonomous task execution via LLM-driven planning and tool use.\n\n| Non-Goal | Explanation & Rationale | What We Might Do Instead |\n|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Train or fine-tune LLM models** | The framework is a *consumer* of LLMs, not a model trainer. We assume a capable pre-trained LLM is available via API or local inference. | We will provide interfaces for popular LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) and local inference servers (vLLM, Ollama), but the training/fine-tuning process is entirely out of scope. |\n| **Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) or chatbot frontend** | The framework is a backend library/engine. It provides a programmatic API (`Agent.run_task()`). Building web UIs, Discord bots, or mobile apps is left to the application layer. | We will ensure the API is clean and well-documented so that others can easily build UIs on top. Example CLI drivers may be provided for testing, but they are not the primary deliverable. |\n| **Guarantee 100% safety or prevent all misuse** | While we will implement significant guardrails (timeouts, permission checks), we cannot eliminate all risk from autonomous AI systems. Malicious users or poorly designed tools can still cause harm. | We will design for \"safety by default\" (tools are opt-in, sandboxed where possible) and provide clear warnings and configuration knobs for dangerous operations. Ultimate responsibility lies with the developer integrating the framework. |\n| **Solve general artificial intelligence (AGI)** | The framework orchestrates LLM reasoning and tool use; it does not create new cognitive capabilities. The agent's intelligence is bounded by the underlying LLM's capabilities and the tools provided. | We focus on the *orchestration* problem: effectively using the capabilities that LLMs and tools already provide. Breakthroughs in LLM reasoning must come from model research, not our framework. |\n| **Replace human judgment in critical domains** | The framework is an augmentation tool, not an autonomous decision-maker for high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis, legal advice, or financial trading without human oversight. | We will include features like human-in-the-loop confirmation for specific tool calls (a future extension), but the base framework assumes the agent operates autonomously within its defined sandbox. |\n| **Handle multi-modal inputs/outputs natively (images, audio, video)** | The initial framework is designed for text-centric tasks. While tools could be built to process images/audio, the core agent reasoning, memory, and communication are text-based. | The architecture can be extended later to support multi-modal LLMs and tools, but for Milestones 1-5, we assume textual interaction. |\n| **Provide built-in tools for every possible domain** | We will include a few illustrative built-in tools (calculator, web search, safe code execution). However, we will not build hundreds of domain-specific tools (e.g., for CRM, accounting, CAD). | The framework's value is in enabling *others* to build tools easily. We will focus on making the tool interface and registry exceptionally simple and powerful. |\n| **Manage infrastructure scaling (load balancing, Kubernetes)** | The framework is a library that runs within a single process. Scaling horizontally to handle thousands of concurrent agent sessions is an application/deployment concern. | We will ensure the framework is stateless where possible (persisting state via provided memory interfaces) to facilitate scaling by the embedding application. |\n\nBy declaring these non-goals, we make intentional trade-offs. We choose depth over breadth, focusing on creating the best possible *engine* for AI autonomy, not the entire *vehicle*. This allows us to invest engineering effort where it matters most: robust loops, clean abstractions, and reliable execution—the foundations upon which countless AI agent applications can be built.\n\n---\n\n\n## 3. High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThis section presents the architectural blueprint for Project Archon—the high-level component structure, their responsibilities, and the flow of control and data between them. Before diving into the intricate details of each subsystem, we establish the mental model of how the entire framework fits together as a cohesive unit capable of transforming vague user requests into concrete, executed actions.\n\nAt its core, the framework must bridge the **semantic gap** between the natural language reasoning of an LLM and the structured, deterministic world of software tools. It does this by constructing an **AI Executive**—an entity that can receive a high-level goal, formulate a plan, delegate work to specialized capabilities (tools), track progress, adapt to failures, and ultimately deliver a result. This executive is not monolithic but composed of five interacting pillars, each with a clear separation of concerns.\n\n### Component Overview\n\nThink of the framework as a modern corporate office building. Each floor houses a specialized department with its own expertise and workflows, yet they all work together under shared leadership to accomplish complex projects. The blueprints for this building are captured in the system component diagram below.\n\n![System Component Diagram](./diagrams/diagram-system-component.svg)\n\n**Table 3.1: The Five Pillars of the AI Executive**\n\n| Component | Mental Model | Primary Responsibility | Key Data It Owns |\n|-----------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Agent Core** | The CEO's Office | The central coordination point and public API. Manages the agent's overall state, orchestrates the flow between Planner, ReAct Loop, and Memory, and serves as the entry point for task execution. | `AgentState` enum, current `Task` object, configuration settings (LLM client, timeouts, limits). |\n| **Tool System** | The Workshop & Tool Shed | Provides the agent's \"hands\" — a dynamic registry of executable capabilities. Handles tool discovery, parameter validation, safe execution, and result formatting. | Registry of all registered `Tool` instances, execution history, tool configuration (timeouts, permissions). |\n| **Planner** | The Project Management Office (PMO) | Breaks down ambiguous, high-level goals into a concrete sequence (or graph) of actionable steps. Creates, manages, and optionally revises the execution plan. | The `Plan` (a DAG of `SubTask` objects), dependency graph, plan execution status. |\n| **Memory System** | The Corporate Library & Whiteboards | Provides the agent with context. Manages short-term conversation history, the working state of the current task, and long-term knowledge from past interactions. | `ConversationMemory` buffer, `WorkingMemory` key-value store, `VectorStore` for semantic retrieval. |\n| **Orchestrator** (Multi-Agent) | The Corporate Headquarters | In multi-agent scenarios, this component manages a team of specialized agents. It handles role assignment, task delegation, inter-agent communication, and result aggregation. | Registry of `Agent` instances with their roles, `Message` queue/bus, delegation rules. |\n\n**The Agent Core: The Conductor of the Orchestra**\nThe Agent Core is the central nervous system. It exposes the primary `Agent.run_task(user_query: str) -> str` method that users call. Internally, it does not perform the reasoning or tool execution itself. Instead, it acts as a conductor:\n1.  **Receives the user's goal** and initializes a new `Task`.\n2.  **Invokes the Planner** to decompose the goal into a `Plan` (a list or DAG of `SubTask` objects).\n3.  **For each `SubTask`**, it triggers the **ReAct Loop Engine** to execute it (think -> act -> observe).\n4.  **Throughout this process**, it consults the **Memory System** to retrieve relevant context and store new observations.\n5.  **Manages the agent's lifecycle state** (`AgentState`: IDLE, PLANNING, EXECUTING, etc.), handling errors and transitioning between phases.\n\n**The Tool System: The Agent's Swiss Army Knife**\nTools are how the agent interacts with the external world. Each tool is a well-defined interface with a name, description, parameter schema (using JSON Schema), and an `execute` function. The Tool System's registry pattern allows capabilities to be added at runtime—imagine plugging a new attachment into a multi-tool. The system ensures safety via parameter validation, execution timeouts, and sandboxing where necessary (e.g., for code execution). Built-in tools provide foundational capabilities like web search, calculation, and file operations.\n\n**The Planner: The Strategic Mapmaker**\nWhen a user says \"Research the market and write a summary report,\" the Planner's job is to translate this into a sequence like: 1) Web search for \"current market trends Q3 2024,\" 2) Extract key points from search results, 3) Draft report outline, 4) Write introduction, etc. It models these steps as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, where some steps depend on the outputs of others. This allows for parallel execution of independent tasks and structured handling of failures.\n\n**The Memory System: Context as a Layered Cake**\nAn agent without memory is amnesic—it forgets the conversation history and past learnings after each interaction. Our Memory System has three distinct layers:\n*   **Episodic/Conversation Memory:** A simple, in-order buffer of the dialogue (user queries, agent thoughts, tool outputs). This is the agent's \"short-term recall\" of the current session.\n*   **Working Memory:** A scratchpad for the *current* task. It holds intermediate results, partial conclusions, and the state of the execution plan. Think of it as the whiteboard in a meeting room.\n*   **Long-Term Memory:** A vector database that stores embeddings of past interactions, facts, and outcomes. It allows the agent to perform semantic search (\"What did we learn about API X last week?\") and inject relevant past knowledge into new tasks, enabling learning across sessions.\n\n**The Orchestrator: The Manager of Specialists**\nFor complex tasks that benefit from specialization, the framework supports multiple agents. The Orchestrator assigns roles (e.g., Researcher, Writer, Coder) and coordinates them. It receives a high-level task, decomposes it, and routes subtasks to the agent whose advertised capabilities best match the requirement. It then manages the conversation between agents, collects their outputs, and synthesizes a final result. This enables a single \"virtual\" executive to leverage a team of specialized sub-agents.\n\n> **Key Architectural Insight:** The separation between the **Planner** (which decides *what* to do) and the **ReAct Loop Engine** (which figures out *how* to do each subtask) is critical. This mirrors human problem-solving: we first make a high-level plan (\"Go to the store, buy ingredients, then cook\"), and then for each step, we engage in moment-to-moment reasoning and action (\"To go to the store, I need my keys, then open the door, then start the car...\").\n\n### Interaction Flow\n\nTo understand how these components interact dynamically, let's trace the lifecycle of a single user query through a **single-agent** scenario: `\"What was the weather in Tokyo last Tuesday, and what's the current price of Bitcoin in JPY?\"`\n\n**Table 3.2: End-to-End Task Execution Flow**\n\n| Step | Component Involved | Action & Data Transformation |\n|------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| **1. Initiation** | User → Agent Core | The user calls `agent.run_task(\"Weather in Tokyo last Tues & BTC price in JPY\")`. The Agent Core creates a new `Task` object, assigns it a unique ID, sets the initial `AgentState` to `PLANNING`, and stores the original query. |\n| **2. Context Enrichment** | Agent Core → Memory System | Before planning, the Agent Core asks the Memory System: \"Given this query, what relevant past context should we include?\" The Memory System queries its vector store (long-term memory) for semantically similar past tasks (e.g., previous weather or crypto queries) and returns a few relevant memory snippets. |\n| **3. Task Decomposition** | Agent Core → Planner | The Agent Core passes the enriched query and context to the Planner. The Planner uses an LLM call with a specialized prompt to break the compound question into atomic subtasks. It outputs a `Plan` containing two independent `SubTask` objects: <br>1. `SubTask A`: Description=\"Get historical weather for Tokyo on [last Tuesday's date]\", tool=\"web_search\". <br>2. `SubTask B`: Description=\"Get current Bitcoin to Japanese Yen exchange rate\", tool=\"web_search\". <br>The Planner notes no dependencies between them, allowing parallel execution. |\n| **4. Plan Execution (Loop)** | Agent Core → ReAct Loop Engine | The Agent Core's state changes to `EXECUTING`. It identifies that Subtask A and B are independent and can be executed concurrently. It calls `_execute_subtask(subtask)` for each. |\n| **4a. ReAct for Subtask A** | ReAct Loop Engine → Tool System → LLM | For Subtask A, the ReAct Engine begins its cycle: <br>1. **THINK:** LLM is prompted with the subtask description, available tools, and context. It reasons: \"I need to find last Tuesday's date, then search for weather.\" <br>2. **ACT:** LLM outputs an action: `{\"tool\": \"calendar\", \"args\": {\"operation\": \"compute_date\", \"offset\": -7}}`. The parser validates and extracts this. <br>3. **OBSERVE:** Tool System executes the `calendar` tool, returns: \"Last Tuesday was 2024-04-09.\" This observation is fed back. <br>4. **THINK (again):** LLM reasons: \"Now I have the date, I can search.\" <br>5. **ACT:** Outputs: `{\"tool\": \"web_search\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"Tokyo weather April 9 2024\"}}`. <br>6. **OBSERVE:** Tool executes, returns a summary of weather data. The ReAct Loop detects this is a final answer for the subtask, packages it into a `ToolResult`, and returns. |\n| **4b. Parallel Execution** | Agent Core | While Subtask A is in its ReAct cycle, Subtask B begins its own, independent ReAct process, potentially using a different tool (like a financial API). |\n| **5. Result Synthesis** | Agent Core → Memory System | Both subtasks complete. The Agent Core aggregates their `ToolResult` contents. It then invokes the Memory System to store the entire interaction: the original query, the generated plan, tool calls, and final results are appended to the conversation memory and embedded into the long-term vector store for future retrieval. |\n| **6. Final Response** | Agent Core → User | The Agent Core formats the aggregated results into a coherent natural language answer: \"Last Tuesday (April 9), Tokyo had sunny skies with a high of 18°C. Currently, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately 8,450,000 Japanese Yen.\" It updates its `AgentState` to `FINISHED` and returns the final string to the user. |\n\n> **Design Principle: Structured Concurrency.** The Agent Core manages subtasks as concurrent units of work. Independent subtasks run in parallel (using Python's `asyncio`) to minimize latency, while dependent subtasks are sequenced according to their DAG. This makes efficient use of resources during I/O-bound operations like LLM calls and web requests.\n\nThe flow for a **multi-agent** scenario adds an extra layer of delegation. The Orchestrator acts as a meta-agent: it receives the task, performs its own decomposition, and then routes each subtask to the most suitable specialized agent (e.g., sending a research subtask to a `ResearcherAgent` and a writing subtask to a `WriterAgent`). Each of those agents then runs its own internal Agent Core flow (Plan → ReAct). The Orchestrator collects their results and synthesizes the final output.\n\n### Recommended File/Module Structure\n\nA well-organized codebase is paramount for maintainability and extensibility. The following Python package structure mirrors the component architecture, separating concerns and defining clear import boundaries. The `src/` layout is recommended for modern Python projects to avoid import confusion.\n\n```\nproject_archon/                      # Project root\n├── pyproject.toml                   # Build, dependencies, tooling config (Poetry/Pipenv)\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt                 # Optional: for pip\n│\n├── src/                             # Main source package\n│   └── archon/                      # Framework's top-level package\n│       ├── __init__.py              # Public API exports\n│       ├── agent/                   # Agent Core pillar\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── core.py              # Main Agent class with run_task()\n│       │   ├── state.py             # AgentState enum, state machine logic\n│       │   └── orchestrator.py      # Multi-agent Orchestrator (Milestone 5)\n│       │\n│       ├── tools/                   # Tool System pillar (Milestone 1)\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── base.py              # ToolBase class, ToolResult\n│       │   ├── registry.py          # ToolRegistry class\n│       │   ├── engine.py            # Tool execution engine with validation & safety\n│       │   └── builtins/            # Built-in tools\n│       │       ├── __init__.py\n│       │       ├── web_search.py\n│       │       ├── calculator.py\n│       │       └── code_executor.py\n│       │\n│       ├── planning/                # Planner pillar (Milestone 3)\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── planner.py           # Base Planner, LLMPlanner\n│       │   ├── plan.py              # Task, SubTask, SubTaskStatus, Plan (DAG) classes\n│       │   └── executor.py          # Plan execution engine (topological sort, parallel)\n│       │\n│       ├── memory/                  # Memory System pillar (Milestone 4)\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── base.py              # Base memory interfaces\n│       │   ├── conversation.py      # Episodic/conversation memory buffer\n│       │   ├── working.py           # Working memory (key-value for task state)\n│       │   ├── long_term/           # Long-term memory with vector store\n│       │   │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   │   ├── vector_store.py  # Abstract interface & implementations (Chroma, FAISS)\n│       │   │   └── retriever.py     # Semantic retriever logic\n│       │   └── summarizer.py        # Context window summarization/compression\n│       │\n│       ├── engine/                  # ReAct Loop Engine pillar (Milestone 2)\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── react.py             # ReActAgent class, loop controller\n│       │   ├── parser.py            # Action parsing strategies (regex, JSON)\n│       │   └── prompts.py           # ReAct and planning prompt templates\n│       │\n│       ├── llm/                     # LLM abstraction layer\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── client.py            # Base LLMClient, adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.\n│       │   └── schemas.py           # Common message/response structures\n│       │\n│       ├── messaging/               # Multi-agent communication (Milestone 5)\n│       │   ├── __init__.py\n│       │   ├── message.py           # Message class, message bus interface\n│       │   └── bus.py               # In-memory or Redis-based message bus\n│       │\n│       └── utils/                   # Shared utilities\n│           ├── __init__.py\n│           ├── logging.py           # Structured JSON logging\n│           └── validation.py        # Shared validation helpers\n│\n├── tests/                           # Comprehensive test suite\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── conftest.py\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   ├── test_tools.py\n│   │   ├── test_react_engine.py\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   ├── test_agent_workflow.py\n│   │   └── ...\n│   └── e2e/\n│       └── test_full_agent.py\n│\n└── examples/                        Example scripts and notebooks\n    ├── single_agent_demo.py\n    ├── multi_agent_chat.py\n    └── custom_tool_integration.ipynb\n```\n\n**Key Structural Decisions:**\n\n1.  **Pillar-Centric Modules (`agent/`, `tools/`, `planning/`, etc.)**: Each major component lives in its own directory, encapsulating its related classes and functions. This makes the codebase navigable and aligns with the architectural diagram.\n2.  **Clear Public API via `archon/__init__.py`**: This top-level file should expose the key classes users need to get started, e.g., `from archon import Agent, Tool, ToolRegistry`. Implementation details are kept internal.\n3.  **Separate `llm/` Layer**: Abstracting the LLM provider behind a common `LLMClient` interface ensures the framework is not locked into a single vendor and makes testing with mock LLMs straightforward.\n4.  **Dedicated `tests/` Hierarchy**: Mirroring the `src/` structure with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests supports the testing pyramid strategy outlined later in the document.\n\nThis structure provides a solid foundation that can scale as new tools, memory backends, or planning strategies are developed. Contributors know exactly where to add new functionality, and the separation of concerns minimizes unintended coupling between components.\n\n---\n\n\n## 4. Data Model\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThe data model forms the backbone of our framework—it's the DNA that defines how information flows, how state is tracked, and how components communicate. Without a well-designed data model, even the most sophisticated algorithms become brittle spaghetti code. This section defines the core types, their fields, and their relationships, providing the structural foundation for all five milestones.\n\nThink of the data model as **the standardized paperwork of our AI Executive's office**. Just as a well-run company uses consistent forms for purchase orders (with fields for item, quantity, vendor) and employee records (with name, role, contact info), our framework needs standardized data structures for tools, tasks, memories, and agent states. This consistency ensures that when the Planner hands off a task to the ReAct Engine, both understand exactly what \"task status\" means; when the Memory System retrieves a past conversation, it returns it in a format the Agent Core can immediately use.\n\n### Core Types and Enums\n\nBelow are the foundational data types that appear throughout the framework. Each is presented as a table showing all fields, their types, and detailed descriptions. These types are **immutable by design**—once created, their fields shouldn't be modified directly. Instead, we create new instances with updated values (functional updates) to maintain predictable state transitions and avoid subtle bugs from shared mutable state.\n\n#### Agent State Enum\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `AgentState` | `Enum` | The high-level operational state of an agent instance. This is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and controlling agent execution. |\n| `IDLE` | Enum value | Agent is initialized but not currently processing any task. This is the starting state after agent creation. |\n| `PLANNING` | Enum value | Agent is decomposing a high-level goal into a plan (Task with SubTasks). The LLM is generating the initial breakdown. |\n| `EXECUTING` | `Enum` value | Agent is actively running the ReAct loop on one or more subtasks. This is the main \"working\" state. |\n| `REPLANNING` | `Enum` value | A subtask has failed or new information requires the agent to adjust its plan. The LLM is generating a revised plan. |\n| `FINISHED` | `Enum` value | All subtasks are completed (or the agent determined the goal is satisfied). The final answer is ready. |\n| `ERROR` | `Enum` value | An unrecoverable system error occurred (e.g., LLM API failure, critical tool crash). Execution is halted. |\n\n> **Design Insight**: We intentionally separate `EXECUTING` from `PLANNING` and `REPLANNING` because these are fundamentally different cognitive modes for the LLM. During planning, the LLM thinks about structure and dependencies; during execution, it focuses on concrete tool usage. Tracking this distinction helps with debugging—if an agent is stuck in `EXECUTING` for too long, we know the issue is with tool execution, not plan generation.\n\n#### Tool Result Types\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `ToolResultStatus` | `Enum` | The outcome category of a tool execution. This drives error recovery logic—`ERROR` might trigger retry, while `TIMEOUT` might skip the tool entirely. |\n| `SUCCESS` | Enum value | Tool executed without errors and produced valid output. |\n| `ERROR` | Enum value | Tool execution failed due to a business logic error (e.g., \"divide by zero\" for calculator, \"website not found\" for web search). |\n| `TIMEOUT` | Enum value | Tool execution exceeded its allotted time limit and was forcibly terminated. |\n| `ToolResult` | `DataClass` | The complete output from executing a tool, including status, content, and metadata. This is what gets passed back to the LLM as an observation. |\n| `content` | `str` | The primary output text from the tool, formatted for LLM consumption. For a web search tool, this would be the summarized results; for a calculator, the numeric answer. Always present, even for errors (contains error description). |\n| `status` | `ToolResultStatus` | Categorical outcome (SUCCESS, ERROR, TIMEOUT). |\n| `error_message` | `Optional[str]` | Detailed error description if status is ERROR or TIMEOUT. For SUCCESS, this is `None`. |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Additional structured data from the tool execution that isn't part of the LLM-visible content. Examples: raw API response, execution duration, token usage, confidence scores. Used for logging, analytics, and advanced recovery logic. |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The `ToolResult` deliberately separates `content` (for the LLM) from `metadata` (for the system). This prevents the LLM from being overwhelmed with technical details while preserving debug information. The metadata field uses `Dict[str, Any]` for extensibility—different tools can include tool-specific metadata without changing the core type.\n\n#### Task and SubTask Types\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `SubTaskStatus` | `Enum` | The lifecycle state of an individual subtask within a larger plan. This enables dependency tracking—a subtask can only execute when all its dependencies are `COMPLETED`. |\n| `PENDING` | Enum value | Subtask has been created but hasn't started execution. All dependencies are satisfied, but it's waiting its turn in the execution queue. |\n| `EXECUTING` | Enum value | Subtask is currently being processed by the ReAct loop. The agent is thinking, acting, and observing for this specific subtask. |\n| `COMPLETED` | Enum value | Subtask finished successfully. Its `result` field contains the `ToolResult`. |\n| `FAILED` | Enum value | Subtask execution failed after all retries. The `result` contains the error details. |\n| `BLOCKED` | Enum value | Subtask cannot start because one or more dependencies are not yet `COMPLETED`. The system will periodically re-evaluate blocked subtasks. |\n| `SubTask` | `DataClass` | A single, atomic unit of work within a larger Task. This is the fundamental building block of agent plans. |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier (UUID recommended). Used for referencing in dependencies and tracking execution. |\n| `description` | `str` | Human-readable description of what this subtask should accomplish. This is what the LLM sees when deciding which tool to use. Example: \"Search the web for current temperature in Tokyo.\" |\n| `expected_output` | `Optional[str]` | The anticipated format or content of the result. Used for validation and for guiding the LLM. Example: \"A single temperature value in Celsius.\" |\n| `tool_name` | `Optional[str]` | The name of the tool to execute (must match a registered tool). For planning-only subtasks (like \"decide which tools to use\"), this may be `None`. |\n| `tool_args` | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | The arguments to pass to the tool, validated against the tool's JSON Schema. Must be `None` if `tool_name` is `None`. |\n| `dependencies` | `List[str]` | List of `SubTask.id` values that must complete before this subtask can start. Empty list means no dependencies. |\n| `status` | `SubTaskStatus` | Current lifecycle state. Initially `PENDING` or `BLOCKED` (if dependencies exist). |\n| `result` | `Optional[ToolResult]` | The output from executing this subtask. `None` until the subtask completes (successfully or otherwise). |\n| `Task` | `DataClass` | A complete unit of work representing a user's original query. Contains the goal, all subtasks, and execution context. |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the task (UUID recommended). Used for logging and correlating related activities. |\n| `original_query` | `str` | The exact text the user submitted. Preserved for reference and for inclusion in memory. |\n| `goal` | `str` | The refined, actionable objective derived from the original query. May be rephrased by the planner for clarity. Example: Original query \"What's the weather?\" becomes goal \"Determine current temperature and conditions in the user's location.\" |\n| `subtasks` | `List[SubTask]` | The decomposed steps to achieve the goal, in dependency order. This is the plan created by the Planner component. |\n| `context` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Arbitrary key-value data shared across all subtasks. Used to pass intermediate results between subtasks. Example: After subtask \"Get user location\" completes, it stores `{\"location\": \"Tokyo\"}` in context, which subtask \"Get Tokyo weather\" can read. |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The separation between `Task` (the overall objective) and `SubTask` (individual steps) mirrors the distinction between a project charter and individual tickets in a project management system. This separation is crucial for **replanning**—when a subtask fails, we can regenerate just the remaining subtasks while preserving the original `Task.id` and `original_query` for continuity.\n\n#### Memory Types\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `MemoryEntry` | `DataClass` | A single unit of stored memory, whether in short-term conversation history or long-term vector store. |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier (UUID recommended). |\n| `content` | `str` | The textual content to remember. For conversation history, this is the exact message; for long-term facts, it's a summarized statement. |\n| `timestamp` | `datetime` | When this memory was created or last accessed. Used for recency-based retrieval. |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Additional context: `{\"type\": \"user_message\"}`, `{\"tool_used\": \"web_search\"}`, `{\"importance_score\": 0.8}`, etc. |\n| `embedding` | `Optional[List[float]]` | Vector representation of the content for semantic search. `None` for entries in non-vector stores (like simple conversation buffer). |\n| `Message` | `DataClass` | A structured communication between agents in a multi-agent system. This is the envelope that carries requests, responses, and notifications. |\n| `sender_id` | `str` | Identifier of the sending agent. |\n| `receiver_id` | `str` | Identifier of the intended recipient agent. Use \"broadcast\" for messages to all agents. |\n| `message_type` | `str` | Category: \"task_request\", \"task_response\", \"notification\", \"error\". |\n| `content` | `Dict[str, Any]` | The payload. Structure varies by type: for \"task_request\", contains `{\"task\": Task, \"deadline\": ...}`; for \"task_response\", contains `{\"result\": ToolResult}`. |\n| `timestamp` | `datetime` | When the message was sent. |\n| `correlation_id` | `Optional[str]` | For linking requests to responses (like a session ID). |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The `MemoryEntry` uses an optional `embedding` field rather than requiring it for all entries because different storage backends have different needs. The conversation buffer (short-term memory) doesn't need embeddings since it just stores sequential messages; the vector store (long-term memory) requires them for similarity search. Making it optional avoids unnecessary computation for non-vector memories.\n\n#### Additional Supporting Types\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `Tool` | `Interface` | The abstract definition of a capability available to the agent. Not a data class but a behavioral contract. |\n| `name` | `str` (property) | Unique, descriptive name (e.g., \"web_search\", \"calculator\"). Used by the LLM to select the tool. |\n| `description` | `str` (property) | Natural language explanation of what the tool does and when to use it. Critical for LLM tool selection. |\n| `parameters_schema` | `Dict[str, Any]` (property) | JSON Schema defining the expected arguments. Example: `{\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"query\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}`. |\n| `execute` | `Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], ToolResult]` (method) | The function that runs when the tool is invoked. Takes validated arguments, returns `ToolResult`. |\n| `Plan` | `DataClass` | Alternative representation of a Task focused on execution. Essentially a Task viewed through the lens of its dependency graph. |\n| `task_id` | `str` | References the parent `Task.id`. |\n| `subtask_dag` | `Dict[str, List[str]]` | Adjacency list representation: `{subtask_id: [dependency_id1, dependency_id2, ...]}`. |\n| `execution_order` | `List[str]` | Topologically sorted list of `SubTask.id`s for sequential execution. Computed from the DAG. |\n\n### Entity Relationships\n\nThe core entities don't exist in isolation—they form a web of relationships that define how the framework operates. Understanding these relationships is key to implementing correct data flow between components.\n\n![Core Data Model Relationships](./diagrams/diagram-data-model.svg)\n\n#### Primary Relationships\n\n1. **Agent ⇄ State ⇄ Task**\n   - **Relationship**: An **Agent** has a current `AgentState` and executes exactly one **Task** at a time (though it may queue multiple tasks).\n   - **Data flow**: When a user submits a query via `Agent.run_task()`, the agent transitions from `IDLE` → `PLANNING` and creates a new `Task` instance. During execution, the agent's state cycles between `EXECUTING` and `REPLANNING` as it works through the task's subtasks. When all subtasks are `COMPLETED`, the agent transitions to `FINISHED`.\n\n2. **Task ⇄ SubTask (Plan)**\n   - **Relationship**: A **Task** is composed of multiple **SubTask** instances arranged in a dependency graph (Directed Acyclic Graph).\n   - **Structural pattern**: This is a **whole-part relationship** (composition). The Task owns its subtasks—if a Task is deleted, its subtasks are also deleted. The dependency graph is represented implicitly via each subtask's `dependencies` field (which lists other subtask IDs within the same Task).\n   - **Execution implication**: The Planner component creates this structure by decomposing the Task's `goal` into subtasks. The Plan Executor then processes subtasks in topological order based on their dependencies.\n\n3. **SubTask ⇄ Tool ⇄ ToolResult**\n   - **Relationship**: A **SubTask** invokes a **Tool** (via its `tool_name`), which produces a **ToolResult** stored in the subtask's `result` field.\n   - **Linking mechanism**: The `SubTask.tool_name` must match the `Tool.name` of a registered tool. The `SubTask.tool_args` must conform to the tool's `parameters_schema`. After execution, the `ToolResult` is attached to the subtask, completing its lifecycle.\n   - **Error handling**: If the tool returns `ToolResultStatus.ERROR`, the subtask's status becomes `FAILED`, which may trigger replanning at the Task level.\n\n4. **Agent ⇄ Memory System ⇄ MemoryEntry**\n   - **Relationship**: An **Agent** has access to a **Memory System** which stores and retrieves **MemoryEntry** instances.\n   - **Storage layers**: The memory system internally manages different storage backends:\n     - **Conversation Memory**: A sequential buffer of `MemoryEntry` instances representing the current session's dialogue (no embeddings needed).\n     - **Working Memory**: A key-value store (implemented as part of `Task.context`) for the current task's intermediate state.\n     - **Long-term Memory**: A vector store of `MemoryEntry` instances with computed `embedding` fields for semantic retrieval.\n   - **Retrieval flow**: During each ReAct loop iteration, the agent queries the memory system for relevant past experiences, which are injected into the LLM prompt as context.\n\n5. **Agent ⇄ Message ⇄ Agent (Multi-Agent)**\n   - **Relationship**: In a multi-agent system, **Agent** instances communicate by sending and receiving **Message** objects through a shared communication channel.\n   - **Orchestration patterns**:\n     - **Hierarchical**: An orchestrator agent sends `Message` objects with `message_type=\"task_request\"` to worker agents, who respond with `message_type=\"task_response\"`.\n     - **Broadcast**: An agent sends a message with `receiver_id=\"broadcast\"` that all agents receive.\n   - **Correlation**: The `correlation_id` field allows linking responses to specific requests, enabling complex conversational patterns between agents.\n\n#### State Lifecycle Examples\n\n**SubTask Status Transitions**:\n```\nPENDING → EXECUTING (when all dependencies are COMPLETED and executor picks it up)\nEXECUTING → COMPLETED (tool execution succeeds with ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS)\nEXECUTING → FAILED (tool execution fails after retries)\nPENDING → BLOCKED (system detects unresolved dependencies)\nBLOCKED → PENDING (when all dependencies become COMPLETED)\n```\n\n**Task Execution Flow**:\n1. User calls `Agent.run_task(\"Research AI ethics and write a summary\")`\n2. Agent creates `Task` with `id=\"task_123\"`, `original_query=\"Research AI ethics...\"`, `goal=\"Comprehensive AI ethics summary\"`\n3. Planner decomposes into subtasks:\n   - `SubTask(id=\"st1\", description=\"Search for recent AI ethics papers\", tool_name=\"web_search\", dependencies=[])`\n   - `SubTask(id=\"st2\", description=\"Extract key arguments from search results\", tool_name=\"text_analyzer\", dependencies=[\"st1\"])`\n   - `SubTask(id=\"st3\", description=\"Write 500-word summary\", tool_name=\"text_writer\", dependencies=[\"st2\"])`\n4. Executor processes subtasks in order: st1 → st2 → st3\n5. After st3 completes, Task is marked as finished, final answer compiled from all subtask results\n\n#### Data Model Design Principles\n\n> **Principle 1: Immutability Where Possible**\n> All core data classes (`ToolResult`, `SubTask`, `Task`, `MemoryEntry`, `Message`) should be treated as immutable records. When state needs to change (e.g., subtask status updates), create a new instance with the updated field. This prevents race conditions in concurrent execution and makes debugging easier—you can log the entire history of state changes.\n\n> **Principle 2: Optional Fields for Progressive Enhancement**\n> Many fields are `Optional` (like `SubTask.expected_output`, `MemoryEntry.embedding`) because they're only relevant in certain contexts or advanced configurations. This keeps the core data model simple while allowing extensibility.\n\n> **Principle 3: String IDs for Loose Coupling**\n> All relationships use string IDs (`SubTask.dependencies` lists IDs, not object references). This allows:\n> - Serialization to JSON for storage/transmission\n> - Loose coupling between components (Planner doesn't need actual SubTask objects, just their IDs)\n> - Easy debugging (IDs appear in logs)\n> The trade-off is an extra lookup step to resolve IDs to objects, but this is minimal compared to the benefits.\n\n> **Principle 4: Metadata Bags for Extensibility**\n> The `metadata` fields in `ToolResult` and `MemoryEntry` follow the \"bag of properties\" pattern. Instead of adding specific fields for every possible piece of auxiliary data (which would cause constant type changes), we use a dictionary. Different components can agree on conventions for metadata keys (e.g., `\"token_usage\"`, `\"confidence_score\"`, `\"source_url\"`).\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Data Modeling\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mutating Shared Data Structures**\n- **Description**: Directly modifying a `SubTask` object's `status` field while multiple components hold references to it.\n- **Why it's wrong**: In concurrent execution (parallel subtasks), this causes race conditions. Even in sequential execution, it makes debugging hard—you can't trace when the status changed.\n- **Fix**: Use functional updates: `new_subtask = subtask.with_status(SubTaskStatus.EXECUTING)`. Implement `.copy()` or `.replace()` methods that return new instances.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circular Dependencies in SubTask Graph**\n- **Description**: Creating a `SubTask` where `dependencies` includes an ID that eventually depends back on this subtask (A depends on B depends on A).\n- **Why it's wrong**: The executor gets stuck in infinite loop trying to find a subtask with no unsatisfied dependencies.\n- **Fix**: Validate the dependency graph is acyclic when building the plan. Use topological sort detection during planning phase.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent ID Referencing**\n- **Description**: A `SubTask` lists a dependency ID that doesn't exist in the parent `Task.subtasks`.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The executor will mark the subtask as `BLOCKED` forever, waiting for a non-existent dependency to complete.\n- **Fix**: Validate all referenced IDs exist within the same Task when constructing the plan. Maintain referential integrity checks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Metadata in ToolResult**\n- **Description**: Tools returning `ToolResult` with empty `metadata` dict, losing valuable debugging information.\n- **Why it's wrong**: When a tool fails mysteriously, there's no forensic data to diagnose the issue (execution time, intermediate values, error codes).\n- **Fix**: Establish conventions for minimum metadata: `{\"execution_ms\": 150, \"tool_version\": \"1.0\"}`. Better: include stack traces for errors.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overloading the Context Dictionary**\n- **Description**: Storing too much unstructured data in `Task.context`, making it a \"global variable bag\" that's hard to reason about.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Subtasks become tightly coupled through implicit data dependencies (subtask B expects subtask A to have set `context[\"formatted_data\"]`).\n- **Fix**: Document context key conventions. Consider typed context objects or a schema for the context dictionary.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations Table\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

mutable fields like `List`. Use `field(default_factory=list)` instead of `default=[]`.\n\n- **Functional updates**: The `replace()` function from `dataclasses` creates a new instance with updated fields. This is cleaner than manual `copy()` and update.\n\n- **Enum serialization**: Python Enums serialize to their value (string) when using `json.dumps()`. For `ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS`, JSON becomes `\"success\"`.\n\n- **Type hints**: Use `from typing import Optional` for nullable fields. Add `-> None` to `__post_init__` methods for proper type checking.\n\n- **ID generation**: `uuid.uuid4().hex` gives a 32-character hex string without hyphens, ideal for clean IDs in logs and UI.\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the data model types, verify with:\n\n```bash\n# Run the type validation tests\npython -m pytest tests/test_types.py -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# test_tool_result_creation (PASS)\n# test_subtask_dependencies (PASS)  \n# test_task_immutability (PASS)\n# test_enum_serialization (PASS)\n```\n\nCreate a simple test to verify the data model works correctly:\n\n```python\n# Quick verification script\nfrom core.types import Task, SubTask, SubTaskStatus\n\n# Create a simple task with subtasks\ntask = Task(\n    original_query=\"What's 2+2?\",\n    goal=\"Calculate 2+2\",\n    subtasks=[\n        SubTask(\n            description=\"Calculate 2+2\",\n            tool_name=\"calculator\",\n            tool_args={\"expression\": \"2+2\"}\n        )\n    ]\n)\n\nprint(f\"Task created: {task.id}\")\nprint(f\"First subtask status: {task.subtasks[0].status}\")\nprint(f\"Subtask ready?: {task.subtasks[0].is_ready()}\")\n\n# Functional update\nupdated_subtask = task.subtasks[0].with_status(SubTaskStatus.EXECUTING)\nprint(f\"Updated status: {updated_subtask.status}\")\n```\n\nExpected output should show proper ID generation, correct default status, and functional updates working without modifying the original object.\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| \"SubTask has no attribute 'id'\" | Forgot to use `field(default_factory=...)` for ID generation | Check if `SubTask()` creation without ID argument fails | Use `field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))` |\n| \"JSON serialization error on Enum\" | Trying to serialize Enum object directly | Print `type(task.subtasks[0].status)` | Ensure Enums have string values and use `.value` when custom serialization needed |\n| \"Updated subtask but original also changed\" | Mutating dataclass in place instead of functional update | Check for `subtask.status = new_status` assignments | Use `replace()` or `.with_status()` method |\n| \"Dependency resolution stuck\" | Circular dependency in subtask graph | Print adjacency list and run cycle detection | Validate graph is acyclic during planning |\n\n\n## 5.1 Component: Tool System (Milestone 1)\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1\n\nThe Tool System is the foundation upon which the AI Executive extends its capabilities into the external world. Just as a CEO cannot personally type every email or analyze every spreadsheet, the AI Executive cannot directly interact with databases, APIs, or calculation engines. Instead, it must delegate these actions to specialized tools. This component defines the contract, registration, and safe execution of these tools, bridging the **semantic gap** between the LLM's natural language reasoning and the structured world of software interfaces.\n\n### Mental Model: The Agent's Toolbox\n\nImagine giving a skilled but disembodied assistant a Swiss Army knife. The assistant understands language and can reason about problems, but it needs physical attachments (blades, scissors, screwdrivers) to manipulate the world. Each attachment has a specific purpose, a safe way to hold it, and clear instructions for use. The **Tool System** is this Swiss Army knife—a curated, well-documented, and safely accessible collection of capabilities.\n\n*   **Well-Defined Interfaces:** Each tool has a precise name, a clear description of what it does, and an exact specification for its inputs (like which screwdriver head fits which screw). This eliminates ambiguity for the LLM when choosing which tool to use.\n*   **Safe Handling:** Tools are designed with guards—input validation, timeouts, and error handling—to prevent the assistant from accidentally cutting itself (crashing the system) or applying the wrong force (corrupting data).\n*   **Dynamic Attachment:** New tools can be added to the knife's handle at any time, even while the assistant is working, without needing to rebuild the entire knife. The assistant can immediately discover and use these new capabilities.\n\nThis mental model emphasizes that tools are not arbitrary code snippets but are **controlled, observable, and predictable extensions** of the agent's will.\n\n### Interface and Contract\n\nEvery tool in the framework must adhere to a strict interface. This consistency enables the LLM to reason about tool usage, the registry to manage them uniformly, and the execution engine to invoke them safely.\n\nThe `Tool` interface defines the following mandatory properties and method:\n\n| Property/Method | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `name` | `str` | A unique, descriptive identifier for the tool (e.g., `\"web_search\"`, `\"execute_python_code\"`). Must be lowercase with underscores. This is the primary key the LLM uses to invoke the tool. |\n| `description` | `str` | A natural language explanation of the tool's purpose, its inputs, and the nature of its output. This is injected into the LLM's prompt and is critical for accurate tool selection. A good description answers: \"What does this do? When should I use it? What do I give it, and what do I get back?\" |\n| `parameters_schema` | `Dict[str, Any]` | A **JSON Schema** object that rigorously defines the expected parameters. This schema is used for runtime validation before execution. It specifies required fields, data types, allowed values, and constraints (e.g., `\"maxLength\"` for strings). |\n| `execute(self, **kwargs) -> ToolResult` | Method | The core implementation. Accepts keyword arguments validated against the `parameters_schema`. It must return a `ToolResult` object, which standardizes success/error outcomes and includes metadata for debugging. Execution must be idempotent where possible and must not have hidden side effects beyond those described. |\n\nThe `ToolResult` type, as defined in the naming conventions, is the universal wrapper for all tool outputs:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `content` | `str` | The primary output of the tool, formatted as text consumable by the LLM (e.g., a search result summary, a calculation answer). For errors, this may contain a user-friendly error message. |\n| `status` | `ToolResultStatus` | An enum (`SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `TIMEOUT`) indicating the categorical outcome. This allows the agent's loop logic to handle failures differently from successes. |\n| `error_message` | `Optional[str]` | For `ERROR` or `TIMEOUT` statuses, a detailed, technical error message for logging and debugging. This is separate from the LLM-consumable `content`. |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | A **bag of properties** for extensible, tool-specific information (e.g., `{\"latency_ms\": 120, \"result_count\": 5}`). This enables observability and advanced post-processing without polluting the primary `content`. |\n\nFactory methods (`ToolResult.success`, `.error`, `.timeout`) should be used to ensure consistent construction of these objects.\n\n### Tool Registry Pattern\n\nThe Tool Registry acts as the central directory and dispatcher for all available tools. It follows the **Service Locator** pattern, providing a single point of lookup. Its primary responsibilities are dynamic registration, discovery by name, and providing a complete list of tools for prompt construction.\n\n**Key Design Points:**\n\n1.  **Singleton/Global Access:** The registry should be accessible throughout the agent's runtime. This is typically implemented as a class with class-level methods or a module-level global instance, though dependency injection is preferred for testability.\n2.  **Thread-Safe Registration:** Since tools can be added at runtime (e.g., by plugins), registration operations must be thread-safe to prevent race conditions.\n3.  **Immutable Tool Definitions:** Once registered, a tool's interface (`name`, `description`, `schema`) should be treated as immutable. The `execute` method's behavior is the tool author's responsibility.\n4.  **Namespacing:** Consider supporting namespaced tool names (e.g., `\"math.calculator\"`, `\"web.search\"`) to avoid collisions in large tool ecosystems, though a simple unique `name` suffices for the initial implementation.\n\nThe registry's interface is simple:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `register_tool` | `tool: Tool` | `None` | Adds a tool instance to the registry. Raises a `ValueError` if a tool with the same name already exists. |\n| `get_tool` | `name: str` | `Optional[Tool]` | Retrieves a tool by its unique name. Returns `None` if not found. |\n| `list_tools` | `None` | `List[Tool]` | Returns a list of all registered tools, typically for inclusion in the LLM's system prompt. |\n\n### Execution Engine with Safety\n\nThe Execution Engine is the critical safety layer that sits between the LLM's action choice and the actual tool code. It transforms a raw tool call request (\"use `calculator` with `expression: '2+2'`\") into a safe, validated, observed, and error-handled execution. This process follows a strict pipeline:\n\n1.  **Lookup & Existence Check:** The engine receives a requested tool `name` and `arguments` dict. It first queries the registry. If the tool does not exist, it immediately returns a `ToolResult.error` with a message like \"Tool 'foo' not found.\"\n2.  **Schema Validation:** Using the tool's `parameters_schema`, the engine validates the provided `arguments`. It checks for required fields, correct data types (e.g., ensuring a parameter expecting a number isn't given a string), and value constraints. Any validation failure results in a descriptive `ToolResult.error` (e.g., \"Parameter 'expression' must be a string, got type int\").\n3.  **Safe Execution Wrapping:**\n    *   **Timeout Enforcement:** The tool's `execute` method is invoked inside a timeout context (e.g., using `asyncio.wait_for` or `threading.Timer`). This prevents buggy or long-running tools from hanging the entire agent loop indefinitely. A timeout triggers a `ToolResult.timeout`.\n    *   **Exception Isolation:** The call is wrapped in a try-except block. Any uncaught exception from the tool is caught, logged, and converted into a `ToolResult.error`. The `error_message` should include the exception type and traceback for debugging, while the `content` may have a simpler message for the LLM (e.g., \"The tool encountered an internal error.\").\n    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** For tools that execute code (e.g., Python), the engine should spawn execution in an isolated sandbox (like a restricted subprocess or a `seccomp`-confined environment) with limits on CPU, memory, and filesystem access. This is a **non-goal** for Milestone 1 but is a critical consideration for production.\n4.  **Result Standardization:** The raw output from `tool.execute` must already be a `ToolResult`. The engine ensures this contract is upheld. It may also attach engine-level metadata to the result's `metadata` field (e.g., `validation_time_ms`, `execution_time_ms`).\n5.  **Observability Logging:** The engine logs the tool call attempt, validation result, execution duration, and final outcome. This is essential for debugging agent behavior and monitoring tool performance.\n\n> The key insight is that **the execution engine treats all tools as potentially hostile or buggy**. It assumes nothing about the tool's internal reliability and enforces safety and observability at the boundary.\n\n### ADR: JSON Schema for Parameter Validation\n\n> **Decision: Use JSON Schema for Tool Parameter Definition and Validation**\n>\n> - **Context**: The LLM outputs unstructured text that must be parsed into structured arguments for tool execution. We need a robust, declarative way to define the expected structure of these arguments and validate them before execution to prevent runtime errors and improve LLM guidance.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>     1.  **Unstructured Strings (Free-form)**: The LLM provides arguments as a concatenated string (e.g., `\"2 + 2\"`), and the tool function parses it internally.\n>     2.  **Pydantic/Type-Hinted Python Models**: Define tool parameters as Pydantic `BaseModel` classes. Validation uses Python's type system and Pydantic's validators.\n>     3.  **JSON Schema**: Define parameters as a JSON Schema (Draft 7 or 2020-12) dictionary.\n> - **Decision**: Use **JSON Schema**.\n> - **Rationale**:\n>     1.  **Language Agnosticism**: JSON Schema is a universal standard, not tied to Python. This aligns with our potential future TypeScript/JavaScript runtime and makes tool definitions portable.\n>     2.  **Rich Validation Ecosystem**: JSON Schema supports complex validations (regex patterns, number ranges, array item constraints) that are cumbersome to express purely with Python type hints.\n>     3.  **LLM-Native Format**: Modern LLMs are extensively trained on JSON and JSON Schema. Providing the schema directly in the prompt (as used by OpenAI's function calling) is a highly effective technique for guiding the LLM to produce correctly formatted arguments.\n>     4.  **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The schema is a pure declaration. The validation logic (using a library like `jsonschema`) is separate from the tool's business logic, promoting cleaner code.\n> - **Consequences**:\n>     - **Positive**: Enables high-quality validation and excellent LLM guidance. Tool definitions become declarative and portable.\n>     - **Negative**: Adds a dependency on a JSON Schema validation library. Schema definitions are slightly more verbose than Python dataclasses. Developers must learn JSON Schema syntax.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Unstructured Strings** | Simple to implement; mirrors some early agent frameworks. | Extremely brittle; shifts parsing burden to each tool; no validation before execution; poor LLM guidance. | ❌ |\n| **Pydantic Models** | Leverages Python's strong typing; excellent IDE support; validation logic can be embedded in model methods. | Ties the framework to Python; schema extraction for LLM prompts requires extra work; less rich constraint language than JSON Schema. | ❌ |\n| **JSON Schema** | Universal standard; rich validation; excellent LLM compatibility; declarative and separate from logic. | Slightly more verbose; requires a validation library dependency. | ✅ |\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Mitigations\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Vague or Incomplete Tool Descriptions**\n*   **Description**: Writing a `description` like \"Searches the web\" provides insufficient context for the LLM. When should it use this versus a \"query_database\" tool? What format does the query take? What kind of results are returned?\n*   **Why it's Wrong**: The LLM will guess incorrectly, leading to wasted iterations and failed tasks. The description is the primary documentation for the LLM.\n*   **How to Fix**: Write descriptions as if instructing a new employee. Example: \"`web_search`: Performs a general internet search using the DuckDuckGo API. Use this to find current information, general knowledge, or news. Input: a `query` string (required). Output: A list of up to 5 search results, each with a `title`, `snippet`, and `url`. Does not access specific databases or internal documents.\"\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing or Weak Parameter Validation**\n*   **Description**: Relying on the tool's internal code to validate inputs, or defining a schema that's too permissive (e.g., `\"type\": \"string\"` for an expression that should be a mathematical formula).\n*   **Why it's Wrong**: Allows malformed data to reach the tool, causing cryptic runtime exceptions (e.g., `KeyError`, `TypeError`). These are harder for the agent to recover from than a clear validation error.\n*   **How to Fix**: Use JSON Schema's full power. Define `required` fields, specific `types`, `pattern` regex for strings, `minimum`/`maximum` for numbers, and `enum` for allowed values. The validation error message should be specific enough for the LLM to correct its input.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Tool Execution Without Timeout**\n*   **Description**: Calling `tool.execute()` directly without any timeout guard.\n*   **Why it's Wrong**: A network call that hangs, or a tool with an infinite loop, will freeze the entire agent loop indefinitely. The system becomes unresponsive.\n*   **How to Fix**: **Always** wrap tool execution in a timeout mechanism. Use `asyncio.wait_for` for async tools or `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` with a timeout for synchronous ones. The timeout should be configurable per-tool.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Sensitive Tools Without Permission Checks**\n*   **Description**: Providing tools like `execute_shell_command` or `delete_database_record` without any authorization layer, allowing the LLM to invoke them based purely on its reasoning.\n*   **Why it's Wrong**: Creates massive security vulnerabilities. The LLM's goal is to satisfy the user's query, which could inadvertently or maliciously lead to destructive actions.\n*   **How to Fix**: Implement a permission system. Tools can have required permission flags (e.g., `\"requires_permission\": [\"fs_write\", \"shell_exec\"]`). The agent's runtime context should include the user's or session's permissions. The execution engine checks permissions after validation but before execution, rejecting unauthorized calls with a clear error.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations Table:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| JSON Schema Validation | `jsonschema` library (pure Python) | `fastjsonschema` (faster, compile-time) |\n| Async Timeout | `asyncio.wait_for` | `anyio` or `trio` for structured concurrency |\n| Sandboxed Code Execution | `subprocess` with resource limits (`resource` module) | Dedicated sandboxing (Docker container, `pysandbox`, `gvisor`) |\n| Tool Registry Storage | In-memory `dict` | Persistent registry (SQLite, Redis) for distributed agents |\n\n**B.

Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n*   **Use `asyncio` for Concurrency:** The framework is async-first. All tool `execute` methods should be `async def`. Use `asyncio.wait_for` for timeouts.\n*   **JSON Schema Validation with `jsonschema`:** Install via `pip install jsonschema`. Use `jsonschema.validate()` in the `validate_args` helper. Pre-compile schemas for frequently used tools with `jsonschema.Draft7Validator`.\n*   **Structured Logging:** Use the `logging` module with JSON formatters (e.g., `python-json-logger`) for production. Log tool calls, validation results, execution times, and outcomes.\n*   **Functional Updates with Dataclasses:** Make `ToolResult` a frozen dataclass (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`) to enforce immutability and enable safe caching/hashing if needed.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the Tool System, you should be able to run the following test:\n\n```bash\n# Run the tool system unit tests\npytest tests/tools/ -v\n```\n\nExpected output should show passing tests for:\n1.  Registering a tool and retrieving it by name.\n2.  Validating correct arguments against a schema (success).\n3.  Validating incorrect arguments (failure with descriptive error).\n4.  Executing a mock tool successfully and receiving a `ToolResult`.\n5.  Handling a tool timeout and returning a `TIMEOUT` result.\n6.  Handling a tool exception and returning an `ERROR` result.\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n```python\n# Create and register a simple tool\nregistry = ToolRegistry()\nregistry.register_tool(MyCalculatorTool())\n\n# Execute via the engine\nengine = ToolExecutionEngine()\nresult = await engine.execute_tool_call(\"calculator\", {\"expression\": \"2+2\"})\nprint(result.status)  # Should be ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS\nprint(result.content) # Should be \"4\"\n```\n\n**Signs of Trouble:**\n*   **\"Tool not found\" errors:** Check that `ToolRegistry.register_tool` was called before execution.\n*   **Validation errors even with correct input:** Double-check your JSON Schema against the actual arguments dictionary structure. Use a [JSON Schema validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) online.\n*   **Timeout not working:** Ensure you're using `asyncio.wait_for` correctly and that your tool's `execute` method is truly `async`.\n\n\n## 5.2 Component: ReAct Loop Engine (Milestone 2)\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 2\n\nThe ReAct Loop Engine is the beating heart of the AI Executive—the core processor that translates high-level goals into concrete actions through iterative reasoning. While the Tool System (Milestone 1) provides the *capabilities* and the Planner (Milestone 3) provides the *strategy*, the ReAct Loop is the *tactical executor* that navigates the immediate terrain of a single subtask, making micro-decisions to overcome obstacles in real time.\n\n### Mental Model: The OODA Loop\n\nThink of the ReAct Loop not as a simple script, but as the agent's **OODA Loop**—the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act cycle used by fighter pilots for rapid, adaptive decision-making under pressure.\n\n- **Observe**: The agent receives the current state of the world—the user's query, the results of previous tool executions, and any relevant context from memory.\n- **Orient**: The agent *thinks*—it processes this information using the LLM to understand the situation, assess options, and form a hypothesis about what action to take next.\n- **Decide**: The agent selects a specific tool and formulates the exact parameters needed to execute it.\n- **Act**: The agent executes the chosen tool and observes the result, which feeds back into the next Observation phase.\n\nThis cyclical process allows the agent to adapt to unexpected outcomes. If a tool fails, the next cycle re-orients and decides on a corrective action. If new information emerges, the agent can change course. The loop continues until the subtask is complete or a termination condition is met. This mental model emphasizes **adaptability** and **continuous feedback**—the agent isn't following a rigid script but piloting toward a goal, constantly adjusting based on what it observes.\n\n### Loop Controller Interface\n\nThe ReAct Loop is encapsulated within a `ReActAgent` class that serves as the controller for a single subtask execution. Its primary interface is the `_execute_subtask` method, which implements the full Thought-Action-Observation cycle until completion. This method is called by the higher-level Planner (Milestone 3) for each `SubTask` in the plan.\n\nThe controller's interface is defined in the following table:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `_execute_subtask` | `subtask: SubTask` | `ToolResult` | **Primary entry point.** Executes a single subtask by running the ReAct loop until the subtask's goal is satisfied, a final answer is produced, or a loop limit is reached. Internally manages the cycle of prompting the LLM, parsing actions, executing tools, and formatting observations. |\n| `_format_react_prompt` | `subtask: SubTask`, `conversation_history: List[str]`, `available_tools: List[Tool]` | `str` | Constructs the prompt sent to the LLM for each reasoning step. Includes the task goal, conversation history, available tools with descriptions, and formatting instructions. |\n| `_parse_llm_output` | `llm_response: str` | `Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[Dict[str, Any]]]` | Extracts the tool name and arguments from the LLM's textual response. Returns `(None, None)` if the response indicates a final answer. |\n| `_run_single_cycle` | `current_state: Dict[str, Any]` | `Tuple[AgentState, Dict[str, Any]]` | Executes one full cycle of the loop (Think → Act → Observe). Returns the updated agent state and the accumulated context. Used internally by `_execute_subtask`. |\n\nThe agent's internal state during loop execution follows a precise state machine, as shown in the diagram below. This state machine ensures clean transitions between thinking, acting, and observing, and provides clear hooks for monitoring and debugging.\n\n![Agent Core State Machine](./diagrams/diagram-agent-state-machine.svg)\n\n**State Transitions During ReAct Loop Execution:**\n\n| Current State | Event Trigger | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------|\n| `IDLE` | `subtask_received` | `THINKING` | Initialize loop context, set iteration counter to 0, load relevant memories. |\n| `THINKING` | `llm_response_received` | `ACTING` (if action) or `FINISHED` (if final answer) | Parse LLM output. If action, validate tool exists; if final answer, prepare result. |\n| `ACTING` | `tool_execution_complete` | `OBSERVING` | Execute the selected tool via `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call()`. |\n| `OBSERVING` | `observation_formatted` | `THINKING` (if continue) or `FINISHED` (if loop limit) | Format tool result as observation text, append to conversation history. Check iteration limit. |\n| `THINKING` | `parsing_error` | `ERROR` | Log error details, set error state with descriptive message. |\n| `ACTING` | `tool_error` | `THINKING` | Format tool error as observation, feed back into next cycle for recovery. |\n| Any state | `iteration_limit_reached` | `FINISHED` | Stop loop, return timeout result with partial context. |\n\n### Step-by-Step Loop Algorithm\n\nThe core ReAct algorithm is a deterministic cycle that runs within `_execute_subtask`. Below is the detailed, step-by-step procedure explained in prose. This algorithm assumes a subtask has been provided by the Planner, and the agent's goal is to produce a `ToolResult` containing either the final answer or an error.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The agent receives a `SubTask` object. It extracts the `description` and `expected_output` as the goal. It initializes an empty `conversation_history` list to store the sequence of thoughts, actions, and observations. It sets an `iteration_counter` to 0 and defines a `max_iterations` (e.g., 10) to prevent infinite loops.\n\n2. **Context Preparation**: The agent retrieves any relevant context from the Memory System (Milestone 4)—both short-term conversation history from previous subtasks and relevant long-term memories retrieved via semantic search based on the subtask description. This context is formatted and included in the initial prompt.\n\n3. **Cycle Start (Think)**: The agent enters the `THINKING` state. It constructs a prompt using `_format_react_prompt`, which includes:\n   - The subtask goal and any `expected_output` criteria.\n   - The current conversation history (initially empty).\n   - A list of available tools from the `ToolRegistry`, each with its `name`, `description`, and `parameters_schema`.\n   - Explicit formatting instructions: the LLM must output its reasoning in a \"Thought:\" section, then either an \"Action:\" section (with JSON) or a \"Final Answer:\" section.\n\n4. **LLM Reasoning**: The prompt is sent to the LLM via the configured provider (e.g., OpenAI API). The agent waits for the response and increments the `iteration_counter`.\n\n5. **Output Parsing**: The agent parses the LLM's response using `_parse_llm_output`. This function looks for three possible patterns:\n   - **Action Pattern**: Extracts a tool name and a JSON dictionary of arguments from the \"Action:\" section.\n   - **Final Answer Pattern**: Detects a \"Final Answer:\" section and extracts the content.\n   - **Malformed Output**: If neither pattern is found, it's a parsing error.\n\n6. **Action Execution**: If an action was parsed:\n   - The agent transitions to the `ACTING` state.\n   - It validates that the tool name exists in the `ToolRegistry` via `ToolRegistry.get_tool()`.\n   - It calls `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call(tool_name, arguments, timeout_seconds)` to safely run the tool with schema validation, timeout, and error handling.\n   - The engine returns a `ToolResult` object with `status`, `content`, and any `error_message`.\n\n7. **Observation Formatting**: The agent transitions to the `OBSERVING` state. It formats the `ToolResult` into a textual observation:\n   - If `status` is `SUCCESS`: \"Observation: [tool result content]\"\n   - If `status` is `ERROR` or `TIMEOUT`: \"Observation: Error: [error message]\"\n   This observation is appended to the `conversation_history`.\n\n8. **Loop Continuation Check**: The agent checks termination conditions:\n   - **Final Answer Detected**: If step 5 found a \"Final Answer:\", the loop breaks, and the answer content is packaged into a `ToolResult.success()`.\n   - **Iteration Limit Reached**: If `iteration_counter >= max_iterations`, the loop breaks with a `ToolResult.error()` indicating timeout.\n   - **Subtask Goal Satisfied**: Optionally, the agent can evaluate if the `expected_output` criteria have been met based on observations (simple string matching or LLM evaluation). If satisfied, break with success.\n   - Otherwise, return to step 3 for the next cycle.\n\n9. **Result Packaging**: Once the loop terminates, the agent packages the final output or error into a `ToolResult` and returns it to the Planner. The entire `conversation_history` is also attached as metadata for debugging.\n\nThis algorithm creates a self-contained execution unit for a single subtask. The sequence of interactions between components during this loop is illustrated in the following diagram:\n\n![ReAct Loop Sequence Diagram](./diagrams/diagram-react-sequence.svg)\n\n**Example Walkthrough**: Consider a subtask with description \"Find the current population of Tokyo.\" The agent initializes, then in cycle 1 thinks: \"I need to search for Tokyo's population. I can use the web_search tool.\" It outputs an Action to call `web_search` with query \"Tokyo current population 2024\". The tool returns a search result snippet. The observation is formatted and added to history. Cycle 2 thinks: \"The search result says Tokyo's population is about 37 million. I should present this as the final answer.\" It outputs a Final Answer. The loop terminates with success.\n\n### Action Parsing Strategies\n\nA critical technical challenge is reliably extracting structured tool calls from the LLM's free-form text. The LLM is instructed to output an \"Action:\" block with JSON, but it may hallucinate formats, omit brackets, or produce malformed JSON. The parsing strategy must be robust to these variations while rejecting invalid input.\n\nWe evaluate three primary strategies:\n\n| Strategy | How It Works | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|--------------|------|------|\n| **Regular Expression (Regex) Extraction** | Use regex patterns to find text between `Action:` and newlines, then extract a JSON-like structure. Can be lenient with whitespace and minor syntax errors. | Simple to implement, fast, no external dependencies. Can handle some LLM formatting quirks. | Fragile to complex JSON nesting. Difficult to maintain as patterns multiply. May incorrectly parse nested quotes or brackets. |\n| **Function-Calling API** | Use the LLM provider's native function-calling feature (e.g., OpenAI's `tools` parameter). The LLM returns a structured JSON object in a separate field. | Highly reliable, native support from major providers. Guaranteed valid JSON. Offloads parsing complexity to the provider. | Vendor lock-in. Not all LLM providers support it. Less transparent (harder to debug the raw prompt). |\n| **JSON-in-Text Parsing with Fallback** | Use a dedicated parser (like `jtoken` or `json5`) that scans the text for the first valid JSON object after \"Action:\". If that fails, use a regex fallback to extract a likely JSON string and attempt repair. | Balances robustness and independence. Can handle many edge cases. Works with any LLM provider. | More complex implementation. Repair logic can introduce its own bugs. Slower than regex. |\n\n> **Decision: JSON-in-Text Parsing with Fallback**\n> - **Context**: We need a parsing strategy that works reliably across different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) while handling the common formatting mistakes LLMs make. The parser must be part of our open framework, not dependent on proprietary APIs.\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Regex extraction, 2) Function-calling API, 3) JSON-in-text parsing with fallback.\n> - **Decision**: Implement **JSON-in-text parsing with a lenient fallback** as the primary strategy.\n> - **Rationale**: This approach provides the best balance of independence, robustness, and debuggability. Using a library like `jtoken` allows us to find and parse JSON even if it's embedded in markdown or has trailing commas. The fallback to regex and JSON repair (e.g., using `json5` or simple string patching) handles cases where the LLM outputs malformed JSON. This keeps the framework provider-agnostic while still being tolerant of LLM errors.\n> - **Consequences**: We must implement and maintain a moderately complex parser. However, this complexity is isolated to a single module, and the increased robustness will reduce learner frustration when their agent gets stuck due to parsing failures. The parser will also provide detailed error messages to aid debugging.\n\n**Parsing Process Details**:\n1. The raw LLM response is searched for the string \"Action:\" (case-insensitive).\n2. The substring after \"Action:\" up to the next \"Thought:\" or \"Final Answer:\" (or end of text) is extracted as the `action_text`.\n3. A JSON tokenizer scans `action_text` to find the first complete JSON object (starting with `{` and ending with matching `}`).\n4. If found, parse it with the standard `json` module.\n5. If not found, apply a fallback: use regex to find text between curly braces, then attempt to repair common issues (add missing quotes, fix trailing commas) using a simple heuristic or `json5` library.\n6. Validate that the parsed object contains `\"tool\"` and `\"arguments\"` keys.\n7. If all fails, raise a `ParsingError` with the problematic text, which the loop will treat as an observation error, feeding back to the LLM for correction.\n\n### ADR: Loop Termination Strategy\n\nKnowing when to stop the loop is non-trivial. The agent might keep taking actions indefinitely, or it might declare victory prematurely. We need a robust termination strategy that balances autonomy with safety.\n\n> **Decision: Hybrid Termination Strategy**\n> - **Context**: The ReAct loop must eventually stop—either because the task is complete or because it's stuck. We need deterministic guarantees against infinite loops while allowing the agent to finish naturally.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Fixed Iteration Limit**: Stop after N cycles (e.g., 10) regardless of progress.\n>   2. **Explicit Final Answer Token**: Only stop when the LLM outputs a special \"Final Answer:\" section.\n>   3. **External Monitor with Goal Checking**: Use a separate LLM call or rule-based evaluator each cycle to assess if the subtask goal has been satisfied.\n> - **Decision**: Implement a **hybrid strategy combining a fixed iteration limit with explicit final answer detection, augmented by optional goal satisfaction checking**.\n> - **Rationale**: A fixed iteration limit is essential as a safety net—it guarantees termination even if the agent is stuck in a loop. The explicit final answer token gives the agent control to finish early when it believes it has the answer. The optional goal checker (configurable) adds an extra layer of validation, ensuring the agent's final answer actually addresses the subtask's `expected_output`. This three-layer approach provides both safety and flexibility.\n> - **Consequences**: This increases implementation complexity slightly, as we need to manage multiple termination conditions. However, each condition is simple to implement, and together they create a robust stopping mechanism. The iteration limit should be configurable per subtask, as complex tasks may require more steps.\n\n**Termination Condition Comparison:**\n\n| Condition | Trigger | Pros | Cons | Implementation Priority |\n|-----------|---------|------|------|-------------------------|\n| **Iteration Limit** | `iteration_counter >= max_iterations` | Guarantees termination, simple to implement. | May cut off productive loops prematurely. | **Required** |\n| **Explicit Final Answer** | LLM output contains \"Final Answer:\" section. | Agent-controlled, natural, follows ReAct paper. | Agent may output final answer incorrectly or prematurely. | **Required** |\n| **Goal Satisfaction Check** | `expected_output` is met (string match or LLM evaluation). | Ensures objective completion, catches hallucinated final answers. | Adds latency (if using LLM) or complexity (rule-based). | **Optional** |\n\nThe recommended default is to use iteration limit (configurable, default 10) + explicit final answer detection. The goal satisfaction check can be enabled for subtasks where `expected_output` is specified and precise verification is needed.\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Mitigations\n\nImplementing a ReAct loop seems straightforward, but several subtle traps can cause the agent to fail in frustrating ways. Below are the most common pitfalls, why they occur, and how to avoid them.\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 1: Infinite Loops with No Progress**\n- **Description**: The agent repeatedly takes the same action or cycles through a set of actions without getting closer to the goal. Example: searching for the same query over and over.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Consumes API credits and time, never produces a result.\n- **Fix**: Implement **progress tracking**. Maintain a set of (tool, arguments) pairs from previous cycles. If the same action is about to be repeated, inject a warning observation: \"You already tried this action with the same arguments. Consider a different approach.\" Also, enforce the iteration limit strictly.\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 2: Hallucinated Tools**\n- **Description**: The LLM invokes a tool that doesn't exist in the registry (e.g., `send_email` when only `web_search` is available).\n- **Why it's wrong**: The parser may extract the tool name, but execution will fail because the tool is missing, breaking the loop.\n- **Fix**: **Validate tool existence immediately after parsing**. Before calling `ToolExecutionEngine`, check `ToolRegistry.get_tool(tool_name)`. If missing, format an observation: \"Tool `{tool_name}` is not available. Available tools are: [list]. Please choose from these.\" This turns the error into a learning opportunity for the agent.\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 3: Parsing Failures on Valid LLM Output**\n- **Description**: The LLM outputs a correctly formatted action, but the parser fails to extract it due to subtle formatting differences (extra spaces, line breaks, markdown code blocks).\n- **Why it's wrong**: The agent stalls because it cannot proceed, even though the LLM did its job correctly.\n- **Fix**: Use the **robust JSON-in-text parsing with fallback** described above. Additionally, log the raw LLM response and the parsing error for debugging. Consider adding a \"graceful degradation\" where if parsing fails, you ask the LLM to reformat: \"Could not parse your action. Please output Action: as valid JSON only.\"\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 4: Context Window Mismanagement**\n- **Description**: The `conversation_history` grows with each cycle, eventually exceeding the LLM's token limit, causing truncation or API errors.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Critical early context (the original goal, key observations) gets truncated, leading to incoherent behavior.\n- **Fix**: Implement **context window management** (detailed in Milestone 4). For the ReAct loop specifically, you can:\n  - Keep only the last K thought-action-observation triples.\n  - Summarize older triples into a concise summary using an LLM.\n  - Include the original subtask description in every prompt, not just the first.\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 5: No Error Feedback for Tool Failures**\n- **Description**: When a tool returns a `ToolResult` with `status=ERROR`, the agent simply passes the raw error (e.g., \"HTTP 500\") to the LLM without context.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The LLM may not understand how to recover from technical errors.\n- **Fix**: **Enrich error observations**. Format tool errors with suggestions: \"Observation: The web_search tool failed with error 'Connection timeout'. This might be a temporary network issue. You could retry the same action or try a different search query.\" This guides the LLM toward appropriate recovery actions.\n\n⚡ **Pitfall 6: Missing Timeout on LLM Calls**\n- **Description**: The LLM API call hangs indefinitely due to network issues or provider slowness, freezing the entire agent.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The agent becomes unresponsive, requiring manual restart.\n- **Fix**: Wrap the LLM API call in a **timeout**. Use `asyncio.wait_for` or a thread with a timeout. If the call times out, treat it as a tool-like error and format an observation: \"The LLM is not responding. Please retry your last thought.\" Also, consider implementing a retry with exponential backoff for transient failures.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete code and structure to implement the ReAct Loop Engine. The primary language is Python, using async/await for non-blocking tool and LLM calls.\n\n#### A. Technology Recommendations Table\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| LLM Client | `openai` Python library (sync) | `openai` async client or `litellm` for multi-provider support |\n| JSON Parsing | Python's `json` + regex fallback | `jtoken` library for robust tokenization, `json5` for repair |\n| Timeout/Async | `asyncio.wait_for` with `asyncio.TimeoutError` | `anyio` or `trio` for structured concurrency, retry with backoff |\n| State Management | Simple dictionary for loop context | Pydantic models for validation, immutable updates via `dataclasses.replace` |\n\n#### B.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n- **Async/Await Pattern**: Use `asyncio.create_task` for parallel tool execution when multiple subtasks can run concurrently (Milestone 3). For now, keep the ReAct loop sequential.\n- **Timeout Handling**: Always wrap LLM calls and tool executions in `asyncio.wait_for`. Catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` and convert to a `ToolResult.timeout`.\n- **Immutable Updates**: Since `ReActLoopContext` is a dataclass, use `dataclasses.replace(context, iteration=context.iteration + 1)` for functional updates. This makes debugging easier.\n- **Logging**: Use structured logging (Python's `logging` module with JSON formatter) to log each cycle's state, action, and observation. This is crucial for debugging agent behavior.\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the ReAct Loop Engine, you should be able to run a simple end-to-end test:\n\n```python\n# test_react_agent.py\nimport asyncio\nfrom tools.registry import ToolRegistry\nfrom tools.execution_engine import ToolExecutionEngine\nfrom llm.client import MockLLMClient  # A mock that returns predefined responses\nfrom agents.react_agent import ReActAgent\nfrom data_model import SubTask, ToolResult\n\nasync def test_react_loop():\n    # 1. Set up mock LLM that simulates a ReAct sequence\n    mock_llm = MockLLMClient(responses=[\n        \"Thought: I need to calculate 15 * 3. Action: {'tool': 'calculator', 'arguments': {'expression': '15 * 3'}}\",\n        \"Thought: The result is 45. Final Answer: 45\"\n    ])\n    \n    # 2. Register a calculator tool\n    registry = ToolRegistry()\n    # ... register a simple calculator tool (from Milestone 1)\n    \n    # 3. Create engine and agent\n    engine = ToolExecutionEngine(registry)\n    agent = ReActAgent(mock_llm, registry, engine, max_iterations=5)\n    \n    # 4. Create a subtask\n    subtask = SubTask(\n        id=\"test-1\",\n        description=\"Calculate 15 times 3\",\n        expected_output=\"45\",\n        tool_name=None,\n        tool_args=None,\n        dependencies=[],\n        status=SubTaskStatus.PENDING,\n        result=None\n    )\n    \n    # 5. Execute\n    result = await agent._execute_subtask(subtask)\n    \n    # 6. Verify\n    assert result.status == ToolResultStatus.SUCCESS\n    assert \"45\" in result.content\n    print(\"✓ ReAct loop test passed!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(test_react_loop())\n```\n\n**Expected Output**: The test should pass without errors. The agent should complete in 2 iterations, using the calculator tool and producing the final answer \"45\".\n\n**Signs of Problems**:\n- If the agent exceeds max iterations: Check parsing logic—the mock LLM response might not be parsed correctly.\n- If tool execution fails: Verify the calculator tool is properly registered and its `execute` method works.\n- If the final answer isn't captured: Ensure the parser correctly detects \"Final Answer:\" and extracts content.\n\n#### G. Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Agent gets stuck in infinite loop** | No progress detection, LLM repeats same action. | Log `previous_actions` each cycle. Check if same (tool, args) appears. | Implement duplicate action detection and inject warning observation. |\n| **LLM output not parsed correctly** | LLM formats action differently than expected. | Log raw LLM response and the extracted action_text. | Adjust regex patterns in `parse_llm_action_response` or improve JSON extraction. |\n| **Tool errors not being fed back** | ToolResult.ERROR is not formatted into observation. | Check the `ToolResult.status` and the observation formatting logic. | Ensure all ToolResult statuses are mapped to appropriate observation text. |\n| **Context window exceeded** | Conversation history grows too large. | Count tokens in prompt (use `tiktoken` or similar). | Implement history truncation: keep only last N triples, or summarize old ones. |\n| **Timeout on LLM call** | Network issue or LLM provider slow. | Wrap LLM call in `asyncio.wait_for` and catch TimeoutError. | Add retry with exponential backoff, or treat timeout as a tool error for the agent to handle. |\n\n\n## 5.3 Component: Planning & Task Decomposition (Milestone 3)\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 3\n\nThe Planning & Task Decomposition component is the **strategic cortex** of the AI Executive. While the ReAct Loop excels at tactical execution of single steps, it lacks the ability to look ahead, anticipate dependencies, and optimize the order of operations for complex, multi-faceted goals. This component gives the agent the ability to **break down ambitious objectives into manageable steps, sequence them intelligently, and adapt when reality diverges from the plan**.\n\n### Mental Model: Project Manager and Gantt Chart\n\nImagine you're a project manager handed a complex objective: \"Redesign the company website.\" You wouldn't start coding immediately. Instead, you'd create a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, listing all required activities: \"conduct user research,\" \"create wireframes,\" \"develop frontend,\" \"write content,\" \"perform QA testing.\" Crucially, you'd identify **dependencies**: wireframes must come before development, and QA can't start until development is complete. You'd then sequence these tasks into a **Gantt chart**—a visual timeline showing what runs in sequence and what can run in parallel.\n\nThe Planning component embodies this project manager. The **Planner** is responsible for creating the WBS (decomposing the goal into `SubTask` objects). The **Executor** is responsible for walking the Gantt chart (the Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG) in the correct order, dispatching each subtask to the ReAct engine, and tracking progress. When a task fails (e.g., a tool is unavailable), the manager must **replan**—adjusting the remaining work based on new information.\n\n![Task Planning DAG Example](./diagrams/diagram-planning-dag.svg)\n\n### Planner and Executor Interface\n\nThe planning subsystem is composed of two primary interfaces: the `Planner` (which creates the plan) and the `Executor` (which runs it). They operate on the core data structures `Task` and `SubTask`.\n\n#### Core Data Structures\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `SubTaskStatus` | `Enum` | The lifecycle state of a single subtask. Values: `PENDING`, `EXECUTING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`. |\n| `SubTask` | `Data Class` | An atomic unit of work within a larger task. |\n| `Task` | `Data Class` | The container for a user's original request, holding the overall goal and the decomposed subtasks. |\n| `Plan` | `Data Class` | The executable representation of a `Task`, explicitly capturing the dependency graph (`subtask_dag`) and a calculated execution order. |\n\n**`SubTask` Fields:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier (e.g., UUID or sequential number). |\n| `description` | `str` | A natural language description of what this subtask aims to accomplish. |\n| `expected_output` | `Optional[str]` | A specification of what a successful completion looks like (used for validation and LLM guidance). |\n| `tool_name` | `Optional[str]` | The name of the `Tool` to invoke for this subtask. If `None`, the subtask is a pure \"thinking\" step. |\n| `tool_args` | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | The arguments to pass to the specified tool. |\n| `dependencies` | `List[str]` | List of `SubTask.id` values that must be `COMPLETED` before this subtask can start. |\n| `status` | `SubTaskStatus` | Current execution state. |\n| `result` | `Optional[ToolResult]` | The outcome of the subtask's execution, populated once status is `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. |\n\n**`Task` Fields:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the overall task. |\n| `original_query` | `str` | The user's original input request. |\n| `goal` | `str` | A refined, actionable statement of the overall objective. |\n| `subtasks` | `List[SubTask]` | The decomposed steps. |\n| `context` | `Dict[str, Any]` | A **bag of properties** for storing shared state, intermediate results, or parameters that need to be passed between subtasks. |\n\n**`Plan` Fields:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `task_id` | `str` | References the parent `Task.id`. |\n| `subtask_dag` | `Dict[str, List[str]]` | Adjacency list representation of the dependency graph. Keys are subtask IDs, values are lists of IDs that *depend on* the key. (Alternative: keys are IDs, values are IDs they depend *on*. Our convention is `{A: [B, C]}` means B and C depend on A). |\n| `execution_order` | `List[str]` | A linearized sequence of subtask IDs (via topological sort) that respects all dependencies. This is precomputed for execution. |\n\n#### Planner Interface\n\nThe `Planner` is responsible for the `create_plan(goal)` operation.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `create_plan` | `goal: str`, `available_tools: List[Tool]`, `initial_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | `Task` | Analyzes the high-level goal, uses the LLM (or a rule-based system) to decompose it into a list of `SubTask` objects with dependencies, and returns a `Task`. |\n\n#### Executor Interface\n\nThe `Executor` is responsible for the `execute_plan(plan)` operation. In our architecture, the `Agent` class often acts as the executor, coordinating between the plan and the ReAct engine.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `execute_plan` | `task: Task`, `tool_registry: ToolRegistry`, `memory_context: Optional[str]` | `ToolResult` | Takes a `Task`, executes its subtasks in dependency order using the ReAct engine, and returns the final aggregated result. |\n| `_execute_subtask` | `subtask: SubTask`, `context: Dict[str, Any]` | `ToolResult` | **Internal.** Runs a single subtask by invoking the ReAct loop with the subtask's description as the query. Merges the subtask's `tool_args` with the shared `context`. |\n\n> **Design Insight:** The separation between `Task` (data) and `Plan` (executable blueprint) follows the classic **Strategy Pattern**. The `Task` is the problem specification, while the `Plan` is one possible solution strategy. This allows for future alternative planners (e.g., a rule-based planner for simple tasks) to generate different `Plan` structures from the same `Task`.\n\n### Planning and Execution Algorithm\n\nThe end-to-end process from user query to completed plan involves several coordinated stages.\n\n#### Stage 1: Task Decomposition (Planning)\n\n1.  **Goal Reception & Context Setup:** The `Agent` receives a `user_query`. It creates a new `Task` object, storing the `original_query` and setting the `goal` field (which may be a cleaned-up version of the query). An initial `context` dictionary is populated with any relevant information from the user's session or retrieved memories.\n2.  **LLM Prompting for Decomposition:** The `Planner` formats a prompt for the LLM containing: the `goal`, a list of available tools (names and descriptions), and instructions for decomposition. The instructions mandate the output to be a list of subtasks, each with an `id`, `description`, `expected_output`, optional `tool_name` and `tool_args`, and a list of `dependencies` by `id`.\n3.  **Structured Output Parsing:** The LLM's response is parsed (e.g., extracting a JSON list). Each parsed object is validated and used to instantiate a `SubTask` with status `PENDING`.\n4.  **Dependency Graph Construction:** The `Planner` builds the `subtask_dag` adjacency list by inverting the `dependencies` lists from each `SubTask`. It then performs a **cycle detection** algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search) to ensure the graph is acyclic. If a cycle is found, the planner attempts to break it by removing the minimal number of dependencies or requests a re-decomposition from the LLM.\n5.  **Topological Sort:** The planner runs a topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) on the DAG to produce the `execution_order` list. This order is stored within a `Plan` object linked to the `Task`.\n\n#### Stage 2: Plan Execution\n\n1.  **Executor Initialization:** The `Executor` receives the `Task` and its associated `Plan`. It sets the overall `AgentState` to `EXECUTING`.\n2.  **Iterative Subtask Processing:** The executor iterates through the `execution_order`. For each subtask ID:\n    a. **Readiness Check:** It retrieves the `SubTask` and calls `SubTask.is_ready()`, which checks if all tasks in its `dependencies` list have status `COMPLETED`. If not, the subtask's status is set to `BLOCKED`, and the executor skips to the next available task.\n    b. **Status Transition:** The ready subtask's status is updated to `EXECUTING` via a **functional update** (`Task.update_subtask(subtask.with_status(EXECUTING))`).\n    c. **Context Preparation:** The executor prepares an execution context by merging the `Task.context` (shared state) with the subtask's specific `tool_args`.\n    d. **ReAct Loop Invocation:** The executor calls `Agent._execute_subtask(subtask)`, which runs the full ReAct loop using the subtask's `description` as the query and the prepared context.\n    e. **Result Capture:** The returned `ToolResult` is attached to the subtask via another functional update (`subtask.with_result(result)`). The subtask status is set to `COMPLETED` (if `result.status` is `SUCCESS`) or `FAILED`.\n    f. **Context Update:** If the subtask succeeded, any outputs or new facts are written back into the `Task.context` dictionary so subsequent subtasks can access them.\n3.  **Parallel Execution (Optional):** The executor can identify independent subtasks (those with no dependencies on each other) and dispatch them to separate worker threads or asynchronous tasks, joining their results before proceeding to dependent tasks.\n4.  **Completion Detection:** After all subtasks in the `execution_order` have been processed (reaching `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`), the executor evaluates the overall `Task`. If all subtasks are `COMPLETED`, it aggregates the final results from the `Task.context` or the last subtask, sets `AgentState` to `FINISHED`, and returns a final `ToolResult.success()`. If any subtask `FAILED` and cannot be recovered, it transitions to `ERROR`.\n\n### DAG Representation and Execution\n\nThe Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is the mathematical model for our task dependencies. It ensures tasks are executed in a logical, deadlock-free order.\n\n**Representation:** We use an **adjacency list** stored in the `Plan.subtask_dag: Dict[str, List[str]]`. The convention `{A: [B, C]}` means \"B and C depend on A\" (A must complete before B and C). This is efficient for querying dependents.\n\n**Traversal - Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm):**\n1.  Compute the in-degree (number of dependencies) for each node.\n2.  Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0 (no dependencies).\n3.  While the queue is not empty:\n    a. Dequeue a node `n`, add it to the `execution_order`.\n    b. For each dependent `m` in `subtask_dag[n]`, decrement its in-degree.\n    c. If `m`'s in-degree becomes 0, enqueue `m`.\n4.  If the `execution_order` contains all nodes, the sort succeeded. If some nodes remain, a cycle exists.\n\n**Execution with State Management:** During execution, the `Executor` must respect the topological order but also dynamically manage state. A subtask can only run if its status is `PENDING` *and* all its dependencies are `COMPLETED`. The `SubTask.is_ready()` method encapsulates this check. The executor maintains a work queue of ready tasks, which can be processed by a pool of workers for parallelism.\n\n> **Key Challenge:** Parallel execution must handle shared access to the `Task.context` dictionary. A thread-safe structure (like `asyncio.Lock` or `threading.Lock`) or immutable updates (functional updates that create a new context dict) are required to prevent race conditions.\n\n### ADR: Replanning Trigger Strategy\n\n> **Decision: Replan on Critical Failure with Adaptive Thresholds**\n>\n> - **Context:** During plan execution, subtasks can fail for various reasons: tool errors, unexpected outputs, or changing external conditions. The agent must decide when to abandon the current plan and create a new one versus retrying the failed step or proceeding with a degraded plan.\n> - **Options Considered:**\n>     1.  **Replan on Every Failure:** Trigger a full re-decomposition whenever any subtask fails.\n>     2.  **Threshold-Based Replanning:** Replan only after N consecutive failures, or if a failure occurs in a \"critical path\" subtask.\n>     3.  **Confidence-Guided Replanning:** Use the LLM to assess the severity of the failure and decide whether to replan, retry, or adjust the goal.\n> - **Decision:** Implement **Threshold-Based Replanning** with the ability to mark subtasks as \"critical.\" The default is to replan after 3 failures of the same subtask, or immediately upon the failure of any subtask explicitly marked as critical during planning.\n> - **Rationale:** Replanning on every failure is inefficient and can lead to oscillation. Confidence-guided replanning adds significant LLM latency and complexity for marginal gain. A threshold-based approach is simple, predictable, and allows for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts) to be retried without discarding a potentially sound plan. Marking critical path tasks (those with many dependents) allows the system to recognize when a failure jeopardizes the entire plan.\n> - **Consequences:** The executor must track failure counts per subtask. The planner must optionally annotate critical subtasks (e.g., based on graph centrality). This approach may sometimes continue executing a doomed plan (Type II error) but avoids wasteful replanning (Type I error).\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Replan on Every Failure** | Maximally adaptive, quickly abandons flawed plans. | Highly unstable, wastes cycles on transient errors, can lead to infinite replanning loops. | ❌ |\n| **Threshold-Based** | Stable, predictable, efficient. Simple to implement and debug. | May persist in a failing plan for too long. Requires defining thresholds and criticality. | ✅ |\n| **Confidence-Guided** | Potentially optimal, uses LLM's contextual understanding. | High latency (extra LLM call), complex prompt engineering, can be unreliable. | ❌ |\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Mitigations\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circular Dependencies in Task Graph**\n*   **Description:** The LLM, when generating subtasks, might inadvertently create a dependency cycle (e.g., \"Task A depends on B, and B depends on A\"). This makes topological sort impossible and deadlocks execution.\n*   **Why it's Wrong:** The executor will enter an infinite loop waiting for a task that can never become ready, or the sorting algorithm will fail.\n*   **Fix:** **Always run cycle detection** after graph construction. If a cycle is found, feed the error back to the LLM with a request to break the cycle, or implement a heuristic to remove the dependency with the weakest semantic link (e.g., the one not mentioning a shared resource).\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-Decomposition (Nano-Tasks)**\n*   **Description:** The LLM breaks a simple goal into an excessive number of tiny subtasks (e.g., \"Move mouse to icon,\" \"Click mouse,\" \"Wait for dialog,\" \"Read dialog text\" for \"Open the settings menu\"). This creates overhead, consumes context window, and increases the chance of error propagation.\n*   **Why it's Wrong:** Slows execution, increases token costs, and can make the plan brittle and hard for the LLM to reason about coherently.\n*   **Fix:** In the planner's prompt, specify **granularity guidelines** (e.g., \"Each subtask should correspond to a single, meaningful tool call or a coherent unit of thought\"). Implement a post-processing step to merge overly simplistic sequential subtasks that use the same tool.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Context Loss Between Subtasks**\n*   **Description:** Subtask B needs information produced by Subtask A, but the executor fails to pass the result of A into B's execution context. The LLM running B is missing critical information.\n*   **Why it's Wrong:** The agent appears to \"forget\" what it just did, leading to incorrect actions or repeated work.\n*   **Fix:** Design a **structured context passing mechanism**. The `Task.context` dictionary is the shared blackboard. The `Executor` must explicitly extract key results from a completed subtask's `ToolResult` (or its `metadata`) and write them into `context` under agreed-upon keys (e.g., `context[\"research_findings\"]`). Subsequent subtasks' `tool_args` should be able to reference these keys via a template syntax (e.g., `{\"query\": \"{research_findings}\"}`).\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Replanning Loops**\n*   **Description:** The agent enters a cycle: Plan fails → Replan → New plan fails in a similar way → Replan again, ad infinitum. Common when the root cause is an unreachable goal or a missing tool.\n*   **Why it's Wrong:** Consumes resources without making progress. Frustrating for users.\n*   **Fix:** Implement a **global replanning limit** (e.g., maximum of 3 replans per original task). When the limit is hit, transition to a graceful failure state, inform the user, and suggest a simplified goal. Log the sequence of failed plans for analysis.\n\n![Agent Core State Machine](./diagrams/diagram-agent-state-machine.svg)\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations Table**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **DAG Management** | Custom in-memory graph using `dict` and `list`. Topological sort via Kahn's algorithm. | Use a graph library like `networkx` for robust cycle detection, centrality analysis, and visualization. |\n| **Parallel Execution** | `asyncio.gather` for I/O-bound subtask execution (e.g., tool calls). | `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks or more complex worker pools. |\n| **Context Storage** | Python `dict` for in-memory, ephemeral task context. | External key-value store (Redis) for persistent, shared context across long-running or distributed agents. |\n\n**B.

Handle exceptions within each gathered task to prevent one failure from stopping others.\n*   For functional updates on dataclasses, use `dataclasses.replace(existing_obj, field=new_value)` or create a new instance manually. This keeps your data flow predictable and thread-safe.\n*   When parsing JSON from the LLM, wrap it in a `try/except json.JSONDecodeError` and have a fallback using `extract_json_from_text()` (from Milestone 2) to handle cases where the LLM adds explanatory text around the JSON.\n*   Store the `failure_count` for replanning in the `Task.context` or a separate dictionary keyed by `subtask.id` to persist across retries.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint**\nAfter implementing the core planning classes and the agent's `run_task` method, you can verify with a simple integration test.\n\n1.  **Test Command:**\n    ```bash\n    python -m pytest tests/test_planning.py -v\n    ```\n\n2.  **Expected Behavior:** A test that creates a mock `LLMPlanner` (returning a pre-defined `Task` with 3 subtasks and dependencies) and a mock `ReActAgent` (returning successful `ToolResult`s) should:\n    *   Successfully create a `Task` from a goal string.\n    *   Build a correct `execution_order` respecting dependencies.\n    *   Execute subtasks in the correct order.\n    *   Return a final success result.\n\n3.  **Signs of Trouble:**\n    *   **Subtasks execute in wrong order:** Check your topological sort implementation and the direction of your `subtask_dag`.\n    *   **Agent gets stuck:** The `is_ready()` check might be incorrect, or a subtask status is not being updated to `COMPLETED`.\n    *   **Context not passed:** Verify that the `_execute_subtask` method correctly merges `context` into `tool_args` and that results are written back.\n\n---\n\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 4\n\n## 5.4 Component: Memory & Context Management (Milestone 4)\n\nThe Memory & Context Management system is the **historical archive and active workspace** of the AI Executive. While the ReAct loop handles immediate reasoning and the Planner builds the roadmap, the Memory system ensures the agent learns from past experiences, retains crucial context across long conversations, and efficiently manages the finite \"attention\" budget of the LLM's context window. Without sophisticated memory, an agent is amnesic—unable to build upon prior work or maintain coherent state across complex, multi-step tasks.\n\n### Mental Model: The Agent's Notebook and Filing Cabinet\n\nImagine the AI Executive as a seasoned project manager in a physical office. Their memory system operates on three distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose:\n\n1.  **Episodic/Conversation Memory (The Open Notebook):** This is the agent's immediate working space—a notebook open on the desk. It contains the *verbatim transcript* of the current conversation: every user query, every thought, every tool result, in chronological order. It's perfect for short-term recall but grows unwieldy for long sessions. Like a notebook, you can flip back to recent pages quickly, but finding a specific fact from hours ago requires a different system.\n\n2.  **Working Memory (The Whiteboard):** This is the dynamic, erasable space where the *current task's intermediate state* lives. It holds the agent's current goals, partial results, and contextual variables (e.g., \"user's name is Alice\", \"we are analyzing Q3 financial data\"). It's like a whiteboard where the manager jots down the current plan, key numbers, and temporary notes. This memory is highly contextual and typically cleared or updated when a task completes.\n\n3.  **Long-Term Memory (The Indexed Filing Cabinet):** This is the agent's institutional knowledge—a vast, organized archive. Past conversations, learned facts, and important outcomes are stored here. Unlike the notebook, you can't scan every document. Instead, you use an **index** (a vector embedding) to retrieve only the most *semantically relevant* memories when starting a new, related task. It's like having a filing cabinet where you can ask, \"Find me everything related to 'market analysis in Europe,'\" and getting the top 5 relevant reports, regardless of when they were filed.\n\nThis three-layer model balances immediacy, relevance, and persistence, allowing the agent to operate effectively across time scales. ![Multi-Layer Memory Architecture](./diagrams/diagram-memory-layers.svg)\n\n### Memory System Interfaces\n\nThe memory system is composed of three primary interfaces, each corresponding to one layer of the mental model. They are designed to be swappable, allowing different storage backends while maintaining a consistent API for the Agent Core.\n\n#### EpisodicMemory Interface\n\nThis interface manages the linear sequence of dialogue turns. Its primary responsibility is to maintain order and provide efficient access to recent history.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `append` | `role: str`, `content: str`, `metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` | `None` | Adds a new message to the conversation history. The `role` is typically \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"system\". Metadata can include timestamps, tool names, or other contextual tags. |\n| `get_messages` | `limit: Optional[int] = None`, `since: Optional[int] = 0` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | Retrieves the most recent `limit` messages, optionally starting from index `since`. Each message is a dictionary with `role`, `content`, and `metadata` fields. |\n| `clear` | - | `None` | Clears the entire conversation history, typically at the start of a new, unrelated session. |\n| `get_recent` | `max_tokens: int` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | A critical method for context window management. Returns the most recent messages whose *total token count* does not exceed `max_tokens`. It may return a partial last message or skip older ones to fit the budget. |\n\n**Associated Data Structure:** While the interface returns generic dictionaries, the internal storage often uses a `MemoryEntry`.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the memory entry (e.g., UUID). |\n| `content` | `str` | The textual content of the memory (the message text). |\n| `timestamp` | `datetime` | When this memory was recorded. |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Flexible bag of properties (e.g., `{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_used\": \"web_search\"}`). |\n| `embedding` | `Optional[List[float]]` | **For long-term memory only.** The vector embedding of the content, used for semantic search. For episodic memory, this is usually `None`. |\n\n#### WorkingMemory Interface\n\nThis interface manages the task-scoped, mutable state. It acts like a key-value store for the current execution context.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `get` | `key: str`, `default: Any = None` | `Any` | Retrieves a value stored under the given `key`. Returns `default` if the key doesn't exist. |\n| `set` | `key: str`, `value: Any` | `None` | Stores a `value` under the given `key`. Overwrites any existing value. |\n| `update` | `mapping: Dict[str, Any]` | `None` | Batch updates multiple key-value pairs from the provided dictionary. |\n| `clear` | - | `None` | Clears all key-value pairs, typically invoked when a task is completed or a new top-level goal is received. |\n| `to_dict` | - | `Dict[str, Any]` | Returns a copy of the entire working memory as a dictionary, useful for serialization or debugging. |\n\n#### LongTermMemory Interface\n\nThis interface provides semantic search over a persistent store of past memories. It is the most complex layer, involving embeddings and vector similarity.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `store` | `content: str`, `metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None` | `str` (ID) | Stores a piece of information (e.g., a conversation summary or a key fact). The system should automatically generate an embedding for the `content`. Returns a unique ID for the stored memory. |\n| `query` | `query_text: str`, `limit: int = 5`, `threshold: Optional[float] = None` | `List[MemoryEntry]` | The core retrieval operation. Takes a query string, converts it to an embedding, and performs a similarity search against stored memories. Returns the top-`limit` most relevant `MemoryEntry` objects, optionally filtered by a similarity score `threshold`. |\n| `delete` | `memory_id: str` | `bool` | Deletes the memory with the given ID. Returns `True` if successful. |\n| `summarize_recent` | `max_memories: int = 100` | `str` | An optional but valuable method. Creates a concise textual summary of the most recent `max_memories` entries. This summary can then be `store`d as a new memory, compressing history. |\n\n### Memory Retrieval and Compression\n\nThe true power of the memory system lies not just in storage, but in the intelligent processes of **retrieval** (finding the right memories at the right time) and **compression** (managing the context window limit). These processes form a continuous cycle during agent operation.\n\n#### Memory Retrieval Algorithm\nWhen the Agent Core prepares a prompt for the LLM (e.g., within `ReActAgent._format_react_prompt`), it must enrich the prompt with relevant context. This follows a multi-source retrieval strategy:\n\n1.  **Extract Query Keywords:** From the current `ReActLoopContext` (specifically the `subtask_description` and recent conversation turns), extract a set of keywords or rephrase the current goal into a concise query string (e.g., \"current user question: {subtask_description}\").\n\n2.  **Query Long-Term Memory:** Pass the query string to `LongTermMemory.query()`. This performs a vector similarity search, returning a list of semantically related past `MemoryEntry` objects.\n\n3.  **Filter and Format:** Process the retrieved memories:\n    *   Remove duplicates or extremely similar entries.\n    *   Format each memory into a natural language string suitable for inclusion in the prompt (e.g., `\"[Memory from past session] User asked about Python decorators. We explained the @ syntax and gave examples.\"`).\n    *   Optionally, include relevance scores or timestamps as metadata in the formatted text.\n\n4.  **Retrieve Recent Episodic Memory:** Call `EpisodicMemory.get_recent(max_tokens=recent_budget)` to get the most recent turns of the current conversation. This provides immediate continuity.\n\n5.  **Inject Working Memory:** Serialize the contents of `WorkingMemory.to_dict()` into a structured string (e.g., `\"Current Context: user_name=Alice, analysis_target=Q3_sales\"`).\n\n6.  **Assemble Context Window:** The final prompt is assembled by concatenating, in order:\n    a. **System Instructions** (fixed).\n    b. **Working Memory Context**.\n    c. **Retrieved Long-Term Memories** (if any).\n    d. **Recent Episodic Memory**.\n    e. **Current Step Instructions** (e.g., the ReAct template).\n\n    The total token count of (a) through (e) must be less than the LLM's context limit, leaving room for the LLM's response.\n\n#### Memory Compression and Eviction Strategy\nAs conversations grow long, the episodic memory buffer will eventually exceed the token budget. A naive \"last-N\" truncation risks losing critical information from earlier in the dialogue. A more sophisticated strategy involves compression:\n\n1.  **Monitor Token Usage:** After each agent turn, calculate the total tokens of the full episodic history.\n2.  **Trigger Compression:** When the history exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 70% of the context window), initiate compression.\n3.  **Summarize Old Turns:** Select the oldest contiguous segment of conversation (e.g., the first 10 turns) that hasn't been summarized yet.\n4.  **Generate Summary:** Use the LLM itself (with a dedicated prompt) to produce a concise, third-person summary of that segment (e.g., \"The user introduced themselves as Bob and asked for an overview of project management methodologies. The agent explained Agile and Waterfall.\").\n5.  **Store and Replace:**\n    *   `store` the generated summary in **LongTermMemory**, ensuring it's available for future retrieval.\n    *   Replace the original, verbose conversation turns in **EpisodicMemory** with a single *pointer message*, like `\"[Earlier conversation summarized: {summary_text}]\"`. This pointer is much shorter but preserves the semantic gist.\n6.  **Repeat:** Continue this process, sliding the compression window forward, as the conversation grows.\n\n> **Design Insight:** This compression strategy transforms the memory system from a passive log into an active, lossy compressor. It prioritizes *recent detail* and *summarized relevance* over *complete verbatim history*, which aligns well with how human memory works and is a practical necessity given token limits.\n\n### Storage Backends and Choices\n\nEach memory layer can be backed by different storage technologies, depending on the required persistence, performance, and complexity.\n\n| Layer | Simple Option (Development/Prototyping) | Advanced Option (Production) | Rationale |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Episodic Memory** | **In-memory list (`list`)**. Fast, no setup, but lost on restart. | **Persistent queue (Redis, SQLite)**. Survives restarts, enables session resumption. | Episodic memory is transient by nature (per session). In-memory is sufficient for most single-session agent tasks. Persistence is needed for long-running or stateful applications. |\n| **Working Memory** | **In-memory dictionary (`dict`)**. Simple, fast, co-located with agent state. | **Shared key-value store (Redis)**. Allows multiple agents or processes to share context. | Working memory is inherently transient and task-scoped. A `dict` is perfectly adequate unless you need cross-process or cross-agent coordination. |\n| **Long-Term Memory** | **In-memory vector store with sentence-transformers (FAISS)**. Runs entirely in-process, good for demos. | **Dedicated vector database (Chroma, Weaviate, Pinecone)**. Offers persistence, scalability, advanced query features, and easier management of large memory corpora. | The core challenge is semantic search. FAISS + sentence-transformers is a powerful, standalone combo. A dedicated DB simplifies operations at scale and provides better tooling for updates and deletions. |\n\n**Embedding Model Choice:** The quality of long-term memory retrieval hinges on the embedding model. For an all-Python stack, the `sentence-transformers` library (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) provides excellent quality and speed locally. For maximum compatibility with LLM APIs, using the same provider's embedding API (e.g., OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`) ensures consistency but adds latency and cost.\n\n### ADR: Context Window Management Strategy\n\n> **Decision: Hybrid Sliding Window with LLM-Based Summarization for Episodic Memory**\n\n*   **Context:** LLMs have a fixed context window (e.g., 4K, 8K, 128K tokens). The agent's conversation history, tool outputs, and retrieved memories can easily exceed this limit. We need a strategy to decide what information to include in each prompt to the LLM without losing critical context.\n*   **Options Considered:**\n    1.  **Naive Truncation (Keep Last N Tokens):** Always include the most recent N tokens from the episodic memory, discarding the oldest.\n    2.  **Recursive Summarization:** After each agent turn, use the LLM to summarize the entire conversation so far into a fixed-length summary. Use only this summary as context for the next turn.\n    3.  **Hybrid Sliding Window with Summarization:** Maintain a sliding window of recent, verbatim turns. When the window is full, summarize the oldest segment, store the summary in long-term memory, and replace the original turns with a short pointer.\n*   **Decision:** **Option 3 (Hybrid Sliding Window with Summarization)**.\n*   **Rationale:**\n    *   **Option 1** is simple but suffers from **catastrophic forgetting**. Crucial details established early in a long task (e.g., \"the user's name is Alice\") are permanently lost once pushed out of the window.\n    *   **Option 2** maintains a very compact state but is **lossy by construction**. Every summarization step discards information, and errors in summarization compound. It also requires an LLM call on *every* turn, increasing cost and latency.\n    *   **Option 3** offers the best balance. It preserves **high fidelity for recent interactions** (critical for step-by-step reasoning), while **conserving the semantic essence of older interactions** via summaries stored in long-term memory. The summaries are retrievable via semantic search if they become relevant again. The summarization cost is amortized over many turns, only paid when necessary.\n*   **Consequences:**\n    *   **Enables:** Long-running, coherent dialogues that can reference early details via summary recall. Efficient use of the context window.\n    *   **Trade-offs:** Increased implementation complexity. Introduces a delay during summarization steps. Requires careful prompt engineering for the summarization task to avoid losing important nuance.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Naive Truncation** | Extremely simple, zero overhead. | Catastrophic forgetting, poor performance on long tasks. | ❌ |\n| **Recursive Summarization** | Constant, predictable context size. | Highly lossy, compounding errors, high latency/cost. | ❌ |\n| **Hybrid Sliding Window** | Balances recency and persistence, scalable. | Complex to implement, requires summarization prompts. | ✅ |\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Mitigations\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unbounded Memory Growth Without Cleanup**\n*   **Description:** Storing every interaction in episodic or long-term memory indefinitely without any eviction or summarization policy.\n*   **Why It's Wrong:** Leads to ballooning memory usage, slowing down retrievals (especially for vector searches over huge datasets), and eventually hitting storage limits. It also pollutes the memory with irrelevant, outdated information, reducing retrieval quality.\n*   **Fix:** Implement **automatic summarization and eviction policies**. For episodic memory, use the hybrid sliding window. For long-term memory, implement a **least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy** or **time-based expiration** for certain types of memories. Periodically run a cleanup job that removes low-importance or very old entries.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Retrieved Memories Are Not Relevant to the Current Task**\n*   **Description:** The vector search returns past memories that are semantically similar at the word level but not contextually useful (e.g., retrieving a memory about \"Python\" when the task is about \"snakes\").\n*   **Why It's Wrong:** Irrelevant memories waste precious context window tokens and can confuse the LLM, leading to incoherent or off-topic responses.\n*   **Fix:** **Improve the query formulation.** Don't just use the current subtask description. Augment the query with metadata filters (e.g., only retrieve memories from the same user or session) or use a more sophisticated query expansion technique (e.g., generate multiple query aspects from the current context). **Tune the similarity threshold** to be more restrictive.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Lossy Summarization Discards Critical Details**\n*   **Description:** The LLM-based summarization step oversimplifies or omits key facts, numbers, or instructions from the original conversation.\n*   **Why It's Wrong:** When the agent later relies on the summary, it may act on incorrect or incomplete information, leading to task failure.\n*   **Fix:** **Craft a detailed summarization prompt.** Explicitly instruct the LLM to preserve specific types of information: names, numbers, dates, URLs, and explicit user instructions. **Store critical facts separately.** Extract key entities (using an NER tool or the LLM) and store them as structured key-value pairs in working memory or a dedicated fact store, rather than relying solely on the narrative summary.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: High Latency from Vector Database Calls**\n*   **Description:** Every call to `LongTermMemory.query()` involves a network round-trip to an external vector database, adding hundreds of milliseconds to each agent cycle.\n*   **Why It's Wrong:** Makes the agent feel sluggish and severely impacts performance for tasks requiring many reasoning cycles.\n*   **Fix:** **Implement caching.** Cache the results of frequent or similar queries in-memory. **Batch retrievals.** If the agent's plan is known, pre-fetch potentially relevant memories at the start of a task phase. **Use a local vector store** (FAISS) for development and smaller deployments to eliminate network latency entirely.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints (Python)\n\n*   **Token Counting:** Use the `tiktoken` library for OpenAI models or `transformers` for open-source models to accurately count tokens. Create a utility function `estimate_tokens(text: str) -> int`.\n*   **FAISS Installation:** For most setups, `pip install faiss-cpu` is sufficient. For GPU acceleration, use `faiss-gpu` but note the compatibility challenges.\n*   **SentenceTransformers Caching:** The first call to `SentenceTransformer.encode()` downloads the model (if not cached). Specify `cache_folder` in the constructor to control where models are stored.\n*   **Thread Safety:** The in-memory implementations (`ListEpisodicMemory`, `DictWorkingMemory`) are not thread-safe. If your agent runs in a multi-threaded environment (e.g., handling multiple requests), use threading locks (`threading.RLock`) or switch to a thread-safe backend like Redis.\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the core memory components, verify the system with a simple test script:\n\n```python\n# test_memory.py\nfrom memory.episodic import ListEpisodicMemory\nfrom memory.working import DictWorkingMemory\nfrom memory.long_term import FAISSMemory\n\nepisodic = ListEpisodicMemory()\nworking = DictWorkingMemory()\nlong_term = FAISSMemory()\n\n# Test episodic memory\nepisodic.append(\"user\", \"Hello, my name is Alice.\")\nepisodic.append(\"assistant\", \"Hi Alice! How can I help?\")\nprint(\"Episodic recent:\", episodic.get_recent(max_tokens=50))\n\n# Test working memory\nworking.set(\"user_name\", \"Alice\")\nworking.set(\"current_task\", \"research\")\nprint(\"Working memory:\", working.to_dict())\n\n# Test long-term memory (may take a moment to load model)\nmem_id = long_term.store(\"Alice prefers summaries in bullet points.\")\nresults = long_term.query(\"user preferences\", limit=1)\nprint(\"Long-term query result:\", results[0].content if results else \"None\")\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:** The script should run without errors. The episodic memory should return the two messages (or a truncated version if token limit is very low). The working memory should print the dictionary. The long-term memory should store and retrieve the memory about Alice's preference.\n\n**Signs of Trouble:**\n*   **FAISS import error:** Check installation (`pip install faiss-cpu`).\n*   **SentenceTransformer download hanging:** Check internet connection or set `cache_folder`.\n*   **No long-term results returned:** The query might not be similar enough; try querying with \"bullet points\" instead.\n\n\n## 5.5 Component: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5)\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 5\n\nThe Multi-Agent Collaboration component transforms the framework from a solo executive into a coordinated team. While a single agent can handle many tasks, complex real-world problems often require specialized expertise working in concert—much like a software project needs developers, designers, and testers collaborating. This component provides the communication protocols, role management, and orchestration patterns that enable multiple AI agents to work together toward a common goal, distributing cognitive load and leveraging specialized capabilities.\n\n### Mental Model: A Corporate Department\n\nImagine a corporate department working on a complex project. There's a **department manager** (the orchestrator) who receives the high-level objective from leadership. The manager breaks the project down into specialized tasks and assigns them to team members based on their roles: a **researcher** gathers information, a **writer** drafts content, a **software engineer** writes code, and a **quality analyst** tests the results. Team members communicate through structured channels (email, meetings, shared documents), report progress back to the manager, and occasionally collaborate directly when their work intersects. The manager tracks overall progress, resolves conflicts, and integrates everyone's contributions into the final deliverable.\n\nIn our framework, this mental model maps directly:\n- **Orchestrator Agent** = Department manager: oversees the overall task, decomposes work, assigns subtasks, and synthesizes final results\n- **Specialized Worker Agents** = Team members: each has a specific role (Researcher, Writer, Coder, Validator) with a tailored set of tools and expertise\n- **Communication Protocol** = Corporate communication channels: structured messages that pass requests, data, and results between agents\n- **Shared Context** = Shared documents and meetings: common workspace where agents can access relevant information and intermediate outputs\n- **Role Assignment** = Job descriptions and organizational chart: defines each agent's capabilities and responsibilities\n\nThis corporate metaphor helps visualize how autonomy and coordination balance each other: each agent operates independently within its domain while remaining aligned toward the shared objective through clear communication and managerial oversight.\n\n### Communication Protocol and Roles\n\nEffective collaboration requires a **structured communication protocol** that defines how agents exchange information. Unlike human teams that can interpret vague instructions, AI agents need unambiguous message formats with clear semantics. The protocol must support request-response patterns, broadcast announcements, and error notifications while maintaining context across conversations.\n\n#### Message Structure\n\nEvery inter-agent communication uses the `Message` data structure, which provides the necessary metadata for routing, correlation, and interpretation:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `sender_id` | `str` | Unique identifier of the sending agent (e.g., \"orchestrator\", \"researcher_agent_1\") |\n| `receiver_id` | `str` | Identifier of the intended recipient agent, or `\"broadcast\"` for all agents |\n| `message_type` | `str` | Semantic type of message, determines how content is interpreted. Common types: `\"task_request\"`, `\"task_response\"`, `\"status_update\"`, `\"error\"`, `\"information_share\"` |\n| `content` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Structured payload of the message. Format varies by `message_type` but must be JSON-serializable |\n| `timestamp` | `datetime` | When the message was created, used for ordering and timeouts |\n| `correlation_id` | `Optional[str]` | Links a response to its original request, enabling request-response tracking |\n\nFor `message_type = \"task_request\"`, the content dictionary typically includes:\n- `\"task_id\"`: Unique identifier for this task instance\n- `\"subtask_description\"`: Natural language description of what needs to be done\n- `\"expected_output\"`: Optional specification of what format the result should take\n- `\"deadline\"`: Optional timestamp by when the task should be completed\n- `\"context\"`: Relevant background information or prerequisites\n\nFor `message_type = \"task_response\"`, the content includes:\n- `\"task_id\"`: Echoes the original task identifier\n- `\"result\"`: The `ToolResult` object (or its serialized form) containing the output\n- `\"status\"`: Completion status (e.g., \"success\", \"partial\", \"failed\")\n\n#### Role Assignment and Capability Advertisement\n\nEach agent has a defined **Role** that dictates its specialization and advertised capabilities. A role is more than just a label—it defines:\n\n1. **Tool Set**: Which tools the agent has access to (a Researcher agent might have web search, database query, and summarization tools)\n2. **Prompt Templates**: Role-specific instructions that shape how the agent interprets tasks (a Writer agent might be prompted to focus on clarity and structure)\n3. **Communication Patterns**: Which message types the agent can send/receive and to whom\n4. **Performance Characteristics**: Expected latency, cost constraints, or quality trade-offs\n\nThe role assignment is typically configured at agent creation and registered with the orchestrator:\n\n| Agent ID | Assigned Role | Advertised Capabilities (Tools) | Special Instructions |\n|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|\n| `agent_researcher_1` | `\"Researcher\"` | `[\"web_search\", \"wikipedia_lookup\", \"document_summarizer\"]` | \"Focus on factual accuracy, cite sources\" |\n| `agent_writer_1` | `\"Writer\"` | `[\"draft_outline\", \"write_section\", \"proofread\"]` | \"Maintain consistent tone, avoid jargon\" |\n| `agent_coder_1` | `\"Software Engineer\"` | `[\"code_generator\", \"code_executor\", \"debugger\"]` | \"Write clean, commented code with error handling\" |\n| `agent_validator_1` | `\"Quality Analyst\"` | `[\"unit_test_generator\", \"code_reviewer\", \"fact_checker\"]` | \"Be thorough, identify edge cases\" |\n\n> **Key Insight**: Role-based specialization reduces cognitive load on individual agents. Instead of every agent needing to master all tools, each focuses on a domain, leading to more reliable tool use and less hallucination of inappropriate actions. The orchestrator's job is to match tasks to roles, not to micromanage how each agent accomplishes its work.\n\n### Orchestration and Delegation Flow\n\nThe orchestrator agent coordinates the multi-agent system using a well-defined flow that balances autonomy with oversight. This flow ensures tasks are completed efficiently while maintaining coherence across contributions.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Orchestration Algorithm\n\n1. **Task Reception & Analysis**\n   - The orchestrator receives a user query through its `Agent.run_task()` method\n   - It analyzes the query to determine if multi-agent collaboration is needed (complexity threshold, multiple domains involved)\n   - If single-agent suffices, it processes the task directly using its internal ReAct loop\n\n2. **Task Decomposition & Role Matching**\n   - The orchestrator uses its `Planner.create_plan()` method to break the complex task into subtasks\n   - For each subtask, it identifies the required capabilities (tools needed)\n   - It matches these capability requirements against registered agent roles to assign each subtask to the most suitable agent\n   - Subtasks with dependencies are linked in a **task dependency graph**\n\n3. **Task Distribution & Communication**\n   - The orchestrator sends `\"task_request\"` messages to the assigned agents, including:\n     - The subtask description and expected output format\n     - Any context or prerequisites (e.g., \"use the research results from agent_researcher_1\")\n     - Deadline and priority information\n   - Each message includes a unique `correlation_id` for tracking\n\n4. **Parallel Execution with Monitoring**\n   - Worker agents receive their tasks and execute them independently using their own ReAct loops\n   - Agents may communicate directly with each other for coordination (e.g., a writer requesting clarification from a researcher)\n   - The orchestrator monitors progress through:\n     - Periodic `\"status_update\"` messages from workers\n     - Timeout tracking for each outstanding task\n     - Watching for `\"error\"` messages indicating problems\n\n5. **Result Collection & Conflict Resolution**\n   - As workers complete tasks, they send `\"task_response\"` messages back to the orchestrator\n   - The orchestrator validates each result against the expected output criteria\n   - If results conflict (e.g., researcher and validator disagree on a fact), the orchestrator:\n     - Applies predefined conflict resolution strategies (majority vote, confidence scoring, or requesting human input)\n     - May trigger additional verification tasks\n   - Results are stored in a **shared context** accessible to all agents working on related subtasks\n\n6. **Synthesis & Final Output Generation**\n   - Once all subtasks are complete, the orchestrator synthesizes the individual results\n   - It may perform final integration tasks (formatting, consistency checks, executive summary)\n   - The orchestrator returns the final result through `Agent.run_task()`\n\n7. **Cleanup & Learning**\n   - The orchestrator archives the complete interaction for future reference\n   - Performance metrics are recorded (task completion time, success rates per agent)\n   - If configured, the system updates agent role assignments or tool sets based on observed performance\n\n#### Shared Context Management\n\nA critical challenge in multi-agent systems is maintaining **shared context**—ensuring all agents working on related aspects have access to relevant information without overwhelming them. Our framework implements a hybrid approach:\n\n- **Orchestrator-Managed Context**: The orchestrator maintains a central `Dict[str, Any]` of key findings, decisions, and artifacts\n- **Selective Broadcast**: When an agent produces a result relevant to others, the orchestrator broadcasts an `\"information_share\"` message with the essential data\n- **On-Demand Querying**: Agents can request specific context elements from the orchestrator via `\"context_request\"` messages\n- **Versioning**: Context items are timestamped and versioned to prevent stale information from causing conflicts\n\nThis approach avoids the bottleneck of requiring all communication to flow through the orchestrator while still maintaining coherence.\n\n### Common Orchestration Patterns\n\nDifferent collaboration scenarios call for different orchestration patterns. Our framework supports three primary patterns that can be mixed and matched.\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical (Manager-Worker) Pattern\n\nThe most common pattern, matching our corporate department metaphor:\n\n- **Structure**: Single orchestrator at the root, multiple specialized workers as leaves\n- **Communication Flow**: All task assignments flow from orchestrator to workers; all results flow back to orchestrator\n- **Coordination**: Workers typically don't communicate directly with each other\n- **Best For**: Well-structured tasks with clear decomposition, centralized quality control\n- **Example**: Writing a technical report (orchestrator → researcher → writer → validator)\n\n#### 2. Broadcast (Committee) Pattern\n\nUseful for consensus-building or gathering diverse perspectives:\n\n- **Structure**: No single orchestrator; all agents have equal standing\n- **Communication Flow**: Any agent can broadcast messages to all others\n- **Coordination**: Agents self-organize through voting or reputation systems\n- **Best For**: Subjective tasks, creative brainstorming, error detection\n- **Example**: Code review where multiple engineers independently review then discuss\n\n#### 3. Market-Based (Auction) Pattern\n\nEfficient for resource-constrained environments or when agents have overlapping capabilities:\n\n- **Structure**: Task issuer (could be orchestrator or any agent) acts as auctioneer\n- **Communication Flow**: Task issuer broadcasts task requirements; agents bid with estimated cost/quality/timeline; issuer selects best bid\n- **Coordination**: Market dynamics (supply/demand) determine task allocation\n- **Best For**: Load balancing, cost optimization, real-time task scheduling\n- **Example**: Processing a batch of heterogeneous data analysis tasks where agents have varying availability\n\n![Multi-Agent Hierarchical Orchestration](./diagrams/diagram-multi-agent-org.svg)\n\n### ADR: Agent-to-Agent Communication Medium\n\n> **Decision: Message Bus with Topic-Based Routing**\n>\n> - **Context**: Multiple agents need to communicate asynchronously in various patterns (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). The communication medium must support decoupled interaction, scalability, and flexible routing while maintaining message ordering guarantees for correlated conversations.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Direct Method Calls**: Each agent maintains references to other agents and calls their methods directly\n>   2. **Shared Blackboard**: Centralized key-value store where agents post and read messages\n>   3. **Message Bus with Topics**: Publish-subscribe system where agents send messages to topics and receive messages from subscribed topics\n> - **Decision**: Implement a lightweight in-memory message bus with topic-based routing, where each agent has an inbox topic and system-wide broadcast topics exist for announcements.\n> - **Rationale**:\n>   - **Decoupling**: Agents don't need direct references to each other, enabling dynamic agent addition/removal\n>   - **Flexibility**: Supports multiple communication patterns (broadcast via system topics, direct via agent-specific topics)\n>   - **Ordering Guarantees**: Messages to a single topic can be processed in order, maintaining conversation coherence\n>   - **Debugging**: Centralized message logging provides visibility into all inter-agent communication\n>   - **Future Extensibility**: Can be replaced with distributed message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ) for multi-process deployment\n> - **Consequences**:\n>   - Adds message routing overhead compared to direct calls\n>   - Requires careful topic naming conventions to avoid collisions\n>   - Need to handle message persistence for crash recovery if required\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| **Direct Method Calls** | - Minimal latency<br>- Simple implementation<br>- Strong typing | - Tight coupling between agents<br>- Difficult to add/remove agents dynamically<br>- Doesn't support broadcast patterns<br>- Deadlock risk if circular calls | ❌ |\n| **Shared Blackboard** | - Centralized state easy to monitor<br>- Simple persistence<br>- Natural fit for shared context | - Becomes bottleneck with many agents<br>- No built-in notification mechanism (polling required)<br>- Race conditions on concurrent writes | ❌ |\n| **Message Bus with Topics** | - Loose coupling between agents<br>- Natural support for multiple patterns<br>- Scalable with topic partitioning<br>- Built-in async processing | - Additional abstraction layer<br>- Message serialization overhead<br>- Requires message format standardization | ✅ |\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Mitigations\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Delegation Loops (A delegates to B delegates to A)**\n- **Description**: Agent A receives a task, decides it's outside its expertise, delegates to Agent B. Agent B similarly decides the task is outside its expertise and delegates back to Agent A, creating an infinite loop.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The system consumes resources without making progress, eventually timing out or crashing.\n- **Mitigation**: \n  1. **Delegation Chain Tracking**: Include the delegation path in task requests; reject requests that would create a cycle\n  2. **Fallback Responsibility**: Each agent must have a \"last resort\" handling for its domain rather than always delegating\n  3. **Orchestrator Oversight**: The orchestrator monitors delegation patterns and intervenes when cycles are detected\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Orchestrator Bottleneck**\n- **Description**: All communication flows through the orchestrator, which becomes overwhelmed as the number of agents or message frequency increases.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Scalability is limited, latency increases, and the orchestrator becomes a single point of failure.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  1. **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Allow agents to communicate directly for coordination within their workgroup\n  2. **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Create sub-orchestrators for domains, reducing the load on the root orchestrator\n  3. **Async Non-Blocking Processing**: Use message queues so the orchestrator processes messages asynchronously without blocking\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Lack of Shared Context**\n- **Description**: Agents work in isolation without awareness of what others have discovered or decided, leading to contradictory outputs or redundant work.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Final synthesis is difficult or impossible; agents waste effort rediscovering what others already know.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  1. **Mandatory Context Sharing**: Require agents to publish key findings to a shared context store\n  2. **Context Injection**: Automatically inject relevant shared context into each agent's prompt\n  3. **Consistency Checking**: Orchestrator validates that new results don't contradict established facts\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unresponsive Agents**\n- **Description**: An agent crashes, hangs, or becomes unreachable, leaving its assigned tasks incomplete and blocking dependent tasks.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The entire workflow stalls; timeout mechanisms may help but don't recover the partial work.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  1. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Agents periodically send \"alive\" signals; orchestrator reassigns tasks from unresponsive agents\n  2. **Checkpointing**: Agents periodically save intermediate state so work can be resumed by another agent\n  3. **Task Redundancy**: Assign critical tasks to multiple agents and use the first completed result\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Conflicting Outputs Without Resolution**\n- **Description**: Different agents produce contradictory results (e.g., Researcher says \"X is true,\" Validator says \"X is false\"), and no mechanism exists to resolve the conflict.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The orchestrator cannot synthesize a coherent final answer; may arbitrarily pick one result.\n- **Mitigation**:\n  1. **Predefined Conflict Resolution Strategies**: Implement rules (majority vote, confidence scoring, source authority ranking)\n  2. **Escalation to Human**: When automated resolution fails, pause and request human input\n  3. **Verification Subtasks**: Generate additional validation tasks to gather more evidence\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A.

Python-Specific Hints\n\n1. **Async/Await Patterns**: Use `asyncio.gather()` to wait for multiple agent responses concurrently, but be careful with error handling—wrap each in `try/except` to prevent one failure from crashing all.\n\n2. **Message Serialization**: Use `json.dumps()` for message serialization, but be aware that datetime objects and custom types need special handling. Consider implementing custom JSONEncoder.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Use `asyncio.BoundedSemaphore` to limit concurrent tasks per agent, preventing overload.\n\n4. **Timeout Handling**: Always use `asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout)` when waiting for agent responses, with a reasonable default timeout (e.g., 30-60 seconds for most tasks).\n\n5. **Error Isolation**: Wrap each agent's execution in `try/except` to prevent a misbehaving agent from crashing the entire orchestrator.\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint\n\n**Verification Command:**\n```bash\npython -m pytest tests/test_multi_agent.py -v -k \"test_orchestration_delegation\"\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n```\ntest_orchestration_delegation PASSED\ntest_worker_accepts_task PASSED\ntest_conflict_resolution PASSED\ntest_message_bus_routing PASSED\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. Start a test script that creates an orchestrator, researcher, and writer agent\n2. Submit a task: \"Research climate change impacts and write a 3-paragraph summary\"\n3. Observe in logs:\n   - Orchestrator decomposes task into research and writing subtasks\n   - Orchestrator sends task_request to researcher\n   - Researcher performs web search, sends task_response with findings\n   - Orchestrator sends task_request to writer with researcher's findings\n   - Writer produces summary, sends task_response\n   - Orchestrator returns final summary\n4. Verify the final summary incorporates research findings\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- **Agents not receiving messages**: Check topic subscriptions and message bus initialization\n- **Tasks stuck pending**: Check dependency resolution and agent capacity limits\n- **Conflicting results not resolved**: Verify conflict resolution strategy is configured\n- **High memory usage**: Ensure completed tasks are cleaned up from tracking dictionaries\n\n#### G. Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Delegation loop** | Agents keep delegating same task back and forth | Check message logs for repeating `task_request` patterns between same agents | Implement delegation chain tracking; add fallback responsibility |\n| **Orchestrator unresponsive** | Message queue overflow or deadlock | Check orchestrator's message queue size; look for blocking operations in message handlers | Use async non-blocking patterns; increase queue size; add deadlock detection |\n| **Worker agent ignores tasks** | Incorrect topic subscription or message handler not registered | Verify agent is subscribed to correct topic; check if message handler is called | Ensure proper subscription in agent initialization; add message receipt logging |\n| **Shared context outdated** | Agents not publishing findings or context not being distributed | Check if agents send `information_share` messages; verify context injection in prompts | Make context sharing mandatory; add version checks to context items |\n| **Conflict resolution fails** | Resolution strategy not defined or contradictory results with equal confidence | Log conflict details and resolution attempt; check if strategy exists for this result type | Implement fallback strategy (human escalation); add confidence calibration |\n| **Tasks complete but final synthesis poor** | Orchestrator not properly integrating results or losing context between steps | Check orchestrator's synthesis logic; verify all relevant results are passed to final step | Improve synthesis prompt; add validation step before final output |\n\n\n## 6. Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 2, 3, 5\n\nThis section traces the end-to-end flow of data and control through the framework for two key scenarios: a single agent completing a complex task and multiple agents collaborating. Understanding these flows is critical for debugging, performance optimization, and extending the system—it shows how the architectural components we've designed actually work together in practice.\n\n### Single-Agent Task Execution Flow\n\n**Mental Model: The Executive's Workday**  \nImagine our AI Executive arriving at work with a single complex assignment: \"Research the latest developments in quantum computing and write a summary report.\" The Executive doesn't try to do everything at once. Instead, they:\n\n1. **Plan their day** (Task Decomposition): Break the assignment into manageable steps: research → outline → draft → edit\n2. **Work through each step** (ReAct Loop): For \"research,\" they think about what to search for, use search tools, read results, then decide what's relevant\n3. **Keep notes** (Memory): They jot down key findings, maintain current draft sections, and reference past similar reports\n4. **Use specialized tools** (Tool System): They use different tools for different steps—web search, document editing, grammar checking\n\nThis disciplined workflow ensures methodical progress without getting overwhelmed by complexity.\n\n#### High-Level Component Interaction\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how data flows through the system components when processing a single user query:\n\n![System Component Diagram](./diagrams/diagram-system-component.svg)\n\n#### Detailed Step-by-Step Flow\n\nLet's trace through a concrete example where a user submits the query: *\"What were the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis? Summarize in bullet points and include at least three reputable sources.\"*\n\n**1. Initialization and Context Setup**\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 1 | User Interface | Calls `Agent.run_task(user_query)` with the query string | User query passed to Agent Core |\n| 2 | Agent Core | Creates initial `AgentState.PLANNING`, initializes empty `WorkingMemory` for this task | `AgentState` transitions from `IDLE` to `PLANNING` |\n| 3 | Memory System | `MemoryRetriever.retrieve_context()` is called with the query | Context string containing relevant past conversations from `LongTermMemory` and recent messages from `EpisodicMemory` |\n| 4 | Agent Core | Packages query + retrieved context into a `Task` object with only the `original_query` and `goal` fields populated | `Task(id=\"task_001\", original_query=..., goal=\"...\", subtasks=[], context={...})` |\n\n**2. Planning Phase (Milestone 3)**\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 5 | Planner | `Planner.create_plan(goal, available_tools, initial_context)` is invoked | LLM is prompted to decompose the goal into subtasks |\n| 6 | LLM Provider | Returns structured decomposition: 1) Search for causes 2) Validate source credibility 3) Draft summary 4) Format bullets | JSON array of subtask descriptions with dependencies |\n| 7 | Planner | Creates `SubTask` objects for each step, sets initial `SubTaskStatus.PENDING`, builds dependency graph | `Task` object now has populated `subtasks` list with 4 `SubTask` instances |\n| 8 | Planner | Performs topological sort on dependency graph to determine `execution_order` | `Plan` object with `subtask_dag` and `execution_order` |\n| 9 | Agent Core | Updates `AgentState` to `EXECUTING` and selects first ready subtask | `AgentState.EXECUTING`, first subtask ID selected |\n\n**3. ReAct Loop Execution for a Subtask (Milestone 2)**\n\nNow the agent executes the first subtask: *\"Search the web for main causes of 2008 financial crisis, focusing on authoritative sources\"*\n\nThe following sequence diagram illustrates the Think-Act-Observe cycle:\n\n![ReAct Loop Sequence Diagram](./diagrams/diagram-react-sequence.svg)\n\nHere's the detailed numbered algorithm for executing a single subtask via `Agent._execute_subtask(subtask)`:\n\n1. **Initialize ReAct Context**: Create a `ReActLoopContext` with:\n   - `subtask_description` from the subtask\n   - `expected_output` from the subtask (if specified)\n   - `conversation_history` from `EpisodicMemory.get_recent(max_tokens)`\n   - `iteration = 0`, `max_iterations = 10` (configurable)\n   - `state = AgentState.THINKING`\n   - `previous_actions = []` (empty list)\n\n2. **Retrieve Available Tools**: Call `ToolRegistry.list_tools()` to get all registered tools for this agent.\n\n3. **Enter ReAct Loop**: While `context.iteration < context.max_iterations` and `context.state` not in `{FINISHED, ERROR}`:\n   \n   a. **Think (Reasoning Step)**:\n      1. Format prompt using `ReActAgent._format_react_prompt(context, available_tools, external_context)`\n      2. External context includes: working memory state + long-term memories relevant to current subtask\n      3. Send prompt to LLM provider\n      4. Receive LLM response text\n   \n   b. **Parse Action**: Call `parse_llm_action_response(response_text)`:\n      1. Check for \"Final Answer:\" marker indicating completion\n      2. If found: Extract final answer text, update `context.state = AgentState.FINISHED`, break loop\n      3. Else: Extract JSON action using `extract_json_from_text(response_text)`\n      4. Validate JSON has `tool_name` and `arguments` fields\n      5. If parsing fails: Create error observation, increment iteration, continue\n   \n   c. **Act (Tool Execution)**:\n      1. Retrieve tool: `ToolRegistry.get_tool(tool_name)`\n      2. If tool not found: Create error observation \"Tool X not available\", continue\n      3. Validate arguments against tool's `parameters_schema` using JSON Schema validation\n      4. Execute: `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call(tool_name, arguments, timeout_seconds=30)`\n      5. Wait for `ToolResult` with status `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, or `TIMEOUT`\n   \n   d. **Observe (Result Processing)**:\n      1. Format observation based on `ToolResult.status`:\n         - `SUCCESS`: \"Tool [name] succeeded: [content]\"\n         - `ERROR`: \"Tool [name] failed: [error_message]\"\n         - `TIMEOUT`: \"Tool [name] timed out after X seconds\"\n      2. Append observation to `context.conversation_history`\n      3. Update `context.previous_actions` with the executed action\n      4. Store useful results in `WorkingMemory` under appropriate keys\n   \n   e. **State Update**:\n      1. Increment `context.iteration`\n      2. If `ToolResult.status == SUCCESS` and subtask appears complete: `context.state = AgentState.FINISHED`\n      3. If maximum retries on same tool exceeded: `context.state = AgentState.ERROR`\n\n4. **Loop Termination**:\n   - If loop ended with `context.state == AgentState.FINISHED`: Return `ToolResult.success(final_answer)`\n   - If loop ended with `context.state == AgentState.ERROR`: Return `ToolResult.error(\"Failed after X iterations\")`\n   - If `context.iteration >= context.max_iterations`: Return `ToolResult.error(\"Max iterations reached\")`\n\n5. **Memory Persistence**:\n   - Append entire ReAct conversation to `EpisodicMemory.append()` for future reference\n   - Store key findings in `LongTermMemory.store()` with appropriate embeddings for semantic retrieval\n   - Update `WorkingMemory` with intermediate results for use in subsequent subtasks\n\n**4. Plan Progression and Completion**\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 10 | Agent Core | After first subtask completes, updates its `SubTaskStatus` to `COMPLETED` and stores `ToolResult` | `SubTask.with_status(COMPLETED).with_result(tool_result)` |\n| 11 | Agent Core | Checks which subtasks become `is_ready()` after dependency satisfaction | List of ready subtask IDs |\n| 12 | Agent Core | Selects next ready subtask (may execute independent subtasks in parallel if supported) | Next `SubTask` to execute |\n| 13 | Loop | Repeats ReAct execution for each subtask in dependency order | Progressively completed subtasks |\n| 14 | Agent Core | When all subtasks `status == COMPLETED`: Aggregates results from each subtask | Combined final answer |\n| 15 | Agent Core | Updates `AgentState` to `FINISHED`, returns final answer to user | `AgentState.FINISHED`, final answer string |\n| 16 | Memory System | Finalizes memory storage: summarizes conversation, indexes key learnings | Compacted `EpisodicMemory`, new `LongTermMemory` entries |\n\n#### Concrete Walk-Through Example\n\nLet's examine a specific iteration within the ReAct loop for the \"search\" subtask:\n\n**Initial Context**: `ReActLoopContext(subtask_description=\"Search for main causes...\", iteration=0, previous_actions=[])`\n\n1. **Think**: The LLM receives a prompt containing: \"You are an AI assistant. Current task: Search for main causes... Available tools: web_search(query), calculator(expression). Previous actions: none. Think step by step.\"\n\n2. **LLM Response**: \n   ```\n   I need to search for authoritative information about the 2008 financial crisis causes. I should use specific search terms to get relevant results.\n   \n   Action: {\n     \"tool_name\": \"web_search\",\n     \"arguments\": {\n       \"query\": \"2008 financial crisis main causes subprime mortgages Lehman Brothers\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Parse**: `parse_llm_action_response()` extracts JSON, validates `web_search` exists, validates arguments match schema.\n\n4. **Act**: `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call(\"web_search\", arguments, timeout=30)` calls the actual web search API, returns:\n   ```python\n   ToolResult.success(\n     content=\"Found 3 relevant sources: 1) Federal Reserve report on... 2) Wikipedia article lists... 3) NY Times analysis...\",\n     metadata={\"sources\": [\"fed.gov/...\", \"wikipedia.org/...\", \"nytimes.com/...\"]}\n   )\n   ```\n\n5. **Observe**: Observation formatted as: \"Tool web_search succeeded: Found 3 relevant sources...\"\n\n6. **Next Cycle**: LLM now sees this observation and might decide to: a) Use another tool to fetch specific articles, b) Extract key points, c) Move to final answer if satisfied.\n\nThis back-and-forth continues until the agent either produces a \"Final Answer:\" or reaches the iteration limit.\n\n#### Data Transformation Through the Pipeline\n\n| Stage | Input | Processing | Output |\n|-------|-------|------------|--------|\n| Raw Query | User natural language string | Context retrieval, initial parsing | `Task` with `goal` field |\n| Planning | `Task.goal` string | LLM decomposition, dependency analysis | `Task` with `subtasks` list and `Plan` DAG |\n| Subtask Execution | `SubTask` object | ReAct loop with tool calls | `ToolResult` with content |\n| Memory Integration | `ToolResult.content` | Embedding generation, relevance scoring | `MemoryEntry` in appropriate memory layer |\n| Final Aggregation | All `SubTask.results` | Concatenation, formatting, synthesis | Final answer string |\n\n#### Critical Control Points\n\n> **Design Insight**: The flow maintains **immutable state updates** throughout. Each component returns new instances rather than mutating shared state. This makes the system easier to debug, test, and reason about, as you can trace exactly how state evolves through each transformation.\n\n### Multi-Agent Delegation Flow\n\n**Mental Model: Department Meeting**  \nWhen a task is too complex for one executive, they call a department meeting. The **Orchestrator** (department head) breaks the problem down and assigns pieces to specialists: the **Researcher** (web search expert), **Writer** (document specialist), and **Fact-Checker** (accuracy verifier). They pass memos (`Message` objects) back and forth, share findings on a common whiteboard (`Shared Context`), and the Orchestrator compiles everything into a final report.\n\nThis collaborative approach leverages specialization while maintaining coordination.\n\n#### Orchestration Architecture\n\nThe following diagram shows the hierarchical structure of a multi-agent system:\n\n![Multi-Agent Hierarchical Orchestration](./diagrams/diagram-multi-agent-org.svg)\n\n#### Step-by-Step Collaborative Execution\n\nLet's trace through a more complex query that triggers multi-agent collaboration: *\"Create a Python script that fetches today's weather from an API, analyzes historical trends, and generates a visualization with matplotlib. Include error handling and documentation.\"*\n\n**1. Task Reception and Initial Assessment**\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 1 | User Interface | Calls `OrchestratorAgent.run_task(user_query)` | Query passed to orchestrator |\n| 2 | OrchestratorAgent | Assesses complexity, determines need for multi-agent approach | Decision to delegate to specialists |\n| 3 | OrchestratorAgent | Calls `Planner.create_plan()` with multi-agent awareness | Plan with subtasks tagged for different agent roles |\n| 4 | OrchestratorAgent | Initializes `shared_context` dictionary for this task | `shared_context = {\"task_id\": \"task_002\", \"original_query\": ...}` |\n\n**2. Role-Based Task Delegation**\n\nThe orchestrator identifies three required specialties:\n\n1. **API Specialist**: Handle weather API calls and error handling\n2. **Data Analyst**: Process historical trends and calculations  \n3. **Visualization Expert**: Create matplotlib visualizations\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 5 | OrchestratorAgent | For each subtask, calls `_delegate_subtask(subtask_description, required_tools, context)` | `DelegatedTask` objects created for each assignment |\n| 6 | OrchestratorAgent | Matches subtasks to agents based on `role` and advertised capabilities | Assignment mapping: API→AgentA, Analysis→AgentB, Viz→AgentC |\n| 7 | Message Bus | `MessageBus.publish()` sends `Message` objects to each agent's subscription topic | Messages queued for delivery |\n| 8 | Worker Agents | Each agent's background processor calls `_handle_task_request(message)` | Task acceptance/acknowledgment |\n\n**3. Parallel Execution with Coordination**\n\nNow all three agents work in parallel on their respective subtasks:\n\n**Agent A (API Specialist) Workflow:**\n1. Receives `Message` with task: \"Fetch today's weather from API with error handling\"\n2. Executes its own ReAct loop with tools: `http_get`, `json_parse`, `error_handler`\n3. Stores results in `shared_context[\"weather_data\"]` and `shared_context[\"api_errors\"]`\n4. Sends completion `Message` back to orchestrator\n\n**Agent B (Data Analyst) Workflow:**\n1. Waits for dependency: `shared_context[\"weather_data\"]` to be populated\n2. Periodically checks shared context (or receives notification via Message Bus)\n3. Once data available, processes historical trends using `calculate_statistics`, `detect_trends` tools\n4. Stores results in `shared_context[\"analysis_results\"]`\n5. Sends completion `Message`\n\n**Agent C (Visualization Expert) Workflow:**\n1. Waits for dependencies: both weather data and analysis results\n2. Creates visualization using `matplotlib_generate`, `format_chart` tools\n3. Stores plot image in `shared_context[\"visualization\"]`\n4. Sends completion `Message`\n\n**4. Result Aggregation and Conflict Resolution**\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Data Produced |\n|------|-----------|--------|---------------|\n| 9 | OrchestratorAgent | `_handle_task_response()` processes each completion message | Updates `DelegatedTask.status` for each subtask |\n| 10 | OrchestratorAgent | Monitors completion of all delegated tasks | Waits for all `DelegatedTask.status == \"COMPLETED\"` |\n| 11 | OrchestratorAgent | Detects potential conflicts (e.g., Agent A and Agent B disagree on data interpretation) | Flag for conflict resolution |\n| 12 | OrchestratorAgent | If conflicts exist: calls `_resolve_conflicts(conflicting_results)` | Unified result through voting or arbitration |\n| 13 | OrchestratorAgent | Compiles final output from `shared_context` and individual agent results | Draft final answer |\n| 14 | OrchestratorAgent | May send draft to a \"Reviewer\" agent for quality check | Additional refinement loop |\n| 15 | OrchestratorAgent | Returns final compiled answer to user | Complete Python script with all requested features |\n\n#### Message Passing Protocol in Detail\n\nThe communication between agents follows a structured protocol:\n\n**Message Structure for Task Delegation:**\n```python\nMessage(\n    sender_id=\"orchestrator_001\",\n    receiver_id=\"api_specialist_002\",\n    message_type=\"TASK_REQUEST\",\n    content={\n        \"task_id\": \"subtask_003\",\n        \"description\": \"Fetch today's weather from OpenWeatherMap API\",\n        \"expected_output\": \"JSON with current temp, humidity, and timestamp\",\n        \"deadline\": 1698765300.0,\n        \"dependencies\": [],\n        \"shared_context_key\": \"weather_data\"\n    },\n    timestamp=datetime.now(),\n    correlation_id=\"task_002_sub_003\"\n)\n```\n\n**Message Flow Patterns:**\n\n1. **Request-Response**: Orchestrator → Worker (TASK_REQUEST), Worker → Orchestrator (TASK_RESPONSE)\n2. **Broadcast**: Orchestrator → All Workers (CONTEXT_UPDATE when shared state changes)\n3. **Peer-to-Peer**: Worker A → Worker B (HELP_REQUEST when specialist needs consultation)\n4. **Status Updates**: Periodic heartbeat messages to detect unresponsive agents\n\n#### Concrete Multi-Agent Scenario Walk-Through\n\nLet's examine a specific interaction when Agent B (Data Analyst) encounters a problem:\n\n**Scenario**: Agent B calculates a 30% temperature increase trend, but Agent C's visualization shows only 15%.\n\n1. **Conflict Detection**: Orchestrator's `_handle_task_response()` compares `shared_context[\"analysis_results\"][\"trend\"]` vs `shared_context[\"visualization_metadata\"][\"trend_value\"]`\n\n2. **Resolution Trigger**: Orchestrator detects mismatch beyond tolerance threshold (e.g., >5% difference)\n\n3. **Arbitration Process**:\n   - Orchestrator sends `Message` to both agents requesting explanation of methodology\n   - Agents respond with `Message` containing their calculation steps and assumptions\n   - Orchestrator (or a dedicated \"Arbitrator\" agent) evaluates methodologies\n   - Decision: Agent C had incorrect date range filter\n   - Orchestrator sends `Message` to Agent C to regenerate visualization with corrected data\n\n4. **Updated Flow**: Agent C fetches corrected data from `shared_context`, regenerates visualization, updates shared context, notifies completion.\n\n#### Data Flow Through Shared Context\n\nThe `shared_context` dictionary evolves throughout execution:\n\n| Phase | Key | Value Type | Set By | Used By |\n|-------|-----|------------|--------|---------|\n| Initial | `original_query` | String | Orchestrator | All agents |\n| API Phase | `weather_data` | Dict | Agent A | Agent B, Agent C |\n| Analysis Phase | `analysis_results` | Dict | Agent B | Agent C, Orchestrator |\n| Visualization Phase | `visualization` | Bytes/Path | Agent C | Orchestrator (final compile) |\n| Conflict | `discrepancy_log` | List | Orchestrator | Arbitrator agent |\n| Final | `complete_script` | String | Orchestrator | User output |\n\n#### Failure Recovery in Multi-Agent Flow\n\nWhen an agent fails or times out:\n\n1. **Detection**: Orchestrator monitors `DelegatedTask.deadline` and heartbeat messages\n2. **Reassignment**: If agent unresponsive, orchestrator calls `_delegate_subtask()` to another agent with same role\n3. **State Recovery**: New agent reads `shared_context` to understand what was already accomplished\n4. **Compensation**: If partial work exists but is inconsistent, may need to rollback dependent tasks\n\n> **Design Insight**: The **shared context** acts as a **blackboard architecture**—a common workspace where agents can read and write partial results. This decouples agents from each other while still allowing coordination. The orchestrator acts as the blackboard controller, managing access and consistency.\n\n#### Performance Considerations\n\n**Parallel vs Sequential Execution**:\n- Independent subtasks execute in parallel (API fetch + historical analysis can happen concurrently)\n- Dependent subtasks wait for prerequisites (visualization waits for both data sources)\n- The orchestrator uses the `Plan.execution_order` (topological sort of DAG) to determine maximum parallelism\n\n**Message Bus Overhead**:\n- Each message adds latency but enables loose coupling\n- Batching non-urgent messages (e.g., multiple context updates) can reduce overhead\n- Direct method calls used for time-critical communication within same process\n\n**Shared Context Consistency**:\n- Simple dictionary works for single-process multi-agent\n- For distributed agents, need distributed cache (Redis) or versioned storage\n- Conflict detection happens at read-time with version checking\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations for Data Flow**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| State Management | Immutable dataclasses with `copy()` | Functional lenses (e.g., `pymonad`) |\n| Message Passing | In-memory `asyncio.Queue` per agent | Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ |\n| Shared Context | Thread-safe `dict` with locks | Versioned key-value store (etcd, Zookeeper) |\n| Flow Visualization | Manual logging with step markers | OpenTelemetry tracing + Jaeger |\n\n**B.

Milestone Checkpoint: Verifying Data Flow**\n\nAfter implementing the flow controller, verify with these tests:\n\n```bash\n# Test single-agent flow with a simple task\npython -m pytest tests/test_flow_controller.py::TestSingleAgentFlow -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# - Task decomposition occurs (plan created with subtasks)\n# - ReAct loop executes for each subtask\n# - Final answer returned within timeout\n# - Memory updated appropriately\n\n# Test multi-agent flow (requires at least 2 worker agents)\npython -m pytest tests/test_flow_controller.py::TestMultiAgentFlow -v\n\n# Expected output:\n# - Orchestrator decomposes task\n# - Messages exchanged between agents\n# - Shared context populated by multiple agents\n# - Final answer combines contributions from all agents\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Checklist**:\n\n1. **Single-Agent Happy Path**:\n   - Start agent with web_search and calculator tools\n   - Query: \"What is 15 * 24? Also search for interesting facts about the number 360.\"\n   - Verify: Calculator tool called first, then web_search, final answer includes both.\n\n2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**:\n   - Start orchestrator + 2 worker agents (one with calculation tools, one with search tools)\n   - Same query as above\n   - Verify: Orchestrator delegates calculation to Agent1, search to Agent2\n   - Check shared context contains both results\n   - Final answer synthesized by orchestrator\n\n**F. Debugging Tips for Flow Issues**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Agent gets stuck at PLANNING | LLM not responding or plan parsing fails | Check LLM API connection, examine planner prompt | Add timeout to LLM call, improve error handling in parser |\n| Subtasks execute in wrong order | Dependencies not correctly calculated | Print `Plan.execution_order`, verify topological sort | Check dependency parsing in planner, ensure DAG has no cycles |\n| Shared context missing data | Race condition in multi-agent | Log timestamp of writes vs reads | Add synchronization (locks) or use versioned writes |\n| Messages lost between agents | Queue overflow or processor crash | Check message bus queue sizes, monitor processor tasks | Increase queue size, add dead-letter queue for undelivered messages |\n| Final answer missing subtask results | Aggregation logic error | Log each subtask result before aggregation | Verify aggregation collects all `SubTask.result` fields |\n| Infinite loop in ReAct | No termination condition met | Log iteration count and state each cycle | Add better termination detection, lower `max_iterations` |\n\n**G. Language-Specific Hints for Python Implementation**\n\n1. **Async/Await Pattern**: Use `asyncio.create_task()` for parallel subtask execution, but be mindful of resource limits.\n\n2. **Immutable Updates**: Use `dataclasses.replace()` or dictionary unpacking for functional updates:\n   ```python\n   # Instead of mutating:\n   # subtask.status = COMPLETED  # BAD\n   \n   # Do:\n   new_subtask = dataclasses.replace(subtask, status=SubTaskStatus.COMPLETED)\n   # Or:\n   new_subtask = SubTask(**{**subtask.__dict__, 'status': SubTaskStatus.COMPLETED})\n   ```\n\n3. **Context Management**: Use `contextvars` for request-scoped context that follows async execution:\n   ```python\n   import contextvars\n   current_flow = contextvars.ContextVar('current_flow')\n   \n   async def execute_subtask(subtask):\n       flow = current_flow.get()\n       # flow is available throughout async call chain\n   ```\n\n4. **Message Serialization**: Use `pydantic` for Message validation or `dataclasses_json` for simple serialization:\n   ```python\n   from dataclasses import dataclass\n   from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json\n   \n   @dataclass_json\n   @dataclass\n   class Message:\n       sender_id: str\n       # ... other fields\n       \n   # Serialize/deserialize easily\n   json_str = message.to_json()\n   new_message = Message.from_json(json_str)\n   ```\n\n5. **Flow Visualization**: Add structured logging with step markers:\n   ```python\n   structured_logger.info({\n       \"event\": \"subtask_start\",\n       \"task_id\": flow.task_id,\n       \"subtask_id\": subtask.id,\n       \"timestamp\": time.time()\n   })\n   ```\n   This creates logs that can be parsed to visualize execution flow.\n\n\n## 7. Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nAutonomous AI agents operate in a fundamentally unpredictable environment—they interface with unreliable LLMs, external APIs with variable latency, user inputs of varying quality, and complex state machines that can enter unexpected configurations. A robust error handling strategy is not merely a defensive programming practice; it is the **safety net that prevents the AI Executive from falling into infinite loops, corrupting data, or delivering nonsensical results**. This section catalogs the expected failure modes across all framework components and defines systematic recovery strategies that transform the agent from a brittle script into a resilient, self-correcting system.\n\nThink of error handling in an AI agent framework as the **emergency response protocols in a nuclear power plant**. You cannot prevent all possible malfunctions, but you can design layers of defense: automated sensors (error detection), redundant systems (retry mechanisms), containment vessels (sandboxed execution), and emergency shutdown procedures (graceful fallbacks). Each component has its own failure signatures, and the system must coordinate responses across components to maintain overall stability.\n\n### 7.1 Failure Mode Taxonomy\n\nFailures in an AI agent system follow a predictable pattern aligned with the five architectural pillars. The taxonomy below categorizes errors by their origin, symptom, and potential impact on the agent's mission.\n\n#### 7.1.1 LLM-Related Failures\n\nThe Large Language Model is the agent's \"brain,\" but it's an unreliable reasoning engine prone to specific failure modes.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Hallucination** | LLM invents non-existent tools, parameters, or facts | Tool registry lookup fails; parameter validation rejects invalid schema; fact-checking tools contradict statements | Medium-High: Can lead to invalid actions, corrupted state |\n| **Refusal/Non-Compliance** | LLM outputs \"I cannot do that\" or refuses to follow the ReAct format | Pattern matching in `parse_llm_action_response` detects refusal keywords; no action/final answer extracted | Medium: Task stalls; requires re-prompting or strategy change |\n| **Format Violation** | LLM outputs freeform text instead of structured JSON or action format | `extract_json_from_text` returns `None`; regex patterns fail to match | Low-Medium: Parsing fails, but recoverable with guidance |\n| **Context Window Overflow** | LLM truncates important history or ignores earlier instructions | Token counting exceeds model limit; LLM returns incoherent or incomplete responses | High: Critical context lost, leading to repetitive or off-track behavior |\n| **Reasoning Degradation** | LLM gets stuck in circular logic or fails to progress | Monitoring `ReActLoopContext.iteration` against `max_iterations`; detecting repeated tool calls with same arguments | Medium: Wastes iterations without task advancement |\n\n#### 7.1.2 Tool Execution Failures\n\nTools are the agent's \"hands\"—they interface with the external world and are subject to network issues, timeouts, and logical errors.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Timeout** | Tool execution exceeds allowed duration | `asyncio.wait_for` raises `TimeoutError`; `ToolResult.status` becomes `TIMEOUT` | Medium: Task delayed but retry may succeed |\n| **Crash/Exception** | Tool raises unhandled exception | `try/except` block in `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call` catches exception | Medium-High: May indicate buggy tool or invalid state |\n| **Invalid Parameters** | Tool receives parameters that fail validation | JSON Schema validation in execution engine rejects input before execution | Low: Preventable with better validation |\n| **Network Unavailability** | External API calls fail (HTTP errors, connection refused) | HTTP client raises exceptions; `ToolResult.status` becomes `ERROR` with network error message | Medium: Dependent on external service availability |\n| **Resource Exhaustion** | Tool consumes excessive memory, CPU, or disk | Monitoring system metrics; `ResourceError` exceptions | High: Can crash entire agent process |\n| **Permission Denied** | Tool lacks required credentials or access rights | Authentication/authorization errors from external services | High: Task cannot proceed without elevation |\n\n#### 7.1.3 Planning & Task Decomposition Failures\n\nThe planner translates high-level goals into executable steps, but this decomposition can be flawed or become invalid during execution.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Circular Dependency** | Subtask A depends on B, which depends on A | Cycle detection during DAG topological sort in plan execution | High: Deadlock—no subtask can execute |\n| **Over-Decomposition** | Plan contains dozens of trivial subtasks | Counting subtasks exceeds reasonable threshold (e.g., >20 for simple task) | Medium: Wastes LLM context and iterations |\n| **Under-Decomposition** | Subtask too complex, requires further breakdown | Subtask execution fails repeatedly with \"need more detail\" errors | Medium: Stalls progress until replanning |\n| **Dependency Deadlock** | Subtask waits for prerequisite that will never complete | Monitoring `SubTaskStatus.BLOCKED` duration; detecting orphaned subtasks | High: Part of plan becomes unreachable |\n| **Context Loss Between Steps** | Subtask B doesn't receive results from subtask A | Working memory check shows missing expected intermediate results | Medium: Subtask executes with incomplete information |\n| **Goal Misinterpretation** | Plan addresses wrong aspect of user query | Human-in-the-loop review; validation against original query intent | High: Agent succeeds at wrong task |\n\n#### 7.1.4 Memory System Failures\n\nMemory is the agent's \"notebook\"—when retrieval fails or memory grows unbounded, the agent loses context and repeats mistakes.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Retrieval Failure** | Vector store returns irrelevant or empty results | Cosine similarity scores below threshold; retrieved content doesn't contain needed information | Medium: Agent operates without relevant historical context |\n| **Embedding Generation Failure** | Text embedding service unavailable or returns error | Embedding API call fails; `MemoryEntry.embedding` remains `None` | Medium: Long-term memory degraded to keyword search |\n| **Token Budget Exceeded** | Context window management truncates critical history | Token count exceeds limit after retrieval; LLM performance degrades | Medium-High: Loss of important conversational context |\n| **Memory Corruption** | Stored memories contain malformed data or inconsistent state | Deserialization errors when loading memory entries; integrity checks fail | High: May require memory reset |\n| **Unbounded Growth** | Conversation history grows without summarization/eviction | Memory storage size increases linearly with conversation length | Medium: Eventually causes performance degradation |\n| **Stale Context** | Retrieved memories are outdated or no longer relevant | Timestamp checks show memories older than task relevance window | Low-Medium: Agent uses outdated information |\n\n#### 7.1.5 Multi-Agent Collaboration Failures\n\nWhen multiple agents work together, coordination failures can cause deadlocks, duplication, or contradictory results.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Delegation Loop** | Agent A delegates to B, who delegates back to A | Detecting circular delegation chain in `DelegatedTask` history | High: Infinite loop without progress |\n| **Orchestrator Bottleneck** | All worker agents idle waiting for orchestrator decisions | Monitoring orchestrator queue depth; worker idle time metrics | Medium: Reduced parallelism and throughput |\n| **Message Loss** | Inter-agent message not delivered or processed | Message timeout without response; sequence number gaps | Medium: Task stalls awaiting response |\n| **Role Conflict** | Multiple agents claim capability for same subtask | Two agents attempt same subtask; duplicate result submission | Low-Medium: Wasted effort, requires conflict resolution |\n| **Shared State Corruption** | Concurrent writes to `shared_context` cause inconsistent state | Data races detected via version stamps or inconsistency checks | High: Agents operate on wrong data |\n| **Unresponsive Agent** | Worker agent crashes or becomes unresponsive | Heartbeat timeout; task assignment timeout in `DelegatedTask.deadline` | Medium: Requires reassignment to other agent |\n\n#### 7.1.6 Systemic & Infrastructure Failures\n\nThese are platform-level issues that affect the entire framework.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Symptom | Detection Method | Impact Severity |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Out of Memory (OOM)** | Process killed by OS; memory allocation fails | Monitoring memory usage; `MemoryError` exceptions | Critical: Entire agent process terminates |\n| **Database/Storage Failure** | Persistent storage (vector DB, disk) becomes unavailable | Connection errors; write/read failures | High: Memory system impaired, may lose state |\n| **LLM API Rate Limiting** | LLM provider rejects requests due to quota exhaustion | HTTP 429 responses; provider-specific error messages | High: All reasoning halts until quota resets |\n| **Network Partition** | Agents cannot communicate; tools cannot reach external services | Connection timeouts across multiple endpoints | High: System partially or fully unavailable |\n| **Clock Skew** | Timestamps inconsistent across agents/database | Message ordering issues; deadline calculation errors | Low-Medium: Mostly affects debugging and monitoring |\n\n### 7.2 Recovery Strategies per Component\n\nEffective error recovery follows a **graded response strategy**: first attempt automatic recovery (retry, fallback), then escalate to component-level adjustments (replanning, tool substitution), and finally resort to system-level intervention (task abortion, human escalation). The table below maps each failure category to concrete recovery actions.\n\n#### 7.2.1 LLM Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n> **Key Insight:** LLM failures often stem from prompt ambiguity or context mismanagement. Recovery focuses on clarifying instructions and reducing cognitive load on the LLM.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Hallucination** | 1. Inject tool list with clear descriptions into prompt<br>2. Add validation: \"Only use tools from this list\"<br>3. Use function-calling API if available | Mark hallucinated tool as \"invalid\" for current cycle and continue | Switch to more capable LLM model; implement tool existence verification pre-check |\n| **Refusal/Non-Compliance** | 1. Rephrase request to align with LLM's ethical guidelines<br>2. Break task into smaller, less controversial steps<br>3. Provide examples of acceptable responses | Use alternative phrasing or role-playing (\"You are a helpful assistant with special permissions\") | Human-in-the-loop to approve sensitive operations; mark task as requiring human review |\n| **Format Violation** | 1. Retry with stricter formatting instructions<br>2. Provide explicit JSON schema examples<br>3. Use `extract_json_from_text` with lenient parsing | Implement regex fallback parser for common action patterns | Switch to function-calling API which guarantees structured output |\n| **Context Window Overflow** | 1. Activate memory summarization (`LongTermMemory.summarize_recent`)<br>2. Implement sliding window prioritization<br>3. Store critical context in `WorkingMemory` | Summarize entire conversation and restart with summary as context | Switch to LLM with larger context window; implement hierarchical context compression |\n| **Reasoning Degradation** | 1. Increment `ReActLoopContext.iteration` counter<br>2. Inject \"You seem stuck, try different approach\" guidance<br>3. Provide hint based on previous failed attempts | Force final answer if near `max_iterations` with best available information | Trigger replanning to break task into simpler subtasks |\n\n**ADR: Retry Strategy for LLM Failures**\n\n> **Decision: Exponential Backoff with Jitter for LLM API Calls**\n> - **Context**: LLM API calls can fail due to transient network issues or rate limiting. Simple retries can exacerbate rate limits or create thundering herds.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **No retry**: Fail immediately → simple but brittle\n>   2. **Fixed-interval retry**: Wait N seconds between attempts → predictable but can sync with other clients\n>   3. **Exponential backoff with jitter**: Wait (2^attempt) ± random seconds → spreads load, handles transient errors well\n> - **Decision**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for all LLM API calls\n> - **Rationale**: This pattern is proven in distributed systems to handle transient failures while preventing synchronized retry storms. The jitter randomizes wait times across clients, reducing collision probability.\n> - **Consequences**: Increases latency for failed requests but maximizes success rate under intermittent failures. Requires tracking retry count per request.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| No retry | Simplest implementation, fastest failure detection | Poor user experience, fails on transient glitches | ❌ |\n| Fixed-interval retry | Predictable, easy to debug | Can synchronize with other clients causing retry storms | ❌ |\n| **Exponential backoff with jitter** | **Spreads load, handles transient errors well, proven pattern** | **Adds complexity, increases latency for retried requests** | ✅ |\n\n#### 7.2.2 Tool Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n> **Key Insight:** Tool failures are often transient (network issues) or parameter-related. Recovery should isolate the failure and preserve system stability.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Timeout** | 1. Retry with increased timeout (up to limit)<br>2. Log timeout for monitoring<br>3. Return `ToolResult.timeout` with metadata | Mark tool as \"slow\" in registry; use alternative tool with similar functionality | Circuit breaker pattern: disable tool after N consecutive timeouts |\n| **Crash/Exception** | 1. Catch exception, return `ToolResult.error` with sanitized message<br>2. Log full exception for debugging<br>3. Validate tool inputs more strictly before execution | If tool is non-critical, continue with partial results | Sandbox crash-prone tools in separate processes; implement health checks |\n| **Invalid Parameters** | 1. Reject before execution with descriptive error<br>2. Feed error back to LLM for correction<br>3. Show expected schema in error message | Use default parameters where safe; prompt LLM for corrected parameters | Implement parameter suggestion: \"Did you mean X?\" based on schema |\n| **Network Unavailability** | 1. Retry with exponential backoff<br>2. Check network connectivity<br>3. Cache previous successful responses if applicable | Use offline simulation or mocked responses for development | Implement tool health dashboard; circuit breaker to mark tool offline |\n| **Resource Exhaustion** | 1. Implement resource quotas per tool execution<br>2. Monitor system metrics, abort if thresholds exceeded<br>3. Run resource-intensive tools in isolated containers | Fall back to less resource-intensive alternative tools | Implement tool priority system: critical tools get reserved resources |\n| **Permission Denied** | 1. Return clear error about missing permissions<br>2. Prompt user for credentials if interactive<br>3. Log authentication failure (without credentials) | Skip tool if optional; continue with reduced capability | Implement OAuth flow for tool authorization; permission escalation prompts |\n\n**Tool Execution Engine Recovery Flow:**\n\n1. **Pre-execution validation**: Schema validation catches invalid parameters early\n2. **Resource guardrails**: Check CPU/memory quotas before execution\n3. **Timeout wrapper**: `asyncio.wait_for` ensures bounded execution time\n4. **Exception isolation**: `try/except` prevents tool crashes from propagating\n5. **Result normalization**: Always return `ToolResult` with status indicator\n6. **Post-execution monitoring**: Update tool health metrics based on outcome\n\n#### 7.2.3 Planning Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n> **Key Insight:** Planning failures indicate a mismatch between the plan and reality. Recovery requires reassessment and adaptation, not just retrying the same approach.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Circular Dependency** | 1. Detect cycle during DAG validation<br>2. Remove one dependency to break cycle (based on heuristic)<br>3. Reorder subtasks to eliminate circular reference | Merge circular subtasks into single atomic task | Human intervention to redesign task decomposition; use different planning algorithm |\n| **Over-Decomposition** | 1. Merge adjacent subtasks with similar objectives<br>2. Increase minimum subtask complexity threshold<br>3. Use clustering to group related subtasks | Execute plan as-is but batch tool calls where possible | Switch to hierarchical planning: high-level plan first, details later |\n| **Under-Decomposition** | 1. Detect repeated failure of complex subtask<br>2. Trigger replanning with instruction to break down further<br>3. Add intermediate goals to guide decomposition | Let ReAct loop handle complexity through multiple cycles | Implement iterative refinement: start coarse, refine as needed |\n| **Dependency Deadlock** | 1. Monitor `SubTaskStatus.BLOCKED` duration<br>2. Identify prerequisite that will never complete<br>3. Remove dependency or mark prerequisite as optional | Execute blocked subtask with best available (partial) inputs | Implement dependency relaxation: proceed with warning if missing inputs |\n| **Context Loss Between Steps** | 1. Store subtask results in `WorkingMemory`<br>2. Explicitly pass outputs as inputs to dependent subtasks<br>3. Add validation that required inputs exist | Re-execute preceding subtask to regenerate missing context | Implement data flow tracking: visualize what each subtask produces/consumes |\n| **Goal Misinterpretation** | 1. Validate plan against original query using LLM<br>2. Compute similarity between plan goal and user intent<br>3. Ask clarifying questions before execution | Execute plan but periodically check alignment with user intent | Human confirmation of plan before execution; implement intent clarification dialog |\n\n**ADR: When to Trigger Replanning**\n\n> **Decision: Replan on Critical Failure with Confidence Threshold**\n> - **Context**: When a subtask fails, the agent must decide whether to retry, continue, or replan entirely. Replanning is expensive but necessary when the current plan is fundamentally flawed.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Replan on every failure**: Always generate new plan after any subtask failure → maximizes adaptation but computationally expensive\n>   2. **Replan on N consecutive failures**: Wait for pattern of failure before replanning → balances adaptation with stability\n>   3. **Confidence-based replanning**: Use LLM to assess if failure indicates plan flaw → intelligent but adds LLM call overhead\n> - **Decision**: Replan after 2 consecutive subtask failures OR when LLM confidence in current plan drops below threshold\n> - **Rationale**: Two consecutive failures suggest systemic issue with plan, not transient tool failure. Adding confidence threshold allows early replanning when agent realizes plan is flawed before wasting more cycles.\n> - **Consequences**: Adds state tracking for consecutive failures and optional LLM call for confidence assessment. Prevents infinite retry loops while avoiding over-replanning.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Replan on every failure | Maximally adaptive, quickly abandons flawed plans | Computationally expensive, may replan due to transient errors | ❌ |\n| Replan on N consecutive failures | Balanced, avoids over-reaction to transient failures | May persist with flawed plan through N-1 failures | ⚠️ (Part of hybrid) |\n| **Confidence-based replanning** | **Intelligent, uses LLM's meta-cognition** | **Adds LLM call overhead, confidence estimation is noisy** | ✅ (Hybrid approach) |\n\n#### 7.2.4 Memory Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n> **Key Insight:** Memory failures degrade agent performance gradually. Recovery focuses on graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Retrieval Failure** | 1. Lower similarity threshold gradually<br>2. Try keyword-based search as fallback<br>3. Expand search to more memory segments | Use recent conversation history instead of long-term memory | Disable long-term memory for current task; rely on `EpisodicMemory` only |\n| **Embedding Generation Failure** | 1. Retry embedding service with backoff<br>2. Use locally computed embeddings if available<br>3. Store text without embedding for later processing | Use TF-IDF or BM25 for retrieval instead of vector search | Mark entries for re-embedding later; queue failed embeddings |\n| **Token Budget Exceeded** | 1. Activate summarization (`LongTermMemory.summarize_recent`)<br>2. Implement importance scoring to keep critical messages<br>3. Use `EpisodicMemory.get_recent(max_tokens)` | Truncate oldest messages first (simple sliding window) | Switch to LLM with larger context window; implement hierarchical chunking |\n| **Memory Corruption** | 1. Validate memory entries on load<br>2. Maintain checksums or version stamps<br>3. Isolate corrupted entries, skip during retrieval | Restore from backup if available; regenerate from conversation log | Reset memory system with notification; implement corruption detection alerts |\n| **Unbounded Growth** | 1. Schedule periodic summarization<br>2. Implement LRU eviction policy<br>3.

Recovery requires re-establishing consensus, reassigning roles, or simplifying the collaboration structure.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Delegation Loop** | 1. Detect cycles in `DelegatedTask` history<br>2. Break cycle by assigning to third agent<br>3. Implement delegation depth limit | Convert to broadcast: ask all capable agents, use first response | Centralize task with orchestrator; implement delegation approval step |\n| **Orchestrator Bottleneck** | 1. Monitor orchestrator queue length<br>2. Implement worker pull model instead of push<br>3. Add parallel orchestrators for different task types | Let workers self-organize using market-based patterns | Scale horizontally: add more orchestrator instances with partitioned workload |\n| **Message Loss** | 1. Implement message ACK/retry protocol<br>2. Add sequence numbers to detect gaps<br>3. Use persistent message queue (e.g., Redis) | Periodic heartbeat to detect disconnected agents; reassign tasks | Switch to synchronous RPC for critical messages; implement message audit trail |\n| **Role Conflict** | 1. Implement claim-check pattern: first to claim gets task<br>2. Use capability matching score to choose best agent<br>3. Allow collaborative execution with result merging | Orchestrator arbitrates conflicts with deterministic rules | Implement task auction: agents bid based on estimated cost/quality |\n| **Shared State Corruption** | 1. Use optimistic concurrency control with version stamps<br>2. Implement mutex for critical sections<br>3. Use CRDTs for eventually consistent state | Make `shared_context` immutable; copy-on-write per agent | Partition shared state by domain; reduce shared state footprint |\n| **Unresponsive Agent** | 1. Implement heartbeat/timeout monitoring<br>2. Reassign tasks after deadline<br>3. Mark agent as unhealthy in registry | Restart agent process automatically | Implement agent health dashboard; manual intervention for persistent issues |\n\n**Multi-Agent Conflict Resolution Protocol:**\n\n1. **Detection**: Monitor for contradictory results from multiple agents\n2. **Escalation**: Route conflict to orchestrator or dedicated resolver agent\n3. **Assessment**: Evaluate result quality (confidence scores, supporting evidence)\n4. **Resolution**: Apply strategy (first wins, voting, LLM arbitration)\n5. **Learning**: Update agent capabilities based on conflict outcomes\n\n#### 7.2.6 Systemic Failure Recovery Strategies\n\n> **Key Insight:** Systemic failures threaten the entire framework. Recovery focuses on preservation of state, graceful degradation, and clear communication to users.\n\n| Failure Mode | Primary Recovery | Fallback Strategy | Escalation Path |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Out of Memory (OOM)** | 1. Implement memory usage monitoring<br>2. Proactively restart memory-intensive components<br>3. Use streaming processing for large data | Shed load: reject new tasks, complete current tasks | Container orchestration (Kubernetes) with memory limits and auto-restart |\n| **Database/Storage Failure** | 1. Retry with exponential backoff<br>2. Fall back to in-memory cache<br>3. Use read-only replica if available | Disable persistence; operate in ephemeral mode | Switch to secondary storage system; implement storage abstraction layer |\n| **LLM API Rate Limiting** | 1. Implement token bucket rate limiter<br>2. Queue requests, process as quota allows<br>3. Cache LLM responses for similar prompts | Switch to secondary LLM provider with available quota | Implement workload scheduling: defer non-urgent tasks |\n| **Network Partition** | 1. Detect partition via heartbeat<br>2. Continue operating in degraded mode<br>3. Buffer messages for when network recovers | Switch to local-only tools; disable network-dependent features | Implement split-brain detection and manual intervention protocol |\n| **Clock Skew** | 1. Use logical clocks (Lamport timestamps) for ordering<br>2. Synchronize via NTP regularly<br>3. Use time ranges instead of exact timestamps | Ignore timestamps for ordering; use sequence numbers instead | Implement timestamp validation; reject messages with implausible timestamps |\n\n### 7.3 Cross-Component Error Coordination\n\nErrors rarely stay contained within one component. The framework needs coordinated recovery that considers dependencies between components.\n\n**Error Propagation and Handling Chain:**\n\n```\n┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐\n│   Tool      │────▶   ReAct     │────▶   Planning  │────▶   Memory    │\n│   Failure   │    │   Loop      │    │   System    │    │   System    │\n└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘\n       │                   │                   │                  │\n       ▼                   ▼                   ▼                  ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 Cross-Component Error Coordinator                   │\n│                                                                     │\n│  • Prioritizes errors by severity and impact                        │\n│  • Determines optimal recovery sequence                             │\n│  • Maintains system-wide error budget                               │\n│  • Escalates to human if automated recovery fails                   │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Cross-Component Recovery Decision Matrix:**\n\n| Error Origin | Impacted Component | Coordinated Recovery Action |\n|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| **LLM Hallucination** | Tool System, ReAct Loop | 1. Update prompt to clarify valid tools<br>2. Temporarily disable hallucinated tool from registry<br>3. Feed correction back to LLM |\n| **Tool Timeout** | Planning System, Multi-Agent | 1. Mark tool as slow in registry<br>2. Adjust task time estimates in plan<br>3. Reassign to different agent if in multi-agent context |\n| **Memory Retrieval Failure** | ReAct Loop, Planner | 1. Fall back to recent conversation context<br>2. Adjust planning to rely less on historical knowledge<br>3. Log retrieval failure for later analysis |\n| **Agent Unresponsive** | Multi-Agent, Planning | 1. Reassign tasks to other agents<br>2. Update capability registry<br>3. Trigger replanning if critical agent unavailable |\n\n### 7.4 Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A. Technology Recommendations Table\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Error Monitoring | Structured logging with Python `logging` module | OpenTelemetry with distributed tracing to Jaeger/Prometheus |\n| Retry Logic | Manual `try/except` with `asyncio.sleep` | `tenacity` library with exponential backoff and jitter |\n| Circuit Breaker | Custom counter tracking consecutive failures | `pybreaker` library with state machine implementation |\n| Health Checks | Simple heartbeat endpoints | Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes with custom metrics |\n| Alerting | Log-based alerts (e.g., Loki AlertManager) | Dedicated monitoring stack (Grafana, Prometheus, AlertManager) |\n\n#### B.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n- **Python-specific error handling**: Use `asyncio.wait_for` for timeouts, `contextlib.asynccontextmanager` for resource management, and `tenacity` library for robust retry logic.\n- **JSON Schema validation**: Use `jsonschema` library with `Draft7Validator` for comprehensive parameter validation.\n- **Circuit breakers**: Implement using `pybreaker` library or custom state machine with `time.monotonic()` for timeout calculations.\n- **Structured logging**: Use Python's `logging` module with JSON formatter for machine-readable logs.\n- **Resource limits**: Use `resource` module on Unix or `psutil` cross-platform to monitor and limit memory/CPU usage.\n\n#### F. Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Agent gets stuck in infinite loop** | Missing or ineffective termination condition; LLM won't produce final answer | Check `ReActLoopContext.iteration` vs `max_iterations`; examine last few LLM responses for circular reasoning | 1. Reduce `max_iterations`<br>2. Add stronger \"produce final answer\" prompt guidance<br>3. Implement pattern detection for repetitive actions |\n| **Tool calls fail silently** | Tool exceptions caught but not propagated; `ToolResult.status` not checked | Add debug logging to `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call`; check `ToolResult.error_message` | 1. Ensure exceptions are converted to `ToolResult.error`<br>2. Log tool failures with stack trace<br>3. Implement tool health dashboard |\n| **Memory retrieval returns irrelevant results** | Embedding quality issues; similarity threshold too low | Check cosine similarity scores of retrieved items; test embedding quality with known similar texts | 1. Adjust similarity threshold<br>2. Use better embedding model<br>3. Add keyword filtering to retrieval |\n| **Multi-agent system deadlocks** | Circular delegation; agents waiting for each other | Trace `DelegatedTask` history for cycles; monitor agent message queues | 1. Implement delegation depth limit<br>2. Add timeout to task assignments<br>3. Use centralized orchestrator for conflict resolution |\n| **Context window overflow errors** | Memory system not summarizing/truncating | Count tokens in prompt sent to LLM; check `EpisodicMemory.get_recent` token limit | 1. Implement summarization<br>2. Reduce `max_tokens` parameter<br>3. Use more aggressive sliding window |\n| **High LLM API costs** | Excessive retries; inefficient prompting | Monitor LLM token usage per task; audit prompt length and structure | 1.

Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing error handling, verify with this test:\n\n```bash\n# Run the error recovery test suite\npython -m pytest tests/test_error_recovery.py -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# ✓ Test tool timeout recovery\n# ✓ Test LLM format error recovery  \n# ✓ Test circular dependency detection\n# ✓ Test memory retrieval fallback\n# ✓ Test multi-agent delegation loop detection\n```\n\nManual verification:\n1. Start an agent with a buggy tool that randomly fails\n2. Submit a complex task requiring multiple tool calls\n3. Observe in logs that:\n   - Tool failures are caught and logged\n   - Retries are attempted with backoff\n   - Agent recovers and completes task despite intermittent failures\n   - No unhandled exceptions crash the agent process\n\nSigns something is wrong:\n- Agent crashes on first tool failure → missing exception handling in `ToolExecutionEngine`\n- Infinite retries without success → missing retry limit or circuit breaker\n- Error messages not visible in final output → `ToolResult.error_message` not being included in observations\n\n---\n\n\n## 8. Testing Strategy\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nTesting an autonomous AI agent framework presents unique challenges that go beyond traditional software testing. We must verify not only that the *code* works correctly, but also that the *AI reasoning* produces reliable outcomes within the constraints of our system. This section outlines a multi-faceted testing strategy that combines traditional software testing techniques with specialized approaches for evaluating AI-driven systems.\n\nThe core philosophy is the **Testing Pyramid for Agent Systems**, which prioritizes fast, deterministic unit tests at the base, followed by integration tests that validate component interactions, and finally end-to-end tests that verify the system's ability to accomplish real tasks. Each milestone in the project has specific **Verification Checkpoints**—concrete test commands and expected outputs that serve as objective completion criteria.\n\n### Testing Pyramid for Agent Systems\n\nThink of testing our AI agent framework as **quality control for a manufacturing pipeline**. At the lowest level, we test individual components (like testing each gear in isolation). Next, we test assembled subsystems (like testing that the conveyor belt moves parts between stations correctly). Finally, we test the entire production line with real materials to ensure it manufactures the intended product. This layered approach catches issues early where they're cheapest to fix and provides confidence that the system works as a whole.\n\nThe pyramid consists of three primary layers:\n\n| Layer | Focus | Test Frequency | Execution Speed | Determinism |\n|-------|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Unit Tests** | Individual components in isolation: tools, parsers, data structures, utilities | High (after every change) | Fast (milliseconds) | Fully deterministic |\n| **Integration Tests** | Component interactions: ReAct loop with mocked LLM, planner with tool registry, memory retrieval | Medium (daily/CI) | Medium (seconds) | Mostly deterministic (depends on mock behavior) |\n| **End-to-End Tests** | Full system with real LLM (lightweight model): complete agent completing simple real-world tasks | Low (weekly/release) | Slow (minutes) | Non-deterministic (LLM variance) |\n\n#### Unit Tests: The Foundation of Reliability\n\nUnit tests validate the smallest testable parts of the framework—data structures, pure functions, and isolated components. These tests should be **fast, deterministic, and comprehensive**, covering edge cases and error conditions. They form the foundation of our testing strategy because they catch bugs early and provide rapid feedback during development.\n\n**Key Unit Test Categories:**\n\n| Component | Test Focus | Example Test Cases |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Data Structures** (`ToolResult`, `SubTask`, `Task`, `Message`, etc.) | Factory methods, immutability, validation, serialization | - `ToolResult.success()` creates result with `SUCCESS` status<br>- `SubTask.is_ready()` returns `False` when dependencies not met<br>- `Message.to_dict()` and `from_dict()` are inverses |\n| **Tool System** | Parameter validation, execution safety, error handling | - `ToolExecutionEngine._validate_arguments()` rejects invalid types<br>- Tool timeout triggers `ToolResult.timeout()`<br>- JSON schema validation produces descriptive errors |\n| **Parsers & Utilities** | String parsing, JSON extraction, state transitions | - `parse_llm_action_response()` extracts tool name and args from text<br>- `extract_json_from_text()` handles nested JSON and malformed brackets<br>- State machine transitions follow defined rules |\n| **Memory Components** | Storage, retrieval, compression logic (without vector DB) | - `EpisodicMemory.get_recent()` respects token limits<br>- `WorkingMemory` stores and retrieves key-value pairs<br>- Memory summarizer produces coherent summaries |\n| **Communication Layer** | Message passing, subscription management | - `MessageBus.publish()` delivers to correct subscribers<br>- Unsubscribe removes agent from all topics<br>- Message serialization preserves all fields |\n\n**Mental Model: The Component Specification Sheet**\nEach unit test acts like a quality control checklist for a manufactured component. Just as a gear has specifications for tooth count, diameter, and material hardness, our `ToolResult` has specifications for status, content, and metadata. The unit test verifies that each instance meets these specifications under all expected conditions (and gracefully handles unexpected ones).\n\n#### Integration Tests: Validating Component Interactions\n\nIntegration tests verify that components work together correctly when connected. For AI agent systems, this is particularly critical because the interfaces between components (LLM prompting, action parsing, observation formatting) are where many subtle bugs emerge. We use **mocking** to isolate the framework from external dependencies (LLM APIs, vector databases, external tool APIs) to maintain determinism.\n\n**Key Integration Test Patterns:**\n\n| Test Scenario | Components Involved | Mock Strategy | Verification Points |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **ReAct Loop with Mocked LLM** | `ReActAgent`, `ToolRegistry`, `ToolExecutionEngine` | Mock LLM returns predetermined responses in sequence | - Loop progresses through think-act-observe cycles<br>- Tool calls are made with correct arguments<br>- Loop terminates after final answer or iteration limit |\n| **Planner with Tool Registry** | `Planner`, `ToolRegistry`, `Task` decomposition | Mock LLM returns predetermined decomposition JSON | - Generated `Task` has valid DAG structure<br>- Subtasks reference available tools<br>- Dependencies respect logical ordering |\n| **Memory Retrieval & Context Injection** | `MemoryRetriever`, `EpisodicMemory`, `LongTermMemory` (mock) | Mock vector store returns predetermined relevant memories | - Retrieved context fits within token budget<br>- Most relevant memories are included<br>- Formatting follows prompt template |\n| **Multi-Agent Message Passing** | `OrchestratorAgent`, `WorkerAgent`, `MessageBus` | Mock agents with predefined response behaviors | - Messages are routed to correct recipients<br>- Task delegation follows role matching<br>- Results are aggregated correctly |\n| **Error Recovery Flow** | `RecoveryOrchestrator`, `ToolExecutionEngine`, `ReActAgent` | Mock tools that fail in specific patterns | - Errors are classified correctly by severity<br>- Appropriate recovery handlers are invoked<br>- Circuit breakers open after repeated failures |\n\n**Mental Model: The Assembly Line Test Station**\nIntegration tests are like testing stations along an assembly line where we verify that partially assembled units function together. We test that the robotic arm (ReAct loop) correctly picks up a component (tool call) from the conveyor belt (tool registry) and places it in the assembly (task execution). By mocking the external power source (LLM), we can run these tests repeatedly without variation.\n\n#### End-to-End Tests: The Reality Check\n\nEnd-to-end (E2E) tests validate the complete system with minimal mocks—typically using a real but lightweight LLM (like a small local model) to perform actual reasoning. These tests are **non-deterministic** due to LLM variance but provide essential confidence that the system works in practice. We run them less frequently and accept some flakiness, focusing on high-level success criteria rather than exact outputs.\n\n**E2E Test Characteristics:**\n\n| Aspect | Approach | Rationale |\n|--------|----------|-----------|\n| **LLM Selection** | Use small, fast local model (e.g., Phi-3-mini, Gemma-2B) or free tier of cloud API | Balances realism with cost/speed; avoids production API costs |\n| **Task Complexity** | Simple, well-defined tasks with clear success criteria (e.g., \"What is 15% of 200?\") | Reduces LLM reasoning errors; makes pass/fail assessment unambiguous |\n| **Validation Method** | Approximate matching (contains keywords, numeric range, regex patterns) | Accommodates LLM output variance while verifying core intent |\n| **Flakiness Handling** | Retry failed tests, mark as non-blocking in CI, maintain stability dashboard | Accepts that LLMs are stochastic; focuses on trend analysis |\n| **Tool Mocking** | Mock only external APIs (web search, database), keep calculator/filesystem real | Isoles network unreliability while testing actual tool execution |\n\n**Example E2E Test Scenario:** `test_agent_calculates_percentage`\n1. **Setup**: Register `CalculatorTool`, initialize agent with simple ReAct loop\n2. **Input**: User query: \"What is 15% of 200?\"\n3. **Execution**: Run `Agent.run_task()` with lightweight LLM\n4. **Verification**: Output should contain \"30\" (or reasoning leading to 30)\n5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Test passes if output contains \"30\" within 3 ReAct iterations\n\n> **Key Insight**: The testing pyramid for AI systems *inverts* the traditional cost-benefit ratio at the top. While E2E tests are valuable for validating the full system, they're expensive, slow, and flaky. Therefore, we invest heavily in comprehensive unit and integration tests that catch 90% of issues, using E2E tests as periodic sanity checks rather than primary quality gates.\n\n### Milestone Verification Checkpoints\n\nEach project milestone has concrete verification checkpoints—specific tests or commands that objectively demonstrate the milestone's acceptance criteria are met. These checkpoints serve as **exit criteria** for each development phase and ensure the system is evolving correctly.\n\n#### Milestone 1: Tool System Verification\n\n**Checkpoint Objective**: Verify that tools can be registered, validated, executed safely, and produce structured results.\n\n| Test Category | Specific Verification | Expected Outcome | Command to Run |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Tool Registration** | Dynamic tool addition at runtime | New tool appears in `ToolRegistry.list_tools()` | `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_tool_registry.py::test_register_tool_dynamically -v` |\n| **Parameter Validation** | JSON schema validation rejects invalid inputs | Descriptive error message returned, tool not executed | `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_tool_execution.py::test_validation_rejects_malformed_input -v` |\n| **Safe Execution** | Timeout enforcement for hanging tools | `ToolResult.timeout()` returned after specified timeout | `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_tool_safety.py::test_tool_timeout_enforced -v` |\n| **Built-in Tools** | Calculator tool performs arithmetic correctly | `ToolResult.success()` with correct calculation | `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_builtin_tools.py::test_calculator_tool -v` |\n| **Error Handling** | Tool exceptions caught and converted to error result | `ToolResult.error()` with error message preserved | `python -m pytest tests/integration/test_tool_error_handling.py::test_tool_exception_handled -v` |\n\n**Concrete Verification Script**:\n```bash\n# Run the comprehensive tool system test suite\npytest tests/unit/test_tool_registry.py \\\n       tests/unit/test_tool_execution.py \\\n       tests/integration/test_tool_safety.py \\\n       -v --tb=short\n\n# Expected: All tests pass (no failures, no skips)\n# Green checkmarks for:\n# ✓ ToolRegistry registers and retrieves tools\n# ✓ Parameter validation rejects type mismatches\n# ✓ Timeout protection works (test may take up to 2 seconds)\n# ✓ Calculator tool returns correct results\n# ✓ Error results contain descriptive messages\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps**:\n1.

Submit task: \"Research the average rainfall in Seattle and write a one-paragraph summary\"\n4. Verify:\n   - Orchestrator decomposes task and delegates research to Researcher\n   - Researcher sends findings to Writer via message bus\n   - Writer produces summary, possibly asking Calculator for conversions\n   - Orchestrator receives all outputs and synthesizes final answer\n5. Check that all messages are properly routed and no agent is idle when work exists\n\n> **Critical Success Factor**: The verification checkpoints are designed to be **objective and automatable**. Each test produces a clear pass/fail result, avoiding subjective assessments like \"the agent seems to reason well.\" This rigor ensures the framework meets its functional requirements before moving to the next milestone.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nTesting autonomous AI systems requires careful architecture to balance realism with determinism. The key is to create **testable seams**—interfaces where we can substitute real components with mocks during testing.\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n**Python Testing Best Practices**:\n1. **Async Testing**: Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator for async tests. Ensure event loop is properly managed.\n2. **Mocking**: `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` for mocking async methods, `unittest.mock.MagicMock` for sync methods.\n3. **Deterministic Tests**: Seed random number generators (`np.random.seed(42)`) in tests involving randomness.\n4. **Timeout Controls**: Use `asyncio.wait_for()` with short timeouts in tests to catch hangs.\n5. **Fixture Management**: Use `@pytest.fixture` with appropriate scopes (function, class, session) to share test setup.\n\n**Testing Asynchronous Code**:\n```python\n# Example pattern for testing async components\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\nasync def test_async_message_bus():\n    bus = MessageBus()\n    received = []\n    \n    async def callback(msg):\n        received.append(msg)\n    \n    bus.subscribe(\"agent1\", callback, [\"topic1\"])\n    await bus.publish(Message(sender=\"test\", receiver=\"*\", message_type=\"task\", content={}))\n    \n    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)  # Small delay for async delivery\n    assert len(received) == 1\n```\n\n#### F.

Debugging Tips for Test Failures\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Tool tests hang forever** | Tool execution not timing out | Check `ToolExecutionEngine._timeout_context()` implementation | Ensure timeout uses `asyncio.wait_for` or `signal.alarm` |\n| **ReAct loop gets stuck** | LLM mock not returning final answer | Inspect mock response sequence; check parser output | Ensure mock includes `{\"action\": \"final\", ...}` response |\n| **Memory retrieval returns nothing** | Embedding mismatch or empty store | Log query embedding and stored embeddings | Check embedding generation; verify store has content |\n| **Async tests fail with event loop errors** | Event loop already running or closed | Check pytest-asyncio version and fixture usage | Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator; avoid nested event loops |\n| **Tests pass locally but fail in CI** | Timing differences or race conditions | Add logging to see execution order; increase timeouts | Use deterministic mocks; add small delays in async tests |\n| **E2E tests flaky** | LLM variance or network issues | Capture LLM responses; check for consistent patterns | Use more specific prompts; implement retry with backoff |\n| **Coverage reports show untested error paths** | Missing negative test cases | Review coverage report for uncovered lines | Add tests for validation failures, timeout, circuit breaker open |\n\n> **Final Verification**: After completing all five milestones, run the comprehensive test suite with `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`. Expect 80+ passing tests with 85%+ code coverage. The system should demonstrate all core capabilities: tool execution, ReAct reasoning, task planning, memory management, and multi-agent collaboration through deterministic tests, with optional E2E tests showing real task completion.\n\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n## 9. Debugging Guide\n\nAutonomous AI agents represent a complex, non-deterministic system where traditional debugging approaches often fall short. When an agent fails—getting stuck in a loop, producing incorrect results, or crashing unexpectedly—the root cause can be buried in multiple layers: the LLM's reasoning, the tool execution, the planning logic, or the memory system. This section provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and fixing common issues that arise during development of the framework.\n\n### Common Bug Symptoms and Fixes\n\nThe following table catalogs the most frequent failure modes observed when building AI agent systems, organized by their primary symptoms. Each entry includes the observable behavior, the underlying technical causes, and concrete step-by-step fixes to implement.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause(s) | Step-by-Step Fix |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Agent gets stuck in an infinite loop, repeating the same tool call** | 1. **Missing termination condition**: The LLM isn't being prompted with a clear \"final answer\" format or the parser isn't detecting it.<br>2. **Tool result not informative**: The observation returned to the LLM doesn't provide enough context to progress.<br>3. **Maximum iteration limit not enforced**: The `ReActLoopContext.iteration` counter isn't being checked or `max_iterations` is set too high. | 1. **Inspect the prompt template**: Ensure your `_format_react_prompt` includes explicit instructions like \"If you have the final answer, respond with `Final Answer:` followed by the answer.\"<br>2. **Check the action parser**: Verify `parse_llm_action_response` correctly identifies both `Action:` and `Final Answer:` patterns.<br>3. **Add loop detection**: Track previous actions in `ReActLoopContext.previous_actions` and detect when the same tool with same arguments is called repeatedly; break with an error observation.<br>4. **Set conservative limits**: Start with `max_iterations=10` during development and incrementally increase only after verifying loop stability. |\n| **LLM hallucinates non-existent tools** | 1. **Tool descriptions too vague**: The LLM cannot distinguish between similar-sounding tools.<br>2. **Tool list not updated in prompt**: Available tools aren't being dynamically injected into each cycle's prompt.<br>3. **No validation before execution**: The system attempts to execute a hallucinated tool name instead of rejecting it. | 1. **Improve tool descriptions**: Rewrite tool `description` fields to be distinct and action-oriented (e.g., \"Search the web for current information using DuckDuckGo\" vs. \"Get data from the internet\").<br>2. **Implement tool validation**: In `ReActAgent._run_single_cycle`, after parsing the action, call `ToolRegistry.get_tool(tool_name)` and if `None`, return an error observation: \"Tool {tool_name} does not exist. Available tools: ...\"<br>3. **Include tool signatures in prompt**: Format available tools with their JSON schema parameters so the LLM understands required arguments. |\n| **Action parsing fails silently** | 1. **LLM output format mismatch**: The LLM is producing free-form text instead of the expected `Action: {\"tool\": \"...\", \"args\": {...}}` format.<br>2. **JSON parsing too strict**: The `extract_json_from_text` function fails on valid but slightly malformed JSON (trailing commas, single quotes).<br>3. **Regex pattern incomplete**: The regex in `parse_llm_action_response` doesn't capture all valid variations of the action format. | 1. **Add robust JSON parsing**: Implement a fallback in `extract_json_from_text` that attempts to fix common JSON issues (replace single quotes with double quotes, add missing closing braces).<br>2. **Log the raw LLM response**: Always log the complete LLM output before parsing to see what format is actually being produced.<br>3. **Use function calling if available**: If your LLM provider supports structured function calling (OpenAI, Anthropic), switch to that API instead of text parsing.<br>4. **Improve prompt engineering**: Add explicit examples of correct action format in the few-shot examples within your prompt template. |\n| **Tool execution hangs forever** | 1. **Missing timeout**: Tool execution is not wrapped in a timeout context manager.<br>2. **Network dependency unresponsive**: External API calls (web search, database) may hang indefinitely.<br>3. **Synchronous blocking in async context**: A synchronous tool is blocking the entire event loop. | 1. **Implement mandatory timeouts**: In `ToolExecutionEngine.execute_tool_call`, wrap the execution in `_timeout_context(timeout_seconds)` with a sensible default (e.g., 30 seconds).<br>2. **Use async for I/O-bound tools**: Implement tools with async `execute` methods and use `asyncio.wait_for` for timeout control.<br>3. **Add circuit breakers**: Use `ToolExecutionEngine._update_circuit_breaker` to temporarily disable tools that repeatedly timeout or fail. |\n| **Subtask dependencies cause deadlock** | 1. **Circular dependency in DAG**: Subtask A depends on B, and B depends on A, either directly or transitively.<br>2. **Dependency not marked complete**: A subtask's `status` remains `EXECUTING` after completion due to missing `SubTask.with_status(COMPLETED)` call.<br>3. **Missing dependency tracking**: The `Plan.execution_order` doesn't respect all dependencies during topological sort. | 1. **Validate DAG acyclicity**: In `Planner.create_plan`, after building the dependency graph, run a cycle detection algorithm (DFS with three-color marking) and reject circular plans.<br>2. **Implement proper status transitions**: Ensure every subtask moves from `EXECUTING` to `COMPLETED` (or `FAILED`) via immutable updates: `task.update_subtask(subtask.with_status(COMPLETED).with_result(result))`.<br>3. **Use topological sort with dependency checking**: In `ExecutionFlow.get_next_ready_subtask`, verify `subtask.is_ready(completed_task_ids)` checks all dependencies, not just immediate ones. |\n| **Memory retrieval returns irrelevant context** | 1. **Poor embedding quality**: Using a generic sentence transformer not tuned for the domain.<br>2. **No query expansion**: The raw user query is used for vector search without augmentation.<br>3. **Missing metadata filtering**: Retrieved memories aren't filtered by recency or task relevance. | 1. **Improve query formulation**: In `MemoryRetriever.retrieve_context`, expand the query with context from `WorkingMemory` (current goal, subtask description) before embedding.<br>2. **Add hybrid search**: Combine vector similarity with keyword matching (BM25) and recency boosting.<br>3. **Implement relevance threshold**: In `LongTermMemory.query`, filter out results with similarity score below a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.7).<br>4. **Add metadata filters**: Store task ID, agent role, or tool names in `MemoryEntry.metadata` and filter retrievals by current context. |\n| **Multi-agent delegation creates infinite loops** | 1. **Delegation loop**: Agent A delegates to B, who delegates back to A for the same subtask.<br>2. **No timeout on delegated tasks**: A worker agent never responds, leaving the orchestrator waiting indefinitely.<br>3. **Missing conflict resolution**: Contradictory results from agents cause the orchestrator to repeatedly request re-execution. | 1. **Track delegation chain**: In `OrchestratorAgent._delegate_subtask`, store the chain of delegations in `DelegatedTask.metadata` and reject if the same agent appears twice.<br>2. **Set deadlines on delegated tasks**: Each `DelegatedTask` should have a `deadline` timestamp; implement a background cleanup task that marks overdue tasks as failed.<br>3. **Implement voting or authority**: In `OrchestratorAgent._resolve_conflicts`, use a simple voting scheme (majority wins) or designate an expert agent as tie-breaker. |\n| **Context window exceeds token limit** | 1. **Unbounded conversation history**: `EpisodicMemory.append` is called for every turn without summarization or eviction.<br>2. **Too many retrieved memories**: `MemoryRetriever.retrieve_context` fetches more context than fits in the token budget.<br>3. **Inefficient prompt formatting**: The prompt template includes verbose tool descriptions or examples on every cycle. | 1. **Implement token counting**: In `EpisodicMemory.get_recent`, count tokens (approximately 4 chars per token) and truncate when exceeding `max_tokens`.<br>2. **Dynamic context budgeting**: Allocate token budgets: 50% for conversation history, 30% for retrieved memories, 20% for prompt template.<br>3. **Summarize old turns**: When history grows beyond threshold, call `LongTermMemory.summarize_recent` to compress older messages into a single summary entry.<br>4. **Streamline prompt**: Remove redundant instructions after the first cycle; use placeholders that only expand when needed. |\n| **Tool returns success but incorrect data** | 1. **Tool schema mismatch**: The tool's `parameters_schema` doesn't validate all required constraints (e.g., numeric ranges, string patterns).<br>2. **LLM misinterpretation**: The LLM passes arguments in wrong format (string vs number) that passes validation but produces wrong results.<br>3. **External API changed**: The underlying service API updated but the tool wrapper wasn't updated. | 1. **Strengthen schema validation**: Use JSON Schema `minimum`, `maximum`, `pattern`, `enum` constraints to catch invalid arguments before execution.<br>2. **Add example validation**: Include example valid/invalid parameter sets in tool documentation for LLM few-shot learning.<br>3. **Implement result validation**: After tool execution, validate the `ToolResult.content` against an expected output schema when possible.<br>4. **Monitor tool health**: Track tool success/failure rates in `ToolExecutionEngine` and alert when error rates spike. |\n| **Agent state becomes inconsistent after error** | 1. **Partial state updates**: An error occurs mid-update, leaving some components updated and others not.<br>2. **Missing error recovery rollback**: The `RecoveryOrchestrator` doesn't revert partial changes when recovery fails.<br>3. **Race conditions in async code**: Concurrent modifications to `ExecutionFlow.active_flows` without proper locking. | 1. **Use immutable updates**: Follow the **functional update** pattern: `flow = flow.mark_subtask_complete(subtask_id)` returns a new instance rather than mutating.<br>2. **Implement transaction-like boundaries**: Group related state changes into a single update operation protected by a lock.<br>3. **Add state validation checks**: Periodically validate invariants (e.g., a `COMPLETED` subtask must have a `result`) and trigger recovery if violated.<br>4. **Use `asyncio.Lock` for shared mutable state**: In `MessageBus` and `FlowController`, protect critical sections with locks. |\n\n### Debugging Techniques and Tools\n\nDebugging autonomous agents requires moving beyond traditional print statements to systematic inspection of the agent's internal reasoning process. The key insight is that the agent's \"thought process\" is partially observable through the sequence of thoughts, actions, and observations it generates. Below are proven techniques for illuminating the black box.\n\n#### Structured Logging of the Thought-Action Chain\n\nThe most powerful debugging tool is comprehensive, structured logging of every ReAct cycle. Instead of logging raw text, create a machine-readable log that captures the complete state at each step:\n\n> **Design Principle**: Log with enough context to replay any agent session offline for analysis. Every log entry should include the full `ReActLoopContext` and the raw LLM response.\n\n**Implementation Approach**:\n1. **Create a logging decorator** that wraps `ReActAgent._run_single_cycle` and logs:\n   - Cycle number (`context.iteration`)\n   - The formatted prompt sent to the LLM (truncated)\n   - The raw LLM response\n   - The parsed action (or final answer)\n   - The tool execution result (status, content snippet)\n   - The updated `AgentState`\n   - Timestamps for performance analysis\n\n2. **Use structured JSON logging** so logs can be queried and analyzed programmatically:\n   ```python\n   # Example log entry structure (conceptual, not code in main body)\n   {\n     \"timestamp\": \"2023-10-05T14:30:00Z\",\n     \"component\": \"ReActAgent\",\n     \"cycle\": 3,\n     \"state\": \"ACTING\",\n     \"action\": {\"tool\": \"web_search\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"current weather NYC\"}},\n     \"observation_preview\": \"Weather report: 72°F, sunny...\",\n     \"context_snapshot\": {\n        \"subtask_description\": \"Find current weather in New York\",\n        \"completed_actions\": [\"search_weather_api\"]\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Add correlation IDs**: Pass a unique `correlation_id` through the entire execution flow (from `Agent.run_task` down to individual tool calls) to trace requests across components.\n\n#### Inspecting the Prompt Sent to the LLM\n\nOften, the root cause of agent misbehavior lies in the prompt construction. The LLM can only work with what you give it, so inspecting the exact prompt (with all context injections) is crucial.\n\n**Debugging Procedure**:\n1. **Capture the complete prompt** by adding a debug flag to `ReActAgent._format_react_prompt` that writes the full prompt to a file when enabled.\n2. **Analyze prompt components**:\n   - **System instructions**: Are they clear about the agent's role and constraints?\n   - **Available tools list**: Are descriptions distinct? Are parameter schemas included?\n   - **Conversation history**: Is it truncated correctly? Are important earlier turns preserved?\n   - **Working memory context**: Is current task state properly injected?\n   - **Retrieved memories**: Are they actually relevant to the current subtask?\n   - **Few-shot examples**: Do they demonstrate correct reasoning and action format?\n3. **Test the prompt manually** in an LLM playground (OpenAI Playground, Anthropic Console) to see how the raw LLM responds without your parsing logic.\n\n#### Using an LLM Playground to Test Prompts\n\nWhen debugging prompt-related issues, interact directly with the LLM using the same model and parameters you're using in production.\n\n**Step-by-Step Workflow**:\n1. **Extract the problematic prompt** from your logs when the agent behaves incorrectly.\n2. **Paste it into the playground** with identical parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.).\n3. **Run multiple generations** (5-10) to see the distribution of responses:\n   - Does the LLM consistently produce the wrong format?\n   - Does it hallucinate tools even when they're clearly listed?\n   - Does it fail to recognize when it has the final answer?\n4. **Iteratively refine the prompt** based on these observations:\n   - Add more explicit instructions\n   - Improve few-shot examples\n   - Reorder sections (tools list before history, etc.)\n   - Adjust temperature (lower for more deterministic behavior)\n\n#### Visualizing the Task Execution DAG\n\nFor planning-related bugs, a visual representation of the task decomposition and execution progress is invaluable.\n\n**Implementation Approach**:\n1. **Export the Plan structure** to Graphviz DOT format or Mermaid syntax:\n   ```python\n   # Helper function to visualize plan\n   def plan_to_mermaid(plan: Plan) -> str:\n       mermaid_lines = [\"graph TD\"]\n       for subtask_id, deps in plan.subtask_dag.items():\n           for dep in deps:\n               mermaid_lines.append(f\"    {dep} --> {subtask_id}\")\n       return \"\\n\".join(mermaid_lines)\n   ```\n2. **Include status annotations** in the visualization by coloring nodes based on `SubTask.status` (green for COMPLETED, yellow for EXECUTING, red for FAILED).\n3. **Use this visualization** to identify:\n   - Circular dependencies (cycles in the graph)\n   - Long critical paths\n   - Bottlenecks where many tasks wait on a single dependency\n   - Subtasks stuck in EXECUTING state\n\n#### Interactive Debugging with the Python Debugger (PDB)\n\nFor complex logic errors in your Python code, traditional debugging tools still apply, but with some adaptations for async code.\n\n**Async-Aware Debugging Techniques**:\n1. **Use `asyncio.run()` wrappers** for testing individual components in isolation:\n   ```python\n   # Test a tool execution in isolation\n   result = asyncio.run(tool_registry.get_tool(\"calculator\").execute({\"operation\": \"add\", \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3}))\n   ```\n2. **Set breakpoints in async functions** with `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` but ensure you're in an async context:\n   - Use `await`-compatible debugging: `import aiodebug; aiodebug.log_slow_callbacks.enable()`\n   - Or use the built-in `asyncio` debug mode: `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1`\n3. **Debug event loop issues** by inspecting task states:\n   ```python\n   # List all running tasks\n   tasks = asyncio.all_tasks()\n   for task in tasks:\n       print(task.get_name(), task.get_coro(), task.done())\n   ```\n\n#### Mock LLM for Deterministic Testing\n\nWhen debugging agent logic (not prompt issues), replace the real LLM with a `MockLLM` that returns predetermined responses. This isolates your code from LLM variability.\n\n**Debugging Workflow**:\n1. **Create a sequence of mock responses** that replicates the problematic scenario:\n   ```python\n   mock_responses = create_mocked_llm_response_chain(\n       \"Thought: I need to search for the weather. Action: {'tool': 'web_search', 'args': {'query': 'weather NYC'}}\",\n       \"Thought: Now I have the weather data. Final Answer: The weather is 72°F and sunny.\"\n   )\n   ```\n2. **Swap the real LLM** with `MockLLM(response_sequence=mock_responses)` in your test.\n3. **Run the exact same agent code** and verify:\n   - Does the agent follow the expected path?\n   - Where does it diverge from the mock script?\n   - Which component (parser, state machine, etc.) is causing the divergence?\n\n#### Monitoring and Metrics Dashboard\n\nFor production debugging, implement a real-time dashboard showing key agent metrics:\n\n**Essential Metrics to Track**:\n- **ReAct cycle duration** (LLM call time + tool execution time)\n- **Tool success/failure rates** per tool name\n- **Context window utilization** (tokens used vs. limit)\n- **Memory retrieval hit rate** (percentage of queries finding relevant memories)\n- **Plan execution progress** (subtasks completed/total over time)\n\n**Implementation Approach**:\n1. **Instrument key methods** with timing decorators that push metrics to a time-series database (Prometheus, InfluxDB).\n2. **Create Grafana dashboards** with panels for each metric, allowing you to correlate agent failures with resource usage patterns.\n3. **Set up alerts** for anomalous patterns (e.g., tool failure rate > 20%, average cycle time > 30 seconds).\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n**Python Async Debugging Tips:**\n1. **Use `asyncio.create_task()` with proper naming**: Name your tasks for better debugging: `task = asyncio.create_task(coroutine(), name=\"tool_execution_web_search\")`\n2. **Enable debug mode**: Run your agent with `PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=1` to get warnings about unawaited coroutines.\n3. **Monitor event loop delays**: Use `loop.slow_callback_duration = 0.1` to log callbacks taking >100ms.\n4. **Use `asyncio.gather()` with `return_exceptions=True`**: This prevents one failing task from canceling all others, making debugging easier.\n\n**Structured Logging Tips:**\n1. **Add correlation IDs at task start**: Generate a unique ID when `Agent.run_task` begins and pass it through all components.\n2. **Log in JSON format for machine processing**: Use `json.dumps()` with `default=str` to handle datetime objects.\n3. **Include component hierarchy in log names**: Use `logging.getLogger(\"archon.agents.ReActAgent\")` for fine-grained control.\n\n#### F. Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|----------------|-----|\n| **Agent consistently chooses wrong tool** | 1. Check tool descriptions in logs<br>2. Test the prompt in playground with different tool ordering<br>3. Count how often each tool is called incorrectly | 1. Rewrite descriptions to highlight distinctions<br>2. Add negative examples in few-shot<br>3. Implement tool confidence scoring |\n| **Memory retrieval slows down agent** | 1. Profile `LongTermMemory.query` execution time<br>2. Check vector store connection latency<br>3. Count number of memories retrieved per query | 1. Add caching layer for frequent queries<br>2. Use approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)<br>3. Limit retrieval to top 3 most relevant |\n| **Multi-agent message bus deadlock** | 1. Log message queue sizes over time<br>2. Check for agents not processing their queues<br>3. Look for circular message dependencies | 1. Implement queue size limits with backpressure<br>2. Add message TTL (time-to-live)<br>3. Use dead letter queue for unprocessable messages |\n\n\n## 10. Future Extensions\n\n> **Milestone(s):** None (these are potential enhancements beyond the current project scope)\n\nThe architecture of Project Archon has been intentionally designed as a modular, extensible foundation. While the core framework addresses the fundamental challenges of autonomous AI agents—tool use, planning, memory, and collaboration—the design leaves room for numerous advanced capabilities that could be built upon this foundation. This section explores potential future directions, illustrating how the existing architecture can accommodate these extensions without requiring fundamental redesign.\n\n### 10.1 Extension Ideas\n\nThe following table catalogs potential enhancement areas, organized by the architectural layer they would extend. Each idea includes a description of the functionality, how it would integrate with existing components, and key implementation considerations.\n\n| Extension Category | Core Idea | Integration Point | Key Considerations |\n|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Enable human oversight, intervention, and guidance during agent execution | `FlowController` intercept points, `ToolRegistry` for human interaction tools | Must balance autonomy with human control; design non-blocking async interfaces for human responses |\n| **Advanced Tool Chaining** | Allow tools to call other tools, enabling composition of complex workflows | `ToolExecutionEngine` with recursive execution, new `CompositeTool` type | Need to prevent infinite recursion, manage execution context, handle error propagation between chained tools |\n| **Learning from Experience** | Agents improve performance over time by learning from past task outcomes | `LongTermMemory` extension with success/failure metadata, reinforcement learning module | Requires reward function definition, careful handling of negative examples to avoid harmful learning |\n| **Web UI & Dashboard** | Visual interface for monitoring agent activity, inspecting plans, and providing input | New `UIServer` component that subscribes to system events via `MessageBus` | Real-time updates, historical playback, security of agent control endpoints |\n| **Multi-Modal Tools** | Extend tool system to handle images, audio, video, and other media types | Enhanced `Tool` interface with MIME type support, new embedding providers for vector store | Token budget management for large media, specialized LLMs for multi-modal understanding |\n| **Scripting & Automation** | Allow users to define reusable agent workflows as scripts or templates | New `WorkflowRegistry` storing predefined `Task` templates with parameterization | Template variable substitution, dependency injection of context, versioning of workflow definitions |\n| **Advanced Orchestration Patterns** | Extend multi-agent collaboration with market-based, swarm, or federated patterns | Alternative `OrchestrationPattern` implementations beyond hierarchical | Complex coordination logic, performance overhead from agent negotiation, emergent behavior risks |\n| **External Knowledge Integration** | Connect agents to live databases, knowledge graphs, and real-time data streams | New `KnowledgeConnector` tool category with streaming capabilities | Rate limiting, data freshness guarantees, handling of structured vs unstructured knowledge |\n| **Cross-Agent Tool Sharing** | Allow agents to dynamically share tools with each other during collaboration | Extension to `MessageBus` with tool advertisement/discovery protocol | Security implications of tool access, permission models, tool compatibility checking |\n| **Explainability & Auditing** | Generate detailed explanations of agent decisions and maintain audit trails | Enhanced logging with causal reasoning chains, new `ExplanationGenerator` component | Storage overhead, query performance for audit trails, privacy considerations for sensitive tasks |\n\n#### 10.1.1 Human-in-the-Loop Integration\n\n> **Mental Model:** The **Flight Control Center** for Autonomous Operations. Think of the agent as an autonomous spacecraft and human operators as mission control. The spacecraft operates independently most of the time, but for critical decisions, unforeseen situations, or when explicit approval is needed, it establishes a communication channel with mission control, awaits guidance, then proceeds with the updated instructions.\n\nThe current framework operates in fully autonomous mode. A human-in-the-loop extension would introduce controlled interruption points where humans can review, approve, redirect, or provide additional information. This addresses the fundamental tension between agent autonomy and safety/control requirements.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Interception Points in the Execution Flow:** The `FlowController.execute_task()` method would gain configuration options to define interception triggers:\n   - **Pre-execution approval:** Before starting a `Task` with specific characteristics (uses certain tools, involves sensitive operations)\n   - **Mid-execution checkpoints:** After completing specific `SubTask` milestones or when confidence scores fall below threshold\n   - **Exception handling:** When `RecoveryOrchestrator` encounters errors above a certain severity level\n\n2. **Human Interaction as Special Tools:** Human input would be modeled as special `Tool` instances (e.g., `HumanApprovalTool`, `HumanGuidanceTool`) that:\n   - Block execution until human response (with configurable timeout)\n   - Format requests in human-readable form (e.g., Markdown, with context summary)\n   - Parse and validate human responses back into structured data\n\n3. **Async Notification System:** A new `NotificationService` component would:\n   - Push interruption requests to configured channels (web UI, email, Slack)\n   - Maintain request state with correlation to the paused `ExecutionFlow`\n   - Resume execution when human response arrives or timeout expires\n\n**Architecture Decision: Human Response Handling Pattern**\n\n> **Decision: Async-Await with Timeout Fallback for Human Responses**\n> - **Context:** Human responses are inherently asynchronous and unpredictable. The agent must wait for input but cannot block indefinitely if the human is unavailable.\n> - **Options Considered:**\n>   1. **Synchronous blocking:** Agent thread blocks indefinitely waiting for human response (simple but risks deadlock)\n>   2. **Async with timeout:** Agent pauses execution, stores state, continues when response arrives or after timeout (preserves resources but requires state management)\n>   3. **Optimistic continuation with rollback:** Agent proceeds with best guess, human can later approve/correct (maintains flow but complex rollback logic)\n> - **Decision:** Option 2 (async with timeout) balances responsiveness with robustness. The agent pauses the specific `ExecutionFlow`, allowing other tasks to continue, and implements a timeout fallback to predefined policies (abort, continue with default, escalate to another human).\n> - **Rationale:** This pattern matches real-world operational practices (pilots awaiting ATC clearance), allows efficient resource use (single agent can manage multiple paused flows), and provides clear failure modes when humans are unresponsive.\n> - **Consequences:** Requires persistent storage of paused flow states, adds complexity to `FlowController` state management, introduces latency for tasks requiring human input.\n\n#### 10.1.2 Advanced Tool Chaining & Composition\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Function Composition in Mathematics.** Just as mathematical functions can be composed (f(g(x))) to create more complex operations, tools can be chained together where the output of one tool becomes the input to another. This enables building complex capabilities from simpler, well-tested primitives.\n\nThe current tool system treats each tool as an independent, atomic operation. Advanced tool chaining would allow tools to call other tools, enabling the creation of higher-level abstractions and reusable workflows.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **CompositeTool Type:** A new `CompositeTool` class implementing the `Tool` interface that:\n   - Contains a directed graph of tool calls with data flow between them\n   - Defines input/output mappings between consecutive tools\n   - Handles error propagation and partial execution rollback\n\n2. **Tool Execution Context Extension:** The `ToolExecutionEngine` would be enhanced to:\n   - Maintain a call stack for nested tool executions\n   - Propagate execution context (user ID, session data) through the chain\n   - Implement circuit breakers at both individual tool and composite tool levels\n\n3. **Visual Workflow Builder:** A companion UI component allowing users to:\n   - Drag-and-drop tools to create workflows\n   - Define conditional logic and loops in the tool chain\n   - Test workflows with sample data before deployment\n\n**Example Composite Tool: \"Research and Summarize\"**\n```plaintext\nCompositeTool: research_and_summarize(topic: str, depth: str) -> str\n  Steps:\n  1. web_search(topic, num_results=5) → list[search_results]\n  2. For each result in search_results:\n      a. fetch_webpage(url) → webpage_content\n      b. extract_key_points(webpage_content) → key_points\n  3. synthesize_summary(all_key_points, depth) → final_summary\n  4. Return final_summary\n```\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Tool Chaining:**\n\n- ⚠️ **Pitfall: Infinite Recursion Chains**  \n  **Description:** A composite tool inadvertently includes itself in its own chain, either directly or through intermediate tools, causing infinite recursion.  \n  **Why Wrong:** Causes stack overflow, consumes resources indefinitely, halts agent execution.  \n  **Fix:** Implement cycle detection in composite tool validation, maintain visited tool set during execution, enforce maximum recursion depth.\n\n- ⚠️ **Pitfall: Context Bleed Between Chains**  \n  **Description:** Execution context from one tool chain unintentionally influences another chain running concurrently.  \n  **Why Wrong:** Leads to unpredictable behavior, security issues if sensitive context leaks.  \n  **Fix:** Implement isolated execution contexts for each composite tool invocation, use functional updates for context propagation.\n\n#### 10.1.3 Learning from Experience via Reinforcement\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Professional Apprenticeship.** Just as an apprentice learns from both successes and mistakes under a master's guidance, the agent can improve its performance over time by analyzing which actions led to successful outcomes and which led to failures, adjusting its future behavior accordingly.\n\nThe current memory system stores experiences but doesn't actively learn from them to improve future performance. A reinforcement learning extension would enable the agent to optimize its planning and tool selection strategies based on historical outcomes.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Experience Replay Storage:** Extend `LongTermMemory` to store:\n   - Complete execution traces (state, action, reward, next state)\n   - Success/failure labels with human or automated feedback\n   - Metadata about execution conditions (time, resource usage, complexity)\n\n2. **Reward Function Service:** A new component that:\n   - Computes reward signals from execution outcomes (speed, accuracy, cost)\n   - Incorporates explicit human feedback scores\n   - Balances multiple objectives (efficiency vs. thoroughness)\n\n3. **Policy Optimization Module:** Integrates with the `Planner` and `ReActAgent` to:\n   - Fine-tune prompt templates based on successful patterns\n   - Adjust tool selection probabilities (prefer tools with high success rates)\n   - Learn when to replan vs. retry failed subtasks\n\n**Training Data Flow:**\n```\nExecution Complete → \n  Store Trace in Experience Replay → \n    Periodic Batch Training → \n      Update Policy Model → \n        Deploy Updated Model to Agents\n```\n\n**Architecture Decision: Online vs. Offline Learning**\n\n> **Decision: Hybrid Online/Offline Learning with Human Oversight**\n> - **Context:** Agents operate in production environments where mistakes can have real consequences. We need learning that improves performance without introducing unpredictable behavior during learning.\n> - **Options Considered:**\n>   1. **Pure offline learning:** Collect traces, train periodically in isolated environment, deploy updated models (safe but delayed improvement)\n>   2. **Pure online learning:** Continuously update policy during execution (fast adaptation but risk of learning harmful behaviors)\n>   3. **Hybrid approach:** Offline learning for major updates, online tuning of safe parameters (e.g., tool selection weights) with bounds\n> - **Decision:** Option 3 (hybrid) with human approval gate for significant policy changes. Minor adjustments (tool preference weights) update online within safe bounds, while major architecture changes (new planning strategies) require offline training and human review.\n> - **Rationale:** Balances safety with adaptability. Most real-world autonomous systems (self-driving cars, industrial robots) use similar hybrid approaches where core models update offline but tuning parameters adjust online within constraints.\n> - **Consequences:** Requires versioning of agent policies, A/B testing infrastructure for new policies, clear rollback procedures if new policies degrade performance.\n\n#### 10.1.4 Web UI & Dashboard for Monitoring\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Air Traffic Control Radar Display.** Just as air traffic controllers monitor multiple aircraft on a radar screen with overlays showing altitude, speed, and trajectory, the Web UI provides a real-time visualization of multiple agent activities, their current state, execution plans, and any issues requiring attention.\n\nWhile the framework is designed as a backend system, a Web UI extension would dramatically improve operational visibility, debugging capabilities, and user interaction.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Event Streaming Layer:** Extend the `MessageBus` to:\n   - Broadcast system events (agent state changes, tool executions, errors) to WebSocket clients\n   - Support filtering and subscription by event type, agent ID, or task ID\n   - Buffer events during client disconnection with configurable retention\n\n2. **UI Server Component:** A new FastAPI/Flask service that:\n   - Serves static frontend assets and API endpoints\n   - Manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates\n   - Provides REST API for historical querying and control actions\n\n3. **Frontend Dashboard:** React/Vue application with:\n   - Real-time visualization of agent activity (similar to process monitoring tools)\n   - Interactive plan editor for modifying ongoing tasks\n   - Chat interface for direct interaction with agents\n   - Analytics views showing performance metrics over time\n\n**Key UI Views and Their Data Sources:**\n\n| View | Purpose | Data Source |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| **Agent Fleet Overview** | Monitor all active agents | `AgentState` events via `MessageBus` |\n| **Task Execution Timeline** | Visualize subtask dependencies and progress | `ExecutionFlow` state, `SubTask` status updates |\n| **Memory Explorer** | Inspect and search agent memories | `LongTermMemory.query()` API |\n| **Tool Performance Dashboard** | Monitor tool success rates and latency | `ToolExecutionEngine` metrics |\n| **Prompt Playground** | Test and refine LLM prompts | Direct `MockLLM` interface with real prompt inspection |\n\n**Implementation Consideration: Security Model**\nThe UI would need robust authentication and authorization since it provides control capabilities over agents. Recommended approach: role-based access control (RBAC) with:\n- **Viewer role:** Read-only access to monitoring data\n- **Operator role:** Can pause/resume agents, provide human input\n- **Admin role:** Can modify tool registry, update agent configurations\n- **Auditor role:** Access to full execution logs for compliance\n\n#### 10.1.5 Multi-Modal Tool Extension\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Swiss Army Knife with Specialized Attachments.** The core tool system is like a basic Swiss Army knife with standard tools (knife, screwdriver). Multi-modal extensions add specialized attachments (magnifying glass, saw, file) that handle different material types (text, images, audio) but all attach to the same base handle (the tool interface).\n\nCurrent tools primarily handle text inputs and outputs. Multi-modal extensions would enable tools that process images, audio, video, and other media types, significantly expanding the agent's capabilities in real-world applications.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Enhanced Tool Interface:** Extend the `Tool` base class with:\n   - `input_mime_types: List[str]` - Supported input formats\n   - `output_mime_types: List[str]` - Supported output formats  \n   - `max_input_size: int` - Maximum file size in bytes\n   - Media-specific validation logic\n\n2. **Media Processing Pipeline:** New components for:\n   - **Media embedding:** Generate vector embeddings for images/audio to store in `LongTermMemory`\n   - **Media chunking:** Split large files (videos, long audio) into processable segments\n   - **Format conversion:** Transcode between formats for tool compatibility\n\n3. **Multi-Modal LLM Integration:** Extend LLM interface to support:\n   - Vision models that accept image URLs or base64-encoded images\n   - Audio transcription models\n   - Multi-modal prompt templates that mix text and media references\n\n**Example Multi-Modal Tools:**\n\n| Tool Name | Input | Output | Use Case |\n|-----------|-------|--------|----------|\n| `image_analyzer` | Image file (PNG, JPEG) | JSON description of image content | Visual question answering, image captioning |\n| `document_ocr` | Scanned PDF/image | Extracted text with layout metadata | Processing scanned documents, receipts |\n| `audio_transcriber` | Audio file (MP3, WAV) | Text transcript with speaker diarization | Meeting notes, podcast summarization |\n| `video_summarizer` | Video file (MP4) | Key frames + audio transcript | Video content analysis, highlight generation |\n\n**Challenges and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Token Budget Management:** Media files consume significant context window space when encoded as text (base64) or described in detail. Mitigation: Implement intelligent compression strategies—store media in external storage, reference by URL in prompts, use embeddings for similarity search rather than raw content.\n\n2. **Tool Compatibility:** Not all LLMs support multi-modal inputs. Mitigation: Implement fallback strategies—extract text descriptions from media first, then process with text-only LLM; use specialized models for specific modalities with results fed back to main agent.\n\n3. **Performance Latency:** Media processing is computationally intensive. Mitigation: Implement async processing pipelines, support streaming partial results, use GPU acceleration where available.\n\n#### 10.1.6 Scripting & Automation Workflows\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Macro Recorder for Complex Tasks.** Similar to how spreadsheet users record macros to automate repetitive multi-step operations, this extension allows users to capture successful agent executions as reusable templates that can be parameterized and invoked with different inputs.\n\nWhile the `Planner` decomposes tasks dynamically, many real-world workflows follow predictable patterns that could be captured and reused. Scripting enables users to define parameterized templates for common task types.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Workflow Template Registry:** New component storing:\n   - Parameterized `Task` templates with placeholder variables\n   - Input/output schemas for template validation\n   - Version history and dependency tracking\n\n2. **Template Language:** A YAML/JSON-based DSL for defining workflows:\n   ```yaml\n   workflow:\n     name: \"weekly_research_report\"\n     parameters:\n       - name: \"topic\"\n         type: \"string\"\n         description: \"Research topic\"\n     steps:\n       - tool: \"web_search\"\n         args:\n           query: \"{{topic}} latest developments 2024\"\n       - tool: \"summarize_documents\"\n         args:\n           documents: \"{{step1.results}}\"\n       - tool: \"format_report\"\n         args:\n           content: \"{{step2.summary}}\"\n           template: \"weekly_research\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Template Instantiation Engine:** Extends `FlowController` to:\n   - Parse templates and substitute parameters with actual values\n   - Validate that required tools are available in registry\n   - Execute templated workflows with the same monitoring as dynamic tasks\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n- **Conditional Logic:** Templates can include if/else branches based on intermediate results\n- **Loops:** Repeat steps for each item in a list (e.g., process each search result)\n- **Error Handling Blocks:** Define fallback steps when specific tools fail\n- **Human Approval Gates:** Insert human review points at defined steps\n\n**Use Case Example: Customer Support Ticket Triage**\n```yaml\nworkflow:\n  name: \"support_ticket_triage\"\n  parameters:\n    - name: \"ticket_text\"\n      type: \"string\"\n  steps:\n    - tool: \"classify_issue\"\n      args:\n        text: \"{{ticket_text}}\"\n      save_as: \"issue_type\"\n    \n    - if: \"{{issue_type}} == 'billing'\"\n      then:\n        - tool: \"fetch_customer_record\"\n          args:\n            extracted_from: \"{{ticket_text}}\"\n        - tool: \"generate_billing_response\"\n      else:\n        - tool: \"escalate_to_human\"\n          args:\n            reason: \"Non-billing issue requires human review\"\n```\n\n**Integration with Dynamic Planning:** Scripted workflows can serve as building blocks within larger dynamic plans. The `Planner` could recognize when a subtask matches a known template pattern and substitute the template execution rather than decomposing from scratch, improving efficiency and consistency.\n\n#### 10.1.7 Cross-Agent Tool Sharing & Dynamic Capability Discovery\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Conference Room Whiteboard Session.** Imagine agents as specialists in a meeting. When one agent encounters a task outside their expertise, they can ask the room, \"Does anyone know how to do X?\" Another agent raises their hand, \"I have a tool for that—let me show you how it works.\" They share not just the tool but also usage examples and limitations.\n\nIn the current multi-agent system, each agent has a fixed set of tools defined by its role. Cross-agent tool sharing would enable dynamic capability discovery and utilization, allowing agents to temporarily \"borrow\" tools from peers when needed.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Tool Advertisement Protocol:** Extend the `MessageBus` to support:\n   - Tool description broadcasts when agents join the system\n   - Capability queries (\"Who can perform operation X?\")\n   - Usage agreement negotiation (temporary access grants)\n\n2. **Dynamic Tool Proxy:** New `RemoteTool` class that:\n   - Implements the `Tool` interface but forwards execution to another agent\n   - Handles authentication and permission checking for tool access\n   - Manages lifecycle of temporary tool grants (lease expiration)\n\n3. **Capability Registry:** Distributed registry tracking:\n   - Which agents have which tools available\n   - Tool performance metrics (success rate, latency)\n   - Access control policies for sensitive tools\n\n**Message Flow for Tool Sharing:**\n```\nAgent A needs tool T → \n  Broadcasts \"capability_query(T)\" → \n    Agent B responds \"tool_offer(T, terms)\" → \n      Agent A sends \"tool_request(T, context)\" → \n        Agent B validates, creates lease → \n          Agent B sends \"tool_lease(T, proxy_endpoint)\" → \n            Agent A registers RemoteTool, uses it\n```\n\n**Security Considerations:**\n- **Least Privilege:** Tools should be shared with minimal necessary permissions\n- **Audit Trail:** All cross-agent tool usage must be logged with full context\n- **Revocation:** Tool owners must be able to immediately revoke access\n- **Sandboxing:** Remote tools should execute in the providing agent's environment, not the requesting agent's, to maintain security boundaries\n\n**Performance Optimization:** Frequently shared tools could be cached as code (with owner approval) rather than executed remotely after establishing trust relationships, reducing latency. The system could implement a reputation system where agents with high success rates have their tools cached more aggressively.\n\n#### 10.1.8 Explainability & Audit Trail Generation\n\n> **Mental Model:** **Black Box Flight Recorder + Investigative Journalist.** The framework currently operates like a black box—we see inputs and outputs but limited insight into internal reasoning. This extension adds both a flight recorder (comprehensive data capture) and an investigative journalist (post-hoc analysis that reconstructs and explains the \"why\" behind decisions).\n\nAs AI agents take on more consequential tasks, the ability to explain their reasoning and maintain audit trails becomes critical for debugging, compliance, and trust.\n\n**Integration Design:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Execution Tracing:** Enhance all components to emit structured trace events:\n   - `Planner`: Decision points, alternative plans considered, confidence scores\n   - `ReActAgent`: Full thought chains, tool selection rationale, uncertainty expressions\n   - `ToolExecutionEngine`: Input/output snapshots, performance metrics, error details\n\n2. **Causal Graph Construction:** Post-execution analysis that:\n   - Reconstructs the decision pathway from final answer back through reasoning steps\n   - Identifies critical junctures where different choices would have led to different outcomes\n   - Calculates confidence intervals for conclusions based on source reliability\n\n3. **Natural Language Explanation Generator:** Component that:\n   - Translates execution traces into human-readable narratives\n   - Highlights key decisions and supporting evidence\n   - Identifies potential biases or limitations in the reasoning process\n\n**Explanation Formats:**\n\n| Audience | Format | Detail Level | Example |\n|----------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **End User** | Simple summary paragraph | High-level | \"The agent determined X because it found evidence Y and Z through web search.\" |\n| **Developer** | Structured JSON with citations | Medium | `{\"conclusion\": \"X\", \"evidence\": [{\"source\": \"tool T\", \"result\": \"Y\"}, ...]}` |\n| **Auditor/Compliance** | Complete trace with timestamps | Verbose | Timeline view showing every thought, tool call, and observation with exact timing |\n\n**Implementation Strategy:** Implement as a layered system where basic tracing is always on (low overhead), detailed causal analysis runs post-execution for important tasks, and natural language explanations generate on-demand.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Trace Storage vs. Regeneration**\n\n> **Decision: Hybrid Store-and-Regenerate with Configurable Detail Levels**\n> - **Context:** Complete execution traces can be large (megabytes per complex task). Storing everything for all tasks is expensive, but regenerating explanations from minimal data may lose fidelity.\n> - **Options Considered:**\n>   1. **Store everything:** Keep complete traces for all executions (maximal fidelity, high storage cost)\n>   2. **Store minimal, regenerate on demand:** Keep only final results, regenerate traces by re-running (low storage, but may not reproduce exact reasoning)\n>   3. **Hybrid with detail levels:** Store structured summaries always, complete traces for important tasks, regenerate intermediate details when needed\n> - **Decision:** Option 3 with configurable retention policies. All tasks store structured summaries (key decisions, outcomes). Important tasks (by user marking, error occurrence, or sensitive domain) store complete traces. System can regenerate intermediate details by replaying from summaries when needed.\n> - **Rationale:** Balances storage costs with explanation fidelity. Critical tasks (medical, financial, legal) require complete audit trails, while routine tasks need only summaries. The regeneration capability provides flexibility when unexpected questions arise.\n> - **Consequences:** Requires versioning of agent components to ensure regenerated traces match original execution, adds complexity to trace serialization/deserialization.\n\n### 10.2 Implementation Guidance for Future Extensions\n\nWhile the full implementation of these extensions is beyond the current project scope, this section provides starter patterns and integration points to guide future development.\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints for Extensions\n\n**Python Async Patterns for Human-in-the-Loop:**\n```python\n# Use asyncio.Queue for decoupling human responses from request generation\nhuman_response_queue = asyncio.Queue()\n\n# Pattern for timeout with default fallback\ntry:\n    response = await asyncio.wait_for(\n        human_response_queue.get(),\n        timeout=300.0  # 5 minutes\n    )\nexcept asyncio.TimeoutError:\n    response = {\"status\": \"timeout\", \"action\": \"use_default\"}\n\n# Use asyncio.Event for signaling human response received\nresponse_event = asyncio.Event()\n# UI calls response_event.set() when human responds\n# Agent awaits response_event.wait() with timeout\n```\n\n**Performance Optimization for Multi-Modal Tools:**\n```python\n# Use lazy loading for expensive media processing libraries\ndef get_image_processor():\n    # Import only when needed\n    import torch\n    import clip\n    from PIL import Image\n    # Return processor function\n\n# Implement streaming for large media files\nasync def process_video_in_chunks(video_path, chunk_size=1024*1024):\n    with open(video_path, 'rb') as f:\n        while chunk := f.read(chunk_size):\n            yield await process_chunk(chunk)\n\n# Use LRU cache for embedding models\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=10)\ndef get_embedding_model(model_name=\"clip-vit-base-patch32\"):\n    import clip\n    model, preprocess = clip.load(model_name)\n    return model, preprocess\n```\n\n**Security Considerations for Tool Sharing:**\n```python\n# Implement permission checking for cross-agent tool access\ndef check_tool_permission(tool_name, requesting_agent, owner_agent):\n    # Check if tool is sharable\n    if not tool_registry.get_tool(tool_name).sharable:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if requesting agent has required role\n    if not has_required_role(requesting_agent, tool_name):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check rate limits\n    if exceeded_rate_limit(requesting_agent, tool_name):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Use JWT tokens for temporary tool access\ndef create_tool_access_token(tool_name, requesting_agent, duration_minutes=10):\n    import jwt\n    import datetime\n    \n    payload = {\n        \"tool\": tool_name,\n        \"requester\": requesting_agent.id,\n        \"exp\": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=duration_minutes),\n        \"permissions\": [\"execute\"]  # No modify permissions\n    }\n    \n    return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=\"HS256\")\n```\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint for Extensions\n\n**Testing Human-in-the-Loop Extension:**\n```bash\n# Run the human interaction tool tests\npython -m pytest extensions/human_in_the_loop/tests/ -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# ✓ HumanApprovalTool sends notification\n# ✓ HumanApprovalTool times out after configured period  \n# ✓ FlowController correctly pauses on interception rule\n# ✓ Human response correctly resumes execution\n\n# Manual test: Start agent with human interception enabled\npython examples/human_interception_example.py\n\n# Expected behavior:\n# 1.

Debugging Tips for Extension Development\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Human response never arrives** | Notification callback not configured, WebSocket disconnected | Check `notification_callback` is called, verify WebSocket connection status | Implement fallback notification channels, add connection health checks |\n| **Composite tool runs in wrong order** | Incorrect topological sort, cyclic dependencies | Visualize graph with `nx.draw()`, check for cycles with `nx.find_cycle()` | Validate graph is acyclic during construction, manually specify execution order if needed |\n| **Multi-modal tool consumes all memory** | Large files loaded entirely into memory, no streaming | Monitor memory usage during execution, check if file is read all at once | Implement chunked processing, use disk-backed temporary storage |\n| **Tool sharing causes permission errors** | JWT tokens expired, missing permission claims | Decode and inspect JWT token contents, check expiration time | Implement token refresh mechanism, add detailed permission claims |\n| **Learning module overfits to recent tasks** | Experience replay buffer too small, no diversity in training | Analyze training data distribution, check buffer sampling strategy | Increase replay buffer size, implement prioritized experience replay |\n| **UI dashboard slows down with many agents** | Too many real-time events, inefficient React re-renders | Check WebSocket message volume, profile React component renders | Implement client-side throttling, virtualize lists, batch updates |\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe extensibility of Project Archon's architecture is one of its core strengths. By adhering to clean interfaces, modular components, and well-defined data flows, the framework can accommodate a wide range of advanced capabilities beyond the initial five milestones. The extension ideas presented here—from human oversight to experiential learning—demonstrate how the foundation can evolve to address increasingly complex real-world applications of autonomous AI agents.\n\nEach extension builds upon existing patterns: human interaction extends the `Tool` interface, composite tools leverage the `ToolExecutionEngine`, learning modules enhance the `MemorySystem`, and so on. This evolutionary approach ensures that advanced capabilities integrate seamlessly rather than requiring disruptive rewrites.\n\nAs with any extensible system, the key to successful expansion lies in maintaining the core architectural principles: clear separation of concerns, well-defined interfaces, and comprehensive observability. Future developers building upon this framework should prioritize these principles while exploring the exciting possibilities of autonomous AI systems.\n\n\n## 11. Glossary\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nThe AI agent framework introduces specialized terminology from multiple domains: autonomous systems, large language models, software architecture, and cognitive science. This glossary provides clear definitions for the key technical terms, acronyms, and domain-specific vocabulary used throughout this design document. Each entry explains the concept in simple terms and references where it appears in the architecture.\n\n### Terms and Definitions\n\nThe following table lists all major terms in alphabetical order with their definitions and architectural context:\n\n| Term | Definition | Architectural Context |\n|------|------------|----------------------|\n| **Action Parsing** | The process of extracting a structured tool call (tool name and JSON arguments) from the LLM's free-form text output. Critical for connecting the agent's reasoning to executable actions. | Used in the ReAct Loop Engine (Milestone 2) to transform LLM thoughts into tool invocations. |\n| **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** | A structured document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context, alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences. Provides transparency into the design process. | Used throughout the design document to explain key choices like JSON Schema validation, loop termination strategies, and context window management. |\n| **Adjacency List** | A graph representation where each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes (dependencies). Efficient for representing sparse dependency graphs in task planning. | Used in the Planning component (Milestone 3) to represent task dependencies within the DAG structure. |\n| **Agent Core** | The central coordinating component that orchestrates the planning, execution, and memory retrieval processes for a single agent. Maintains the agent's state and manages the flow between other components. | The main entry point in the High-Level Architecture; coordinates Tool System, Planner, Memory, and Orchestrator. |\n| **Agent-to-Agent Communication Medium** | The underlying infrastructure that enables message passing between agents. Options include shared message buses, direct method calls, and blackboard architectures. | A key design decision in Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5) affecting how agents coordinate. |\n| **AI Executive** | The primary mental model for the framework: an autonomous agent that plans, delegates to specialized tools, manages progress, and learns from experience—much like a human executive running a company. | The overarching analogy used throughout the design document to explain the framework's purpose and behavior. |\n| **Bag of Properties** | A pattern using a dictionary (`Dict[str, Any]`) for extensible metadata storage, allowing components to attach arbitrary context without modifying core data structures. | Used in many data structures like `ToolResult.metadata`, `MemoryEntry.metadata`, and `context` fields throughout the framework. |\n| **Blackboard Architecture** | An architecture pattern where multiple agents read and write to a common workspace (blackboard) containing shared problem data, enabling indirect coordination without direct message passing. | Considered as an alternative communication medium in Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5). |\n| **Broadcast Pattern** | An orchestration pattern where messages are sent to all agents in the system (or a subset), enabling discovery and peer-to-peer coordination without a central coordinator. | One of the common orchestration patterns discussed in Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5). |\n| **Circuit Breaker Pattern** | A design pattern that prevents repeated calls to a failing service by tracking failure rates and temporarily \"opening the circuit\" (blocking requests) to allow the service time to recover. | Used in the Tool Execution Engine to prevent cascading failures when tools repeatedly timeout or return errors. |\n| **Conflict Resolution** | The process of reconciling contradictory results from multiple agents using defined merge strategies such as voting, confidence-weighted averaging, or hierarchical arbitration. | A key capability in Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5) for handling divergent outputs from specialized agents. |\n| **Context Window Management** | The strategy for managing the limited token budget of LLMs by selectively including, truncating, or summarizing conversation history and retrieved memories. | Central to Memory & Context Management (Milestone 4); strategies include sliding window, recursive summarization, and importance scoring. |\n| **Conversation Memory** | The linear, chronological record of dialogue turns (user messages, agent thoughts, tool results) for the current session. Analogous to an open notebook. | Part of the episodic memory layer in Memory & Context Management (Milestone 4); implemented as a buffer with token-aware truncation. |\n| **Correlation ID** | A unique identifier passed through the execution flow (e.g., across tool calls, agent messages, and log entries) to enable tracing and debugging of a single request across distributed components. | Used throughout the framework for observability; appears in `Message.correlation_id` and structured logging. |\n| **Coverage Reports** | Analysis showing which lines of code are executed during test runs, helping identify untested paths and ensure comprehensive testing of the framework. | Part of the Testing Strategy (Section 8) for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. |\n| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A graph structure with directed edges and no cycles, used to model task dependencies where each subtask depends on zero or more predecessors. | The core representation for task decomposition in Planning & Task Decomposition (Milestone 3). |\n| **DelegatedTask** | A data structure representing a subtask assigned to a specific agent in a multi-agent system, tracking assignment, status, result, and dependencies. | Used by the `OrchestratorAgent` in Multi-Agent Collaboration (Milestone 5) to manage distributed work. |\n| **Delegation Loop** | An infinite cycle where agents keep delegating the same task back and forth (e.g., Agent A delegates to B, who delegates back to A).
