It solves the C10K problem by implementing the Reactor pattern with non-blocking I/O, efficient timer management via a hierarchical timer wheel, and asynchronous task scheduling. The key architectural challenge is managing massive concurrency with low overhead and predictable latency without using threads.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (foundational understanding)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section establishes why traditional server architectures fail at scale and introduces the fundamental concepts that enable handling 10,000+ concurrent connections with a single thread. We&#39;ll explore the limitations of thread-per-connection models, introduce the event-driven mental model through analogy, and compare the available I/O multiplexing technologies on Linux systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-c10k-problem-and-the-threading-bottleneck\">The C10K Problem and the Threading Bottleneck</h3>\n<p>Imagine a small post office with one clerk who can only serve one customer at a time. When a customer arrives, the clerk helps them completely—filling out forms, weighing packages, calculating postage—while other customers wait in line. This works fine when 5-10 customers arrive per hour, but completely collapses when 10,000 customers show up simultaneously. The clerk becomes overwhelmed, the line grows indefinitely, and most customers give up waiting. This is precisely what happens with <strong>thread-per-connection</strong> server architectures under high concurrency.</p>\n<p>In traditional blocking I/O server designs, each incoming client connection spawns a new operating system thread (or process). This thread calls blocking system calls like <code>accept()</code>, <code>read()</code>, and <code>write()</code>, which cause the thread to enter a suspended state (&quot;blocked&quot;) until data arrives or can be sent. While conceptually simple, this approach suffers from severe scalability limitations known as the <strong>C10K problem</strong> (handling ten thousand concurrent connections).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Reject Thread-Per-Connection Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to handle 10,000+ concurrent connections with predictable latency and minimal resource overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Thread-per-connection with blocking I/O</li>\n<li>Thread pool with blocking I/O</li>\n<li>Single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Thread-per-connection requires 10K threads, each with its own stack (typically 8MB), consuming ~80GB RAM just for stacks. Context switching between 10K threads introduces massive CPU overhead. Thread pools with blocking I/O still waste threads waiting on I/O, limiting concurrency to pool size</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Must implement non-blocking I/O and event multiplexing; programming model becomes callback-driven rather than linear; must handle partial reads/writes explicitly</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bottleneck</th>\n<th>Thread-Per-Connection Impact at 10K Connections</th>\n<th>Technical Explanation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Overhead</strong></td>\n<td>80-160 GB RAM for thread stacks alone</td>\n<td>Each thread requires 8-16MB stack (default Linux pthread). 10K × 8MB = 80GB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Context Switch Overhead</strong></td>\n<td>Millions of switches per second, &gt;90% CPU wasted</td>\n<td>OS scheduler must cycle through all runnable threads. Each switch flushes CPU caches, TLB, and registers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>File Descriptor Limits</strong></td>\n<td>Default system limits (1024) must be raised</td>\n<td>Each connection consumes a file descriptor. 10K connections need adjusted <code>ulimit -n</code> and kernel parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Synchronization Complexity</strong></td>\n<td>Lock contention increases super-linearly with threads</td>\n<td>Shared data structures require locks. Probability of contention grows with thread count, causing serialization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Connection Setup Teardown</strong></td>\n<td>Thread creation/destruction becomes bottleneck</td>\n<td><code>pthread_create()</code> and <code>pthread_join()</code> are expensive system calls at 10K scale</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The critical insight is that <strong>threads are expensive when waiting</strong>. A thread blocked in <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code> is still consuming resources (memory, kernel structures) while doing no useful work. The fundamental solution is to separate the <strong>waiting</strong> from the <strong>processing</strong>—instead of having thousands of threads wait individually, have a single entity efficiently monitor thousands of connections and only wake up when there&#39;s actual work to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"event-driven-architecture-the-postal-system-analogy\">Event-Driven Architecture: The Postal System Analogy</h3>\n<p>Consider a modern postal sorting facility with a single, highly efficient sorting machine (the event loop) and a team of specialized workers (callback handlers). Letters (I/O events) arrive continuously on conveyor belts (file descriptors). Rather than assigning one worker per letter to wait at each mailbox, the system works like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Sorting Machine (epoll)</strong> monitors hundreds of mailboxes simultaneously</li>\n<li>When a letter arrives in any mailbox, the machine detects it instantly</li>\n<li>The machine routes that specific letter to an available specialized worker</li>\n<li>The worker processes only that letter (reads address, applies postage)</li>\n<li>If the worker needs to wait for something (like a scale to become available), they don&#39;t block—they return the letter to the machine with a note saying &quot;notify me when the scale is free&quot;</li>\n<li>The worker immediately becomes available for other letters</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the essence of the <strong>Reactor pattern</strong>—a single event loop dispatches events to appropriate handlers without blocking. The key components in our analogy map to system components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Postal System Component</th>\n<th>Event Loop Equivalent</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sorting Machine</td>\n<td><code>epoll</code> instance</td>\n<td>Monitors multiple file descriptors for events</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mailboxes</td>\n<td>File descriptors (sockets)</td>\n<td>Sources of I/O events (data arriving, space available)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Letter with Data</td>\n<td>Read/Write buffer</td>\n<td>Application data to process or send</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Specialized Workers</td>\n<td>Callback functions</td>\n<td>Process specific types of events (HTTP, echo, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&quot;Notify Me Later&quot; Notes</td>\n<td>Event registration</td>\n<td>Request to be notified when a specific condition occurs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The mental model shift is from <strong>&quot;one thread, one connection, linear execution&quot;</strong> to <strong>&quot;one loop, many connections, event-driven execution.&quot;</strong> Instead of writing code that says &quot;read from this socket until we get a full HTTP request,&quot; we write: &quot;when data arrives on this socket, parse what you can; if you don&#39;t have a full request yet, ask to be notified when more data arrives.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The event loop&#39;s power comes from never waiting idly. It either processes ready events or sleeps efficiently in the kernel until events occur. This eliminates the resource waste of blocked threads while maintaining concurrency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This architecture enables our single-threaded server to handle 10K+ connections because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constant memory overhead</strong>: ~1KB per connection for buffers/state vs. 8MB per thread</li>\n<li><strong>Constant context switching</strong>: Exactly one thread, so no user-space context switches</li>\n<li><strong>Efficient waiting</strong>: The kernel&#39;s <code>epoll_wait()</code> monitors all connections in one system call</li>\n<li><strong>Predictable latency</strong>: No lock contention or scheduler interference between connections</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"comparison-of-io-multiplexing-approaches\">Comparison of I/O Multiplexing Approaches</h3>\n<p>Linux offers several system calls for monitoring multiple file descriptors. Choosing the right one is critical for performance at scale. All these approaches follow the same basic pattern: tell the kernel which file descriptors to monitor and what events to watch for, then wait for something to happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use epoll for I/O Multiplexing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to efficiently monitor 10,000+ file descriptors for read/write readiness on Linux</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><code>select()</code> - POSIX standard, available everywhere</li>\n<li><code>poll()</code> - Improved over select, but similar scalability issues</li>\n<li><code>epoll()</code> - Linux-specific, designed for massive scalability</li>\n<li><code>kqueue()</code> - BSD/macOS equivalent of epoll (not considered for Linux)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: <code>epoll</code> with edge-triggered mode (EPOLLET)</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: <code>select</code>/<code>poll</code> scan all file descriptors on every call (O(n)). With 10K FDs, this wastes CPU. <code>epoll</code> maintains kernel state and only returns changed FDs (O(1) for ready FDs). Edge-triggered mode reduces unnecessary wakeups</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Linux-only; must handle EPOLLET semantics (read/write until EAGAIN); slightly more complex setup than select/poll</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following table compares the technical characteristics of each approach:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Characteristic</th>\n<th><code>select()</code></th>\n<th><code>poll()</code></th>\n<th><code>epoll()</code> (Level-Triggered)</th>\n<th><code>epoll()</code> (Edge-Triggered)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Maximum FDs</strong></td>\n<td>FD_SETSIZE (1024)</td>\n<td>Limited by <code>ulimit -n</code></td>\n<td>Limited by <code>ulimit -n</code></td>\n<td>Limited by <code>ulimit -n</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Time Complexity</strong></td>\n<td>O(n) scan all FDs each call</td>\n<td>O(n) scan all FDs each call</td>\n<td>O(1) for ready FDs</td>\n<td>O(1) for ready FDs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Usage</strong></td>\n<td>Fixed-size bitmask</td>\n<td>Array of struct pollfd</td>\n<td>Kernel hash table + user array</td>\n<td>Kernel hash table + user array</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Trigger Mode</strong></td>\n<td>Level-only (reports if ready)</td>\n<td>Level-only (reports if ready)</td>\n<td>Level (default)</td>\n<td>Edge (EPOLLET flag)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FD Management</strong></td>\n<td>Rebuild set each call</td>\n<td>Rebuild array each call</td>\n<td>Kernel-managed set (add/mod/del)</td>\n<td>Kernel-managed set (add/mod/del)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Portability</strong></td>\n<td>POSIX, everywhere</td>\n<td>POSIX, most systems</td>\n<td>Linux only</td>\n<td>Linux only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Best For</strong></td>\n<td>&lt; 1000 FDs, portability</td>\n<td>&lt; 1000 FDs, &gt;1024 FDs needed</td>\n<td>1000+ FDs, Linux only</td>\n<td>1000+ FDs, Linux, max performance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Understanding Level vs. Edge Triggering</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level-Triggered (default)</strong>: &quot;Notify me while the condition is true.&quot; If data is available to read, you&#39;ll keep getting notified every event loop iteration until you read all data</li>\n<li><strong>Edge-Triggered (EPOLLET)</strong>: &quot;Notify me when the condition changes.&quot; You get notified once when data arrives, then not again until you read and get EAGAIN</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To illustrate the performance difference, consider checking 10,000 mailboxes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With <code>select</code>/<code>poll</code>: Walk past each of 10,000 mailboxes every time, checking if there&#39;s mail</li>\n<li>With <code>epoll</code>: Get a list saying &quot;mailboxes 42, 317, and 5823 have new mail&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Trigger Mode Implications</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trigger Mode</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Required Handling Pattern</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Level-Triggered</strong></td>\n<td>Simpler: won&#39;t miss events if you don&#39;t read all data immediately</td>\n<td>More wakeups: get notified repeatedly while data remains</td>\n<td>Can read partial data each time; loop continues while readable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Edge-Triggered</strong></td>\n<td>Fewer wakeups: only notified on state changes</td>\n<td>Complex: must read until EAGAIN to reset trigger</td>\n<td>Must read/write in loop until EAGAIN; risk starvation if other FDs have data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Principle</strong>: For our 10K+ connections target, we choose edge-triggered epoll. While more complex to implement correctly, it minimizes unnecessary event loop iterations when connections have continuous data flow. The key is ensuring we always read/write until EAGAIN when notified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why Not Just Use Threads with epoll?</strong>\nMulti-threaded epoll designs (one epoll per thread) can scale beyond single-core limits, but they introduce synchronization complexity that&#39;s beyond our learning scope. Our single-threaded design establishes the foundational pattern—the reactor core—which can later be extended to multiple threads (one event loop per CPU core) in a production system.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Conceptual Understanding</strong>:</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Believing &quot;Non-Blocking&quot; Means &quot;Zero Wait&quot;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Assuming non-blocking I/O eliminates all waiting time</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong</strong>: Non-blocking calls return immediately regardless of data availability, but the event loop still sleeps in <code>epoll_wait()</code> when nothing is ready. The difference is fine-grained waiting (per FD) vs. coarse waiting (per thread)</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Understand that <code>epoll_wait()</code> is still a blocking call (with timeout), but it blocks on ALL monitored FDs simultaneously, not individually</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Confusing Concurrency with Parallelism</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Expecting 10K connections to be processed simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong</strong>: Single-threaded event loops process one event at a time. Concurrency means making progress on many tasks interleaved, not simultaneously. While processing one connection&#39;s data, others wait in the queue</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Design handlers to be short and non-blocking. Defer expensive work to timer callbacks or task queues to avoid starving other connections</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overlooking the Cost of System Calls</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Thinking epoll eliminates all overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Why It&#39;s Wrong</strong>: Each <code>epoll_ctl()</code> (add/modify/delete FD) is a system call with context switch cost. With 10K connections churning rapidly, this becomes significant</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Batch FD modifications where possible; reuse connections (HTTP keep-alive); design protocols to minimize connection churn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The transition from thread-per-connection to event-driven architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we think about server programming. Instead of &quot;who does this work?&quot; (which thread), we focus on &quot;when does this work happen?&quot; (in response to which event). This event-driven mindset, combined with Linux&#39;s <code>epoll</code> mechanism, enables our single-threaded server to handle massive concurrency within practical resource limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

Establishing clear boundaries is critical for a learning-focused project—it prevents scope creep while ensuring the architecture remains focused on solving the fundamental C10K problem using the <strong>Reactor pattern</strong>. The goals directly map to the four project milestones, creating a cohesive learning path from basic event-driven I/O to a complete, scalable HTTP server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"goals\">Goals</h3>\n<p>The system must deliver four interconnected capabilities that collectively demonstrate mastery of high-concurrency server design. Each goal addresses a specific architectural challenge identified in the C10K problem.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Goal</th>\n<th>Architectural Challenge Addressed</th>\n<th>Key Capabilities</th>\n<th>Primary Milestone</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Handle 10K+ concurrent connections</strong></td>\n<td>Resource exhaustion from thread-per-connection models</td>\n<td>Single-threaded <strong>event loop</strong> with <code>epoll</code>, non-blocking I/O, O(1) event dispatch</td>\n<td>Milestone 1, 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Support idle timeouts</strong></td>\n<td>Connection resource leakage from stale or slow clients</td>\n<td>Hierarchical <strong>timer wheel</strong> with O(1) insertion/deletion, integrated timeout propagation</td>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Provide a callback API</strong></td>\n<td>Complexity of raw event loop programming</td>\n<td><strong>Reactor pattern</strong> abstraction with callback registration for I/O and timer events</td>\n<td>Milestone 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Include an HTTP server example</strong></td>\n<td>Practical application of event-driven architecture</td>\n<td>Incremental HTTP/1.1 parser, write buffer management, keep-alive support</td>\n<td>Milestone 4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"goal-1-handle-10k-concurrent-connections\">Goal 1: Handle 10K+ Concurrent Connections</h4>\n<p>The primary objective is to demonstrate that a single-threaded, event-driven server can maintain <strong>10,000+ simultaneous TCP connections</strong> with predictable latency and minimal resource overhead. This directly tackles the C10K problem&#39;s core constraint: traditional operating systems cannot efficiently schedule 10,000 threads. The system achieves this through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Linux <code>epoll</code> for I/O multiplexing</strong>: Unlike <code>select()</code> or <code>poll()</code>, <code>epoll</code> uses O(1) event notification regardless of connection count, avoiding the linear scan overhead that breaks at scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-blocking I/O on all sockets</strong>: Every file descriptor—including the listening socket—must be set to non-blocking mode using <code>fcntl(O_NONBLOCK)</code>. This ensures the single thread never blocks on <code>accept()</code>, <code>read()</code>, or <code>write()</code> operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Level-triggered event notification</strong>: While edge-triggered (<code>EPOLLET</code>) can be more efficient, level-triggered mode simplifies correctness for learners by ensuring events re-fire if data remains unprocessed. The architecture must handle both models correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficient memory per connection</strong>: Each connection should maintain only necessary state (socket descriptor, read/write buffers, timer reference) in a compact <code>struct connection</code> to minimize memory footprint.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Single-threaded event loop over multi-threaded reactor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The C10K problem demonstrates that thread-per-connection models exhaust memory and CPU due to stack overhead and context switching. We need maximum connection density with minimal overhead.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Single-threaded event loop</strong>: One thread handles all I/O, timers, and callbacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-threaded reactor</strong>: One acceptor thread dispatches connections to worker threads, each with its own <code>epoll</code> instance.</li>\n<li><strong>Thread pool with work stealing</strong>: Fixed thread pool processes events from a shared queue.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Single-threaded event loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: For the learning objective—understanding the Reactor pattern fundamentals—a single-threaded model eliminates concurrency complexity (locking, race conditions) while demonstrating the raw efficiency possible with <code>epoll</code>. It achieves the highest connection density per CPU core, which is the essence of solving C10K. Multi-threaded variants add complexity without changing the fundamental event-driven paradigm.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The server cannot utilize multiple CPU cores. All processing—including HTTP parsing—must be non-blocking and efficient to avoid stalling the event loop. This constraint reinforces careful design of incremental processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"goal-2-support-idle-timeouts\">Goal 2: Support Idle Timeouts</h4>\n<p>Long-lived connections must be automatically cleaned up after periods of inactivity to prevent resource exhaustion from abandoned or idle clients. The system requires a timeout mechanism that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Closes connections after configurable idle periods</strong> (e.g., 30 seconds without read/write activity).</li>\n<li><strong>Integrates seamlessly with the event loop</strong> without requiring separate threads or periodic signals.</li>\n<li><strong>Provides O(1) timer operations</strong> to avoid degrading performance as connection count grows.</li>\n<li><strong>Allows timer cancellation</strong> when connections become active again (resetting the idle timeout).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>hierarchical timer wheel</strong> data structure meets these requirements by organizing timers into multiple levels of increasing granularity (e.g., milliseconds, seconds, minutes), enabling constant-time insertion and expiration processing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"goal-3-provide-a-callback-api\">Goal 3: Provide a Callback API</h4>\n<p>Raw <code>epoll</code> programming requires manual management of file descriptor registration and event masks. The system must abstract these details behind a clean <strong>Reactor pattern</strong> API that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Allows registration of callback functions</strong> for <code>EPOLLIN</code> (read-ready) and <code>EPOLLOUT</code> (write-ready) events.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports timer callbacks</strong> for one-shot and repeating operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Manages a deferred task queue</strong> for work that should execute after I/O processing in the current event loop iteration.</li>\n<li><strong>Hides <code>epoll</code> system call details</strong> behind intuitive functions like <code>event_loop_register_fd()</code> and <code>event_loop_run()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This abstraction transforms the event loop from a fragile, low-level construct into a reusable framework for building various protocol servers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"goal-4-include-an-http-server-example\">Goal 4: Include an HTTP Server Example</h4>\n<p>The theoretical architecture must be validated with a practical, benchmarkable implementation. An HTTP/1.1 server serves as the canonical demonstration because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HTTP is a well-understood protocol</strong> with clear request/response semantics.</li>\n<li><strong>It exercises all event loop components</strong>: non-blocking reads/writes, incremental parsing, buffer management, timer-based keep-alive, and callback dispatch.</li>\n<li><strong>It provides measurable performance metrics</strong> for the 10K goal via tools like <code>ab</code> (Apache Bench) or <code>wrk</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The HTTP implementation must handle real-world complexities: requests split across multiple TCP packets, slow clients that can&#39;t consume responses quickly, and persistent connections with proper idle timeout management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-goals\">Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Explicitly defining what the system does <strong>not</strong> do is equally important for maintaining focus and setting learner expectations. These boundaries acknowledge practical production considerations while keeping the project achievable within its educational scope.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Non-Goal</th>\n<th>Reason for Exclusion</th>\n<th>Alternative/Consideration</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-threading or multi-process architecture</strong></td>\n<td>Adds significant complexity (locking, synchronization) that distracts from core event-driven principles. The goal is to master single-threaded concurrency first.</td>\n<td>For production, a multi-threaded reactor (one <code>epoll</code> instance per CPU core) is the logical next step after understanding this foundation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Full HTTP/2 protocol support</strong></td>\n<td>HTTP/2 introduces binary framing, multiplexing, and flow control that require substantial additional implementation.</td>\n<td>The event loop framework could support HTTP/2, but implementing the full protocol exceeds the scope of learning epoll fundamentals.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>SSL/TLS encryption</strong></td>\n<td>TLS adds complex handshaking, renegotiation, and record layer processing that obscures the core I/O multiplexing concepts.</td>\n<td>In production, TLS termination is often handled by a dedicated proxy (nginx) or library (OpenSSL with async mode).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Production-grade connection pooling</strong></td>\n<td>Connection pooling involves health checks, load balancing, and failover mechanisms that are orthogonal to the event loop itself.</td>\n<td>The architecture focuses on handling connections, not managing pools between services.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advanced load balancing or service discovery</strong></td>\n<td>These are distributed systems concerns that build upon, rather than comprise, the event loop pattern.</td>\n<td>The event loop could be used within each node of a load-balanced cluster.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Windows compatibility or cross-platform I/O multiplexing</strong></td>\n<td>The project specifically targets Linux&#39;s <code>epoll</code> as the learning vehicle.</td>\n<td>Production code might use abstraction libraries (libuv) but understanding the underlying OS mechanism is the educational goal.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Comprehensive security hardening</strong></td>\n<td>While basic error handling is required, full security audit (buffer overflow prevention, input validation) exceeds the scope.</td>\n<td>Learners should apply security best practices but the focus remains on architecture and performance.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Database integration or business logic</strong></td>\n<td>The server is a platform for connection management, not a full application framework.</td>\n<td>The callback API could dispatch to business logic, but implementing such logic is beyond the C10K focus.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"why-these-boundaries-matter\">Why These Boundaries Matter</h4>\n<p>Each non-goal represents a legitimate production concern that has been intentionally deferred:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle: Focus on the Pattern, Not the Production Features</strong></p>\n<p>The event loop is a <strong>foundational pattern</strong> that enables high-concurrency servers. By excluding multi-threading, TLS, and HTTP/2, we isolate and master this pattern in its purest form. Once understood, these extensions become incremental additions rather than overwhelming complexities. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-threading</strong> can be added by creating multiple event loop threads (one per CPU core) with load-balanced accept.</li>\n<li><strong>TLS</strong> can be integrated using OpenSSL&#39;s asynchronous mode with <code>SSL_read()</code> and <code>SSL_write()</code> returning <code>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>HTTP/2</strong> could be implemented atop the same event loop by replacing the HTTP/1.1 parser with a state machine for binary frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The architecture is deliberately <strong>extensible at its boundaries</strong>—the callback API, timer system, and buffer management all provide hooks for these future enhancements without redesign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-scope-interpretation\">Common Pitfalls in Scope Interpretation</h4>\n<p>Learners often misunderstand these boundaries, leading to two counterproductive extremes:</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-engineering toward production readiness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mistake</strong>: Attempting to implement multi-threading, TLS, or connection pooling before mastering the single-threaded event loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: These features introduce complexity that obscures the core learning objectives. Debugging race conditions in a multi-threaded event loop is vastly harder than understanding a single-threaded one.</li>\n<li><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Strictly follow the milestone sequence. Complete all four milestones with a single-threaded, plain TCP/HTTP server before considering extensions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Underestimating the HTTP server complexity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mistake</strong>: Treating the HTTP server as a trivial addition after the event loop works for echo servers.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Real HTTP requires incremental parsing, header validation, chunked encoding, and proper response buffering—all of which exercise subtle aspects of non-blocking I/O and state management.</li>\n<li><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Allocate significant time for Milestone 4. The HTTP implementation should be treated as a first-class component, not an afterthought.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology

Think of this as the <strong>blueprint</strong> for the entire project. Before diving into each component&#39;s internal details, we need to understand the overall structure and the <strong>division of responsibilities</strong> that enables handling 10,000+ connections in a single thread.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-diagram-and-data-flow\">Component Diagram and Data Flow</h3>\n<p>Imagine the event loop system as a <strong>high-efficiency post office</strong> running with a single postal worker (the main thread). The postal worker doesn&#39;t wait at each mailbox for letters to arrive—instead, they monitor a centralized <strong>notification board</strong> (<code>epoll</code>) that lights up when any mailbox has incoming mail (read events) or is ready to accept outgoing mail (write events). The worker also wears a <strong>multi-alarm wristwatch</strong> (timer wheel) that buzzes at precise intervals to remind them to clean up abandoned mailboxes (idle timeouts). This mental model captures the essence of the Reactor pattern: a single thread efficiently dispatches work triggered by external events.</p>\n<p>The system comprises four main components that work together:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Data Structures</th>\n<th>Analogy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Event Loop (Reactor Core)</strong></td>\n<td>Monitors file descriptors for I/O readiness using <code>epoll</code>, dispatches events to registered callbacks</td>\n<td><code>event_loop</code>, <code>epoll_event</code></td>\n<td>Postal notification board</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Timer Wheel</strong></td>\n<td>Manages timeout events with O(1) efficiency, integrated with the event loop&#39;s wait timeout</td>\n<td>Hierarchical wheel slots, <code>timer</code> entries</td>\n<td>Multi-alarm wristwatch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Async Task Queue</strong></td>\n<td>Schedules deferred callbacks for execution after I/O processing, enables clean API</td>\n<td>Task queue, callback registry</td>\n<td>Worker&#39;s todo list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Protocol Handlers</strong></td>\n<td>Implement application logic (e.g., HTTP) using non-blocking I/O and incremental parsing</td>\n<td><code>connection</code>, protocol-specific state</td>\n<td>Mail sorting and processing rules</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>These components interact through a well-defined data flow, illustrated in the system overview:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-event-loop/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-1.svg\" alt=\"System Component Overview\"></p>\n<p><strong>Data Flow Through the System:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Incoming Network Traffic</strong> → The operating system&#39;s network stack receives packets and buffers data for sockets. When data arrives or a socket becomes writable, the kernel updates its internal readiness state.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Event Detection (<code>epoll</code>)</strong> → The <code>event_loop</code> calls <code>epoll_wait()</code> to query which file descriptors have pending I/O operations. The kernel returns an array of <code>epoll_event</code> structures, each containing the file descriptor and event type (<code>EPOLLIN</code>, <code>EPOLLOUT</code>, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Event Dispatch</strong> → For each ready file descriptor, the event loop looks up the associated <code>connection</code> context (via the <code>user_data</code> pointer in the <code>epoll_event</code>), then invokes the appropriate callback function registered for that event type.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Protocol Processing</strong> → The callback (typically part of a protocol handler like HTTP) performs non-blocking I/O operations (<code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>). If an operation would block (<code>EAGAIN</code>/<code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>), it registers for the corresponding event and continues later. This enables <strong>incremental processing</strong>—handling partial data as it arrives.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Timer Integration</strong> → Before each <code>epoll_wait()</code> call, the event loop queries the timer wheel for the next expiration time and uses it as the timeout parameter. When <code>epoll_wait()</code> returns, the event loop &quot;ticks&quot; the timer wheel, executing any expired timer callbacks (e.g., closing idle connections).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Deferred Task Execution</strong> → After processing all I/O events and timers, the event loop executes any tasks in the async task queue. This ensures that callback registrations/modifications don&#39;t interfere with the current event iteration.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Component Separation and Single-Threaded Reactor</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to handle 10K+ connections with minimal overhead while keeping the codebase maintainable and extensible.

The event loop owns the <code>epoll</code> file descriptor and dispatch logic. The timer wheel owns timeout tracking. Protocol handlers own connection state and parsing logic. They communicate through function pointers (callbacks) and shared context structures, avoiding the need for locks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-filemodule-structure\">Recommended File/Module Structure</h3>\n<p>Organizing code for clarity and maintainability is crucial for a learning project. The recommended structure follows the <strong>component separation</strong> principle, with each major component living in its own pair of header and implementation files.

Language-Specific Hints for C:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Always check <code>malloc()</code> return values.

Think of these structures as the DNA of your server—they encode how connections are tracked, how timeouts are managed, and how events trigger callbacks. The design must balance memory efficiency against fast access, since at 10,000+ connections, even small per-connection overhead compounds dramatically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-types-connection-timer-callback\">Core Types: Connection, Timer, Callback</h3>\n<p>At the heart of any event-driven server are three fundamental concepts: <strong>connections</strong> representing active client sockets, <strong>timers</strong> for scheduling future events, and <strong>callbacks</strong> as the glue that connects I/O events to your application logic. The data structures for these must support all the operations the event loop needs while minimizing memory fragmentation and pointer chasing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"connection-structure\">Connection Structure</h4>\n<p>Imagine each connection as a <strong>work-in-progress envelope</strong> at a postal sorting facility. The envelope has designated slots for incoming data (read buffer) and outgoing data (write buffer), a tracking number (file descriptor), a status indicator (state), and a timer reference that says when this envelope will be discarded if no activity occurs. This self-contained design allows the event loop to process thousands of connections without maintaining separate lookup tables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Unified Connection Context Object</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to associate application state with each file descriptor registered with epoll. When <code>epoll_wait</code> returns an event, we must quickly access all relevant state for that connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Separate Hash Table</strong>: Store connection state in a hash table keyed by file descriptor, with epoll events only carrying the fd.</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded Pointer</strong>: Store connection pointer directly in epoll&#39;s <code>data.ptr</code> field.</li>\n<li><strong>File Descriptor as Index</strong>: Use fd as an index into a pre-allocated array of connection objects.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use embedded pointer (option 2) with a unified <code>connection</code> structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: The <code>epoll_event.data.ptr</code> field provides O(1) access without additional lookups. This eliminates hash collisions and extra memory accesses. The unified structure keeps all related data in one cache-friendly allocation.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Connection objects must be allocated/freed carefully to avoid dangling pointers. The pointer remains valid until explicitly removed from epoll and freed.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>The file descriptor for the socket.

When data arrives, we can cancel the old idle timeout and schedule a new one without searching the timer wheel. This is essential for O(1) timeout reset operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"timer-structure\">Timer Structure</h4>\n<p>Timers are like <strong>kitchen timer dials</strong> in a large restaurant kitchen. Each dial has a specific expiration time and is linked to a particular dish (connection). The hierarchical timer wheel organizes these dials into slots based on when they&#39;ll ring. The timer structure itself just needs to know when it expires, what function to call, and what connection it belongs to.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>expires_at</code></td>\n<td><code>uint64_t</code></td>\n<td>Absolute expiration time in milliseconds since an arbitrary epoch (typically server start).

Each wheel slot holds a linked list of timers that expire in that time range. This approach handles hash collisions gracefully and maintains O(1) average insertion/deletion when combined with the hierarchical wheel algorithm.</p>\n<h4 id=\"callback-registration-pattern\">Callback Registration Pattern</h4>\n<p>While there&#39;s no single <code>callback</code> structure, the system uses a <strong>registration pattern</strong> where callbacks are associated with file descriptors through the <code>connection</code> object and with timers through the <code>timer</code> structure. Think of this as <strong>event subscriptions</strong>—you&#39;re telling the event loop: &quot;When this socket becomes readable, call my read handler; when this timer expires, call my timeout handler.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Callback Types in the System</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I/O Callbacks</strong>: Functions registered via <code>event_loop_register_fd()</code> that get called when <code>EPOLLIN</code> or <code>EPOLLOUT</code> events occur.</li>\n<li><strong>Timer Callbacks</strong>: Functions attached to <code>timer</code> objects that execute when <code>expires_at</code> is reached.</li>\n<li><strong>Deferred Tasks</strong>: Functions placed in a queue to execute in the next event loop iteration (not associated with specific FDs or timers).</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Callback Lifetime Management</strong>\n<strong>Mistake</strong>: Storing direct pointers to stack-allocated data in <code>user_data</code> fields.\n<strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: When a connection closes and its <code>connection</code> object is freed, any pending timer or callback that references it will cause a use-after-free crash.\n<strong>How to fix</strong>: Use <strong>reference counting</strong> or ensure all timers are cancelled before freeing connection objects. The <code>timer_ref</code> field allows cancellation before <code>connection_destroy()</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"event-loop-state-and-timer-wheel-slots\">Event Loop State and Timer Wheel Slots</h3>\n<h4 id=\"event-loop-state-structure\">Event Loop State Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>event_loop</code> is the <strong>central dispatcher</strong>—like an air traffic control tower that monitors all runways (file descriptors) and directs planes (connections) when they&#39;re ready for takeoff or landing.

Think of the event loop as the central nervous system—it senses stimuli (I/O events), processes them through reflex arcs (callbacks), and maintains homeostasis with timers. The timer wheel is the circadian rhythm, the task queue is short-term memory, and the HTTP handler is a specialized skill built on these foundations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"event-loop-epoll-basics-milestone-1\">Event Loop (epoll Basics) - Milestone 1</h3>\n<p>The event loop is the <strong>reactor</strong>—the single-threaded coordinator that monitors all I/O sources and dispatches events to handlers. Imagine a single air traffic controller watching hundreds of radar screens (file descriptors) who directs each plane (connection) when it&#39;s clear for takeoff (write) or has arrived (read).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Level-Triggered vs Edge-Triggered epoll</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: epoll supports two notification modes: level-triggered (notifies while condition is true) and edge-triggered (notifies only on state changes). We need to choose for our educational server handling 10K+ connections.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Level-triggered (default): Simpler for learners, matches select/poll behavior, but may cause unnecessary wakeups if data isn&#39;t fully drained.</li>\n<li>Edge-triggered with EPOLLONESHOT: Most efficient, avoids thundering herd, but requires precise buffer management and re-arm operations.</li>\n<li>Hybrid: Start with level-triggered, optionally support edge-triggered.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use <strong>level-triggered</strong> for Milestone 1-3, with edge-triggered as an advanced extension.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Level-triggered is more forgiving—if a callback doesn&#39;t consume all data, epoll will notify again on the next iteration. This matches the incremental processing model and reduces complex re-registration logic for learners. The performance difference is negligible for educational scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly more epoll_wait returns when data remains, but simpler code and easier debugging. Learners can graduate to edge-triggered optimization later.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Level-triggered (default)</td>\n<td>Simple, self-correcting, matches select/poll mental model</td>\n<td>May cause extra epoll_wait returns if data not fully read</td>\n<td>✅ Yes for learning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edge-triggered with EPOLLONESHOT</td>\n<td>Maximum performance, minimizes syscalls</td>\n<td>Complex buffer management, must re-arm after each event</td>\n<td>No for core</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid configurable</td>\n<td>Best of both worlds</td>\n<td>Increased complexity, two code paths</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The event loop component owns the epoll instance, manages file descriptor registration, and executes the main dispatch loop.

Each office (file descriptor) has a button that lights up when someone enters (EPOLLIN) or when the outgoing tray is empty (EPOLLOUT). The receptionist watches all lights, and when one illuminates, they announce over the intercom: &quot;Office 42, you have a visitor!&quot; The office worker (callback) then handles the visitor at their own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Data Structures</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>event_loop</code></td>\n<td>struct</td>\n<td>Main event loop state container</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>epoll_event</code></td>\n<td>struct epoll_event</td>\n<td>Linux kernel event structure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong><code>event_loop</code> Structure Fields</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>epoll_fd</code></td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>The epoll file descriptor returned by <code>epoll_create1()</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>events</code></td>\n<td>struct epoll_event*</td>\n<td>Dynamically allocated array for epoll_wait results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>max_events</code></td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Capacity of the events array (configurable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>running</code></td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Boolean flag: 1 while loop should continue, 0 to stop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>timer_wheel</code></td>\n<td>struct timer_wheel*</td>\n<td>Pointer to associated timer wheel (Milestone 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>task_queue</code></td>\n<td>struct deferred_task*</td>\n<td>Head pointer to deferred task queue (Milestone 3)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong><code>epoll_event</code> Structure Fields</strong> (Linux standard):</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>events</code></td>\n<td>uint32_t</td>\n<td>Bitmask of epoll events (EPOLLIN, EPOLLOUT, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>data</code></td>\n<td>union</td>\n<td>User data attached to event (we store <code>connection*</code> in <code>ptr</code>)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Event Loop Interface</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>event_loop_create</code></td>\n<td><code>max_events int</code></td>\n<td><code>struct event_loop*</code></td>\n<td>Allocates and initializes event loop with given epoll_wait capacity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>event_loop_register_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>loop struct event_loop*</code>, <code>fd int</code>, <code>events uint32_t</code>, <code>user_data void*</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code> (0 success, -1 error)</td>\n<td>Registers FD with epoll for specified events, attaches user_data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>event_loop_modify_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>loop struct event_loop*</code>, <code>fd int</code>, <code>events uint32_t</code>, <code>user_data void*</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Modifies existing FD registration (e.g., add EPOLLOUT when write buffer full)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>event_loop_unregister_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>loop struct event_loop*</code>, <code>fd int</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Removes FD from epoll monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>event_loop_run</code></td>\n<td><code>loop struct event_loop*</code>, <code>timeout_ms int</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Main dispatch loop;

a single blocking call stalls all other connections.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Always call <code>set_nonblocking()</code> on the listening socket after creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Treating <code>read()</code>/<code>write()</code> returning -1 with <code>errno == EAGAIN</code> as an error and closing the connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: These are normal non-blocking I/O conditions meaning &quot;try later,&quot; not errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Check <code>errno</code> after -1 return: if <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, simply return 0 bytes processed and continue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Starving writes while processing reads</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Processing all <code>EPOLLIN</code> events before any <code>EPOLLOUT</code> events in the same loop iteration.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: A connection with both read and write ready might have its write delayed, causing buffer buildup.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Process both events for each connection before moving to the next, or use round-robin.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The event loop&#39;s efficiency comes from <strong>never waiting</strong> for any single operation. It always has work to do—either process ready I/O, handle timers, or execute deferred tasks. This is why non-blocking operations are non-negotiable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"timer-wheel-timer-wheel-and-timeouts-milestone-2\">Timer Wheel (Timer Wheel and Timeouts) - Milestone 2</h3>\n<p>The timer wheel manages time-based events with <strong>O(1) complexity</strong> for insertion and deletion. Imagine a multi-tiered revolving door system in a large hotel: the innermost door rotates every minute (64ms slots), the middle every hour (4s slots), and the outer every day (4min slots). Guests (timers) enter at the appropriate door based on their departure time, cascading inward as time progresses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hierarchical Timer Wheel vs Min-Heap</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need efficient timeout management for 10K+ connections with frequent insertions (new timeouts) and deletions (cancellations when activity occurs).</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li><strong>Min-heap (priority queue)</strong>: O(log n) insert/delete, O(1) min retrieval.

When response exceeds buffer size, use write slicing: send first chunk, register <code>EPOLLOUT</code>, send next chunk when ready.</li>\n<li>Backpressure: When <code>connection_write()</code> returns <code>EAGAIN</code>, stop reading from that connection to prevent buffer buildup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls for Milestone 4</strong>:</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: HTTP request line split across reads</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: &quot;GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\\r\\n&quot; arrives as &quot;GET /index&quot; then &quot;.html HTTP/1.1\\r\\n&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Naive parser expecting complete lines fails.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Incremental parser stores partial data in buffer, continues when more arrives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Write buffer exhaustion without EPOLLOUT registration</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Response too large for buffer, but code doesn&#39;t register for <code>EPOLLOUT</code> to continue later.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Response truncated, connection hangs.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: After filling write buffer, if more data remains, register <code>EPOLLOUT</code>. In write callback, send next chunk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Keep-alive connection starvation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Single fast client sends infinite requests on keep-alive, blocking others.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Fairness issue, denial of service vector.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Limit requests per connection (e.g., 100), then close. Or implement weighted fair queuing.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The HTTP server demonstrates <strong>composability</strong> of the event loop framework. By implementing just three callbacks (create, read, write) and using the provided buffer management and timer facilities, we get a production-capable server. This pattern extends to any protocol (WebSocket, Redis, custom).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

While the previous sections described the static components and data structures, here we examine how these parts interact over time to handle real-world scenarios. Think of this as watching the system in motion—like observing a complex clock mechanism where gears (components) turn in precise sequence to produce the desired outcome (handling 10K+ connections).</p>\n<p>Understanding these flows is critical because the reactor pattern&#39;s power emerges from the choreography between I/O events, timer ticks, and deferred tasks. A single misstep—like processing timers before I/O events—can cause subtle bugs like delayed responses or missed timeouts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sequence-connection-lifecycle\">Sequence: Connection Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>Imagine each TCP connection as a <strong>visitor to a high-traffic museum</strong>. The event loop is the single tour guide managing all visitors simultaneously. The guide doesn&#39;t wait for one visitor to finish examining an exhibit before attending to another. Instead, they constantly scan the room (epoll_wait), notice when visitors are ready (read/write events), provide information in small chunks (non-blocking I/O), and politely escort out visitors who&#39;ve been idle too long (timer timeouts). This analogy captures the essence of the connection lifecycle in our event-driven architecture.</p>\n<p>The complete journey of a connection follows a <strong>finite state machine</strong> (refer to <img src=\"/api/project/build-event-loop/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-2.svg\" alt=\"Event Loop State Machine\">). Below, we walk through each state transition with concrete steps, data structure updates, and the API calls involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Connection State Management</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: State Machine Embedded in Connection Structure</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to track where each connection is in its lifecycle (accepting, reading, writing, closing) to apply the correct handling logic when events occur. The state determines which callbacks to invoke and what cleanup to perform.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Separate state machines per protocol</strong>: Each protocol handler (HTTP, echo) maintains its own state enumeration, duplicating common states like <code>READING</code> and <code>WRITING</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Generic state with protocol-specific extensions</strong>: A base connection state machine (<code>STATE_ACCEPTED</code>, <code>STATE_READING</code>, etc.) with a <code>proto_data</code> field for protocol-specific state (like <code>HTTP_READING</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>Fully protocol-agnostic event callbacks</strong>: No explicit state tracking; callbacks decide what to do based on buffered data and previous actions, requiring complex logic within each callback.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Option 2—generic state machine with protocol extension. The <code>connection</code> struct contains a <code>state</code> field with common states, and protocol handlers can store additional state in <code>proto_data</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This provides a clean separation of concerns. The event loop manages the generic lifecycle (allocation, registration, timeout, cleanup) while protocol handlers manage protocol-specific parsing and logic. It avoids duplication while maintaining clear state transitions that are easy to debug.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Protocol handlers must coordinate with the base state (e.g., transitioning from <code>STATE_READING</code> to <code>STATE_WRITING</code> when a request is fully parsed). The <code>proto_data</code> field requires careful memory management (allocated/freed with the connection).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Separate state machines per protocol</td>\n<td>Clean protocol separation; no shared state assumptions</td>\n<td>Duplication of common states; harder to enforce consistent lifecycle management</td>\n<td>❌</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Generic state with protocol extensions</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Unified lifecycle management; extensible; clear debugging</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Slight complexity in protocol handler coordination</strong></td>\n<td><strong>✅</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fully protocol-agnostic callbacks</td>\n<td>Maximum flexibility; no state tracking overhead</td>\n<td>Callbacks become complex; hard to reason about connection progress</td>\n<td>❌</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The connection lifecycle proceeds through the following stages, each triggered by specific events and resulting in specific actions:</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Connection State Transitions and Actions</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event Trigger</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken (in order)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>LISTENING</strong> (listening socket)</td>\n<td><code>EPOLLIN</code> event on listening socket</td>\n<td><code>STATE_ACCEPTED</code></td>\n<td>1. <code>accept4()</code> with <code>SOCK_NONBLOCK</code> <br> 2.

The event loop invokes the registered read callback, which is <code>http_handle_read()</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The callback first cancels the idle timer: <code>timer_wheel_remove(wheel, connection-&gt;timer_ref)</code>.</li>\n<li>It calls <code>connection_read(connection)</code> which reads up to <code>READ_BUFFER_SIZE</code> bytes into <code>read_buffer</code>. Suppose the request is partial (only &quot;GET /index.html HT&quot;).</li>\n<li><code>http_parser_feed()</code> consumes the available bytes but doesn&#39;t complete the request (headers not fully received).</li>\n<li>The callback updates <code>connection-&gt;state = HTTP_READING</code> (a protocol-specific state stored in <code>proto_data</code>).</li>\n<li>It adds a new idle timer (maybe 5 seconds for reading phase) via <code>timer_wheel_add()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>More data arrives</strong>: Another <code>EPOLLIN</code> event occurs on socket 42. <code>http_handle_read()</code> is called again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timer is cancelled again (idle timeout reset).</li>\n<li><code>connection_read()</code> reads the remainder of the request (&quot;TP/1.1\\r\\nHost: ...&quot;).</li>\n<li><code>http_parser_feed()</code> now completes header parsing, sets <code>headers_complete = 1</code>, and extracts <code>Content-Length</code>.</li>\n<li>The parser may need more data for body (if <code>Content-Length &gt; 0</code>). In this example, it&#39;s a GET request with no body, so parsing completes.</li>\n<li><code>http_generate_response()</code> generates an HTTP 200 response with some HTML content, copying it into <code>connection.write_buffer</code>.</li>\n<li>The callback changes <code>connection-&gt;state = HTTP_WRITING</code>.</li>\n<li>It registers for <code>EPOLLOUT</code> via <code>event_loop_modify_fd(loop, 42, EPOLLOUT, connection_ptr)</code> to be notified when writable.</li>\n<li>A new idle timer for the writing phase is added (maybe 10 seconds).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Socket becomes writable</strong>: <code>EPOLLOUT</code> event fires on socket 42.

Suppose the entire response fits in one write (common for small responses).</li>\n<li>All bytes are sent, so <code>write_buffer</code> is cleared.</li>\n<li>Since HTTP keep-alive is supported and requested, the connection should wait for the next request.</li>\n<li>The callback deregisters <code>EPOLLOUT</code> (only <code>EPOLLIN</code> needed now) via <code>event_loop_modify_fd(loop, 42, EPOLLIN, connection_ptr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>connection-&gt;state</code> is set back to <code>HTTP_READING</code> (or <code>HTTP_KEEPALIVE</code>).</li>\n<li>The idle timer is reset to the keep-alive timeout (maybe 30 seconds).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Client sends second request</strong>: The cycle repeats from step 2.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Client idle timeout</strong>: Suppose after the response, the client disappears and sends no more data. After 30 seconds, the timer added in step 4 expires.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The timer callback (<code>idle_timeout_callback</code>) receives the <code>connection</code> pointer.</li>\n<li>It calls <code>event_loop_unregister_fd(loop, connection-&gt;fd)</code> to remove the socket from epoll.</li>\n<li>It calls <code>connection_destroy(connection)</code>, which <code>close()</code>s the socket and frees all buffers and the <code>connection</code> struct itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Connection Lifecycle Management</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Timer reference dangling after connection destruction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: A connection is destroyed (due to error or normal close) but its timer still exists in the timer wheel. When the timer later expires, it calls the callback with a stale <code>user_data</code> pointer, causing a use-after-free crash.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Timer callbacks must never access freed memory. This leads to undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Always cancel the timer (<code>timer_wheel_remove()</code>) <strong>before</strong> freeing the connection. In the destruction sequence: 1) remove from epoll, 2) cancel timer, 3) close socket and free memory. Alternatively, store a weak reference in the timer that&#39;s validated before use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: State inconsistency during partial writes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: When a write cannot send all buffered data (<code>EAGAIN</code>), the code transitions to <code>STATE_WRITING</code> and registers <code>EPOLLOUT</code>. However, if an error occurs before the next <code>EPOLLOUT</code> event (like client disconnect), the connection might be stuck in <code>STATE_WRITING</code> with no way to progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The connection becomes a zombie—consuming resources but unable to complete.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Always check for errors on the socket (via <code>getsockopt(SO_ERROR)</code> or checking <code>errno</code> after a subsequent operation) even when waiting for <code>EPOLLOUT</code>. Additionally, implement a write timeout timer that forces closure if data cannot be sent within a reasonable period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Busy-loop on <code>EPOLLOUT</code> with empty buffer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: After all buffered data is sent, the code forgets to deregister <code>EPOLLOUT</code>. The socket remains continuously writable (level-triggered), causing the event loop to spin constantly invoking the write callback.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Wastes CPU cycles, reduces performance, and may cause unexpected behavior if the write callback is called with empty buffer.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Immediately after <code>connection_write()</code> sends all data, check if <code>write_buffer_used == 0</code>. If so, modify the event registration to remove <code>EPOLLOUT</code> (using <code>event_loop_modify_fd()</code> with only <code>EPOLLIN</code>). Alternatively, use edge-triggered mode (<code>EPOLLET</code>) which only notifies on transition to writable, but this requires different handling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"flow-event-loop-tick\">Flow: Event Loop Tick</h3>\n<p>The event loop tick is the <strong>heartbeat</strong> of the entire system. Imagine a master chef in a busy kitchen who repeatedly follows a strict routine: 1) Check which orders are ready (epoll_wait), 2) Prepare dishes that have ingredients available (process I/O events), 3) Check the oven timer (timer wheel tick), 4) Clean up and prep for next round (deferred tasks). This disciplined, repetitive cycle ensures no order is forgotten and everything progresses efficiently.</p>\n<p>Each iteration of the event loop—called a &quot;tick&quot;—processes all pending I/O events, expires due timers, and executes deferred tasks. The order of these operations is crucial for correctness and performance. Refer to <img src=\"/api/project/build-event-loop/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiagram-4.svg\" alt=\"Sequence Diagram: Event Loop Tick\"> for a visual sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Processing Order Within a Tick</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: I/O → Timers → Deferred Tasks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We must decide the sequence in which to handle different event sources within a single loop iteration. The order affects latency, fairness, and potential starvation.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Timers → I/O → Tasks</strong>: Process timer callbacks first, then I/O events, then deferred tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>I/O → Timers → Tasks</strong>: Process all I/O events (reads then writes), then timer expirations, then deferred tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixed priority queue</strong>: All events (I/O, timer, task) placed in a single priority queue sorted by urgency.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Option 2—I/O first, then timers, then deferred tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: I/O events are typically the highest priority because they represent data already arrived that needs immediate processing to free kernel buffers. Timers are checked after I/O because their expiration time has already passed slightly (we check after epoll_wait returns). Deferred tasks run last because they&#39;re explicitly deferred to the next iteration and shouldn&#39;t block I/O processing. This order minimizes latency for incoming data while ensuring timers are checked at least every <code>epoll_wait</code> timeout.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Timer callbacks may experience a small additional latency (up to the <code>epoll_wait</code> timeout) beyond their scheduled time. However, this is acceptable for idle timeouts and heartbeat timers. Critical timing applications would need a different design.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Timers → I/O → Tasks</td>\n<td>Timers fire more precisely at expiration</td>\n<td>I/O data may sit in kernel buffers longer, increasing memory pressure and latency</td>\n<td>❌</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>I/O → Timers → Tasks</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Minimizes latency for incoming data; logical flow</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Timer callbacks slightly delayed</strong></td>\n<td><strong>✅</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mixed priority queue</td>\n<td>Most theoretically fair; all events handled by urgency</td>\n<td>Complex implementation; overhead of sorting; may starve I/O if many timers expire</td>\n<td>❌</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The event loop tick follows a precise algorithm executed by <code>event_loop_run()</code>.

If so, break out of the loop.</li>\n<li>Optionally, perform periodic maintenance (e.g., log statistics, resize internal buffers if needed) every N iterations.</li>\n<li>Return to step 1 for the next iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Timing and Latency Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The choice of <code>timeout_ms</code> in step 1 is critical for balancing responsiveness and CPU usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>timeout_ms</code> is too large (e.g., always <code>-1</code>), timer expirations will be delayed until the next I/O event occurs, causing idle connections to linger beyond their timeout.</li>\n<li>If <code>timeout_ms</code> is too small (e.g., always <code>1</code>), the loop will busy-wait, consuming 100% CPU even when idle.</li>\n<li>The correct approach: dynamically set <code>timeout_ms</code> to the time until the next timer expiration, capped at a reasonable maximum (e.g., 100ms) to allow periodic housekeeping even when no timers are scheduled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concrete Example: Tick with Mixed Events</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#39;s walk through a concrete tick where multiple event types occur:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Before tick</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timer wheel has a timer expiring in 50ms (idle timeout for connection A).</li>\n<li>Connection B has pending data in its kernel receive buffer.</li>\n<li>Deferred task queue has one task (cleanup of a recently closed connection).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Calculate timeout. <code>timer_wheel_next_expiration()</code> returns 50. <code>timeout_ms = 50</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: <code>epoll_wait</code> with 50ms timeout. Suppose after 30ms, connection B becomes readable. <code>epoll_wait</code> returns with <code>n_events = 1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Process I/O events. The event is for connection B with <code>EPOLLIN</code>. Invoke <code>http_handle_read(connection_B)</code>. It reads data, parses a complete HTTP request, generates response, and registers <code>EPOLLOUT</code>. No errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tick timer wheel. <code>timer_wheel_tick()</code> increments time by 30ms (the actual wait). The timer that was 50ms away is now 20ms from expiration, so it does NOT fire yet. No callbacks invoked.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Process deferred tasks. The cleanup task callback frees memory from a connection closed in the previous tick.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Loop continues (<code>running == 1</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Next tick</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>timeout_ms</code> now 20ms (timer for connection A).</li>\n<li><code>epoll_wait</code> waits up to 20ms. No I/O events occur.</li>\n<li>After 20ms, <code>epoll_wait</code> times out (returns 0 events).</li>\n<li>Process I/O events: none.</li>\n<li><code>timer_wheel_tick()</code> increments time by 20ms, timer for connection A expires. Timer callback calls <code>connection_destroy(connection_A)</code>.</li>\n<li>Process deferred tasks: none.</li>\n<li>Loop continues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This example shows how the event loop interleaves different event types, ensuring timely processing of both I/O and timers.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Flow During a Tick</strong></p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the data transformations that occur during each phase of the tick:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Input Data</th>\n<th>Transformation</th>\n<th>Output Data</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>epoll_wait</code></td>\n<td>Kernel I/O readiness state</td>\n<td>System call blocks until timeout or readiness</td>\n<td>Array of <code>epoll_event</code> structures with <code>fd</code> and event flags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O Processing</td>\n<td><code>epoll_event</code> array + <code>connection</code> pointers</td>\n<td>Callbacks read/write socket buffers, update connection state, modify buffers</td>\n<td>Updated <code>connection</code> buffers, possibly new event registrations (<code>EPOLLOUT</code>), state transitions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timer Tick</td>\n<td><code>timer_wheel</code> state + current time</td>\n<td>Scan for expired timers, invoke callbacks, cascade future timers</td>\n<td>Timer callbacks executed (may close connections, send heartbeats), <code>timer_wheel</code> slots updated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task Processing</td>\n<td><code>deferred_task</code> linked list</td>\n<td>Execute callbacks in FIFO order</td>\n<td>Side effects (cleanup, logging), queue emptied</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Event Loop Tick Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Starving timers or tasks due to infinite I/O</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: If a continuous stream of I/O events occurs (e.g., a fast client sending data), the loop may never progress beyond step 3 because <code>epoll_wait</code> always returns immediately with events. Timers never get checked, and deferred tasks never run.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Timers don&#39;t fire, causing idle connections to never timeout. Deferred tasks (like cleanup) accumulate, causing memory leaks.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Ensure <code>epoll_wait</code> has a non-zero timeout even when I/O is busy. Cap the number of I/O events processed per tick (e.g., process at most <code>2 * max_events</code> per tick before breaking to timer/task phases). Alternatively, use a separate mechanism to force timer checks, like a periodic signal or checking monotonic clock between iterations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Callback modifying event set during iteration</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: While iterating through the <code>epoll_event</code> array, a callback calls <code>event_loop_modify_fd()</code> or <code>event_loop_unregister_fd()</code> for the same fd being processed. This may corrupt the event array or cause undefined behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Modifying the underlying epoll set while iterating over the result of <code>epoll_wait</code> is safe in Linux (the returned array is a snapshot), but modifying the <strong>same fd&#39;s events</strong> can lead to confusion about which events were actually present.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Defer modifications until after the I/O processing loop. For example, when a read callback completes a request and needs to register <code>EPOLLOUT</code>, set a flag in the connection and perform the modification after all events are processed. Alternatively, use the <code>EPOLLONESHOT</code> flag to automatically deregister after an event, then re-register with desired events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect timeout calculation leading to drift</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: Using a simple <code>sleep</code> or assuming each tick takes exactly <code>timeout_ms</code> milliseconds causes timer drift over time. Real-world <code>epoll_wait</code> may return early due to signals or I/O, and processing takes variable time.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Timers become increasingly inaccurate; a 30-second idle timeout might fire after 35 seconds.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Base time on a monotonic clock (<code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code>) rather than assuming elapsed time. Store the clock value before <code>epoll_wait</code> and after, compute actual elapsed milliseconds, and advance the timer wheel by that amount. This ensures timers expire at correct absolute times regardless of processing overhead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology

Use <code>perror()</code> for logging during development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone Checkpoint: Verifying the Event Loop Tick</strong></p>\n<p>After implementing the event loop core (Milestone 1), verify the tick flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start the echo server</strong>: Compile and run <code>./server 8080</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Connect multiple clients</strong>: In separate terminals, run <code>telnet localhost 8080</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Observe I/O processing</strong>: Type a line in one telnet session. It should be echoed back immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>Verify timer integration</strong>: After implementing timer wheel (Milestone 2), add a 5-second idle timeout. Connect a client but don&#39;t send data. Wait 5 seconds; the connection should close automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Check deferred tasks</strong>: Add a deferred task that logs &quot;tick&quot; every 100 iterations.

Each unhandled error can gradually leak resources until the system becomes unresponsive. Unlike traditional blocking I/O where errors appear as obvious failures in a single thread, non-blocking event loops require anticipating failures across thousands of independent connections while maintaining system stability.</p>\n<p>Think of error handling in an event loop like air traffic control at a busy airport. The controller (event loop) must handle routine operations (normal I/O) while constantly monitoring for emergencies (errors), managing fuel shortages (resource constraints), and dealing with unresponsive pilots (slow clients). Missing a single distress signal or allowing one plane to occupy the runway too long can cascade into system-wide failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-blocking-io-error-patterns\">Non-Blocking I/O Error Patterns</h3>\n<p>Non-blocking I/O fundamentally changes how errors manifest. Instead of operations failing with hard errors, they often return &quot;soft&quot; conditions that indicate &quot;try again later&quot; or &quot;the connection state changed.&quot; Successful event loop implementation requires treating these not as exceptions but as expected, routine conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Restaurant with a Ticket System</strong><br>Imagine a busy restaurant where waitstaff (the event loop) take orders (read requests) and deliver food (write responses). When the kitchen is temporarily backed up, the waitstaff don&#39;t stop working—they check back later (<code>EAGAIN</code>). If a customer leaves without paying (connection reset), the waitstaff don&#39;t panic—they simply clean the table (<code>ECONNRESET</code>). If a customer&#39;s mouth is full when trying to deliver more food (pipe broken), they wait until the customer is ready (<code>EPIPE</code>). Each condition has a standard operating procedure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"common-error-conditions-and-their-handling\">Common Error Conditions and Their Handling</h4>\n<p>The following table catalogs the critical error patterns and their proper handling in the event loop context:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Typical Cause</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong><code>EAGAIN</code>/<code>EWOULDBLOCK</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after <code>read()</code>/<code>write()</code>/<code>accept()</code></td>\n<td>Non-blocking operation cannot complete immediately</td>\n<td>Stop current operation, maintain current state, wait for next <code>EPOLLIN</code>/<code>EPOLLOUT</code> notification</td>\n<td>Not actually an error—expected behavior in non-blocking mode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>ECONNRESET</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after <code>read()</code>/<code>write()</code></td>\n<td>Remote peer abruptly closed connection (TCP RST)</td>\n<td>Immediately close local socket, free connection resources, deregister from epoll</td>\n<td>May occur on either read or write operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>EPIPE</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after <code>write()</code></td>\n<td>Writing to socket whose read side is closed (broken pipe)</td>\n<td>Close socket, deregister from epoll</td>\n<td>Often accompanied by <code>SIGPIPE</code> signal; disable signal with <code>MSG_NOSIGNAL</code> or <code>signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>EINTR</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after system call</td>\n<td>System call interrupted by signal</td>\n<td>Restart the same system call (with same parameters)</td>\n<td>Most system calls in event loop should be retried</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>EBADF</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after system call</td>\n<td>File descriptor is invalid (already closed)</td>\n<td>Log error, skip processing for this fd</td>\n<td>Indicates programming error in fd lifecycle management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>ENOMEM</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after <code>malloc()</code>/<code>accept()</code></td>\n<td>System out of memory</td>\n<td>Close least important connections, continue serving</td>\n<td>Apply backpressure by rejecting new connections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>EMFILE</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after <code>accept()</code></td>\n<td>Process file descriptor limit reached</td>\n<td>Stop accepting temporarily, close idle connections</td>\n<td>Use <code>epoll</code> to monitor listening socket only when below threshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><code>EFAULT</code></strong></td>\n<td><code>errno</code> after system call</td>\n<td>Invalid buffer pointer (programming bug)</td>\n<td>Log and terminate program</td>\n<td>Cannot recover from memory corruption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Treating EAGAIN as Expected Flow, Not Error</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: In non-blocking I/O, operations frequently cannot complete immediately.

Without metering, a few slow-moving vehicles (slow clients) entering the highway can cause traffic jams for everyone.

Think of testing this system like validating a high-performance race car: you need individual component tests (engine, brakes, transmission), integration tests (how the powertrain works together), and finally track testing under realistic load conditions to verify it actually achieves 10,000+ concurrent connections with stable performance.</p>\n<p>The testing strategy must address three critical dimensions: <strong>functional correctness</strong> (does it handle connections correctly?), <strong>concurrency robustness</strong> (does it handle 10K connections without failure?), and <strong>performance characteristics</strong> (does it maintain acceptable latency under load?). Each milestone introduces new complexity that requires specific verification approaches, from basic echo functionality in Milestone 1 to full HTTP protocol compliance in Milestone 4.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-and-integration-tests\">Unit and Integration Tests</h3>\n<p>Unit testing focuses on individual components in isolation, while integration testing verifies that components work together correctly. Given the event-driven nature of the system, traditional unit testing approaches need adaptation to handle asynchronous callbacks and non-blocking I/O.</p>\n<h4 id=\"timer-wheel-unit-testing\">Timer Wheel Unit Testing</h4>\n<p>The hierarchical timer wheel is a complex data structure with specific performance guarantees. Testing it requires verifying both correctness (timers fire at the right time) and performance (O(1) operations).</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of the timer wheel as a multi-tiered conveyor belt system in a factory. Items (timers) are placed on different belts based on when they need to be processed. The belts move at different speeds, and items must cascade from slower belts to faster belts as their deadline approaches. Testing ensures items don&#39;t fall off the belts, don&#39;t get processed too early or late, and the conveyor system doesn&#39;t jam under heavy load.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Strategy Table</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n<th>Expected Outcome</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Basic Operations</td>\n<td>Insert single timer, tick before expiration</td>\n<td>Manual timer counting</td>\n<td>Timer doesn&#39;t fire early</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Basic Operations</td>\n<td>Insert single timer, tick past expiration</td>\n<td>Callback invocation check</td>\n<td>Timer fires exactly once</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Basic Operations</td>\n<td>Insert and cancel timer before expiration</td>\n<td>Memory leak check</td>\n<td>Timer callback never invoked, memory freed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cascading Behavior</td>\n<td>Insert timer that spans multiple wheel levels</td>\n<td>Internal state inspection</td>\n<td>Timer cascades correctly through levels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>Insert 10,000 timers with random expirations</td>\n<td>Time measurement</td>\n<td>All operations complete in O(1) time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edge Cases</td>\n<td>Insert timer with 0ms timeout</td>\n<td>Immediate execution check</td>\n<td>Timer fires on next <code>timer_wheel_tick</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edge Cases</td>\n<td>Insert timer with very large timeout (overflow)</td>\n<td>Boundary checking</td>\n<td>Timer handled correctly or rejected</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Timer Wheel Testing Approach</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Mockable Time Source for Deterministic Testing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The timer wheel depends on monotonic time for determining when timers expire. Real-time sources make tests non-deterministic and flaky.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Use real <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> and rely on timing tolerances</li>\n<li>Inject a mock time source via function pointer</li>\n<li>Build deterministic test harness with controllable virtual time</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use a mockable time source via function pointer in the <code>timer_wheel</code> structure</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Deterministic tests are essential for CI/CD pipelines. A mock time source allows tests to &quot;fast-forward&quot; time without waiting, making tests run quickly and predictably.

Unlike a batch parser that receives complete requests, the incremental parser maintains state between calls to <code>http_parser_feed</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Imagine the HTTP parser as a factory assembly line inspector. Parts of an HTTP request (bytes) arrive on a conveyor belt at irregular intervals. The inspector must examine each part as it arrives, determine if it&#39;s a valid piece of a request, and raise a flag when a complete, valid request has passed through. Sometimes defective parts arrive (malformed bytes), and the inspector must reject them without stopping the entire line.</p>\n<p><strong>HTTP Parser Test Matrix</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Input Pattern</th>\n<th>Expected Parser State</th>\n<th>Expected Output</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Complete request in one chunk</td>\n<td>Full HTTP request</td>\n<td><code>HTTP_READING</code> → <code>HTTP_WRITING</code></td>\n<td>Request fully parsed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Split across read boundaries</td>\n<td>&quot;GET / HT&quot; then &quot;TP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;</td>\n<td><code>HTTP_READING</code> persists between feeds</td>\n<td>Request parsed after second feed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Headers across multiple reads</td>\n<td>Headers split mid-line</td>\n<td>Header state maintained</td>\n<td>All headers correctly assembled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chunked encoding</td>\n<td>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</td>\n<td>Handles chunk size and data separately</td>\n<td>Body correctly reconstructed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malformed method</td>\n<td>&quot;GEX / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot;</td>\n<td>Error state with error code</td>\n<td><code>http_parser_feed</code> returns error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request too large</td>\n<td>Headers exceed buffer</td>\n<td>Error state for overflow</td>\n<td>Parser rejects with size error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Keep-alive vs close</td>\n<td>Connection header variations</td>\n<td>Sets keep-alive flag correctly</td>\n<td>Correct connection handling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Step-by-Step Parser Test Procedure</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initialize parser</strong>: Create <code>http_parser</code> instance with <code>http_parser_create()</code></li>\n<li><strong>Feed partial data</strong>: Call <code>http_parser_feed()</code> with first chunk of request data</li>\n<li><strong>Verify intermediate state</strong>: Check parser state indicates more data needed</li>\n<li><strong>Feed remaining data</strong>: Provide remaining bytes to complete request</li>\n<li><strong>Verify completion</strong>: Check parser indicates headers are complete</li>\n<li><strong>Extract parsed request</strong>: Use accessor functions to validate parsed fields</li>\n<li><strong>Reset for next request</strong>: Call <code>http_parser_reset()</code> and verify clean state</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Edge Case Testing Table</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Edge Case</th>\n<th>Test Approach</th>\n<th>Validation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Empty read (EAGAIN)</td>\n<td>Feed 0 bytes to parser</td>\n<td>Parser state unchanged</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CRLF vs LF line endings</td>\n<td>Mix of \\r\\n and \\n</td>\n<td>Headers parsed correctly regardless</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unicode in headers</td>\n<td>UTF-8 in header values</td>\n<td>Preserved or rejected based on policy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple consecutive requests</td>\n<td>Keep-alive connection</td>\n<td>Parser resets correctly between requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Extremely long URL</td>\n<td>URL exceeds buffer</td>\n<td>Handled with configurable max</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing Host header (HTTP/1.1)</td>\n<td>Request without Host</td>\n<td>Parser rejects or handles based on spec</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"event-loop-integration-testing\">Event Loop Integration Testing</h4>\n<p>Integration testing verifies that the event loop coordinates correctly between I/O, timers, and callbacks.

The non-blocking flag ensures it works with the event loop. This approach tests the actual epoll code path without network variability.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Tests run fast and deterministically.

Instead of stepping through a linear execution path, you&#39;re observing emergent behavior in a complex state machine. Think of debugging this system as <strong>diagnosing a living organism</strong>: you can&#39;t stop its heart (the event loop) to examine it, so you must use external monitoring, logging, and selective instrumentation to understand its health. The key insight is that most problems manifest as statistical anomalies—gradual performance degradation, sporadic connection failures, or resource leaks—rather than deterministic crashes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"diagnostic-mental-model-the-traffic-control-center-analogy\">Diagnostic Mental Model: The Traffic Control Center Analogy</h3>\n<p>Imagine the event loop as a <strong>traffic control center</strong> for a busy highway system with thousands of vehicles (connections). When something goes wrong:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Traffic Jam (High CPU)</strong>: All controllers (CPU cores) are overwhelmed processing vehicles, but throughput drops.</li>\n<li><strong>Stalled Vehicles (Stuck Connections)</strong>: Individual cars aren&#39;t moving despite open lanes.</li>\n<li><strong>Missing Patrols (Timer Failures)</strong>: Scheduled maintenance vehicles don&#39;t arrive at their destinations.</li>\n<li><strong>Radio Static (Partial Data)</strong>: Communication arrives garbled or incomplete.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just as traffic controllers use cameras (logging), vehicle trackers (<code>strace</code>), and traffic flow sensors (<code>perf</code>), you need multiple observational tools to diagnose which component of the system is malfunctioning and why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"symptom-cause-fix-table\">Symptom-Cause-Fix Table</h3>\n<p>The following table maps observable symptoms to their likely root causes, diagnostic steps, and corrective actions.

This is especially common in race conditions around timer expiration and event registration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: The debugging itself becomes a confounding variable.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Use atomic counters instead of I/O in hot paths, or write to memory-mapped ring buffers that have minimal timing impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Assuming Linear Causality</strong>\nIn event-driven systems, symptom and cause may be separated by thousands of event loop ticks. A connection drop at time T might be caused by a memory allocation failure at time T-1000.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Looking only at immediate context misses root causes.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement correlation IDs that track chains of events, and use timeline visualization tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overlooking Kernel Resources</strong>\nYour application logic may be perfect, but the kernel may be out of TCP buffers, file descriptors, or ephemeral ports.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Application-level debugging shows no bugs, but the system still fails.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Monitor <code>/proc</code> metrics alongside application metrics, set <code>ulimit -n</code> appropriately, and implement graceful degradation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Statistically Rare Events</strong>\nA bug that affects 1 in 10,000 connections might not appear in small-scale testing but will cause periodic failures in production.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: &quot;It works on my machine&quot; with 100 connections doesn&#39;t guarantee correctness at scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Use property-based testing that generates edge cases, and run load tests that exceed target concurrency by 2x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"a-technology-recommendations-table\">A.

The foundational design—with its clean separation of I/O multiplexing, timer management, and protocol handling—provides a solid base for several advanced enhancements. Think of the current event loop as a high-performance single-engine aircraft; these extensions represent potential upgrades to multi-engine configurations, improved navigation systems, and specialized payload capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multi-threaded-reactor-and-protocol-upgrades\">Multi-threaded Reactor and Protocol Upgrades</h3>\n<p>The single-threaded reactor pattern achieves remarkable efficiency for I/O-bound workloads but faces limitations with CPU-intensive tasks or when maximum hardware utilization is required. Extending the architecture to leverage multiple CPU cores while preserving the event-driven model is a natural progression.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-the-post-office-with-specialized-departments\">Mental Model: The Post Office with Specialized Departments</h4>\n<p>Imagine our single-threaded event loop as a small-town post office with one exceptionally efficient postal worker. This worker handles everything: sorting mail, operating the counter, and loading trucks. As mail volume grows, we could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Open Multiple Identical Post Offices (Multi-Process)</strong>: Run independent event loops in separate processes, each with its own epoll instance and connection set.</li>\n<li><strong>Add Specialized Workers (Thread Pool)</strong>: Keep the main postal worker for sorting but hire specialized workers for heavy tasks like package processing.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Regional Sorting Centers (Multi-Threaded Reactor)</strong>: Build a larger facility where multiple workers collaboratively sort mail using shared infrastructure.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The third approach—multi-threaded reactor—provides the best scalability for our server architecture while maintaining the event-driven paradigm.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multi-threaded-reactor-pattern\">Multi-Threaded Reactor Pattern</h4>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Threaded Reactor with Worker Threads</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Threading Model for CPU-Intensive Work</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The single-threaded event loop can efficiently handle 10K+ connections but saturates a single CPU core.

Understanding this terminology is essential for working with the event loop architecture, debugging issues, and extending the system. Terms are listed alphabetically for quick reference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"terminology-table\">Terminology Table</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>First Reference/Context</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation)</strong></td>\n<td>A TLS extension that allows a client and server to negotiate which application-layer protocol (like HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or WebSocket) will be used within a TLS connection before data transmission begins.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (TLS integration)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>backpressure</strong></td>\n<td>A flow control mechanism where a data consumer (like our event loop when writing to a slow client) signals to the producer (our application logic) to slow down or stop sending data because buffers are full and cannot be processed quickly enough.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (slow clients)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>bump-in-the-stack</strong></td>\n<td>A design pattern for implementing TLS/SSL where encryption/decryption is inserted as a layer between the raw socket I/O and the application protocol handler. The event loop sees encrypted bytes, but the protocol handler works with plaintext.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (protocol handler architecture)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>buffer management</strong></td>\n<td>The systematic approach to allocating, tracking, filling, and draining memory buffers used for reading from and writing to network sockets. This includes managing <code>read_buffer_used</code>, <code>write_buffer_used</code>, and <code>write_buffer_sent</code> fields in the <code>connection</code> struct.</td>\n<td>Data Model (connection fields)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>buffer watermark</strong></td>\n<td>A predetermined threshold (e.g., 80% full) within a buffer that triggers specific actions. For example, a write buffer reaching its high watermark might stop registering for <code>EPOLLOUT</code> to prevent busy loops, while dropping below a low watermark might re-enable it.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (flow control)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>C10K problem</strong></td>\n<td>The classic challenge of designing a network server capable of handling ten thousand concurrent connections efficiently on commodity hardware. It exposed the limitations of the thread-per-connection model and spurred the adoption of event-driven architectures and I/O multiplexing.</td>\n<td>Context and Problem Statement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>callback API</strong></td>\n<td>A programming interface where the application registers functions (callbacks) to be invoked by the framework when specific events occur (e.g., <code>http_handle_read</code> for <code>EPOLLIN</code>). This is the core of the Reactor pattern&#39;s inversion of control.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Async Task Scheduling)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>connection state machine</strong></td>\n<td>A finite state machine (FSM) that models the lifecycle of a network connection using states like <code>STATE_ACCEPTED</code>, <code>STATE_READING</code>, <code>STATE_WRITING</code>, and <code>STATE_CLOSING</code>. Transitions between states are driven by I/O events, timer expirations, and protocol logic.</td>\n<td>Data Model (state constants) &amp; Interactions and Data Flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CPU affinity</strong></td>\n<td>The practice of binding a specific thread or process to a particular CPU core (or set of cores). This can improve performance in multi-threaded reactors by reducing cache invalidation and context-switching overhead between cores.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (multi-threaded reactor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>edge-triggered</strong></td>\n<td>An event notification mode (set with <code>EPOLLET</code>) where <code>epoll</code> signals a file descriptor only when its I/O status <em>changes</em> (e.g., when data first becomes available). The application must assume it can read/write until it receives <code>EAGAIN</code>.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Event Loop - pitfalls)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>epoll</strong></td>\n<td>A Linux-specific I/O event notification facility that efficiently monitors multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them. It scales better than <code>select()</code> or <code>poll()</code> for large numbers of connections.</td>\n<td>Context and Problem Statement (comparison table)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>error categorization</strong></td>\n<td>The process of classifying system call errors (from <code>errno</code>) into categories like <code>ERROR_RETRYABLE</code> (<code>EAGAIN</code>), <code>ERROR_CONNECTION_FATAL</code> (<code>ECONNRESET</code>), and <code>ERROR_SYSTEM_FATAL</code> (<code>ENOMEM</code>) to determine the appropriate recovery action.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (error table)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>event loop</strong></td>\n<td>The central coordinating component of the Reactor pattern. It continuously waits for events (using <code>epoll_wait</code>), then dispatches them to registered handlers or callbacks. Also referred to as the &quot;reactor&quot; or &quot;dispatcher.&quot;</td>\n<td>High-Level Architecture (component diagram)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>event loop tick</strong></td>\n<td>A single complete iteration of the event loop&#39;s main cycle: calling <code>epoll_wait</code>, processing all returned I/O events, ticking the timer wheel to process expired timers, and executing any deferred tasks.</td>\n<td>Interactions and Data Flow (sequence diagram)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>finite state machine (FSM)</strong></td>\n<td>An abstract model of computation consisting of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions. Used extensively to model connection lifecycles and protocol parsing states (e.g., in <code>http_parser</code>).</td>\n<td>Data Model (connection states)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>half-closed connection</strong></td>\n<td>A TCP connection state where one endpoint has sent a FIN packet (indicating it has finished sending data) but is still willing to receive data from the other endpoint. This state must be handled correctly to avoid writing to a closed connection.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (edge cases)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>hierarchical timer wheel</strong></td>\n<td>A multi-level circular buffer data structure for managing large numbers of timers with O(1) amortized cost for insertion, deletion, and expiration. Higher levels represent larger time intervals (e.g., minutes), lower levels represent smaller ones (e.g., milliseconds).</td>\n<td>Component Design (Timer Wheel)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>HTTP keep-alive</strong></td>\n<td>An HTTP/1.1 feature that allows multiple request/response transactions to occur over a single TCP connection, reducing connection establishment overhead. The server must manage an idle timeout for these persistent connections.</td>\n<td>Component Design (HTTP Server)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>idle timeout</strong></td>\n<td>A timer associated with a connection that fires if no read or write activity occurs within a configured period (e.g., <code>IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS</code>). This prevents resource exhaustion from clients that connect but never send data (a &quot;slow loris&quot; attack pattern).</td>\n<td>Component Design (Timer Wheel - acceptance criteria)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>incremental processing</strong></td>\n<td>A design approach where data is processed as it arrives in chunks, rather than waiting for a complete message. Essential for non-blocking I/O, as a single <code>read()</code> may only deliver part of an HTTP request.</td>\n<td>Component Design (HTTP Server)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>I/O multiplexing</strong></td>\n<td>The capability of an operating system or system call to monitor multiple I/O sources (file descriptors) simultaneously and report which ones are ready for reading or writing. <code>epoll</code>, <code>select</code>, and <code>poll</code> are all I/O multiplexing mechanisms.</td>\n<td>Context and Problem Statement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>level-triggered</strong></td>\n<td>The default event notification mode for <code>epoll</code>. The kernel notifies the application that a file descriptor is ready for I/O for as long as the condition persists (e.g., data remains in the socket buffer). This can lead to repeated notifications if not handled.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Event Loop - pitfalls)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>monotonic clock</strong></td>\n<td>A system clock that continuously increases at a constant rate and is not affected by discontinuous jumps in system time (e.g., from NTP adjustments). Used for measuring intervals and timer expirations via <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code>.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Timer Wheel - implementation)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>MPSC (Multi Producer Single Consumer) ring buffer</strong></td>\n<td>A concurrent data structure where multiple threads (producers) can enqueue items, but only one thread (the consumer, typically the event loop) can dequeue them. Useful for passing tasks or connections between threads in a multi-threaded reactor.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (work-stealing)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>multi-threaded reactor</strong></td>\n<td>An extension of the Reactor pattern where multiple threads, each running its own event loop, work together to handle connections. Connections are distributed among the threads, often using techniques like <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> or a central acceptor.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>non-blocking I/O</strong></td>\n<td>A mode of socket operation where calls to <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, and <code>accept()</code> return immediately, either with the completed result or with an error (<code>EAGAIN</code>/<code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>) if the operation cannot be completed without waiting.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Event Loop)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>protocol handler interface</strong></td>\n<td>A common interface (represented by the <code>protocol_handler</code> struct) that abstracts the specifics of different application-layer protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, TLS). It allows the event loop to treat connections uniformly, delegating protocol logic to handler functions.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (protocol upgrades)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reactor pattern</strong></td>\n<td>An architectural pattern for event-driven applications. It demultiplexes incoming events (I/O, timers) and dispatches them synchronously to associated request handlers (callbacks). The pattern separates the mechanism of event detection from the application logic.</td>\n<td>High-Level Architecture (postal system analogy)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>slow loris attack</strong></td>\n<td>A denial-of-service attack that operates by opening many connections to a server and periodically sending small amounts of data to keep the connections open indefinitely, exhausting server resources. Defended against using aggressive idle timeouts.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (edge cases)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>SO_REUSEPORT</strong></td>\n<td>A socket option (<code>setsockopt(SO_REUSEPORT)</code>) that allows multiple sockets (typically in different processes or threads) to bind to the same IP address and port number. The kernel performs load balancing of incoming connections.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (multi-threaded reactor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>SPSC (Single Producer Single Consumer) ring buffer</strong></td>\n<td>A concurrent data structure optimized for the case where exactly one thread produces data and exactly one different thread consumes it. Often used for communication between an I/O thread and a worker thread with minimal locking.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (task queues)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>thread-local storage (TLS)</strong></td>\n<td>A mechanism for allocating variables that have a distinct instance for each thread. In a multi-threaded reactor, each thread&#39;s event loop state and connection tables can be stored in thread-local storage to avoid synchronization.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions (implementation notes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>timer cascading</strong></td>\n<td>The process in a hierarchical timer wheel where, as the current time pointer advances, timers that have &quot;overflowed&quot; from a higher-precision wheel level (e.g., milliseconds) are moved down to a lower-precision level (e.g., seconds) for future expiration checking.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Timer Wheel - algorithm)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>timer wheel</strong></td>\n<td>A data structure for efficient timer management, conceptually a circular buffer of linked lists. Each slot corresponds to a time interval. A pointer advances at a fixed &quot;tick,&quot; and all timers in the current slot expire.</td>\n<td>Component Design (Timer Wheel)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>work-stealing</strong></td>\n<td>A load balancing strategy used in concurrent systems where idle worker threads &quot;steal&quot; tasks from the queues of busy threads. This helps keep all threads utilized evenly and can improve throughput in a multi-threaded reactor.</td>\n<td>Future Extensions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>write timeout</strong></td>\n<td>A timer that fires if a write operation cannot make progress (i.e., the socket&#39;s send buffer remains full) within a specified period (e.g., <code>WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS</code>). This protects the server from extremely slow clients that cannot accept data.</td>\n<td>Error Handling and Edge Cases (slow clients)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>While the glossary defines concepts, this section provides concrete guidance on how these terms manifest in the codebase and how to navigate the implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>A.

It solves the C10K problem by implementing the Reactor pattern with non-blocking I/O, efficient timer management via a hierarchical timer wheel, and asynchronous task scheduling. The key architectural challenge is managing massive concurrency with low overhead and predictable latency without using threads.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (foundational understanding)\n\nThis section establishes why traditional server architectures fail at scale and introduces the fundamental concepts that enable handling 10,000+ concurrent connections with a single thread. We'll explore the limitations of thread-per-connection models, introduce the event-driven mental model through analogy, and compare the available I/O multiplexing technologies on Linux systems.\n\n### The C10K Problem and the Threading Bottleneck\n\nImagine a small post office with one clerk who can only serve one customer at a time. When a customer arrives, the clerk helps them completely—filling out forms, weighing packages, calculating postage—while other customers wait in line. This works fine when 5-10 customers arrive per hour, but completely collapses when 10,000 customers show up simultaneously. The clerk becomes overwhelmed, the line grows indefinitely, and most customers give up waiting. This is precisely what happens with **thread-per-connection** server architectures under high concurrency.\n\nIn traditional blocking I/O server designs, each incoming client connection spawns a new operating system thread (or process). This thread calls blocking system calls like `accept()`, `read()`, and `write()`, which cause the thread to enter a suspended state (\"blocked\") until data arrives or can be sent. While conceptually simple, this approach suffers from severe scalability limitations known as the **C10K problem** (handling ten thousand concurrent connections).\n\n> **Decision: Reject Thread-Per-Connection Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Need to handle 10,000+ concurrent connections with predictable latency and minimal resource overhead\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Thread-per-connection with blocking I/O\n>   2. Thread pool with blocking I/O\n>   3. Single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O\n> - **Decision**: Single-threaded event loop with non-blocking I/O\n> - **Rationale**: Thread-per-connection requires 10K threads, each with its own stack (typically 8MB), consuming ~80GB RAM just for stacks. Context switching between 10K threads introduces massive CPU overhead. Thread pools with blocking I/O still waste threads waiting on I/O, limiting concurrency to pool size\n> - **Consequences**: Must implement non-blocking I/O and event multiplexing; programming model becomes callback-driven rather than linear; must handle partial reads/writes explicitly\n\n| Bottleneck | Thread-Per-Connection Impact at 10K Connections | Technical Explanation |\n|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Memory Overhead** | 80-160 GB RAM for thread stacks alone | Each thread requires 8-16MB stack (default Linux pthread). 10K × 8MB = 80GB |\n| **Context Switch Overhead** | Millions of switches per second, >90% CPU wasted | OS scheduler must cycle through all runnable threads. Each switch flushes CPU caches, TLB, and registers |\n| **File Descriptor Limits** | Default system limits (1024) must be raised | Each connection consumes a file descriptor. 10K connections need adjusted `ulimit -n` and kernel parameters |\n| **Synchronization Complexity** | Lock contention increases super-linearly with threads | Shared data structures require locks. Probability of contention grows with thread count, causing serialization |\n| **Connection Setup Teardown** | Thread creation/destruction becomes bottleneck | `pthread_create()` and `pthread_join()` are expensive system calls at 10K scale |\n\nThe critical insight is that **threads are expensive when waiting**. A thread blocked in `read()` or `write()` is still consuming resources (memory, kernel structures) while doing no useful work. The fundamental solution is to separate the **waiting** from the **processing**—instead of having thousands of threads wait individually, have a single entity efficiently monitor thousands of connections and only wake up when there's actual work to do.\n\n### Event-Driven Architecture: The Postal System Analogy\n\nConsider a modern postal sorting facility with a single, highly efficient sorting machine (the event loop) and a team of specialized workers (callback handlers). Letters (I/O events) arrive continuously on conveyor belts (file descriptors). Rather than assigning one worker per letter to wait at each mailbox, the system works like this:\n\n1. **The Sorting Machine (epoll)** monitors hundreds of mailboxes simultaneously\n2. When a letter arrives in any mailbox, the machine detects it instantly\n3. The machine routes that specific letter to an available specialized worker\n4. The worker processes only that letter (reads address, applies postage)\n5. If the worker needs to wait for something (like a scale to become available), they don't block—they return the letter to the machine with a note saying \"notify me when the scale is free\"\n6. The worker immediately becomes available for other letters\n\nThis is the essence of the **Reactor pattern**—a single event loop dispatches events to appropriate handlers without blocking. The key components in our analogy map to system components:\n\n| Postal System Component | Event Loop Equivalent | Responsibility |\n|------------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Sorting Machine | `epoll` instance | Monitors multiple file descriptors for events |\n| Mailboxes | File descriptors (sockets) | Sources of I/O events (data arriving, space available) |\n| Letter with Data | Read/Write buffer | Application data to process or send |\n| Specialized Workers | Callback functions | Process specific types of events (HTTP, echo, etc.) |\n| \"Notify Me Later\" Notes | Event registration | Request to be notified when a specific condition occurs |\n\nThe mental model shift is from **\"one thread, one connection, linear execution\"** to **\"one loop, many connections, event-driven execution.\"** Instead of writing code that says \"read from this socket until we get a full HTTP request,\" we write: \"when data arrives on this socket, parse what you can; if you don't have a full request yet, ask to be notified when more data arrives.\"\n\n> **Key Insight**: The event loop's power comes from never waiting idly. It either processes ready events or sleeps efficiently in the kernel until events occur. This eliminates the resource waste of blocked threads while maintaining concurrency.\n\nThis architecture enables our single-threaded server to handle 10K+ connections because:\n- **Constant memory overhead**: ~1KB per connection for buffers/state vs. 8MB per thread\n- **Constant context switching**: Exactly one thread, so no user-space context switches\n- **Efficient waiting**: The kernel's `epoll_wait()` monitors all connections in one system call\n- **Predictable latency**: No lock contention or scheduler interference between connections\n\n### Comparison of I/O Multiplexing Approaches\n\nLinux offers several system calls for monitoring multiple file descriptors. Choosing the right one is critical for performance at scale. All these approaches follow the same basic pattern: tell the kernel which file descriptors to monitor and what events to watch for, then wait for something to happen.\n\n> **Decision: Use epoll for I/O Multiplexing**\n> - **Context**: Need to efficiently monitor 10,000+ file descriptors for read/write readiness on Linux\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. `select()` - POSIX standard, available everywhere\n>   2. `poll()` - Improved over select, but similar scalability issues\n>   3. `epoll()` - Linux-specific, designed for massive scalability\n>   4. `kqueue()` - BSD/macOS equivalent of epoll (not considered for Linux)\n> - **Decision**: `epoll` with edge-triggered mode (EPOLLET)\n> - **Rationale**: `select`/`poll` scan all file descriptors on every call (O(n)). With 10K FDs, this wastes CPU. `epoll` maintains kernel state and only returns changed FDs (O(1) for ready FDs). Edge-triggered mode reduces unnecessary wakeups\n> - **Consequences**: Linux-only; must handle EPOLLET semantics (read/write until EAGAIN); slightly more complex setup than select/poll\n\nThe following table compares the technical characteristics of each approach:\n\n| Characteristic | `select()` | `poll()` | `epoll()` (Level-Triggered) | `epoll()` (Edge-Triggered) |\n|----------------|------------|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Maximum FDs** | FD_SETSIZE (1024) | Limited by `ulimit -n` | Limited by `ulimit -n` | Limited by `ulimit -n` |\n| **Time Complexity** | O(n) scan all FDs each call | O(n) scan all FDs each call | O(1) for ready FDs | O(1) for ready FDs |\n| **Memory Usage** | Fixed-size bitmask | Array of struct pollfd | Kernel hash table + user array | Kernel hash table + user array |\n| **Trigger Mode** | Level-only (reports if ready) | Level-only (reports if ready) | Level (default) | Edge (EPOLLET flag) |\n| **FD Management** | Rebuild set each call | Rebuild array each call | Kernel-managed set (add/mod/del) | Kernel-managed set (add/mod/del) |\n| **Portability** | POSIX, everywhere | POSIX, most systems | Linux only | Linux only |\n| **Best For** | < 1000 FDs, portability | < 1000 FDs, >1024 FDs needed | 1000+ FDs, Linux only | 1000+ FDs, Linux, max performance |\n\n**Understanding Level vs. Edge Triggering**:\n- **Level-Triggered (default)**: \"Notify me while the condition is true.\" If data is available to read, you'll keep getting notified every event loop iteration until you read all data\n- **Edge-Triggered (EPOLLET)**: \"Notify me when the condition changes.\" You get notified once when data arrives, then not again until you read and get EAGAIN\n\nTo illustrate the performance difference, consider checking 10,000 mailboxes:\n- With `select`/`poll`: Walk past each of 10,000 mailboxes every time, checking if there's mail\n- With `epoll`: Get a list saying \"mailboxes 42, 317, and 5823 have new mail\"\n\n**Trigger Mode Implications**:\n\n| Trigger Mode | Pros | Cons | Required Handling Pattern |\n|--------------|------|------|---------------------------|\n| **Level-Triggered** | Simpler: won't miss events if you don't read all data immediately | More wakeups: get notified repeatedly while data remains | Can read partial data each time; loop continues while readable |\n| **Edge-Triggered** | Fewer wakeups: only notified on state changes | Complex: must read until EAGAIN to reset trigger | Must read/write in loop until EAGAIN; risk starvation if other FDs have data |\n\n> **Architecture Principle**: For our 10K+ connections target, we choose edge-triggered epoll. While more complex to implement correctly, it minimizes unnecessary event loop iterations when connections have continuous data flow. The key is ensuring we always read/write until EAGAIN when notified.\n\n**Why Not Just Use Threads with epoll?**\nMulti-threaded epoll designs (one epoll per thread) can scale beyond single-core limits, but they introduce synchronization complexity that's beyond our learning scope. Our single-threaded design establishes the foundational pattern—the reactor core—which can later be extended to multiple threads (one event loop per CPU core) in a production system.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Conceptual Understanding**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Believing \"Non-Blocking\" Means \"Zero Wait\"**\n- **Description**: Assuming non-blocking I/O eliminates all waiting time\n- **Why It's Wrong**: Non-blocking calls return immediately regardless of data availability, but the event loop still sleeps in `epoll_wait()` when nothing is ready. The difference is fine-grained waiting (per FD) vs. coarse waiting (per thread)\n- **Fix**: Understand that `epoll_wait()` is still a blocking call (with timeout), but it blocks on ALL monitored FDs simultaneously, not individually\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Confusing Concurrency with Parallelism**\n- **Description**: Expecting 10K connections to be processed simultaneously\n- **Why It's Wrong**: Single-threaded event loops process one event at a time. Concurrency means making progress on many tasks interleaved, not simultaneously. While processing one connection's data, others wait in the queue\n- **Fix**: Design handlers to be short and non-blocking. Defer expensive work to timer callbacks or task queues to avoid starving other connections\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overlooking the Cost of System Calls**\n- **Description**: Thinking epoll eliminates all overhead\n- **Why It's Wrong**: Each `epoll_ctl()` (add/modify/delete FD) is a system call with context switch cost. With 10K connections churning rapidly, this becomes significant\n- **Fix**: Batch FD modifications where possible; reuse connections (HTTP keep-alive); design protocols to minimize connection churn\n\nThe transition from thread-per-connection to event-driven architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we think about server programming. Instead of \"who does this work?\" (which thread), we focus on \"when does this work happen?\" (in response to which event). This event-driven mindset, combined with Linux's `epoll` mechanism, enables our single-threaded server to handle massive concurrency within practical resource limits.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints (C)**\n\n- **Error Handling**: Always check `errno` after system call failures. `EINTR` means interrupted by signal and usually should be retried\n- **Memory Management**: Use `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for structures to ensure zero initialization of padding bytes\n- **Epoll Flags**: `EPOLL_CLOEXEC` ensures the epoll FD is closed on `exec()` calls. Always use it with `epoll_create1()`\n- **Event Data**: Store connection context in `epoll_event.data.ptr`, not `data.fd`, to pass rich context to handlers\n- **File Descriptor Limits**: Call `getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, ...)` and `setrlimit()` early to ensure enough FDs for 10K connections\n\n**F.

Establishing clear boundaries is critical for a learning-focused project—it prevents scope creep while ensuring the architecture remains focused on solving the fundamental C10K problem using the **Reactor pattern**. The goals directly map to the four project milestones, creating a cohesive learning path from basic event-driven I/O to a complete, scalable HTTP server.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe system must deliver four interconnected capabilities that collectively demonstrate mastery of high-concurrency server design. Each goal addresses a specific architectural challenge identified in the C10K problem.\n\n| Goal | Architectural Challenge Addressed | Key Capabilities | Primary Milestone |\n|------|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **Handle 10K+ concurrent connections** | Resource exhaustion from thread-per-connection models | Single-threaded **event loop** with `epoll`, non-blocking I/O, O(1) event dispatch | Milestone 1, 4 |\n| **Support idle timeouts** | Connection resource leakage from stale or slow clients | Hierarchical **timer wheel** with O(1) insertion/deletion, integrated timeout propagation | Milestone 2 |\n| **Provide a callback API** | Complexity of raw event loop programming | **Reactor pattern** abstraction with callback registration for I/O and timer events | Milestone 3 |\n| **Include an HTTP server example** | Practical application of event-driven architecture | Incremental HTTP/1.1 parser, write buffer management, keep-alive support | Milestone 4 |\n\n#### Goal 1: Handle 10K+ Concurrent Connections\nThe primary objective is to demonstrate that a single-threaded, event-driven server can maintain **10,000+ simultaneous TCP connections** with predictable latency and minimal resource overhead. This directly tackles the C10K problem's core constraint: traditional operating systems cannot efficiently schedule 10,000 threads. The system achieves this through:\n\n- **Linux `epoll` for I/O multiplexing**: Unlike `select()` or `poll()`, `epoll` uses O(1) event notification regardless of connection count, avoiding the linear scan overhead that breaks at scale.\n- **Non-blocking I/O on all sockets**: Every file descriptor—including the listening socket—must be set to non-blocking mode using `fcntl(O_NONBLOCK)`. This ensures the single thread never blocks on `accept()`, `read()`, or `write()` operations.\n- **Level-triggered event notification**: While edge-triggered (`EPOLLET`) can be more efficient, level-triggered mode simplifies correctness for learners by ensuring events re-fire if data remains unprocessed. The architecture must handle both models correctly.\n- **Efficient memory per connection**: Each connection should maintain only necessary state (socket descriptor, read/write buffers, timer reference) in a compact `struct connection` to minimize memory footprint.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Single-threaded event loop over multi-threaded reactor**\n> - **Context**: The C10K problem demonstrates that thread-per-connection models exhaust memory and CPU due to stack overhead and context switching. We need maximum connection density with minimal overhead.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Single-threaded event loop**: One thread handles all I/O, timers, and callbacks.\n>   2. **Multi-threaded reactor**: One acceptor thread dispatches connections to worker threads, each with its own `epoll` instance.\n>   3. **Thread pool with work stealing**: Fixed thread pool processes events from a shared queue.\n> - **Decision**: Single-threaded event loop.\n> - **Rationale**: For the learning objective—understanding the Reactor pattern fundamentals—a single-threaded model eliminates concurrency complexity (locking, race conditions) while demonstrating the raw efficiency possible with `epoll`. It achieves the highest connection density per CPU core, which is the essence of solving C10K. Multi-threaded variants add complexity without changing the fundamental event-driven paradigm.\n> - **Consequences**: The server cannot utilize multiple CPU cores. All processing—including HTTP parsing—must be non-blocking and efficient to avoid stalling the event loop. This constraint reinforces careful design of incremental processing.\n\n#### Goal 2: Support Idle Timeouts\nLong-lived connections must be automatically cleaned up after periods of inactivity to prevent resource exhaustion from abandoned or idle clients. The system requires a timeout mechanism that:\n\n- **Closes connections after configurable idle periods** (e.g., 30 seconds without read/write activity).\n- **Integrates seamlessly with the event loop** without requiring separate threads or periodic signals.\n- **Provides O(1) timer operations** to avoid degrading performance as connection count grows.\n- **Allows timer cancellation** when connections become active again (resetting the idle timeout).\n\nThe **hierarchical timer wheel** data structure meets these requirements by organizing timers into multiple levels of increasing granularity (e.g., milliseconds, seconds, minutes), enabling constant-time insertion and expiration processing.\n\n#### Goal 3: Provide a Callback API\nRaw `epoll` programming requires manual management of file descriptor registration and event masks. The system must abstract these details behind a clean **Reactor pattern** API that:\n\n- **Allows registration of callback functions** for `EPOLLIN` (read-ready) and `EPOLLOUT` (write-ready) events.\n- **Supports timer callbacks** for one-shot and repeating operations.\n- **Manages a deferred task queue** for work that should execute after I/O processing in the current event loop iteration.\n- **Hides `epoll` system call details** behind intuitive functions like `event_loop_register_fd()` and `event_loop_run()`.\n\nThis abstraction transforms the event loop from a fragile, low-level construct into a reusable framework for building various protocol servers.\n\n#### Goal 4: Include an HTTP Server Example\nThe theoretical architecture must be validated with a practical, benchmarkable implementation. An HTTP/1.1 server serves as the canonical demonstration because:\n\n- **HTTP is a well-understood protocol** with clear request/response semantics.\n- **It exercises all event loop components**: non-blocking reads/writes, incremental parsing, buffer management, timer-based keep-alive, and callback dispatch.\n- **It provides measurable performance metrics** for the 10K goal via tools like `ab` (Apache Bench) or `wrk`.\n\nThe HTTP implementation must handle real-world complexities: requests split across multiple TCP packets, slow clients that can't consume responses quickly, and persistent connections with proper idle timeout management.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\nExplicitly defining what the system does **not** do is equally important for maintaining focus and setting learner expectations. These boundaries acknowledge practical production considerations while keeping the project achievable within its educational scope.\n\n| Non-Goal | Reason for Exclusion | Alternative/Consideration |\n|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Multi-threading or multi-process architecture** | Adds significant complexity (locking, synchronization) that distracts from core event-driven principles. The goal is to master single-threaded concurrency first. | For production, a multi-threaded reactor (one `epoll` instance per CPU core) is the logical next step after understanding this foundation. |\n| **Full HTTP/2 protocol support** | HTTP/2 introduces binary framing, multiplexing, and flow control that require substantial additional implementation. | The event loop framework could support HTTP/2, but implementing the full protocol exceeds the scope of learning epoll fundamentals. |\n| **SSL/TLS encryption** | TLS adds complex handshaking, renegotiation, and record layer processing that obscures the core I/O multiplexing concepts. | In production, TLS termination is often handled by a dedicated proxy (nginx) or library (OpenSSL with async mode). |\n| **Production-grade connection pooling** | Connection pooling involves health checks, load balancing, and failover mechanisms that are orthogonal to the event loop itself. | The architecture focuses on handling connections, not managing pools between services. |\n| **Advanced load balancing or service discovery** | These are distributed systems concerns that build upon, rather than comprise, the event loop pattern. | The event loop could be used within each node of a load-balanced cluster. |\n| **Windows compatibility or cross-platform I/O multiplexing** | The project specifically targets Linux's `epoll` as the learning vehicle. | Production code might use abstraction libraries (libuv) but understanding the underlying OS mechanism is the educational goal. |\n| **Comprehensive security hardening** | While basic error handling is required, full security audit (buffer overflow prevention, input validation) exceeds the scope. | Learners should apply security best practices but the focus remains on architecture and performance. |\n| **Database integration or business logic** | The server is a platform for connection management, not a full application framework. | The callback API could dispatch to business logic, but implementing such logic is beyond the C10K focus. |\n\n#### Why These Boundaries Matter\nEach non-goal represents a legitimate production concern that has been intentionally deferred:\n\n> **Design Principle: Focus on the Pattern, Not the Production Features**\n> \n> The event loop is a **foundational pattern** that enables high-concurrency servers. By excluding multi-threading, TLS, and HTTP/2, we isolate and master this pattern in its purest form. Once understood, these extensions become incremental additions rather than overwhelming complexities. For example:\n> - **Multi-threading** can be added by creating multiple event loop threads (one per CPU core) with load-balanced accept.\n> - **TLS** can be integrated using OpenSSL's asynchronous mode with `SSL_read()` and `SSL_write()` returning `SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE`.\n> - **HTTP/2** could be implemented atop the same event loop by replacing the HTTP/1.1 parser with a state machine for binary frames.\n>\n> The architecture is deliberately **extensible at its boundaries**—the callback API, timer system, and buffer management all provide hooks for these future enhancements without redesign.\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Scope Interpretation\nLearners often misunderstand these boundaries, leading to two counterproductive extremes:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-engineering toward production readiness**\n- **Mistake**: Attempting to implement multi-threading, TLS, or connection pooling before mastering the single-threaded event loop.\n- **Why it's wrong**: These features introduce complexity that obscures the core learning objectives. Debugging race conditions in a multi-threaded event loop is vastly harder than understanding a single-threaded one.\n- **How to avoid**: Strictly follow the milestone sequence. Complete all four milestones with a single-threaded, plain TCP/HTTP server before considering extensions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Underestimating the HTTP server complexity**\n- **Mistake**: Treating the HTTP server as a trivial addition after the event loop works for echo servers.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Real HTTP requires incremental parsing, header validation, chunked encoding, and proper response buffering—all of which exercise subtle aspects of non-blocking I/O and state management.\n- **How to avoid**: Allocate significant time for Milestone 4. The HTTP implementation should be treated as a first-class component, not an afterthought.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations Table:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option (Learning Focus) | Advanced Option (Extension) |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **I/O Multiplexing** | `epoll` with level-triggered mode | `epoll` with edge-triggered mode + `EPOLLONESHOT` |\n| **Timer Management** | Hierarchical timer wheel (4-level) | Min-heap for exact timers + timerfd for kernel integration |\n| **HTTP Parsing** | Handwritten incremental state machine | `http-parser` library (node.js parser in C) |\n| **Buffering** | Per-connection read/write ring buffers | Scatter/gather I/O with `readv()`/`writev()` |\n| **Concurrency Model** | Single-threaded reactor | Multi-threaded acceptor + workers (thread pool) |\n\n**Recommended File/Module Structure:**\n```\nevent-loop-project/\n├── include/\n│   ├── event_loop.h      # Core event loop types and API\n│   ├── timer_wheel.h     # Timer wheel data structure\n│   ├── connection.h      # Connection state management\n│   └── http_server.h     # HTTP protocol handler\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.c            # Server entry point\n│   ├── event_loop.c      # epoll event loop implementation (Milestone 1, 3)\n│   ├── timer_wheel.c     # Hierarchical timer wheel (Milestone 2)\n│   ├── connection.c      # Connection lifecycle and buffers\n│   ├── http_parser.c     # Incremental HTTP/1.1 parser (Milestone 4)\n│   ├── http_response.c   # HTTP response generation\n│   └── utils.c           # Non-blocking socket helpers\n├── tests/\n│   ├── test_timer_wheel.c\n│   ├── test_http_parser.c\n│   └── integration_test.c\n└── benchmarks/\n    └── c10k_benchmark.c  # 10K connection stress test\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\nComplete helper functions for non-blocking socket operations:\n\n```c\n// utils.c -

10K Connections**: Run `./server` and use a load testing tool to establish 10,000 concurrent connections:\n   ```bash\n   # In one terminal\n   ./server --port 8080\n   \n   # In another, using Python\n   python3 -c \"import socket; [socket.socket().connect(('localhost', 8080)) for _ in range(10000)]\"\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Server should accept all connections without crashing, memory usage should be ~20-30MB (not gigabytes), and CPU should be idle after connections are established.\n\n2. **Milestone 2 - Idle Timeouts**: Connect with `telnet localhost 8080`, don't send any data for 30 seconds:\n   ```bash\n   telnet localhost 8080\n   # (wait 30 seconds without typing)\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Connection should automatically close after the idle timeout. Check server logs for timeout messages.\n\n3. **Milestone 3 - Callback API**: Write a test program that registers read/write callbacks:\n   ```c\n   void on_read(int fd, void* data) { printf(\"FD %d is readable\\n\", fd); }\n   event_loop_register_callback(loop, fd, EPOLLIN, on_read, NULL);\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Callback fires when data arrives on the socket. No raw `epoll` handling visible in user code.\n\n4. **Milestone 4 - HTTP Server**: Benchmark with Apache Bench:\n   ```bash\n   ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/test\n   ```\n   **Expected**: All requests complete successfully with latency < 100ms for 95th percentile. Server maintains 10K concurrent HTTP keep-alive connections.\n\n**Debugging Tips Table:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| CPU at 100% in event loop | `epoll_wait` returning immediately with no events | Check if timeout_ms = 0 (non-blocking mode) or events being constantly re-triggered | Use proper timeout, ensure level-triggered events are handled completely |\n| Connections stuck at 1024 | Hit default `epoll` instance limit | Check `cat /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches` | Increase limit: `sysctl -w fs.epoll.max_user_watches=100000` |\n| Timer not firing | Timer wheel not being advanced | Log timer wheel tick count; check if `epoll_wait` timeout is too large | Ensure `timeout_ms` in `event_loop_run` is min(next_timer_expiration, default) |\n| Memory leak with 10K connections | Connection structures not freed on close | Use `valgrind --leak-check=full ./server` | Ensure `close(fd)` and free connection struct in all code paths (timeout, client close, error) |\n| HTTP requests truncated | Read buffer too small or not handling partial reads | Log bytes read per `read()` call; check for `EAGAIN` | Increase buffer size, keep reading until `EAGAIN` in read callback |\n\n---\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nThis section provides the **bird's-eye view** of the event loop system's architecture—how all components fit together, their responsibilities, and the flow of data between them. Think of this as the **blueprint** for the entire project. Before diving into each component's internal details, we need to understand the overall structure and the **division of responsibilities** that enables handling 10,000+ connections in a single thread.\n\n### Component Diagram and Data Flow\n\nImagine the event loop system as a **high-efficiency post office** running with a single postal worker (the main thread). The postal worker doesn't wait at each mailbox for letters to arrive—instead, they monitor a centralized **notification board** (`epoll`) that lights up when any mailbox has incoming mail (read events) or is ready to accept outgoing mail (write events). The worker also wears a **multi-alarm wristwatch** (timer wheel) that buzzes at precise intervals to remind them to clean up abandoned mailboxes (idle timeouts). This mental model captures the essence of the Reactor pattern: a single thread efficiently dispatches work triggered by external events.\n\nThe system comprises four main components that work together:\n\n| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Data Structures | Analogy |\n|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| **Event Loop (Reactor Core)** | Monitors file descriptors for I/O readiness using `epoll`, dispatches events to registered callbacks | `event_loop`, `epoll_event` | Postal notification board |\n| **Timer Wheel** | Manages timeout events with O(1) efficiency, integrated with the event loop's wait timeout | Hierarchical wheel slots, `timer` entries | Multi-alarm wristwatch |\n| **Async Task Queue** | Schedules deferred callbacks for execution after I/O processing, enables clean API | Task queue, callback registry | Worker's todo list |\n| **Protocol Handlers** | Implement application logic (e.g., HTTP) using non-blocking I/O and incremental parsing | `connection`, protocol-specific state | Mail sorting and processing rules |\n\nThese components interact through a well-defined data flow, illustrated in the system overview:\n\n![System Component Overview](./diagrams/diagram-1.svg)\n\n**Data Flow Through the System:**\n\n1. **Incoming Network Traffic** → The operating system's network stack receives packets and buffers data for sockets. When data arrives or a socket becomes writable, the kernel updates its internal readiness state.\n\n2. **Event Detection (`epoll`)** → The `event_loop` calls `epoll_wait()` to query which file descriptors have pending I/O operations. The kernel returns an array of `epoll_event` structures, each containing the file descriptor and event type (`EPOLLIN`, `EPOLLOUT`, etc.).\n\n3. **Event Dispatch** → For each ready file descriptor, the event loop looks up the associated `connection` context (via the `user_data` pointer in the `epoll_event`), then invokes the appropriate callback function registered for that event type.\n\n4. **Protocol Processing** → The callback (typically part of a protocol handler like HTTP) performs non-blocking I/O operations (`read()`, `write()`). If an operation would block (`EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`), it registers for the corresponding event and continues later. This enables **incremental processing**—handling partial data as it arrives.\n\n5. **Timer Integration** → Before each `epoll_wait()` call, the event loop queries the timer wheel for the next expiration time and uses it as the timeout parameter. When `epoll_wait()` returns, the event loop \"ticks\" the timer wheel, executing any expired timer callbacks (e.g., closing idle connections).\n\n6. **Deferred Task Execution** → After processing all I/O events and timers, the event loop executes any tasks in the async task queue. This ensures that callback registrations/modifications don't interfere with the current event iteration.\n\n> **Decision: Component Separation and Single-Threaded Reactor**\n> - **Context**: We need to handle 10K+ connections with minimal overhead while keeping the codebase maintainable and extensible. The system must support multiple protocols (echo, HTTP) and efficient timeout management.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Monolithic event loop**: All logic (I/O, timers, protocol) in one massive function.\n>   2. **Thread-per-component**: Separate threads for I/O multiplexing, timer management, and protocol processing.\n>   3. **Single-threaded Reactor with separated concerns**: One thread with cleanly separated components communicating through callbacks and shared state.\n> - **Decision**: Single-threaded Reactor with separated concerns.\n> - **Rationale**: \n>   - Monolithic code becomes unmaintainable and difficult to test.\n>   - Thread-per-component introduces synchronization overhead and complexity for 10K connections, negating the efficiency gains of event-driven architecture.\n>   - Separated concerns in a single thread maintain the performance benefits of no locking while enabling modular testing and clear responsibility boundaries.\n> - **Consequences**:\n>   - Enables clean API boundaries and unit testing of individual components.\n>   - Requires careful design to avoid blocking operations in any component (would stall entire system).\n>   - Callbacks must be non-blocking and execute quickly to maintain responsiveness.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |\n|--------|------|------|----------------|\n| Monolithic event loop | Simple initial implementation | Hard to extend, test, or debug; violates SRP | Becomes technical debt at scale |\n| Thread-per-component | Parallel processing, natural isolation | Synchronization overhead, context switching costs, complex error handling | Defeats purpose of efficient single-threaded C10K solution |\n| Single-threaded Reactor with separation | Clean architecture, testable, maintains performance | Requires disciplined non-blocking code | **CHOSEN**: Best balance of performance and maintainability |\n\nThe **key architectural insight** is that all components share the same execution thread but have distinct responsibilities. The event loop owns the `epoll` file descriptor and dispatch logic. The timer wheel owns timeout tracking. Protocol handlers own connection state and parsing logic. They communicate through function pointers (callbacks) and shared context structures, avoiding the need for locks.\n\n### Recommended File/Module Structure\n\nOrganizing code for clarity and maintainability is crucial for a learning project. The recommended structure follows the **component separation** principle, with each major component living in its own pair of header and implementation files. This modular approach allows you to work on one milestone at a time while maintaining a clean architecture.\n\n**Project Directory Layout:**\n\n```\nevent-loop-epoll-project/\n├── include/                    # Public header files\n│   ├── event_loop.h           # Event loop API and types\n│   ├── timer_wheel.h          # Timer wheel API and types\n│   ├── connection.h           # Connection context structure\n│   └── http_server.h          # HTTP server API\n├── src/                       # Implementation source files\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── event_loop.c       # Event loop implementation (Milestone 1)\n│   │   ├── timer_wheel.c      # Timer wheel implementation (Milestone 2)\n│   │   └── connection.c       # Connection buffer management\n│   ├── networking/\n│   │   ├── socket_utils.c     # Non-blocking socket helpers\n│   │   └── listening_socket.c # Listening socket setup\n│   ├── protocols/\n│   │   ├── echo_handler.c     # Simple echo protocol (Milestone 1)\n│   │   └── http_handler.c     # HTTP/1.1 server (Milestone 4)\n│   └── utils/\n│       ├── task_queue.c       # Async task queue (Milestone 3)\n│       └── logging.c          # Debug logging utilities\n├── tests/                     # Unit and integration tests\n│   ├── test_timer_wheel.c\n│   ├── test_event_loop.c\n│   └── test_http_parser.c\n├── examples/                  # Example programs\n│   ├── echo_server.c          # Complete echo server using the framework\n│   └── http_server.c          # Complete HTTP server (Milestone 4)\n├── benchmarks/                # Performance tests\n│   └── c10k_benchmark.c       # 10K connection benchmark\n└── Makefile                   # Build system\n```\n\n**File-to-Component Mapping:**\n\n| File | Component | Key Functions | Milestone |\n|------|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n| `src/core/event_loop.c` | Event Loop | `event_loop_create`, `event_loop_register_fd`, `event_loop_run` | 1, 3 |\n| `src/core/timer_wheel.c` | Timer Wheel | `timer_wheel_create`, `timer_wheel_add`, `timer_wheel_tick` | 2 |\n| `src/core/connection.c` | Connection Management | `connection_create`, `connection_read`, `connection_write` | 1, 4 |\n| `src/utils/task_queue.c` | Async Task Queue | `task_queue_push`, `task_queue_execute_all` | 3 |\n| `src/protocols/http_handler.c` | HTTP Protocol Handler | `http_handle_read`, `http_handle_write`, `http_parse_incremental` | 4 |\n\n> **Decision: Directory Structure by Concern**\n> - **Context**: We need to organize C code for a multi-component system that learners will implement incrementally across four milestones.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Flat structure**: All `.c` and `.h` files in one directory.\n>   2. **Structure by milestone**: Separate directories for each milestone's code.\n>   3. **Structure by component/concern**: Group files by architectural component (core, networking, protocols, utils).\n> - **Decision**: Structure by component/concern.\n> - **Rationale**:\n>   - Flat structure becomes chaotic with 10+ files and doesn't reflect architectural boundaries.\n>   - Structure by milestone creates artificial barriers and makes code reuse between milestones difficult.\n>   - Structure by component mirrors the architectural design, makes dependencies clear, and facilitates independent testing of each component.\n> - **Consequences**:\n>   - Learners must understand the build system (Makefile) to compile across directories.\n>   - Clear separation encourages thinking in terms of APIs between components.\n>   - Natural organization for growing the project with additional protocols (WebSocket, custom protocols).\n\n**Header File Dependencies:**\n\nThe header files create a clean API boundary between components. Here's how they depend on each other:\n\n```\nevent_loop.h  ← (includes) → connection.h, timer_wheel.h (for integration)\ntimer_wheel.h ← standalone, no external dependencies\nconnection.h  ← standalone, defines core data structure\nhttp_server.h ← (includes) → event_loop.h, connection.h (uses the framework)\n```\n\nThis dependency structure means:\n- The **event loop** knows about connections and timer wheel for integration.\n- **Protocol handlers** depend on the event loop API but not vice versa (loose coupling).\n- The **timer wheel** is independent and can be tested in isolation.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Project Organization:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circular Header Dependencies**\n- **Description**: Creating header files that include each other (e.g., `event_loop.h` includes `http_server.h`, which includes `event_loop.h`).\n- **Why it's wrong**: Causes compilation failures, unclear ownership, and tight coupling between components.\n- **How to fix**: Design a clear dependency hierarchy. Use forward declarations (`struct connection;`) when types are referenced but not fully defined. The event loop framework should not include protocol-specific headers.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Global Variables for Shared State**\n- **Description**: Using global variables for event loop instance, timer wheel, or connection table.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Makes testing difficult, prevents multiple instances, and creates hidden dependencies.\n- **How to fix**: Pass component instances as parameters. The `event_loop_run()` function should take a `struct event_loop*` parameter, not rely on a global.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mixing Platform-Specific Code with Core Logic**\n- **Description**: Putting `#ifdef LINUX` or `#ifdef MACOS` directly in the event loop core logic.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Reduces readability and makes porting harder.\n- **How to fix**: Isolate platform-specific code in wrapper functions (e.g., `socket_utils.c` for `set_nonblocking()`). The event loop should call `epoll_wait()` directly (it's Linux-specific by design), but other platform concerns are isolated.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance provides the **starter code** and **skeleton structure** to begin implementing the architecture. Since the primary language is C, we'll focus on establishing the foundational files and types.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints for C:**\n\n1. **Memory Management**: Always check `malloc()` return values. Use `valgrind` to detect memory leaks during development.\n2. **Error Handling**: Check all system call returns. Use `perror()` for debugging, but implement proper error recovery in production code.\n3. **Non-blocking I/O**: After `read()` or `write()` returns `-1`, check `errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK` to distinguish actual errors from \"would block\" conditions.\n4. **Build Dependencies**: Use `-D_GNU_SOURCE` in `CFLAGS` to enable Linux-specific features like `EPOLL_CLOEXEC` and `accept4()`.\n5. **Type Safety**: Use `void*` for user data in callbacks, but cast back to specific types (e.g., `struct connection*`) inside callbacks with clear documentation.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint for High-Level Structure:**\n\nAfter setting up the project structure and creating the skeleton files:\n\n1. **Build the project**: Run `make` in the project root directory.\n   - **Expected**: Successful compilation with warnings but no errors.\n   - **Signs of trouble**: Missing header files, undefined references, or syntax errors.\n\n2. **Verify header dependencies**: Create a simple `test.c` that includes all headers:\n   ```c\n   #include \"event_loop.h\"\n   #include \"timer_wheel.h\"\n   #include \"connection.h\"\n   int main() { return 0; }\n   ```\n   Compile with `gcc -I./include -c test.c`.\n   - **Expected**: Clean compilation.\n   - **Signs of trouble**: Circular dependencies or missing forward declarations.\n\n3. **Run basic example**: Implement a minimal `event_loop_create()` and compile an empty echo server skeleton.\n   - **Command**: `make echo_server` (should link successfully even with stub implementations).\n   - **Next step**: The echo server won't work yet, but the build system should be functional.\n\nThis foundation establishes the architectural boundaries and file structure. Each subsequent milestone will flesh out the components within this organized framework, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainable code growth.\n\n\n## Data Model\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nThis section defines the **core data structures** that make the event loop work efficiently at scale. Think of these structures as the DNA of your server—they encode how connections are tracked, how timeouts are managed, and how events trigger callbacks. The design must balance memory efficiency against fast access, since at 10,000+ connections, even small per-connection overhead compounds dramatically.\n\n### Core Types: Connection, Timer, Callback\n\nAt the heart of any event-driven server are three fundamental concepts: **connections** representing active client sockets, **timers** for scheduling future events, and **callbacks** as the glue that connects I/O events to your application logic. The data structures for these must support all the operations the event loop needs while minimizing memory fragmentation and pointer chasing.\n\n#### Connection Structure\n\nImagine each connection as a **work-in-progress envelope** at a postal sorting facility. The envelope has designated slots for incoming data (read buffer) and outgoing data (write buffer), a tracking number (file descriptor), a status indicator (state), and a timer reference that says when this envelope will be discarded if no activity occurs. This self-contained design allows the event loop to process thousands of connections without maintaining separate lookup tables.\n\n> **Decision: Unified Connection Context Object**\n> - **Context**: We need to associate application state with each file descriptor registered with epoll. When `epoll_wait` returns an event, we must quickly access all relevant state for that connection.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Separate Hash Table**: Store connection state in a hash table keyed by file descriptor, with epoll events only carrying the fd.\n>   2. **Embedded Pointer**: Store connection pointer directly in epoll's `data.ptr` field.\n>   3. **File Descriptor as Index**: Use fd as an index into a pre-allocated array of connection objects.\n> - **Decision**: Use embedded pointer (option 2) with a unified `connection` structure.\n> - **Rationale**: The `epoll_event.data.ptr` field provides O(1) access without additional lookups. This eliminates hash collisions and extra memory accesses. The unified structure keeps all related data in one cache-friendly allocation.\n> - **Consequences**: Connection objects must be allocated/freed carefully to avoid dangling pointers. The pointer remains valid until explicitly removed from epoll and freed.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `fd` | `int` | The file descriptor for the socket. This is the primary identifier for the connection at the OS level. |\n| `read_buffer` | `char*` | Pointer to dynamically allocated buffer for incoming data. Sized by `READ_BUFFER_SIZE` (typically 4KB). |\n| `write_buffer` | `char*` | Pointer to dynamically allocated buffer for outgoing data. Sized by `WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE` (typically 4KB). |\n| `timer_ref` | `void*` | Opaque reference to a timer in the timer wheel, used for cancelling idle timeouts when activity occurs. |\n| `state` | `int` | Current protocol state (e.g., `STATE_READING`, `STATE_WRITING`, `STATE_CLOSING`). Helps manage connection lifecycle. |\n| `read_buffer_used` | `int` | Number of valid bytes currently in `read_buffer`. Tracks how much data has arrived but not yet processed. |\n| `write_buffer_used` | `int` | Number of bytes to send currently in `write_buffer`. Total data queued for writing. |\n| `write_buffer_sent` | `int` | Number of bytes from `write_buffer` already written to socket. Used for partial writes with `EPOLLOUT`. |\n\n> **Critical Insight**: The `timer_ref` field creates a **bidirectional link** between connections and timers. When data arrives, we can cancel the old idle timeout and schedule a new one without searching the timer wheel. This is essential for O(1) timeout reset operations.\n\n#### Timer Structure\n\nTimers are like **kitchen timer dials** in a large restaurant kitchen. Each dial has a specific expiration time and is linked to a particular dish (connection). The hierarchical timer wheel organizes these dials into slots based on when they'll ring. The timer structure itself just needs to know when it expires, what function to call, and what connection it belongs to.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `expires_at` | `uint64_t` | Absolute expiration time in milliseconds since an arbitrary epoch (typically server start). Used for ordering and comparison. |\n| `callback` | `timer_callback_t` | Function pointer to call when timer expires. Signature: `void (*)(void* user_data)`. |\n| `user_data` | `void*` | Argument passed to callback, usually a pointer to the associated `connection`. |\n| `next` | `struct timer*` | Pointer to next timer in the same slot (linked list for collision resolution). |\n\n**Design Rationale for Linked List Chaining**: The timer wheel uses a hash table with separate chaining. Each wheel slot holds a linked list of timers that expire in that time range. This approach handles hash collisions gracefully and maintains O(1) average insertion/deletion when combined with the hierarchical wheel algorithm.\n\n#### Callback Registration Pattern\n\nWhile there's no single `callback` structure, the system uses a **registration pattern** where callbacks are associated with file descriptors through the `connection` object and with timers through the `timer` structure. Think of this as **event subscriptions**—you're telling the event loop: \"When this socket becomes readable, call my read handler; when this timer expires, call my timeout handler.\"\n\n**Callback Types in the System**:\n1. **I/O Callbacks**: Functions registered via `event_loop_register_fd()` that get called when `EPOLLIN` or `EPOLLOUT` events occur.\n2. **Timer Callbacks**: Functions attached to `timer` objects that execute when `expires_at` is reached.\n3. **Deferred Tasks**: Functions placed in a queue to execute in the next event loop iteration (not associated with specific FDs or timers).\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Callback Lifetime Management**\n> **Mistake**: Storing direct pointers to stack-allocated data in `user_data` fields.\n> **Why it's wrong**: When a connection closes and its `connection` object is freed, any pending timer or callback that references it will cause a use-after-free crash.\n> **How to fix**: Use **reference counting** or ensure all timers are cancelled before freeing connection objects. The `timer_ref` field allows cancellation before `connection_destroy()`.\n\n### Event Loop State and Timer Wheel Slots\n\n#### Event Loop State Structure\n\nThe `event_loop` is the **central dispatcher**—like an air traffic control tower that monitors all runways (file descriptors) and directs planes (connections) when they're ready for takeoff or landing. This structure holds the epoll instance, the array for returned events, and control flags.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `epoll_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for the epoll instance created with `epoll_create1()`. All monitored FDs are registered here. |\n| `events` | `struct epoll_event*` | Dynamically allocated array of epoll events returned by `epoll_wait()`. Sized by `max_events`. |\n| `max_events` | `int` | Maximum number of events `epoll_wait()` can return per call. Typically set to expected maximum concurrent connections. |\n| `running` | `int` | Boolean flag (0/1) indicating whether the event loop should continue running. Set to 0 to initiate graceful shutdown. |\n| `timer_wheel` | `struct timer_wheel*` | Pointer to the hierarchical timer wheel instance. Integrated directly for timeout management. |\n| `task_queue` | `struct deferred_task*` | Head pointer to a linked list of deferred tasks scheduled for next loop iteration. |\n\n> **Decision: Integration of Timer Wheel into Event Loop**\n> - **Context**: The event loop needs to check for timer expirations efficiently without adding complexity to the main loop.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Separate Timer Thread**: Run timer management in a separate thread that signals the main loop via pipe or eventfd.\n>   2. **epoll_wait Timeout**: Use the `timeout` parameter of `epoll_wait()` to sleep until the next timer expires.\n>   3. **Separate Tick Calls**: Call `timer_wheel_tick()` unconditionally in every loop iteration.\n> - **Decision**: Combine options 2 and 3—store timer wheel in event loop and use `epoll_wait()` timeout.\n> - **Rationale**: This avoids thread synchronization complexity while ensuring timers fire with reasonable accuracy. The `epoll_wait` timeout prevents busy-waiting when no I/O events occur.\n> - **Consequences**: Timer resolution is limited by `epoll_wait`'s millisecond timeout granularity. Long timeouts may cause delayed firing if calculated incorrectly.\n\n#### Hierarchical Timer Wheel Data Layout\n\nThe hierarchical timer wheel is like a **multi-level gear system** where each gear represents a different time scale. Imagine a clock with seconds, minutes, and hours hands—timers scheduled within the next minute go to the seconds wheel, those within the hour go to the minutes wheel, and so on. This allows O(1) operations for most timers while bounding cascade operations.\n\n![Hierarchical Timer Wheel Data Structure](./diagrams/diagram-3.svg)\n\n**Wheel Levels and Their Purposes**:\n1. **Level 0 (Milliseconds)**: 64 slots, each representing 1ms. Covers timers up to 64ms out.\n2. **Level 1 (Seconds)**: 64 slots, each representing 64ms (1 << 6). Covers timers up to ~4 seconds.\n3. **Level 2 (Minutes)**: 64 slots, each representing 4.096s (64 * 64ms). Covers timers up to ~4 minutes.\n4. **Level 3 (Hours)**: 64 slots, each representing 4.37min (64 * 4.096s). Covers timers up to ~4.6 hours.\n5. **Level 4 (Days)**: 64 slots, each representing ~4.66h (64 * 4.37min). Covers timers up to ~12 days.\n\n**Timer Wheel Structure**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `levels` | `int` | Number of levels in the hierarchy (typically 5 for the ranges above). |\n| `slots_per_level` | `int` | Number of slots per level (power of 2, typically 64 for efficient modulo). |\n| `resolution_ms` | `uint64_t` | Base timer resolution in milliseconds (typically 1ms for Level 0). |\n| `current_time` | `uint64_t` | Current time in ms since epoch, updated on each `timer_wheel_tick()`. |\n| `wheel` | `struct timer***` | 2D array: `wheel[level][slot]` points to head of linked list of timers in that slot. |\n| `count` | `uint64_t` | Total number of active timers in the wheel (for debugging and monitoring). |\n\n**Slot Index Calculation Algorithm**:\n1. Determine time difference: `delta = expires_at - current_time`\n2. For each level from 0 to levels-1:\n   - If `delta < slots_per_level * (resolution_ms << (6 * level))`:\n     - `slot = (current_slot[level] + (delta >> (6 * level))) & (slots_per_level - 1)`\n     - Insert timer into `wheel[level][slot]` linked list\n     - Return\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Timer Cascading Overhead**\n> **Mistake**: Placing a timer in a high-level slot when it actually belongs in a lower level.\n> **Why it's wrong**: When the wheel advances, timers must \"cascade\" down through levels, requiring multiple re-insertions and degrading to O(n) performance.\n> **How to fix**: Always compute the **correct level** using the precise formula above. During `timer_wheel_tick()`, when a slot at level > 0 expires, re-insert all its timers into appropriate lower-level slots.\n\n**Cascade Operation Example**:\nWhen the current time advances from 63ms to 64ms:\n1. Level 0 slot index increments from 63 to 0 (wraps around)\n2. Level 1 slot index increments by 1 (since we've completed a full Level 0 rotation)\n3. All timers in the now-expired Level 1 slot (slot that just became current) are removed and re-inserted into appropriate Level 0 slots based on their exact expiration times.\n\n#### Connection State Machine\n\nWhile not a separate data structure, the `state` field in `connection` follows a specific state machine that governs connection lifecycle:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------|\n| `STATE_ACCEPTED` | `EPOLLIN` with data | `STATE_READING` | Read available data, start parsing |\n| `STATE_READING` | Complete request read | `STATE_WRITING` | Generate response, register for `EPOLLOUT` if buffer full |\n| `STATE_WRITING` | `EPOLLOUT` ready | `STATE_WRITING` | Write buffered data, deregister `EPOLLOUT` when empty |\n| `STATE_WRITING` | All data written | `STATE_READING` (keep-alive) or `STATE_CLOSING` | Reset buffers for next request or initiate close |\n| Any state | Timer expires | `STATE_CLOSING` | Close socket, free resources |\n| Any state | Read returns 0 (EOF) | `STATE_CLOSING` | Client closed connection |\n| Any state | Error on socket | `STATE_CLOSING` | Clean up immediately |\n\n> **Critical Insight**: The state machine is **non-blocking at every transition**. Each state change corresponds to an event loop iteration, never waiting for I/O. This ensures single-threaded concurrency.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations Table**:\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| Memory Allocation | `malloc/free` per connection | Object pool with pre-allocation |\n| Timer Resolution | 1ms base resolution | Configurable resolution per level |\n| Buffer Management | Fixed-size buffers (4KB) | Dynamic growth with watermarks |\n| Time Source | `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` | `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW)` |\n\n**B.

Language-Specific Hints**:\n- Use `epoll_create1(EPOLL_CLOEXEC)` to ensure the epoll fd is closed on `exec()`.\n- Always check `errno` after system calls—`EAGAIN` and `EWOULDBLOCK` are expected for non-blocking I/O.\n- For timer wheel slots, use `calloc()` to ensure all pointers are initially NULL.\n- Store timestamps as `uint64_t` milliseconds using `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` to avoid wrap-around issues.\n- When freeing connection buffers, use `free()` and immediately set pointers to NULL to prevent double-free.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint**:\nAfter implementing the data structures:\n1. Run a simple test: `gcc -o test_connection src/connection.c -Iinclude && ./test_connection`\n2. Expected: No crashes, memory usage should be stable (check with `valgrind`).\n3. Verify structure sizes: `printf(\"connection: %zu bytes\\n\", sizeof(struct connection))` should show ~48 bytes on 64-bit systems.\n4. Create a mock event loop that allocates 10,000 connection objects—memory should be ~500KB plus buffers.\n\n**G. Debugging Tips**:\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Memory grows unbounded | Connections not freed on close | Add logging to `connection_destroy()` | Ensure `connection_destroy()` called for every closed fd |\n| Timers fire too early | Wrong slot calculation | Log `expires_at`, `current_time`, and calculated slot | Debug timer wheel insertion logic |\n| Partial data lost | Buffer counters incorrect | Log `read_buffer_used` before/after each read | Ensure counters updated atomically |\n| High CPU usage | Busy loop in `epoll_wait` | Check `timeout_ms` calculation | Ensure `timer_wheel_next_expiration()` returns correct value |\n\n\n## Component Design\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nThis section details each core component of the event loop system, following the project milestones. Think of the event loop as the central nervous system—it senses stimuli (I/O events), processes them through reflex arcs (callbacks), and maintains homeostasis with timers. The timer wheel is the circadian rhythm, the task queue is short-term memory, and the HTTP handler is a specialized skill built on these foundations.\n\n### Event Loop (epoll Basics) - Milestone 1\n\nThe event loop is the **reactor**—the single-threaded coordinator that monitors all I/O sources and dispatches events to handlers. Imagine a single air traffic controller watching hundreds of radar screens (file descriptors) who directs each plane (connection) when it's clear for takeoff (write) or has arrived (read).\n\n> **Decision: Level-Triggered vs Edge-Triggered epoll**\n> - **Context**: epoll supports two notification modes: level-triggered (notifies while condition is true) and edge-triggered (notifies only on state changes). We need to choose for our educational server handling 10K+ connections.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Level-triggered (default): Simpler for learners, matches select/poll behavior, but may cause unnecessary wakeups if data isn't fully drained.\n>   - Edge-triggered with EPOLLONESHOT: Most efficient, avoids thundering herd, but requires precise buffer management and re-arm operations.\n>   - Hybrid: Start with level-triggered, optionally support edge-triggered.\n> - **Decision**: Use **level-triggered** for Milestone 1-3, with edge-triggered as an advanced extension.\n> - **Rationale**: Level-triggered is more forgiving—if a callback doesn't consume all data, epoll will notify again on the next iteration. This matches the incremental processing model and reduces complex re-registration logic for learners. The performance difference is negligible for educational scale.\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more epoll_wait returns when data remains, but simpler code and easier debugging. Learners can graduate to edge-triggered optimization later.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Level-triggered (default) | Simple, self-correcting, matches select/poll mental model | May cause extra epoll_wait returns if data not fully read | ✅ Yes for learning |\n| Edge-triggered with EPOLLONESHOT | Maximum performance, minimizes syscalls | Complex buffer management, must re-arm after each event | No for core |\n| Hybrid configurable | Best of both worlds | Increased complexity, two code paths | No |\n\nThe event loop component owns the epoll instance, manages file descriptor registration, and executes the main dispatch loop. Its responsibilities include:\n- Creating and configuring the epoll instance\n- Registering and deregistering file descriptors for I/O events\n- Executing the infinite dispatch loop that waits for events and processes them\n- Managing the lifecycle of associated connection objects\n\n**Mental Model**: The event loop is like a busy receptionist with an intercom system. Each office (file descriptor) has a button that lights up when someone enters (EPOLLIN) or when the outgoing tray is empty (EPOLLOUT). The receptionist watches all lights, and when one illuminates, they announce over the intercom: \"Office 42, you have a visitor!\" The office worker (callback) then handles the visitor at their own pace.\n\n**Core Data Structures**:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `event_loop` | struct | Main event loop state container |\n| `epoll_event` | struct epoll_event | Linux kernel event structure |\n\n**`event_loop` Structure Fields**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `epoll_fd` | int | The epoll file descriptor returned by `epoll_create1()` |\n| `events` | struct epoll_event* | Dynamically allocated array for epoll_wait results |\n| `max_events` | int | Capacity of the events array (configurable) |\n| `running` | int | Boolean flag: 1 while loop should continue, 0 to stop |\n| `timer_wheel` | struct timer_wheel* | Pointer to associated timer wheel (Milestone 2) |\n| `task_queue` | struct deferred_task* | Head pointer to deferred task queue (Milestone 3) |\n\n**`epoll_event` Structure Fields** (Linux standard):\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `events` | uint32_t | Bitmask of epoll events (EPOLLIN, EPOLLOUT, etc.) |\n| `data` | union | User data attached to event (we store `connection*` in `ptr`) |\n\n**Event Loop Interface**:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `event_loop_create` | `max_events int` | `struct event_loop*` | Allocates and initializes event loop with given epoll_wait capacity |\n| `event_loop_register_fd` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int`, `events uint32_t`, `user_data void*` | `int` (0 success, -1 error) | Registers FD with epoll for specified events, attaches user_data |\n| `event_loop_modify_fd` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int`, `events uint32_t`, `user_data void*` | `int` | Modifies existing FD registration (e.g., add EPOLLOUT when write buffer full) |\n| `event_loop_unregister_fd` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int` | `int` | Removes FD from epoll monitoring |\n| `event_loop_run` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `timeout_ms int` | `int` | Main dispatch loop; runs until `running` becomes 0 |\n| `event_loop_stop` | `loop struct event_loop*` | `void` | Sets `running` to 0 to break out of loop |\n\n**Algorithm: Event Loop Dispatch (single iteration)**:\n1. Calculate timeout for `epoll_wait`: minimum of user-provided timeout and next timer expiration (from timer wheel)\n2. Call `epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, max_events, timeout_ms)` to wait for I/O events\n3. For each returned event (0 to n events):\n   1. Extract `connection*` from `event.data.ptr`\n   2. If `event.events & EPOLLIN`: call connection's read callback\n   3. If `event.events & EPOLLOUT`: call connection's write callback  \n   4. If `event.events & (EPOLLHUP | EPOLLERR)`: initiate connection cleanup\n4. Call `timer_wheel_tick()` to process expired timers\n5. Process all deferred tasks in the task queue\n6. Return to step 1 if `running` is still true\n\n**Connection State Machine** (simplified for Milestone 1):\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Action Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|--------------|\n| `STATE_ACCEPTED` | `EPOLLIN` received | `STATE_READING` | Call `connection_read()`, if data arrives, transition to reading |\n| `STATE_READING` | Read returns data | `STATE_WRITING` | Process data, prepare response, register for `EPOLLOUT` |\n| `STATE_READING` | Read returns 0 (EOF) | `STATE_CLOSING` | Initiate connection closure |\n| `STATE_WRITING` | `EPOLLOUT` received | `STATE_READING` or `STATE_CLOSING` | Call `connection_write()`, if all data sent, deregister `EPOLLOUT`, return to reading (keep-alive) or close |\n| Any state | `EPOLLERR` or `EPOLLHUP` | `STATE_CLOSING` | Clean up connection resources |\n\n**Common Pitfalls for Milestone 1**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking accept() on listening socket**\n- **Description**: Forgetting to set `O_NONBLOCK` on the listening socket causes `accept()` to block the entire event loop when no connections are pending.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Event loop must never block; a single blocking call stalls all other connections.\n- **Fix**: Always call `set_nonblocking()` on the listening socket after creation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK**\n- **Description**: Treating `read()`/`write()` returning -1 with `errno == EAGAIN` as an error and closing the connection.\n- **Why it's wrong**: These are normal non-blocking I/O conditions meaning \"try later,\" not errors.\n- **Fix**: Check `errno` after -1 return: if `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`, simply return 0 bytes processed and continue.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Starving writes while processing reads**\n- **Description**: Processing all `EPOLLIN` events before any `EPOLLOUT` events in the same loop iteration.\n- **Why it's wrong**: A connection with both read and write ready might have its write delayed, causing buffer buildup.\n- **Fix**: Process both events for each connection before moving to the next, or use round-robin.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The event loop's efficiency comes from **never waiting** for any single operation. It always has work to do—either process ready I/O, handle timers, or execute deferred tasks. This is why non-blocking operations are non-negotiable.\n\n### Timer Wheel (Timer Wheel and Timeouts) - Milestone 2\n\nThe timer wheel manages time-based events with **O(1) complexity** for insertion and deletion. Imagine a multi-tiered revolving door system in a large hotel: the innermost door rotates every minute (64ms slots), the middle every hour (4s slots), and the outer every day (4min slots). Guests (timers) enter at the appropriate door based on their departure time, cascading inward as time progresses.\n\n> **Decision: Hierarchical Timer Wheel vs Min-Heap**\n> - **Context**: We need efficient timeout management for 10K+ connections with frequent insertions (new timeouts) and deletions (cancellations when activity occurs).\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - **Min-heap (priority queue)**: O(log n) insert/delete, O(1) min retrieval. Simple implementation.\n>   - **Simple wheel (single-level)**: O(1) operations but limited to fixed future range (wheel size × resolution).\n>   - **Hierarchical (multilevel) wheel**: O(1) operations with arbitrary future range via cascading.\n>   - **Time-sorted list**: O(n) operations, unacceptable at scale.\n> - **Decision**: **Hierarchical timer wheel** with 4 levels (64ms, 4s, 4min, 4hr).\n> - **Rationale**: For connection timeouts, insertions and cancellations vastly outnumber expirations. O(1) operations matter most. The hierarchical design supports the full 32-bit timeout range (≈49 days) while maintaining constant time. The cascading overhead is amortized over many ticks.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation than min-heap, but predictable performance regardless of timer count.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Min-heap | Simple, standard, supports arbitrary times | O(log n) operations, heapify overhead | No |\n| Simple wheel | True O(1), very simple | Limited to wheel span (e.g., 2^8 × 64ms = 16s) | No |\n| Hierarchical wheel | O(1), arbitrary range, predictable | Complex cascading logic, fixed overhead | ✅ Yes |\n| Hashed timing wheel | O(1) average, handles large ranges | Hash collision chains, less predictable | No |\n\nThe timer wheel component manages the lifecycle of all timed events. Its responsibilities include:\n- Inserting new timers with arbitrary timeout values\n- Efficiently advancing the current time and expiring due timers\n- Supporting timer cancellation (e.g., when a connection receives data before its idle timeout)\n- Calculating the next expiration time for `epoll_wait` timeout optimization\n\n**Mental Model**: The timer wheel is like a multi-layered egg timer. You set a timer by placing an egg in the appropriate slot of the appropriate wheel. Every tick (64ms), the innermost wheel rotates one slot. If that slot has eggs, they hatch (fire). When a wheel completes a full rotation, it rotates the next outer wheel by one slot, moving all eggs from that outer slot to the appropriate inner wheel slots (cascading).\n\n![Hierarchical Timer Wheel Data Structure](./diagrams/diagram-3.svg)\n\n**Core Data Structures**:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `timer_wheel` | struct | Main timer wheel container |\n| `timer` | struct | Individual timer entry stored in wheel slots |\n\n**`timer_wheel` Structure Fields**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `levels` | int | Number of wheel levels (e.g., 4) |\n| `slots_per_level` | int | Slots per level (power of 2, e.g., 64) |\n| `resolution_ms` | uint64_t | Milliseconds per tick of innermost wheel (e.g., 64) |\n| `current_time` | uint64_t | Current time in wheel ticks (monotonically increasing) |\n| `wheel` | struct timer*** | 3D array: levels × slots × timer linked list heads |\n| `count` | uint64_t | Total active timers for statistics |\n\n**`timer` Structure Fields**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `expires_at` | uint64_t | Absolute expiration time in wheel ticks |\n| `callback` | timer_callback_t | Function pointer to call on expiration |\n| `user_data` | void* | Context data passed to callback (e.g., connection*) |\n| `next` | struct timer* | Next timer in same slot (singly linked list) |\n\n**Timer Wheel Interface**:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `timer_wheel_create` | (none) | `struct timer_wheel*` | Creates wheel with default levels (4) and slots (64) |\n| `timer_wheel_add` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*`, `timeout_ms uint64_t`, `callback timer_callback_t`, `user_data void*` | `void*` (timer reference) | Schedules callback after `timeout_ms`, returns opaque ref for cancellation |\n| `timer_wheel_remove` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*`, `timer_ref void*` | `void` | Cancels pending timer using reference returned by add |\n| `timer_wheel_next_expiration` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*` | `uint64_t` | Returns milliseconds until next timer expires (for epoll_wait timeout) |\n| `timer_wheel_tick` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*` | `void` | Advances time by one tick (called from event loop), expires due timers |\n| `timer_wheel_current_time` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*` | `uint64_t` | Returns current time in milliseconds for relative calculations |\n\n**Algorithm: Timer Wheel Insertion**:\n1. Calculate absolute expiration: `current_time + (timeout_ms / resolution_ms)`\n2. Determine level and slot:\n   1. For each level i from 0 to levels-1:\n      1. Calculate range of this level: `range = (slots_per_level ^ (i+1)) * resolution_ms`\n      2. If `timeout_ms < range`: \n         1. Calculate slot: `slot = (current_time + timeout_ms) >> (i * log2(slots_per_level)) % slots_per_level`\n         2. Insert timer into list at `wheel[i][slot]`\n         3. Store level and slot in timer reference for O(1) removal\n         4. Break\n3. If timeout exceeds maximum range of wheel, cap to maximum (rare, handled by highest level)\n\n**Algorithm: Timer Wheel Tick and Cascading**:\n1. Increment `current_time` by 1 tick\n2. For level 0 (innermost):\n   1. Calculate current slot: `slot = current_time % slots_per_level`\n   2. Remove all timers from `wheel[0][slot]`\n   3. For each removed timer, execute its callback\n3. For each level i where `current_time % (slots_per_level ^ (i+1)) == 0`:\n   1. Calculate previous slot in level i+1\n   2. Remove all timers from that slot in level i+1\n   3. For each removed timer, reinsert into appropriate lower-level slot (cascade down)\n   4. Continue to next level if cascading triggered further wheel rotation\n\n**Connection Timeout Integration**:\n- When a connection becomes active (read/write), cancel its existing idle timer\n- After processing, schedule new idle timer (e.g., 30 seconds)\n- On timeout expiration, callback receives `connection*` as user_data and initiates closure\n\n**Common Pitfalls for Milestone 2**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Timer drift from inaccurate epoll_wait timeout**\n- **Description**: Using fixed `epoll_wait` timeout (e.g., 100ms) instead of minimum until next timer expiration.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Timers fire late, causing idle timeouts to extend beyond configured values.\n- **Fix**: Call `timer_wheel_next_expiration()` before each `epoll_wait` and use that as timeout.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not handling timer cancellation races**\n- **Description**: Timer fires and callback begins executing while connection simultaneously receives data and attempts cancellation.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Connection could be closed while processing data, causing use-after-free.\n- **Fix**: Use timer reference invalidation: set a cancelled flag in timer or connection, check in callback before acting.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Wheel slots not power of two**\n- **Description**: Using 100 slots per level for \"nice decimal numbers.\"\n- **Why it's wrong**: Modulo operations become expensive divisions instead of bitwise AND.\n- **Fix**: Always use power of two slots (64, 128, 256) for fast `slot = time & (slots-1)`.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The timer wheel's efficiency comes from **batching time computations**. Instead of checking each timer individually (\"is it time yet?\"), we bucket timers by expiration slot and only examine buckets whose time has come. This transforms O(n) scan into O(1) bucket removal.\n\n### Async Task Scheduling - Milestone 3\n\nAsync task scheduling provides the **callback API** that makes the reactor pattern usable. Imagine a restaurant with a single waiter (event loop) who takes orders (I/O events) and gives them to the kitchen (callbacks). The kitchen can also give the waiter future tasks (\"check table 5 in 10 minutes\") that go into the waiter's pocket notebook (deferred queue).\n\n> **Decision: Immediate vs Deferred Callback Execution**\n> - **Context**: When an I/O event occurs or timer fires, we need to decide when to execute the associated callback relative to other events.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - **Immediate execution**: Callback runs directly in the event processing loop.\n>   - **Deferred to queue**: Callback added to task queue, executed after all I/O events in current iteration.\n>   - **Hybrid**: I/O callbacks immediate, timer callbacks deferred.\n> - **Decision**: **I/O callbacks immediate, timer and deferred tasks queued**.\n> - **Rationale**: I/O callbacks should run immediately to drain buffers and maintain throughput. Timer callbacks (like connection timeout) often involve cleanup that might modify event registrations, which is safer deferred. This follows the Reactor pattern's \"don't call us, we'll call you\" semantics.\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex dispatch logic, but avoids re-entrancy issues during I/O processing.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| All immediate | Simple, predictable order | Callbacks can modify event set during iteration (dangerous) | No |\n| All deferred | Safe, deterministic execution order | I/O delays by one tick, reduces responsiveness | No |\n| Hybrid (I/O immediate, others deferred) | Responsive I/O, safe modifications | Two execution paths, more complex | ✅ Yes |\n| Configurable per callback | Maximum flexibility | Very complex, hard to reason about | No |\n\nThe async scheduling component manages the registration and execution of all callbacks. Its responsibilities include:\n- Providing clean API for registering interest in file descriptor events\n- Managing callback context (user data) lifecycle\n- Maintaining deferred task queue for non-I/O work\n- Supporting one-shot and repeating timers via timer wheel integration\n\n**Mental Model**: The async scheduler is like a theater stage manager. Actors (file descriptors) signal when they're ready (I/O events). The stage manager immediately whispers their lines (I/O callbacks). Meanwhile, stagehands (timers) place notes in the manager's \"future cues\" box (timer wheel). During scene breaks, the manager checks this box and processes any due notes (timer callbacks). Any actor requesting a costume change (deferred task) gets queued for the next break.\n\n![System Component Overview](./diagrams/diagram-1.svg)\n\n**Core Data Structures**:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `deferred_task` | struct | Entry in deferred task queue |\n| `callback_registry` | struct | Maps file descriptors to their callbacks (simplified) |\n\n**`deferred_task` Structure Fields**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `callback` | task_callback_t | Function to execute |\n| `user_data` | void* | Context data |\n| `next` | struct deferred_task* | Next task in queue |\n\n**Callback Types (function pointer signatures)**:\n\n| Type | Signature | Purpose |\n|------|-----------|---------|\n| `read_callback_t` | `void (*)(int fd, void* user_data)` | Called when FD has data ready to read |\n| `write_callback_t` | `void (*)(int fd, void* user_data)` | Called when FD is ready for writing |\n| `timer_callback_t` | `void (*)(void* user_data)` | Called when timer expires |\n| `task_callback_t` | `void (*)(void* user_data)` | Called for deferred execution |\n\n**Async Scheduling Interface**:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `event_loop_register_read` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int`, `callback read_callback_t`, `user_data void*` | `int` | Registers read interest, internal wrapper for `event_loop_register_fd` |\n| `event_loop_register_write` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int`, `callback write_callback_t`, `user_data void*` | `int` | Registers write interest (often done dynamically when buffer full) |\n| `event_loop_deregister` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `fd int`, `events uint32_t` | `int` | Removes specific event interests |\n| `event_loop_defer_task` | `loop struct event_loop*`, `callback task_callback_t`, `user_data void*` | `void` | Adds task to deferred queue for next loop iteration |\n| `timer_wheel_add_repeating` | `wheel struct timer_wheel*`, `interval_ms uint64_t`, `callback timer_callback_t`, `user_data void*` | `void*` | Adds timer that automatically reschedules after firing |\n\n**Algorithm: Event Loop with Async Scheduling** (enhanced from Milestone 1):\n1. Calculate `epoll_wait` timeout from `timer_wheel_next_expiration()`\n2. Call `epoll_wait`\n3. For each returned event:\n   1. Extract `connection*` from `event.data.ptr`\n   2. If `event.events & EPOLLIN`: \n      1. Look up read callback for this FD\n      2. **Execute immediately**: call `read_callback(fd, connection*)`\n   3. If `event.events & EPOLLOUT`:\n      1. Look up write callback for this FD  \n      2. **Execute immediately**: call `write_callback(fd, connection*)`\n4. Call `timer_wheel_tick()`: each expired timer's callback is **added to deferred queue**\n5. Process all tasks in deferred queue (including timer callbacks):\n   1. While queue not empty:\n      2. Pop task from head\n      3. Execute `task_callback(user_data)`\n      4. Free task node\n6. Repeat\n\n**Repeating Timer Implementation**:\n- When a repeating timer fires, its callback executes\n- Before returning, the callback (or timer infrastructure) calls `timer_wheel_add()` again with same interval\n- Alternatively, `timer_wheel_add_repeating()` creates a special timer that auto-reschedules\n\n**Common Pitfalls for Milestone 3**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Callback modifies event registration during iteration**\n- **Description**: A read callback calls `event_loop_deregister(fd, EPOLLIN)` while event loop is still iterating through the epoll events array.\n- **Why it's wrong**: May cause invalid memory access if epoll modifies internal structures during iteration.\n- **Fix**: Either defer registration changes (add to modification queue) or use immediate I/O callbacks but defer timer callbacks (our chosen approach).\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unbounded deferred task queue growth**\n- **Description**: Tasks are added to deferred queue faster than they're processed.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Memory exhaustion, increased latency.\n- **Fix**: Implement queue size limit, or better, ensure tasks don't spawn infinite sub-tasks. Use circular buffer instead of linked list for bounded size.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not cleaning up user_data on connection close**\n- **Description**: Timer or deferred task holds `connection*` after connection freed.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Use-after-free when callback eventually executes.\n- **Fix**: When destroying connection, cancel all associated timers and scan deferred queue removing tasks with that user_data.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The async scheduling layer **decouples event detection from event processing**. The event loop detects \"what happened,\" while callbacks decide \"what to do about it.\" This separation allows protocol handlers (like HTTP) to be built independently of the reactor machinery.\n\n### HTTP Server on Event Loop - Milestone 4\n\nThe HTTP server is a **protocol handler** built atop the event loop framework. Imagine a postal worker (event loop) who normally just forwards letters (bytes). Now they learn to recognize birthday invitations (HTTP requests): they check if the envelope has all required fields (complete headers), prepare a standard RSVP (HTTP response), and mail it back, all while continuing to handle other letters.\n\n> **Decision: Incremental Parsing vs Buffering Whole Request**\n> - **Context**: With non-blocking reads, an HTTP request may arrive in multiple fragments across different events. We need to parse efficiently.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - **Buffer whole request then parse**: Simple, but wastes memory on partial buffering and delays processing.\n>   - **Incremental/streaming parser**: Parse as data arrives, immediate processing of complete requests.\n>   - **State machine without full parsing**: Just find CRLF delimiters, minimal validation.\n> - **Decision**: **Incremental parser with state machine**.\n> - **Rationale**: Handles slow clients efficiently, minimizes memory usage, starts processing as soon as request is complete. Follows HTTP/1.1's line-oriented protocol naturally.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex parser logic, must handle all partial states (mid-header, mid-chunk, etc.).\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Buffer whole request | Simple, robust, easy to validate | Memory overhead, latency on slow networks | No |\n| Incremental parser | Efficient, immediate processing, scalable | Complex state machine, many edge cases | ✅ Yes |\n| Hybrid (buffer up to limit) | Balance of simplicity and efficiency | Still wastes memory on large requests | No |\n\nThe HTTP server component implements the application logic. Its responsibilities include:\n- Incremental parsing of HTTP/1.1 requests from non-blocking sockets\n- Managing per-connection read/write buffers with flow control\n- Generating appropriate HTTP responses\n- Supporting keep-alive connections with configurable timeouts\n- Handling backpressure when clients can't receive data quickly\n\n**Mental Model**: The HTTP handler is like a coffee shop barista working during rush hour. Customers (clients) shout orders (request bytes) as they think of them. The barista writes each fragment on a notepad (read buffer). When they detect a complete order (double newline), they make the coffee (generate response) and pour it into a cup (write buffer). If the cup fills before the customer takes it, they set it aside and wait for the customer to empty their hands (EPOLLOUT).\n\n![HTTP Request Handling Flowchart](./diagrams/diagram-5.svg)\n\n**Core Data Structures**:\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `http_parser` | struct | Stateful incremental HTTP request parser |\n| `http_request` | struct | Parsed request representation |\n| `http_response` | struct | Response being built |\n\n**`http_parser` Structure Fields**:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `state` | enum | Current parsing state (e.g., `START_LINE`, `HEADERS`, `BODY`, `COMPLETE`) |\n| `buffer` | char* | Accumulated data for current parsing stage |\n| `buffer_used` | int | Bytes currently in buffer |\n| `content_length` | int | From Content-Length header, or -1 if chunked/unknown |\n| `headers_complete` | int | Boolean flag indicating headers fully parsed |\n| `current_header` | struct | Temporary storage for header being parsed |\n\n**`connection` Structure Fields** (HTTP extensions):\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `proto_data` | void* | Pointer to protocol-specific data (`http_parser*` for HTTP connections) |\n| `state` | int | Extended with HTTP states: `HTTP_READING`, `HTTP_WRITING`, `HTTP_KEEPALIVE` |\n\n**HTTP Server Interface**:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `http_connection_create` | `fd int` | `struct connection*` | Creates connection with HTTP parser initialized |\n| `http_handle_read` | `conn struct connection*` | `int` | Read callback: reads data, feeds parser, generates response if request complete |\n| `http_handle_write` | `conn struct connection*` | `int` | Write callback: sends response bytes from write buffer |\n| `http_generate_response` | `conn struct connection*`, `request struct http_request*` | `void` | Generates appropriate HTTP response into connection's write buffer |\n| `http_parser_feed` | `parser struct http_parser*`, `data char*`, `len int` | `int` | Incrementally parses data, returns bytes consumed |\n\n**Algorithm: HTTP Read Callback**:\n1. Call `connection_read()` to read available data into read buffer\n2. If bytes read > 0:\n   1. Call `http_parser_feed()` with new data\n   2. While parser indicates progress:\n      1. If parser state becomes `HEADERS_COMPLETE`:\n         1. Extract `http_request` from parser\n         2. Call `http_generate_response()` to fill write buffer\n         3. If write buffer has data, register for `EPOLLOUT` (if not already)\n      2. If parser state becomes `ERROR`:\n         1. Send 400 Bad Response, mark connection for closure\n3. If bytes read == 0 (EOF):\n   1. Initiate graceful closure\n4. If bytes read == -1 with `EAGAIN`:\n   1. Simply return (normal non-blocking condition)\n5. Reset connection's idle timer (keep-alive)\n\n**Algorithm: HTTP Write Callback**:\n1. Call `connection_write()` to send data from write buffer\n2. If all bytes sent:\n   1. If keep-alive supported and requested:\n      1. Reset parser for next request\n      2. Deregister `EPOLLOUT` (if registered)\n      3. Return to reading state\n   2. Else:\n      1. Initiate graceful closure\n3. If partial bytes sent (write buffer still has data):\n   1. Update `write_buffer_sent` offset\n   2. Keep `EPOLLOUT` registered for next write opportunity\n4. If write returns `EAGAIN`:\n   1. Keep `EPOLLOUT` registered, return\n\n**Keep-Alive Implementation**:\n- Parser detects `Connection: keep-alive` header\n- After response sent, instead of closing, reset parser state and buffer\n- Maintain idle timer (e.g., 5 seconds); close connection if no new request arrives\n- Limit number of requests per connection to prevent starvation\n\n**Buffer Management Strategy**:\n- Read buffer: circular buffer of `READ_BUFFER_SIZE` (4096). When full and more data arrives, either grow buffer or close connection (simplified: close).\n- Write buffer: linear buffer with `write_buffer_sent` offset. When response exceeds buffer size, use write slicing: send first chunk, register `EPOLLOUT`, send next chunk when ready.\n- Backpressure: When `connection_write()` returns `EAGAIN`, stop reading from that connection to prevent buffer buildup.\n\n**Common Pitfalls for Milestone 4**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: HTTP request line split across reads**\n- **Description**: \"GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\" arrives as \"GET /index\" then \".html HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\".\n- **Why it's wrong**: Naive parser expecting complete lines fails.\n- **Fix**: Incremental parser stores partial data in buffer, continues when more arrives.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Write buffer exhaustion without EPOLLOUT registration**\n- **Description**: Response too large for buffer, but code doesn't register for `EPOLLOUT` to continue later.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Response truncated, connection hangs.\n- **Fix**: After filling write buffer, if more data remains, register `EPOLLOUT`. In write callback, send next chunk.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Keep-alive connection starvation**\n- **Description**: Single fast client sends infinite requests on keep-alive, blocking others.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Fairness issue, denial of service vector.\n- **Fix**: Limit requests per connection (e.g., 100), then close. Or implement weighted fair queuing.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The HTTP server demonstrates **composability** of the event loop framework. By implementing just three callbacks (create, read, write) and using the provided buffer management and timer facilities, we get a production-capable server. This pattern extends to any protocol (WebSocket, Redis, custom).\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

While the previous sections described the static components and data structures, here we examine how these parts interact over time to handle real-world scenarios. Think of this as watching the system in motion—like observing a complex clock mechanism where gears (components) turn in precise sequence to produce the desired outcome (handling 10K+ connections).\n\nUnderstanding these flows is critical because the reactor pattern's power emerges from the choreography between I/O events, timer ticks, and deferred tasks. A single misstep—like processing timers before I/O events—can cause subtle bugs like delayed responses or missed timeouts.\n\n### Sequence: Connection Lifecycle\n\nImagine each TCP connection as a **visitor to a high-traffic museum**. The event loop is the single tour guide managing all visitors simultaneously. The guide doesn't wait for one visitor to finish examining an exhibit before attending to another. Instead, they constantly scan the room (epoll_wait), notice when visitors are ready (read/write events), provide information in small chunks (non-blocking I/O), and politely escort out visitors who've been idle too long (timer timeouts). This analogy captures the essence of the connection lifecycle in our event-driven architecture.\n\nThe complete journey of a connection follows a **finite state machine** (refer to ![Event Loop State Machine](./diagrams/diagram-2.svg)). Below, we walk through each state transition with concrete steps, data structure updates, and the API calls involved.\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: Connection State Management**\n\n> **Decision: State Machine Embedded in Connection Structure**\n> - **Context**: We need to track where each connection is in its lifecycle (accepting, reading, writing, closing) to apply the correct handling logic when events occur. The state determines which callbacks to invoke and what cleanup to perform.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>     1. **Separate state machines per protocol**: Each protocol handler (HTTP, echo) maintains its own state enumeration, duplicating common states like `READING` and `WRITING`.\n>     2. **Generic state with protocol-specific extensions**: A base connection state machine (`STATE_ACCEPTED`, `STATE_READING`, etc.) with a `proto_data` field for protocol-specific state (like `HTTP_READING`).\n>     3. **Fully protocol-agnostic event callbacks**: No explicit state tracking; callbacks decide what to do based on buffered data and previous actions, requiring complex logic within each callback.\n> - **Decision**: Option 2—generic state machine with protocol extension. The `connection` struct contains a `state` field with common states, and protocol handlers can store additional state in `proto_data`.\n> - **Rationale**: This provides a clean separation of concerns. The event loop manages the generic lifecycle (allocation, registration, timeout, cleanup) while protocol handlers manage protocol-specific parsing and logic. It avoids duplication while maintaining clear state transitions that are easy to debug.\n> - **Consequences**: Protocol handlers must coordinate with the base state (e.g., transitioning from `STATE_READING` to `STATE_WRITING` when a request is fully parsed). The `proto_data` field requires careful memory management (allocated/freed with the connection).\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Separate state machines per protocol | Clean protocol separation; no shared state assumptions | Duplication of common states; harder to enforce consistent lifecycle management | ❌ |\n| **Generic state with protocol extensions** | **Unified lifecycle management; extensible; clear debugging** | **Slight complexity in protocol handler coordination** | **✅** |\n| Fully protocol-agnostic callbacks | Maximum flexibility; no state tracking overhead | Callbacks become complex; hard to reason about connection progress | ❌ |\n\nThe connection lifecycle proceeds through the following stages, each triggered by specific events and resulting in specific actions:\n\n**Table: Connection State Transitions and Actions**\n\n| Current State | Event Trigger | Next State | Actions Taken (in order) |\n|---------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|\n| **LISTENING** (listening socket) | `EPOLLIN` event on listening socket | `STATE_ACCEPTED` | 1. `accept4()` with `SOCK_NONBLOCK` <br> 2. Create `connection` struct via `connection_create()` <br> 3. Register new socket with `EPOLLIN` via `event_loop_register_fd()` <br> 4. Add idle timer via `timer_wheel_add()` (reference stored in `connection.timer_ref`) |\n| `STATE_ACCEPTED` | `EPOLLIN` event on connection socket | `STATE_READING` (or `HTTP_READING`) | 1. Cancel previous idle timer (if any) via `timer_wheel_remove()` <br> 2. Invoke protocol-specific read callback (e.g., `http_handle_read()`) <br> 3. Callback performs `connection_read()`, processes data, may change state |\n| `STATE_READING` | Read callback completes request processing | `STATE_WRITING` (or `HTTP_WRITING`) | 1. Generate response (e.g., `http_generate_response()`) into `connection.write_buffer` <br> 2. If `write_buffer` has data, register for `EPOLLOUT` via `event_loop_modify_fd()` <br> 3. Add new idle timer for write phase (optional, different timeout) |\n| `STATE_WRITING` | `EPOLLOUT` event on connection socket | `STATE_WRITING` (remain until buffer empty) or `STATE_READING` (keep-alive) | 1. Invoke write callback (e.g., `http_handle_write()`) <br> 2. Callback performs `connection_write()`, sends buffered data <br> 3. If all data sent: <br>   - For HTTP with keep-alive: deregister `EPOLLOUT`, return to `STATE_READING`, restart idle timer <br>   - Otherwise: transition to `STATE_CLOSING` |\n| `STATE_WRITING` | Write buffer full (cannot send all data) | `STATE_WRITING` (stays) | 1. `connection_write()` returns `EAGAIN` <br> 2. Write callback leaves data in `write_buffer`, ensures `EPOLLOUT` remains registered <br> 3. Next `EPOLLOUT` event will resume sending |\n| Any active state | Timer expiration (idle timeout) | `STATE_CLOSING` | 1. Timer callback receives `connection` as `user_data` <br> 2. Calls `event_loop_unregister_fd()` to remove from epoll <br> 3. Calls `connection_destroy()` which closes socket and frees buffers |\n| Any active state | Read returns 0 bytes (client closed) | `STATE_CLOSING` | 1.

All resources freed, connection removed from all data structures |\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example of an HTTP connection with keep-alive:\n\n**Concrete Walk-Through: HTTP Keep-Alive Connection**\n\n1. **Client connects**: The listening socket (port 8080) receives an `EPOLLIN` event. The event loop's dispatch logic calls the accept callback.\n   - `accept4()` returns a new socket fd (e.g., 42) with `SOCK_NONBLOCK`.\n   - `connection_create(42)` allocates a `connection` struct, initializes buffers, sets `state = STATE_ACCEPTED`.\n   - `event_loop_register_fd(loop, 42, EPOLLIN, connection_ptr)` adds the socket to epoll monitoring.\n   - `timer_wheel_add(wheel, 30000, idle_timeout_callback, connection_ptr)` sets a 30-second idle timeout, storing the timer reference in `connection.timer_ref`.\n\n2. **Client sends HTTP request**: Socket 42 becomes readable (`EPOLLIN`). The event loop invokes the registered read callback, which is `http_handle_read()`.\n   - The callback first cancels the idle timer: `timer_wheel_remove(wheel, connection->timer_ref)`.\n   - It calls `connection_read(connection)` which reads up to `READ_BUFFER_SIZE` bytes into `read_buffer`. Suppose the request is partial (only \"GET /index.html HT\").\n   - `http_parser_feed()` consumes the available bytes but doesn't complete the request (headers not fully received).\n   - The callback updates `connection->state = HTTP_READING` (a protocol-specific state stored in `proto_data`).\n   - It adds a new idle timer (maybe 5 seconds for reading phase) via `timer_wheel_add()`.\n\n3. **More data arrives**: Another `EPOLLIN` event occurs on socket 42. `http_handle_read()` is called again.\n   - Timer is cancelled again (idle timeout reset).\n   - `connection_read()` reads the remainder of the request (\"TP/1.1\\r\\nHost: ...\").\n   - `http_parser_feed()` now completes header parsing, sets `headers_complete = 1`, and extracts `Content-Length`.\n   - The parser may need more data for body (if `Content-Length > 0`). In this example, it's a GET request with no body, so parsing completes.\n   - `http_generate_response()` generates an HTTP 200 response with some HTML content, copying it into `connection.write_buffer`.\n   - The callback changes `connection->state = HTTP_WRITING`.\n   - It registers for `EPOLLOUT` via `event_loop_modify_fd(loop, 42, EPOLLOUT, connection_ptr)` to be notified when writable.\n   - A new idle timer for the writing phase is added (maybe 10 seconds).\n\n4. **Socket becomes writable**: `EPOLLOUT` event fires on socket 42. The event loop invokes the write callback `http_handle_write()`.\n   - `connection_write(connection)` sends as much of `write_buffer` as possible. Suppose the entire response fits in one write (common for small responses).\n   - All bytes are sent, so `write_buffer` is cleared.\n   - Since HTTP keep-alive is supported and requested, the connection should wait for the next request.\n   - The callback deregisters `EPOLLOUT` (only `EPOLLIN` needed now) via `event_loop_modify_fd(loop, 42, EPOLLIN, connection_ptr)`.\n   - `connection->state` is set back to `HTTP_READING` (or `HTTP_KEEPALIVE`).\n   - The idle timer is reset to the keep-alive timeout (maybe 30 seconds).\n\n5. **Client sends second request**: The cycle repeats from step 2.\n\n6. **Client idle timeout**: Suppose after the response, the client disappears and sends no more data. After 30 seconds, the timer added in step 4 expires.\n   - The timer callback (`idle_timeout_callback`) receives the `connection` pointer.\n   - It calls `event_loop_unregister_fd(loop, connection->fd)` to remove the socket from epoll.\n   - It calls `connection_destroy(connection)`, which `close()`s the socket and frees all buffers and the `connection` struct itself.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Connection Lifecycle Management**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Timer reference dangling after connection destruction**\n- **Description**: A connection is destroyed (due to error or normal close) but its timer still exists in the timer wheel. When the timer later expires, it calls the callback with a stale `user_data` pointer, causing a use-after-free crash.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Timer callbacks must never access freed memory. This leads to undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities.\n- **Fix**: Always cancel the timer (`timer_wheel_remove()`) **before** freeing the connection. In the destruction sequence: 1) remove from epoll, 2) cancel timer, 3) close socket and free memory. Alternatively, store a weak reference in the timer that's validated before use.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: State inconsistency during partial writes**\n- **Description**: When a write cannot send all buffered data (`EAGAIN`), the code transitions to `STATE_WRITING` and registers `EPOLLOUT`. However, if an error occurs before the next `EPOLLOUT` event (like client disconnect), the connection might be stuck in `STATE_WRITING` with no way to progress.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The connection becomes a zombie—consuming resources but unable to complete.\n- **Fix**: Always check for errors on the socket (via `getsockopt(SO_ERROR)` or checking `errno` after a subsequent operation) even when waiting for `EPOLLOUT`. Additionally, implement a write timeout timer that forces closure if data cannot be sent within a reasonable period.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Busy-loop on `EPOLLOUT` with empty buffer**\n- **Description**: After all buffered data is sent, the code forgets to deregister `EPOLLOUT`. The socket remains continuously writable (level-triggered), causing the event loop to spin constantly invoking the write callback.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Wastes CPU cycles, reduces performance, and may cause unexpected behavior if the write callback is called with empty buffer.\n- **Fix**: Immediately after `connection_write()` sends all data, check if `write_buffer_used == 0`. If so, modify the event registration to remove `EPOLLOUT` (using `event_loop_modify_fd()` with only `EPOLLIN`). Alternatively, use edge-triggered mode (`EPOLLET`) which only notifies on transition to writable, but this requires different handling.\n\n### Flow: Event Loop Tick\n\nThe event loop tick is the **heartbeat** of the entire system. Imagine a master chef in a busy kitchen who repeatedly follows a strict routine: 1) Check which orders are ready (epoll_wait), 2) Prepare dishes that have ingredients available (process I/O events), 3) Check the oven timer (timer wheel tick), 4) Clean up and prep for next round (deferred tasks). This disciplined, repetitive cycle ensures no order is forgotten and everything progresses efficiently.\n\nEach iteration of the event loop—called a \"tick\"—processes all pending I/O events, expires due timers, and executes deferred tasks. The order of these operations is crucial for correctness and performance. Refer to ![Sequence Diagram: Event Loop Tick](./diagrams/diagram-4.svg) for a visual sequence.\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: Processing Order Within a Tick**\n\n> **Decision: I/O → Timers → Deferred Tasks**\n> - **Context**: We must decide the sequence in which to handle different event sources within a single loop iteration. The order affects latency, fairness, and potential starvation.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>     1. **Timers → I/O → Tasks**: Process timer callbacks first, then I/O events, then deferred tasks.\n>     2. **I/O → Timers → Tasks**: Process all I/O events (reads then writes), then timer expirations, then deferred tasks.\n>     3. **Mixed priority queue**: All events (I/O, timer, task) placed in a single priority queue sorted by urgency.\n> - **Decision**: Option 2—I/O first, then timers, then deferred tasks.\n> - **Rationale**: I/O events are typically the highest priority because they represent data already arrived that needs immediate processing to free kernel buffers. Timers are checked after I/O because their expiration time has already passed slightly (we check after epoll_wait returns). Deferred tasks run last because they're explicitly deferred to the next iteration and shouldn't block I/O processing. This order minimizes latency for incoming data while ensuring timers are checked at least every `epoll_wait` timeout.\n> - **Consequences**: Timer callbacks may experience a small additional latency (up to the `epoll_wait` timeout) beyond their scheduled time. However, this is acceptable for idle timeouts and heartbeat timers. Critical timing applications would need a different design.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Timers → I/O → Tasks | Timers fire more precisely at expiration | I/O data may sit in kernel buffers longer, increasing memory pressure and latency | ❌ |\n| **I/O → Timers → Tasks** | **Minimizes latency for incoming data; logical flow** | **Timer callbacks slightly delayed** | **✅** |\n| Mixed priority queue | Most theoretically fair; all events handled by urgency | Complex implementation; overhead of sorting; may starve I/O if many timers expire | ❌ |\n\nThe event loop tick follows a precise algorithm executed by `event_loop_run()`. Below is the step-by-step procedure for a single iteration:\n\n**Algorithm: Event Loop Tick (single iteration of `event_loop_run`)**\n\n1. **Calculate timeout for epoll_wait**:\n   - Call `timer_wheel_next_expiration(timer_wheel)` to get milliseconds until the next timer expires.\n   - If no timers pending, set `timeout_ms = -1` (infinite wait).\n   - If timers pending, set `timeout_ms = min(next_expiration, MAX_EPOLL_TIMEOUT)` where `MAX_EPOLL_TIMEOUT` is a safety cap (e.g., 1000ms) to prevent hanging indefinitely.\n\n2. **Wait for I/O events**:\n   - Call `epoll_wait(loop->epoll_fd, loop->events, loop->max_events, timeout_ms)`.\n   - This blocks the thread until either:\n     - At least one file descriptor has a pending event (readable, writable, error).\n     - The timeout expires (no I/O activity before next timer deadline).\n     - A signal interrupts the call (handled by checking `errno == EINTR`).\n   - Returns number of ready events `n_events`.\n\n3. **Process I/O events**:\n   - For `i = 0` to `n_events - 1`:\n     - Retrieve `epoll_event` from `loop->events[i]`.\n     - Extract `user_data` pointer (typically a `connection*`) from `epoll_event.data.ptr`.\n     - Check `epoll_event.events` for error flags (`EPOLLERR`, `EPOLLHUP`). If present, transition connection to `STATE_CLOSING` and continue to next event.\n     - If `epoll_event.events & EPOLLIN`: Invoke the connection's read callback (e.g., `http_handle_read`). The callback handles non-blocking read and state transitions.\n     - If `epoll_event.events & EPOLLOUT`: Invoke the connection's write callback (e.g., `http_handle_write`). The callback handles non-blocking write and may deregister `EPOLLOUT` when done.\n     - Note: A single event can have both `EPOLLIN` and `EPOLLOUT` set (socket both readable and writable). Process both flags.\n\n4. **Tick the timer wheel**:\n   - Call `timer_wheel_tick(timer_wheel)`. This function:\n     - Increments `current_time` by the elapsed time (may use a monotonic clock or simply assume one tick occurred).\n     - Scans the appropriate wheel slots for expired timers.\n     - For each expired timer, invokes its callback with `user_data`.\n     - Handles cascading of future timers from higher to lower wheel levels.\n\n5. **Process deferred task queue**:\n   - While `loop->task_queue` is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the first `deferred_task`.\n     - Execute its `callback(task->user_data)`.\n     - Free the task node.\n   - Note: Tasks enqueued during this processing (by callbacks) are executed on the **next** iteration to avoid infinite loops.\n\n6. **Housekeeping and loop condition**:\n   - Check if `loop->running == 0` (set by `event_loop_stop()`). If so, break out of the loop.\n   - Optionally, perform periodic maintenance (e.g., log statistics, resize internal buffers if needed) every N iterations.\n   - Return to step 1 for the next iteration.\n\n**Timing and Latency Considerations**\n\nThe choice of `timeout_ms` in step 1 is critical for balancing responsiveness and CPU usage:\n- If `timeout_ms` is too large (e.g., always `-1`), timer expirations will be delayed until the next I/O event occurs, causing idle connections to linger beyond their timeout.\n- If `timeout_ms` is too small (e.g., always `1`), the loop will busy-wait, consuming 100% CPU even when idle.\n- The correct approach: dynamically set `timeout_ms` to the time until the next timer expiration, capped at a reasonable maximum (e.g., 100ms) to allow periodic housekeeping even when no timers are scheduled.\n\n**Concrete Example: Tick with Mixed Events**\n\nLet's walk through a concrete tick where multiple event types occur:\n\n1. **Before tick**: \n   - Timer wheel has a timer expiring in 50ms (idle timeout for connection A).\n   - Connection B has pending data in its kernel receive buffer.\n   - Deferred task queue has one task (cleanup of a recently closed connection).\n\n2. **Step 1**: Calculate timeout. `timer_wheel_next_expiration()` returns 50. `timeout_ms = 50`.\n\n3. **Step 2**: `epoll_wait` with 50ms timeout. Suppose after 30ms, connection B becomes readable. `epoll_wait` returns with `n_events = 1`.\n\n4. **Step 3**: Process I/O events. The event is for connection B with `EPOLLIN`. Invoke `http_handle_read(connection_B)`. It reads data, parses a complete HTTP request, generates response, and registers `EPOLLOUT`. No errors.\n\n5. **Step 4**: Tick timer wheel. `timer_wheel_tick()` increments time by 30ms (the actual wait). The timer that was 50ms away is now 20ms from expiration, so it does NOT fire yet. No callbacks invoked.\n\n6. **Step 5**: Process deferred tasks. The cleanup task callback frees memory from a connection closed in the previous tick.\n\n7. **Step 6**: Loop continues (`running == 1`).\n\n**Next tick**:\n- `timeout_ms` now 20ms (timer for connection A).\n- `epoll_wait` waits up to 20ms. No I/O events occur.\n- After 20ms, `epoll_wait` times out (returns 0 events).\n- Process I/O events: none.\n- `timer_wheel_tick()` increments time by 20ms, timer for connection A expires. Timer callback calls `connection_destroy(connection_A)`.\n- Process deferred tasks: none.\n- Loop continues.\n\nThis example shows how the event loop interleaves different event types, ensuring timely processing of both I/O and timers.\n\n**Data Flow During a Tick**\n\nThe following table summarizes the data transformations that occur during each phase of the tick:\n\n| Phase | Input Data | Transformation | Output Data |\n|-------|------------|----------------|-------------|\n| `epoll_wait` | Kernel I/O readiness state | System call blocks until timeout or readiness | Array of `epoll_event` structures with `fd` and event flags |\n| I/O Processing | `epoll_event` array + `connection` pointers | Callbacks read/write socket buffers, update connection state, modify buffers | Updated `connection` buffers, possibly new event registrations (`EPOLLOUT`), state transitions |\n| Timer Tick | `timer_wheel` state + current time | Scan for expired timers, invoke callbacks, cascade future timers | Timer callbacks executed (may close connections, send heartbeats), `timer_wheel` slots updated |\n| Task Processing | `deferred_task` linked list | Execute callbacks in FIFO order | Side effects (cleanup, logging), queue emptied |\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Event Loop Tick Implementation**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Starving timers or tasks due to infinite I/O**\n- **Description**: If a continuous stream of I/O events occurs (e.g., a fast client sending data), the loop may never progress beyond step 3 because `epoll_wait` always returns immediately with events. Timers never get checked, and deferred tasks never run.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Timers don't fire, causing idle connections to never timeout. Deferred tasks (like cleanup) accumulate, causing memory leaks.\n- **Fix**: Ensure `epoll_wait` has a non-zero timeout even when I/O is busy. Cap the number of I/O events processed per tick (e.g., process at most `2 * max_events` per tick before breaking to timer/task phases). Alternatively, use a separate mechanism to force timer checks, like a periodic signal or checking monotonic clock between iterations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Callback modifying event set during iteration**\n- **Description**: While iterating through the `epoll_event` array, a callback calls `event_loop_modify_fd()` or `event_loop_unregister_fd()` for the same fd being processed. This may corrupt the event array or cause undefined behavior.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Modifying the underlying epoll set while iterating over the result of `epoll_wait` is safe in Linux (the returned array is a snapshot), but modifying the **same fd's events** can lead to confusion about which events were actually present.\n- **Fix**: Defer modifications until after the I/O processing loop. For example, when a read callback completes a request and needs to register `EPOLLOUT`, set a flag in the connection and perform the modification after all events are processed. Alternatively, use the `EPOLLONESHOT` flag to automatically deregister after an event, then re-register with desired events.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect timeout calculation leading to drift**\n- **Description**: Using a simple `sleep` or assuming each tick takes exactly `timeout_ms` milliseconds causes timer drift over time. Real-world `epoll_wait` may return early due to signals or I/O, and processing takes variable time.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Timers become increasingly inaccurate; a 30-second idle timeout might fire after 35 seconds.\n- **Fix**: Base time on a monotonic clock (`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`) rather than assuming elapsed time. Store the clock value before `epoll_wait` and after, compute actual elapsed milliseconds, and advance the timer wheel by that amount. This ensures timers expire at correct absolute times regardless of processing overhead.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations Table**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Time Measurement | `gettimeofday()` (microsecond resolution) | `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` (nanosecond, not affected by system time changes) |\n| Epoll Event Loop | Level-triggered (default) with manual `EPOLLOUT` registration | Edge-triggered (`EPOLLET`) with careful buffer exhaustion checks |\n| Timer Wheel Resolution | Fixed 1ms ticks (requires high-frequency `epoll_wait` timeout) | Configurable resolution (e.g., 10ms) with cascading levels |\n| Buffer Management | Fixed-size per-connection buffers (4KB) | Dynamic growth with upper limit;

Ensure proper cleanup in destructor.\n- **Non-blocking I/O**: After `accept()`, set socket non-blocking with `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)`. Handle `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` in read/write loops.\n- **Timer wheel time**: Use `monotonic_time_ms()` for current time in timer wheel to avoid issues when system time changes.\n- **Connection cleanup**: Always `close(fd)` and free buffers in `connection_destroy()`. Set pointers to NULL after freeing to catch use-after-free.\n- **Error handling**: Check all system call returns. Use `perror()` for logging during development.\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint: Verifying the Event Loop Tick**\n\nAfter implementing the event loop core (Milestone 1), verify the tick flow:\n\n1. **Start the echo server**: Compile and run `./server 8080`.\n2. **Connect multiple clients**: In separate terminals, run `telnet localhost 8080`.\n3. **Observe I/O processing**: Type a line in one telnet session. It should be echoed back immediately.\n4. **Verify timer integration**: After implementing timer wheel (Milestone 2), add a 5-second idle timeout. Connect a client but don't send data. Wait 5 seconds; the connection should close automatically.\n5. **Check deferred tasks**: Add a deferred task that logs \"tick\" every 100 iterations. Run server and observe log output.\n\n**Expected behavior**: The server handles multiple concurrent connections without blocking. CPU usage should be near 0% when idle, spike briefly when processing data. No connections should hang or leak.\n\n**Debugging Tips**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| CPU at 100% when idle | `epoll_wait` timeout set to 0 or too small | Print calculated timeout before `epoll_wait`; ensure it's -1 when no timers | Properly compute `timer_wheel_next_expiration()`; cap minimum timeout to e.g., 1ms |\n| Timer timeouts inaccurate (fire late) | Not using monotonic clock; assuming each tick takes exactly `timeout_ms` | Log actual elapsed time using `monotonic_time_ms()` before and after `epoll_wait` | Implement precise time measurement; advance timer wheel by actual elapsed milliseconds |\n| Some connections never get data | Forgot to set non-blocking on accepted sockets | Check `fcntl` return value; add logging when `accept4` fails | Use `accept4` with `SOCK_NONBLOCK` or call `set_nonblocking()` after `accept` |\n| Write buffer never empties | `EPOLLOUT` not registered when write returns `EAGAIN` | Log when `connection_write()` returns `EAGAIN`; check event registration | After partial write, call `event_loop_modify_fd()` to add `EPOLLOUT` |\n| Memory leak over time | Connections not destroyed on close; timer references not freed | Use `valgrind --leak-check=full ./server`; add counters for connections created/destroyed | Ensure `connection_destroy()` frees all resources; cancel timer before destroying connection |\n\n\n## Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nIn an event-driven system handling 10,000+ concurrent connections, robust error handling isn't just about correctness—it's about survival. Each unhandled error can gradually leak resources until the system becomes unresponsive. Unlike traditional blocking I/O where errors appear as obvious failures in a single thread, non-blocking event loops require anticipating failures across thousands of independent connections while maintaining system stability.\n\nThink of error handling in an event loop like air traffic control at a busy airport. The controller (event loop) must handle routine operations (normal I/O) while constantly monitoring for emergencies (errors), managing fuel shortages (resource constraints), and dealing with unresponsive pilots (slow clients). Missing a single distress signal or allowing one plane to occupy the runway too long can cascade into system-wide failure.\n\n### Non-Blocking I/O Error Patterns\n\nNon-blocking I/O fundamentally changes how errors manifest. Instead of operations failing with hard errors, they often return \"soft\" conditions that indicate \"try again later\" or \"the connection state changed.\" Successful event loop implementation requires treating these not as exceptions but as expected, routine conditions.\n\n**Mental Model: The Restaurant with a Ticket System**  \nImagine a busy restaurant where waitstaff (the event loop) take orders (read requests) and deliver food (write responses). When the kitchen is temporarily backed up, the waitstaff don't stop working—they check back later (`EAGAIN`). If a customer leaves without paying (connection reset), the waitstaff don't panic—they simply clean the table (`ECONNRESET`). If a customer's mouth is full when trying to deliver more food (pipe broken), they wait until the customer is ready (`EPIPE`). Each condition has a standard operating procedure.\n\n#### Common Error Conditions and Their Handling\n\nThe following table catalogs the critical error patterns and their proper handling in the event loop context:\n\n| Error Condition | Detection Method | Typical Cause | Recovery Action | Notes |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|\n| **`EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`** | `errno` after `read()`/`write()`/`accept()` | Non-blocking operation cannot complete immediately | Stop current operation, maintain current state, wait for next `EPOLLIN`/`EPOLLOUT` notification | Not actually an error—expected behavior in non-blocking mode |\n| **`ECONNRESET`** | `errno` after `read()`/`write()` | Remote peer abruptly closed connection (TCP RST) | Immediately close local socket, free connection resources, deregister from epoll | May occur on either read or write operations |\n| **`EPIPE`** | `errno` after `write()` | Writing to socket whose read side is closed (broken pipe) | Close socket, deregister from epoll | Often accompanied by `SIGPIPE` signal; disable signal with `MSG_NOSIGNAL` or `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` |\n| **`EINTR`** | `errno` after system call | System call interrupted by signal | Restart the same system call (with same parameters) | Most system calls in event loop should be retried |\n| **`EBADF`** | `errno` after system call | File descriptor is invalid (already closed) | Log error, skip processing for this fd | Indicates programming error in fd lifecycle management |\n| **`ENOMEM`** | `errno` after `malloc()`/`accept()` | System out of memory | Close least important connections, continue serving | Apply backpressure by rejecting new connections |\n| **`EMFILE`** | `errno` after `accept()` | Process file descriptor limit reached | Stop accepting temporarily, close idle connections | Use `epoll` to monitor listening socket only when below threshold |\n| **`EFAULT`** | `errno` after system call | Invalid buffer pointer (programming bug) | Log and terminate program | Cannot recover from memory corruption |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Treating EAGAIN as Expected Flow, Not Error**\n> - **Context**: In non-blocking I/O, operations frequently cannot complete immediately. The system must distinguish between temporary unavailability and permanent failure.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Treat all non-zero return values as errors requiring connection closure\n>   2. Special-case `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` but treat other errors as fatal\n>   3. Categorize errors into retryable, connection-fatal, and system-fatal\n> - **Decision**: Implement option 3 with detailed categorization\n> - **Rationale**: Option 1 would close connections prematurely under load. Option 2 misses important distinctions (e.g., `EINTR` should retry, `ENOMEM` requires different handling than `ECONNRESET`). Detailed categorization maximizes connection longevity while ensuring resource recovery.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex error handling logic but higher connection stability under varying network conditions.\n\n| Error Category | Example Errors | Handling Strategy | Connection Fate |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Retryable** | `EAGAIN`, `EWOULDBLOCK`, `EINTR` | Retry later (same event loop tick or next notification) | Preserved |\n| **Connection-Fatal** | `ECONNRESET`, `EPIPE`, `ETIMEDOUT` | Close connection, free resources | Terminated |\n| **System-Fatal** | `ENOMEM`, `EMFILE`, `EFAULT` | Apply backpressure, log, possible graceful degradation | May terminate some connections |\n\n#### Implementation Strategy for Error Handling in `connection_read()` and `connection_write()`\n\nEach I/O operation in the event loop follows a consistent error handling pattern:\n\n1. **Attempt Operation**: Call `read()` or `write()` on non-blocking socket\n2. **Check Return Value**:\n   - `> 0`: Success, process data\n   - `= 0`: EOF (remote closed gracefully), initiate clean closure\n   - `-1`: Check `errno` for specific condition\n3. **Handle `errno` Cases**:\n   - `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`: Update epoll registration if needed, return \"incomplete\"\n   - `ECONNRESET`/`EPIPE`: Mark connection for closure\n   - Others: Log, classify, take appropriate action\n4. **State Machine Transition**: Update `connection` state based on outcome\n\n**Example Walkthrough: Handling Partial Read with EAGAIN**  \nConsider a connection in `STATE_READING` with `read_buffer` size 4096 bytes. The event loop receives `EPOLLIN` notification and calls `connection_read()`:\n\n1. `read()` returns 2048 bytes (half the buffer filled)\n2. The HTTP parser processes these bytes but doesn't find a complete request\n3. Next `read()` attempt returns -1 with `errno = EAGAIN`\n4. Instead of closing the connection, we:\n   - Update `read_buffer_used` to 2048\n   - Keep connection in `STATE_READING`\n   - Ensure epoll still has `EPOLLIN` interest (level-triggered will re-notify)\n   - Return to event loop to process other connections\n5. When more data arrives, epoll will notify again, and we resume reading\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Non-Blocking Error Handling\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Treating EAGAIN as Fatal Error**  \n**Description**: Closing connections when `read()`/`write()` returns -1 with `EAGAIN`  \n**Why It's Wrong**: This eliminates the benefit of non-blocking I/O—connections would close under normal load when buffers are temporarily full  \n**Fix**: Always check `errno` after -1 return; handle `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` as \"operation incomplete\"\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring ECONNRESET on Write**  \n**Description**: Assuming connection errors only appear on read operations  \n**Why It's Wrong**: A peer may send RST while we're writing, causing `ECONNRESET` on `write()`  \n**Fix**: Check for connection-fatal errors after both `read()` and `write()` operations\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting to Handle EPIPE Signal**  \n**Description**: Process crashes when writing to closed connection due to `SIGPIPE`  \n**Why It's Wrong**: Default Unix behavior sends `SIGPIPE` to process writing to broken pipe  \n**Fix**: Set `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` at program start or use `send(fd, buf, len, MSG_NOSIGNAL)`\n\n### Edge Cases: Slow Clients and Backpressure\n\nIn high-concurrency systems, a small number of slow clients can consume disproportionate resources, eventually causing denial of service to well-behaved clients. This \"slow client problem\" requires deliberate backpressure mechanisms and careful buffer management.\n\n**Mental Model: The Highway On-Ramp Metering System**  \nImagine a highway (server resources) with many on-ramps (client connections). Without metering, a few slow-moving vehicles (slow clients) entering the highway can cause traffic jams for everyone. The metering system (backpressure) regulates how quickly vehicles enter based on highway capacity. Each on-ramp has a limited queue space (write buffer). When the queue fills, new vehicles must wait (application pauses writes).\n\n#### Managing Write Buffers with EPOLLOUT Backpressure\n\nThe core challenge with slow clients is managing the write path. When a client cannot accept data as fast as we can send it, we must avoid unbounded buffer growth while maintaining efficient resource utilization.\n\n**Backpressure Strategy Using epoll Edge-Triggered Mode**  \nEdge-triggered epoll (`EPOLLET`) provides natural backpressure by only notifying when the socket transitions from unwritable to writable:\n\n1. **Initial State**: After generating response data, attempt `write()`\n2. **Partial Write**: If `write()` returns fewer bytes than buffer content (or `EAGAIN`), store remaining data in `write_buffer`\n3. **Register EPOLLOUT**: Call `event_loop_modify_fd()` to add `EPOLLOUT` interest\n4. **Wait for Notification**: Event loop won't notify again until socket becomes writable\n5. **EPOLLOUT Notification**: When client can accept more data, epoll notifies\n6. **Resume Write**: Attempt another `write()` from remaining buffer\n7. **Completion**: When buffer empty, remove `EPOLLOUT` interest with `event_loop_modify_fd()`\n\n**Write Buffer State Machine**  \nThe `connection`'s write buffer management follows this state machine:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Action |\n|---------------|-------|------------|--------|\n| `WRITE_IDLE` | Response data generated | `WRITE_PENDING` | Copy data to `write_buffer`, attempt `write()` |\n| `WRITE_PENDING` | `write()` succeeds fully | `WRITE_IDLE` | Clear `write_buffer`, keep only `EPOLLIN` interest |\n| `WRITE_PENDING` | `write()` partial/`EAGAIN` | `WRITE_BACKPRESSURED` | Keep unsent data in buffer, add `EPOLLOUT` interest |\n| `WRITE_BACKPRESSURED` | `EPOLLOUT` notification | `WRITE_PENDING` | Attempt `write()` on remaining buffer |\n| `WRITE_BACKPRESSURED` | Timeout expires | `STATE_CLOSING` | Close connection (slow client) |\n| Any write state | `EPOLLHUP`/`EPOLLERR` | `STATE_CLOSING` | Close connection immediately |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Fixed-Size vs. Dynamic Write Buffers**\n> - **Context**: Each connection needs buffer space for pending writes when clients are slow. Buffer sizing impacts memory usage and fairness.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fixed-size buffers per connection (`WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE` bytes)\n>   2. Dynamically growing buffers (realloc as needed)\n>   3. Per-connection buffer pools with chunked allocation\n> - **Decision**: Fixed-size buffers with fair queuing\n> - **Rationale**: Fixed buffers provide predictable memory usage critical for 10K connections (e.g., 4KB × 10K = 40MB). Dynamic buffers could exhaust memory from few slow clients. Buffer pools add complexity without solving the fundamental problem: slow clients shouldn't consume unbounded resources.\n> - **Consequences**: When write buffer fills, we must stop generating data for that connection, potentially requiring flow control at application protocol level.\n\n#### Handling Half-Closed Connections (TCP FIN)\n\nTCP allows independent closure of each direction of communication (half-close), creating subtle edge cases:\n\n**Scenario**: Client sends `FIN` (reads closed) but keeps write side open\n- **Detection**: `read()` returns 0 (EOF) but `write()` may still succeed\n- **Proper Handling**: \n  1. When `read()` returns 0, mark read side closed\n  2. If write buffer has pending data, continue attempting writes\n  3. After write buffer empties, send `FIN` with `shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)` or close\n  4. Monitor for client's `FIN` to fully close\n\n**Implementation Table for Half-Close States**:\n\n| Socket State | Read Behavior | Write Behavior | epoll Events | Action |\n|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------|\n| **Fully open** | Normal | Normal | `EPOLLIN`\\|`EPOLLOUT` | Normal processing |\n| **Read-side closed** | `read()` returns 0 | May succeed | `EPOLLIN` (hup) | Complete writes, then close |\n| **Write-side closed** | May succeed | `write()` fails with `EPIPE` | `EPOLLOUT` (hup) | Close immediately |\n| **Both sides closed** | `read()` returns 0 | `write()` fails | `EPOLLHUP` | Close immediately |\n\n#### Slow Loris Attack Mitigation\n\nA Slow Loris attack opens many connections and sends data extremely slowly, exhausting server resources. Our architecture provides natural defenses:\n\n1. **Idle Timeouts**: Timer wheel closes connections inactive for configurable period\n2. **Read Timeouts**: Separate timeout for incomplete requests (e.g., 10 seconds for HTTP headers)\n3. **Connection Limits**: Maximum concurrent connections prevents exhaustion\n4. **Buffer Limits**: Fixed read buffer prevents slow clients from consuming unbounded memory\n\n**Timeout Hierarchy for HTTP Connections**:\n\n| Timeout Type | Typical Value | Reset Condition | Expiration Action |\n|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| **Keep-alive idle** | 5 seconds | Any data received | Close connection |\n| **Header read** | 10 seconds | Complete header received | Close connection |\n| **Request body** | 30 seconds | Body bytes received | Close connection |\n| **Write backpressure** | 30 seconds | Write completes | Close connection |\n\n**Example Walkthrough: Handling Slow Client with Partial Writes**  \nA client connects and requests a 100KB file. The server generates response but client has poor connectivity:\n\n1. Server writes 8KB successfully, but next `write()` returns `EAGAIN`\n2. Server registers `EPOLLOUT`, moves to `WRITE_BACKPRESSURED` state\n3. Timer wheel adds write timeout (30 seconds)\n4. Client receives data slowly over 15 seconds, triggering occasional `EPOLLOUT` notifications\n5. Each notification writes more data until buffer empty\n6. Server removes `EPOLLOUT` interest, cancels write timeout\n7. If timeout had expired first, server would close connection\n\n#### Common Pitfalls with Backpressure and Slow Clients\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unbounded Write Buffer Growth**  \n**Description**: Continuously appending to write buffer when client can't keep up  \n**Why It's Wrong**: Single slow client can exhaust all server memory, causing denial of service  \n**Fix**: Use fixed-size buffer; when full, stop generating data and apply backpressure to application layer\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Busy Loop on EPOLLOUT**  \n**Description**: In level-triggered mode, continuously receiving `EPOLLOUT` when socket writable  \n**Why It's Wrong**: Wastes CPU when client is slow but socket buffer has some space  \n**Fix**: Use edge-triggered (`EPOLLET`) or deregister `EPOLLOUT` after write attempt, re-register when `EAGAIN`\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring FIN While Write Buffer Pending**  \n**Description**: Closing connection immediately when `read()` returns 0, even with pending writes  \n**Why It's Wrong**: Client may still be reading our response; immediate close loses data  \n**Fix**: Implement proper half-close handling: complete pending writes before full close\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: No Per-Connection Write Timeout**  \n**Description**: Allowing slow client to hold buffer indefinitely  \n**Why It's Wrong**: Enables Slow Loris attacks and resource exhaustion  \n**Fix**: Timer wheel timeout for each connection in `WRITE_BACKPRESSURED` state\n\n### Resource Exhaustion Strategies\n\nAt 10,000+ connections, resource exhaustion becomes a real concern. The system must gracefully degrade rather than catastrophically fail.\n\n**Memory Pressure Response**:\n1. **Monitor Allocation Failures**: When `malloc()` returns NULL, close idle connections first\n2. **Connection Prioritization**: Under memory pressure, close connections with:\n   - No pending requests\n   - No write buffer data\n   - Longest idle time\n3. **Emergency Mode**: Stop accepting new connections when below free memory threshold\n\n**File Descriptor Exhaustion Response**:\n1. **Monitor `accept()` Failures**: When `EMFILE` occurs, temporarily disable listening socket monitoring\n2. **LRU Connection Closure**: Close least recently used connections to free file descriptors\n3. **Gradual Recovery**: Re-enable acceptance when FD count drops below threshold (e.g., 90% of limit)\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A. Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Error Detection** | Check `errno` after each system call | Use `getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR)` for deferred error checking |\n| **Backpressure Signaling** | Fixed-size buffers with `EAGAIN` handling | Dynamic buffer sizing with watermarks and application-level flow control |\n| **Timeout Management** | Single idle timeout per connection | Multiple hierarchical timeouts (header, body, keep-alive, write) |\n\n#### B.

Language-Specific Hints for C\n\n1. **`errno` Preservation**: `errno` is thread-local but can be overwritten by library calls. Save it immediately after system call failure:\n   ```c\n   ssize_t n = write(fd, buf, len);\n   if (n < 0) {\n       int saved_errno = errno;  // Save immediately\n       // ... use saved_errno\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Socket Error Checking**: Use `getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, ...)` to check for asynchronous errors that epoll might report via `EPOLLERR`.\n\n3. **Non-Blocking Accept**: Even with non-blocking listening socket, `accept()` can return `EAGAIN` if no pending connections between epoll notification and accept call.\n\n4. **Portability**: `EAGAIN` and `EWOULDBLOCK` may have the same value on some systems but different on others. Check for both.\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint: Error Handling Verification\n\n**After implementing error handling, verify with these tests:**\n\n1. **Slow Client Test**:\n   ```\n   $ nc localhost 8080\n   (Type very slowly, one character every 10 seconds)\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Server should timeout connection after idle timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) instead of waiting forever.\n\n2. **Connection Reset Test**:\n   ```\n   $ python3 -c \"import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.connect(('localhost',8080)); s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_LINGER, struct.pack('ii',1,0)); s.close()\"\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Server should handle `ECONNRESET` gracefully without crashing, logging appropriate message.\n\n3. **Memory Pressure Test**:\n   ```\n   $ ulimit -n 1000  # Limit file descriptors\n   $ ./server  # Start server\n   $ ./test_client --connections 2000  # Attempt to exceed limits\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Server should reject new connections when near limit rather than crashing.\n\n4. **Write Backpressure Verification**:\n   ```\n   $ ./slow_receiver.py  # Client that reads 1 byte/second\n   $ curl http://localhost:8080/large-file.bin\n   ```\n   **Expected**: Server should pause writes when client buffer fills, resume when client reads.\n\n#### G. Debugging Tips for Error Scenarios\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **CPU at 100%** | Busy loop on `EPOLLOUT` (level-triggered) | Check if `EPOLLOUT` handler runs continuously | Use edge-triggered or deregister `EPOLLOUT` after write attempt |\n| **Connections stuck in `WRITING`** | Missing `EPOLLOUT` registration after `EAGAIN` | Log when write returns `EAGAIN` and verify `event_loop_modify_fd()` called | Ensure `EPOLLOUT` added when write blocks |\n| **Memory exhaustion with few clients** | Unbounded buffer growth | Monitor `write_buffer_used` per connection; set maximum | Implement fixed buffer size and backpressure |\n| **Random connection resets** | Missing `EAGAIN` handling | Add logging to `connection_read()`/`connection_write()` errno handling | Check for all retryable errors (`EAGAIN`, `EWOULDBLOCK`, `EINTR`) |\n| `accept()` returning `EMFILE` | File descriptor leak | Use `lsof -p <pid>` to see open files; check connection cleanup | Ensure all closed sockets have resources freed and epoll deregistered |\n\n---\n\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nTesting a high-concurrency event loop server requires a multi-layered approach that verifies correctness at each architectural level while maintaining the performance characteristics that make the system valuable. Think of testing this system like validating a high-performance race car: you need individual component tests (engine, brakes, transmission), integration tests (how the powertrain works together), and finally track testing under realistic load conditions to verify it actually achieves 10,000+ concurrent connections with stable performance.\n\nThe testing strategy must address three critical dimensions: **functional correctness** (does it handle connections correctly?), **concurrency robustness** (does it handle 10K connections without failure?), and **performance characteristics** (does it maintain acceptable latency under load?). Each milestone introduces new complexity that requires specific verification approaches, from basic echo functionality in Milestone 1 to full HTTP protocol compliance in Milestone 4.\n\n### Unit and Integration Tests\n\nUnit testing focuses on individual components in isolation, while integration testing verifies that components work together correctly. Given the event-driven nature of the system, traditional unit testing approaches need adaptation to handle asynchronous callbacks and non-blocking I/O.\n\n#### Timer Wheel Unit Testing\n\nThe hierarchical timer wheel is a complex data structure with specific performance guarantees. Testing it requires verifying both correctness (timers fire at the right time) and performance (O(1) operations).\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of the timer wheel as a multi-tiered conveyor belt system in a factory. Items (timers) are placed on different belts based on when they need to be processed. The belts move at different speeds, and items must cascade from slower belts to faster belts as their deadline approaches. Testing ensures items don't fall off the belts, don't get processed too early or late, and the conveyor system doesn't jam under heavy load.\n\n**Test Strategy Table**:\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Verification Method | Expected Outcome |\n|---------------|------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Basic Operations | Insert single timer, tick before expiration | Manual timer counting | Timer doesn't fire early |\n| Basic Operations | Insert single timer, tick past expiration | Callback invocation check | Timer fires exactly once |\n| Basic Operations | Insert and cancel timer before expiration | Memory leak check | Timer callback never invoked, memory freed |\n| Cascading Behavior | Insert timer that spans multiple wheel levels | Internal state inspection | Timer cascades correctly through levels |\n| Performance | Insert 10,000 timers with random expirations | Time measurement | All operations complete in O(1) time |\n| Edge Cases | Insert timer with 0ms timeout | Immediate execution check | Timer fires on next `timer_wheel_tick` |\n| Edge Cases | Insert timer with very large timeout (overflow) | Boundary checking | Timer handled correctly or rejected |\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: Timer Wheel Testing Approach**\n\n> **Decision: Mockable Time Source for Deterministic Testing**\n> \n> - **Context**: The timer wheel depends on monotonic time for determining when timers expire. Real-time sources make tests non-deterministic and flaky.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Use real `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` and rely on timing tolerances\n>   2. Inject a mock time source via function pointer\n>   3. Build deterministic test harness with controllable virtual time\n> - **Decision**: Use a mockable time source via function pointer in the `timer_wheel` structure\n> - **Rationale**: Deterministic tests are essential for CI/CD pipelines. A mock time source allows tests to \"fast-forward\" time without waiting, making tests run quickly and predictably. The function pointer approach adds minimal overhead (one indirect call) while providing full test control.\n> - **Consequences**: The `timer_wheel` structure must store a `get_time_ms` function pointer. Production code uses `clock_gettime`, while tests use a controlled counter. This adds one function pointer dereference per time query but enables comprehensive testing.\n\n**Timer Wheel Test Comparison Table**:\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Selected? |\n|--------|------|------|-----------|\n| Real time with tolerances | Simple implementation, no abstraction | Flaky tests, slow test execution | ❌ |\n| Function pointer injection | Deterministic tests, fast execution | Slight runtime overhead, more complex interface | ✅ |\n| Virtual time harness | Most control, can simulate edge cases | Heavy infrastructure, diverges from production | ❌ |\n\n**Common Timer Wheel Testing Pitfalls**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming Linear Time Progression in Tests**\n- **Description**: Writing tests that assume `timer_wheel_tick` is called at regular intervals matching the wheel resolution.\n- **Why It's Wrong**: In production, `timer_wheel_tick` may be called irregularly based on I/O activity. The wheel must handle time jumps correctly (timer cascading).\n- **Fix**: Test with irregular time progressions: small jumps, large jumps, backward jumps (though monotonic time shouldn't go backward), and skipped ticks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Testing Timer Cancellation Race Conditions**\n- **Description**: Testing timer cancellation only in isolation, not when a timer is about to expire.\n- **Why It's Wrong**: In production, a timer might be cancelled in a callback while the wheel is iterating through expired timers.\n- **Fix**: Create stress tests where timers are cancelled from other timer callbacks, and verify no use-after-free or double-free occurs.\n\n#### HTTP Parser Unit Testing\n\nThe incremental HTTP parser must handle partial data, malformed requests, and various HTTP/1.1 features. Unlike a batch parser that receives complete requests, the incremental parser maintains state between calls to `http_parser_feed`.\n\n**Mental Model**: Imagine the HTTP parser as a factory assembly line inspector. Parts of an HTTP request (bytes) arrive on a conveyor belt at irregular intervals. The inspector must examine each part as it arrives, determine if it's a valid piece of a request, and raise a flag when a complete, valid request has passed through. Sometimes defective parts arrive (malformed bytes), and the inspector must reject them without stopping the entire line.\n\n**HTTP Parser Test Matrix**:\n| Test Scenario | Input Pattern | Expected Parser State | Expected Output |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| Complete request in one chunk | Full HTTP request | `HTTP_READING` → `HTTP_WRITING` | Request fully parsed |\n| Split across read boundaries | \"GET / HT\" then \"TP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\" | `HTTP_READING` persists between feeds | Request parsed after second feed |\n| Headers across multiple reads | Headers split mid-line | Header state maintained | All headers correctly assembled |\n| Chunked encoding | Transfer-Encoding: chunked | Handles chunk size and data separately | Body correctly reconstructed |\n| Malformed method | \"GEX / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\" | Error state with error code | `http_parser_feed` returns error |\n| Request too large | Headers exceed buffer | Error state for overflow | Parser rejects with size error |\n| Keep-alive vs close | Connection header variations | Sets keep-alive flag correctly | Correct connection handling |\n\n**Step-by-Step Parser Test Procedure**:\n\n1. **Initialize parser**: Create `http_parser` instance with `http_parser_create()`\n2. **Feed partial data**: Call `http_parser_feed()` with first chunk of request data\n3. **Verify intermediate state**: Check parser state indicates more data needed\n4. **Feed remaining data**: Provide remaining bytes to complete request\n5. **Verify completion**: Check parser indicates headers are complete\n6. **Extract parsed request**: Use accessor functions to validate parsed fields\n7. **Reset for next request**: Call `http_parser_reset()` and verify clean state\n\n**Edge Case Testing Table**:\n| Edge Case | Test Approach | Validation |\n|-----------|---------------|------------|\n| Empty read (EAGAIN) | Feed 0 bytes to parser | Parser state unchanged |\n| CRLF vs LF line endings | Mix of \\r\\n and \\n | Headers parsed correctly regardless |\n| Unicode in headers | UTF-8 in header values | Preserved or rejected based on policy |\n| Multiple consecutive requests | Keep-alive connection | Parser resets correctly between requests |\n| Extremely long URL | URL exceeds buffer | Handled with configurable max |\n| Missing Host header (HTTP/1.1) | Request without Host | Parser rejects or handles based on spec |\n\n#### Event Loop Integration Testing\n\nIntegration testing verifies that the event loop coordinates correctly between I/O, timers, and callbacks. This requires creating mock sockets or using socketpair to simulate network behavior without actual network stack.\n\n**Test Architecture Decision**:\n\n> **Decision: Use Socketpair for Loopback Testing**\n> \n> - **Context**: Testing network code requires simulating connection establishment, data transfer, and closure without involving the actual network stack.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Real network sockets (localhost)\n>   2. Socketpair() for loopback within process\n>   3. Mock file descriptor layer\n> - **Decision**: Use `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM | SOCK_NONBLOCK, 0)` to create connected socket pairs\n> - **Rationale**: Socketpair provides real file descriptors with full TCP-like semantics (stream-oriented, bidirectional) but operates entirely in kernel memory without network overhead. The non-blocking flag ensures it works with the event loop. This approach tests the actual epoll code path without network variability.\n> - **Consequences**: Tests run fast and deterministically. However, some TCP-specific behaviors (Nagle's algorithm, TCP_NODELAY, SO_LINGER) aren't tested, requiring supplemental integration tests with real network.\n\n**Integration Test Sequence**:\n\n1. **Setup phase**:\n   - Create event loop with `event_loop_create(MAX_EVENTS)`\n   - Create socket pair: `socketpair()` yields two FDs (server_fd, client_fd)\n   - Set both to non-blocking with `set_nonblocking()`\n   - Register server_fd with event loop for read events\n\n2. **Connection establishment test**:\n   - Write data to client_fd (simulating client request)\n   - Run event loop for one iteration with `event_loop_run(loop, 10)`\n   - Verify read callback invoked on server_fd\n   - Verify data read matches data written\n\n3. **Timer integration test**:\n   - Add timer via `timer_wheel_add()` with short timeout\n   - Run event loop with timeout longer than timer expiration\n   - Verify timer callback invoked\n   - Verify timer removed from wheel after firing\n\n4. **Backpressure simulation test**:\n   - Fill write buffer on server_fd\n   - Attempt to write more data (should return EAGAIN)\n   - Verify EPOLLOUT registration occurs\n   - Drain buffer from client side\n   - Verify write callback invoked and remaining data sent\n\n**Common Integration Testing Pitfalls**:\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Testing Event Loop with Full epoll_wait Buffer**\n- **Description**: Testing with only a few events, never hitting the `max_events` limit of epoll_wait.\n- **Why It's Wrong**: In production with 10K connections, epoll_wait may return hundreds of ready events per iteration. The event loop must handle all returned events correctly.\n- **Fix**: Create tests that generate more ready file descriptors than `MAX_EVENTS` (typically 1024) and verify all are processed in a single loop iteration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming Immediate Callback Execution**\n- **Description**: Tests that assume a callback runs immediately after the triggering event.\n- **Why It's Wrong**: In the actual event loop, callbacks are scheduled in the deferred task queue and execute after all I/O events in the current tick.\n- **Fix**: Structure tests to run full event loop iterations and verify callback execution order matches the documented sequence (I/O events → timer tick → deferred tasks).\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints and Verification\n\nEach milestone has specific acceptance criteria that must be verified through both automated tests and manual verification. The following checkpoints provide concrete steps to validate progress.\n\n#### Milestone 1: epoll Basics\n\n**Acceptance Criteria Verification Table**:\n| Criteria | Verification Method | Expected Result | Command/Tool |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| epoll instance creation | Check return value and error handling | `epoll_create1()` returns valid FD > 0 | Program startup logs |\n| Listening socket registration | Monitor epoll events | Listening FD appears in epoll_wait returns | `strace -e epoll_ctl` |\n| Non-blocking socket configuration | Attempt blocking operation | `accept()` returns EAGAIN when no connections | Test with `fcntl` inspection |\n| Multiple concurrent connections | Connect multiple clients | All connections accepted and serviced | `telnet` x10 concurrently |\n| Echo functionality | Send data, check echo | Data returned identically | `echo \"test\" | nc localhost 8080` |\n| Non-blocking read/write handling | Send partial data | Server handles EAGAIN correctly | Slow client simulation |\n\n**Manual Verification Procedure**:\n\n1. **Start the echo server**:\n   ```bash\n   ./event_loop_server --port 8080 --echo\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify basic connectivity** (in separate terminal):\n   ```bash\n   echo \"Hello, event loop\" | nc localhost 8080\n   ```\n   Expected output: \"Hello, event loop\" echoed back.\n\n3. **Test concurrent connections**:\n   ```bash\n   # Start 10 concurrent connections\n   for i in {1..10}; do\n     (echo \"Connection $i\" | nc localhost 8080 -w 1) &\n   done\n   wait\n   ```\n   Expected: All connections receive correct echo without server crash.\n\n4. **Test non-blocking behavior**:\n   ```bash\n   # Use telnet to send data slowly\n   telnet localhost 8080\n   # Type characters one by one with delays\n   ```\n   Expected: Server handles partial reads without blocking, eventually echoes complete input.\n\n5. **Monitor epoll activity** (for debugging):\n   ```bash\n   strace -e epoll_wait,epoll_ctl -p $(pidof event_loop_server)\n   ```\n   Expected: See regular epoll_wait returns with multiple events under load.\n\n**Milestone 1 Success Criteria**:\n- Server handles at least 100 concurrent echo connections without dropping\n- CPU usage remains low (< 5%) when idle\n- Memory usage grows linearly with connections (check for leaks)\n- No blocking calls (verify with `strace`)\n\n#### Milestone 2: Timer Wheel and Timeouts\n\n**Acceptance Criteria Verification Table**:\n| Criteria | Verification Method | Expected Result | Validation Command |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| O(1) timer operations | Performance measurement | Insert/delete 10K timers < 10ms | Benchmark test program |\n| Connection idle timeouts | Inactive connection test | Connection closes after timeout | `telnet` then wait |\n| epoll_wait timeout integration | Timer-driven wakeups | epoll_wait returns before timer expiry | Log timestamps |\n| Timer cancellation | Active connection reset | Timer removed on activity, connection stays open | Send data before timeout |\n| Hierarchical wheel correctness | Timer distribution test | Timers fire at correct times across time scales | Test with varied timeouts |\n\n**Verification Test Suite**:\n\n1. **Timer Wheel Unit Test**:\n   ```bash\n   ./test_timer_wheel\n   ```\n   Expected output: All tests pass, including performance test showing O(1) characteristics.\n\n2. **Idle Timeout Integration Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Start server with 5-second idle timeout\n   ./event_loop_server --port 8080 --idle-timeout 5000\n  \n   # Connect but send no data\n   nc localhost 8080 &\n   NC_PID=$!\n  \n   # Wait 6 seconds\n   sleep 6\n  \n   # Check if connection closed\n   kill -0 $NC_PID 2>/dev/null && echo \"FAIL: Connection still alive\" || echo \"PASS: Connection closed\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Timer Cancellation Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Start server with 10-second timeout\n   ./event_loop_server --port 8080 --idle-timeout 10000\n  \n   # Connect and send periodic data\n   (echo \"initial\"; sleep 3; echo \"refresh\"; sleep 3; echo \"refresh\") | nc localhost 8080\n   ```\n   Expected: Connection remains open through refreshes, closes only after final 10-second inactivity.\n\n4. **Timer Performance Benchmark**:\n   ```bash\n   ./benchmark_timer --timers 10000 --operations 100000\n   ```\n   Expected: Average operation time < 1μs, linear scaling with operation count.\n\n**Common Milestone 2 Verification Issues**:\n\n- **Timer not firing**: Check that `epoll_wait` timeout is calculated from `timer_wheel_next_expiration()`\n- **Premature timeout**: Verify timer cancellation on I/O activity removes timer from wheel\n- **Memory leak in timers**: Use valgrind to track timer allocation/deallocation\n- **Clock skew issues**: Ensure using `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` not `CLOCK_REALTIME`\n\n#### Milestone 3: Async Task Scheduling\n\n**Acceptance Criteria Verification Table**:\n| Criteria | Verification Method | Expected Result | Test Approach |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Callback registration API | API usage test | Clean registration/deregistration | Unit test with mock FDs |\n| Deferred task queue | Execution order test | Tasks run after I/O, in registration order | Test with sequence logging |\n| One-shot timers | Single execution test | Callback fires once, not re-registered | Timer test with counter |\n| Repeating timers | Multiple execution test | Callback fires at each interval | Test with 3+ iterations |\n| Event registration set safety | Modification during iteration | No crash when callbacks modify registrations | Stress test with concurrent mods |\n| Callback re-entrancy | Nested registration test | System handles callbacks registering new callbacks | Recursive callback test |\n\n**Verification Procedures**:\n\n1. **Callback API Test**:\n   ```bash\n   ./test_callback_api\n   ```\n   Expected: Tests demonstrate registering read/write/timer callbacks, modifying interest, and clean teardown.\n\n2. **Deferred Task Order Verification**:\n   ```bash\n   ./event_loop_server --port 8080 --test-deferred-tasks\n   ```\n   Expected server output:\n   ```\n   [INFO] I/O event processed\n   [INFO] Deferred task 1 executed\n   [INFO] Deferred task 2 executed\n   ```\n   Tasks must execute after all I/O events in the same tick.\n\n3. **Re-entrancy Stress Test**:\n   ```bash\n   ./stress_test_reentrant --callbacks 1000 --depth 5\n   ```\n   Expected: System handles nested callback registration without stack overflow or memory leak.\n\n4. **Event Loop API Completeness Test**:\n   ```bash\n   ./test_event_loop_api\n   ```\n   Tests all API functions: `event_loop_register_read`, `event_loop_register_write`, `event_loop_defer_task`, `event_loop_modify_fd`, `event_loop_unregister_fd`.\n\n**Success Criteria for Milestone 3**:\n- All API functions behave as documented with proper error handling\n- Deferred tasks never execute before I/O events in the same loop iteration\n- Repeating timers maintain accurate scheduling despite timer wheel ticks\n- No crashes when callbacks modify the event registration set\n\n#### Milestone 4: HTTP Server on Event Loop\n\n**Acceptance Criteria Verification Table**:\n| Criteria | Verification

only after inactivity | Timing test |\n\n**Comprehensive Verification Suite**:\n\n1. **HTTP Protocol Compliance Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Test with standard HTTP benchmarking tool\n   h2load -n 100000 -c 100 -m 100 http://localhost:8080/test\n   \n   # Or with simpler tool\n   ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/\n   ```\n   Expected: All requests succeed (100% success rate), no protocol errors.\n\n2. **Incremental Parsing Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Send request byte-by-byte\n   python3 -c \"\n   import socket, time\n   s = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 8080))\n   request = b'GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n   for byte in request:\n       s.send(bytes([byte]))\n       time.sleep(0.01)  # 10ms between bytes\n   print(s.recv(4096))\n   \"\n   ```\n   Expected: Complete HTTP response received despite slow send.\n\n3. **Keep-alive Connection Test**:\n   ```bash\n   # Use curl with keep-alive\n   curl -v http://localhost:8080/ \\\n

`netstat` or `ss`).\n\n4. **10K Concurrent Connection Benchmark**:\n   ```bash\n   # Use specialized tool for many connections\n   slowhttptest -c 10000 -B -i 10 -r 200 -s 8192 -t GET -u http://localhost:8080/ -x 10 -p 3\n   \n   # Or with wrk for realistic load\n   wrk -t4 -c10000 -d30s http://localhost:8080/\n   ```\n   Success Criteria:\n   - No connection resets or failures\n   -

slowly\n   while True:\n       data = s.recv(10)  # Only 10 bytes at a time\n       if not data: break\n       time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms delay\n   \"\n   ```\n   Expected: Server handles slow client without blocking, uses write timeouts.\n\n**Performance Benchmark Matrix**:\n| Metric | Measurement Method | Target Value | Tool |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------|------|\n| Connections

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./test_timer_wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Compiler Sanitizers**: Use for additional checks:\n   ```bash\n   CFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer\"\n   make test\n   ```\n\n3. **epoll Testing**: When testing epoll code, remember edge-triggered vs level-triggered differences. For tests, level-triggered is often simpler.\n\n4. **Non-blocking I/O Simulation**: To simulate EAGAIN in tests:\n   ```c\n   // Fill socket buffer to force EAGAIN on write\n   int send_buffer_size;\n   socklen_t optlen = sizeof(send_buffer_size);\n   getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, &send_buffer_size, &optlen);\n   // Send data until write returns EAGAIN\n   ```\n\n5. **Time Mocking**: For deterministic timer tests, override the time source:\n   ```c\n   // In timer_wheel.h, add:\n   typedef uint64_t (*time_getter_t)(void);\n   struct timer_wheel {\n       time_getter_t get_time;\n       // ... other fields\n   };\n   ```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint Verification Commands\n\n**After Milestone 1**:\n```bash\n# Build and run echo server\nmake\n./event_loop_echo_server 8080 &\n\n# Test with multiple concurrent connections\nfor i in {1..20}; do\n  (echo \"Test $i\"; sleep 0.1) | nc localhost 8080 &\ndone\nwait\n\n# Check server is still running\nkill -0 $! && echo \"Server alive - SUCCESS\" || echo \"Server died - FAIL\"\n```\n\n**After Milestone 2**:\n```bash\n# Build and run server with timeouts\n./event_loop_server --port 8080 --idle-timeout 2000 &\n\n# Connect but don't send data\nnc localhost 8080 &\nNC_PID=$!\n\n# Wait for timeout\nsleep 3\n\n# Check connection closed\nkill -0 $NC_PID 2>/dev/null && echo \"FAIL: Still connected\" || echo \"PASS: Timeout worked\"\n```\n\n**After Milestone 3**:\n```bash\n# Build and test callback API\nmake test_callback\n./test_callback\n\n# Expected output shows callback execution order:\n# [INFO] I/O callback executed\n# [INFO] Deferred task executed\n# [INFO] Timer callback executed\n```\n\n**After Milestone 4**:\n```bash\n# Build and run HTTP server\n./http_server 8080 &\n\n# Benchmark with Apache Bench\nab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/\n\n# Check for errors and performance\n# Success: 100% requests served, latency < 50ms\n```\n\n#### Debugging Tips for Tests\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Test passes alone but fails in suite | Shared global state | Add `printf` to show setup/teardown order | Ensure each test completely cleans up |\n| Timer tests flaky (sometimes pass) | Real time source variability | Use mock time source | Implement deterministic time mocking |\n| Memory leak in tests | Missing cleanup in error paths | Run valgrind with `--track-origins=yes` | Add cleanup to all return paths |\n| Socketpair tests hang | Deadlock in event loop | Add logging to event loop states | Check EPOLLOUT registration logic |\n| HTTP parser fails on partial data | Buffer management error | Log parser state after each feed | Ensure buffer pointers updated correctly |\n| Concurrent test fails randomly | Race condition | Add sequence numbering to logs | Use proper synchronization or deterministic test order |\n| Performance test slower than expected | Unoptimized data structures | Profile with `perf record` | Use power-of-2 sizes, cache-friendly layouts |\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging Guide\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Milestone 4\n\nDebugging an event-driven system with 10,000+ concurrent connections requires different mental models than traditional sequential programs. Instead of stepping through a linear execution path, you're observing emergent behavior in a complex state machine. Think of debugging this system as **diagnosing a living organism**: you can't stop its heart (the event loop) to examine it, so you must use external monitoring, logging, and selective instrumentation to understand its health. The key insight is that most problems manifest as statistical anomalies—gradual performance degradation, sporadic connection failures, or resource leaks—rather than deterministic crashes.\n\n### Diagnostic Mental Model: The Traffic Control Center Analogy\n\nImagine the event loop as a **traffic control center** for a busy highway system with thousands of vehicles (connections). When something goes wrong:\n\n1. **Traffic Jam (High CPU)**: All controllers (CPU cores) are overwhelmed processing vehicles, but throughput drops.\n2. **Stalled Vehicles (Stuck Connections)**: Individual cars aren't moving despite open lanes.\n3. **Missing Patrols (Timer Failures)**: Scheduled maintenance vehicles don't arrive at their destinations.\n4. **Radio Static (Partial Data)**: Communication arrives garbled or incomplete.\n\nJust as traffic controllers use cameras (logging), vehicle trackers (`strace`), and traffic flow sensors (`perf`), you need multiple observational tools to diagnose which component of the system is malfunctioning and why.\n\n### Symptom-Cause-Fix Table\n\nThe following table maps observable symptoms to their likely root causes, diagnostic steps, and corrective actions. These patterns emerge from common implementation mistakes in event-driven systems.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause(s) | Diagnostic Steps | Fix |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|-----|\n| **CPU at 100% with low throughput** | 1. **Busy-loop on `epoll_wait`** with zero timeout<br>2. **Missing `EAGAIN` handling** causing infinite retry loops<br>3. **Level-triggered epoll starvation** where ready events never drain<br>4. **Timer wheel cascade storm** from incorrectly configured resolution | 1.

Coarsen timer wheel resolution to match required precision |\n\n### Tools and Techniques\n\nEffective debugging requires combining passive observation (logging) with active instrumentation (tracing) and statistical analysis (profiling). The event-driven nature means you often need to correlate events across time and multiple connections to identify patterns.\n\n#### 1. Strategic Logging Infrastructure\n\n> **Decision: Structured Logging with Connection Context**\n> - **Context**: Traditional printf-style logging becomes unmanageable at 10K connections and can itself affect performance through syscall overhead.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - **Option A**: Verbose per-connection logging (high overhead, hard to filter)\n>   - **Option B**: Minimal error-only logging (insufficient for diagnosis)\n>   - **Option C**: Configurable structured logging with ring buffers\n> - **Decision**: Implement connection-contextual structured logging that can be enabled per-FD or per-error-type.\n> - **Rationale**: Structured logs allow post-hoc analysis without runtime overhead when disabled; per-FD enabling lets you \"zoom in\" on problematic connections without drowning in noise.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires log aggregation tools but provides surgical debugging capability; ring buffers prevent unbounded memory growth.\n\n| Logging Component | Purpose | Recommended Data |\n|------------------|---------|------------------|\n| **Connection lifecycle** | Track FD allocation/deallocation leaks | `timestamp, fd, action(create/destroy), peer_ip:port` |\n| **Event dispatch** | Diagnose missing or stuck events | `timestamp, fd, events(EPOLLIN/OUT/ERR), callback_invoked` |\n| **Timer operations** | Debug timeout issues | `timestamp, fd, timer_op(add/remove/fire), scheduled_ms, actual_ms` |\n| **Buffer watermarks** | Identify backpressure problems | `timestamp, fd, buffer_type(read/write), used_bytes, capacity` |\n| **Error categorization** | Classify failure patterns | `timestamp, fd, errno, category(ERROR_RETRYABLE/etc), action_taken` |\n\n**Implementation Pattern**: Use a lightweight macro system that compiles to nothing when debugging is disabled:\n```c\n#define CONN_DEBUG(conn, fmt, ...) \\\n    if ((conn)->debug_enabled) \\\n        log_structured(conn->fd, \"DEBUG\", fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)\n```\n\n#### 2. System Call Tracing with `strace`\n\n`strace` reveals the actual interactions between your process and the kernel, which is essential for diagnosing issues that don't manifest in your program's logic.\n\n**Common `strace` Invocations and Their Insights:**\n\n| Command | Purpose | Key Patterns to Diagnose |\n|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| `strace -e epoll_wait,epoll_ctl -p PID` | Monitor epoll operations | Missing `epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_MOD)` after write buffer drain |\n| `strace -e read,write -p PID 2>&1 | grep EAGAIN` | Identify retry storms | Excessive `EAGAIN` errors indicating busy-loop |\n| `strace -c -p PID -S calls` | Count system call distribution | High `epoll_ctl` count suggesting suboptimal registration patterns |\n| `strace -e accept4,close -p PID` | Track connection lifecycle | `close()` calls not matching `accept4()` indicating leaks |\n| `strace -yy -e poll,epoll_wait,read,write -p PID` | See FD numbers and types | Correlations between FD numbers and operations |\n\n**Example Diagnosis Flow**:\n1. **Symptom**: High CPU usage\n2. **Command**: `strace -c -p $(pgrep server) -S time`\n3. **Observation**: 80% of time spent in `epoll_wait` with 0 timeout\n4. **Inference**: Event loop is busy-waiting because timeout calculation is wrong\n5. **Fix**: Ensure `epoll_wait` timeout uses `timer_wheel_next_expiration()`\n\n#### 3. Performance Profiling with `perf`\n\n`perf` provides CPU-level insights that complement the system-call view from `strace`. It's particularly valuable for identifying cache inefficiencies and hotspots in your data structures.\n\n**Key `perf` Subcommands for Event Loop Analysis:**\n\n| Subcommand | Target Issue | Interpretation Guide |\n|------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| `perf top -p PID` | CPU hotspots in real-time | Look for `timer_wheel_tick` or `connection_read` dominating |\n| `perf record -g -p PID` + `perf report` | Call graph analysis | Identify deep call stacks from simple operations |\n| `perf stat -e cache-misses,L1-dcache-loads -p PID` | Cache efficiency | High cache-miss rate suggests poor data locality in `connection` array |\n| `perf trace --syscalls=epoll_wait,read,write -p PID` | Combined syscall + timing | See duration of each system call within event loop tick |\n\n**Mental Model for `perf` Output**: Think of the event loop as a **factory assembly line**. `perf` tells you which workstations (functions) have the longest queues (CPU time), which parts are waiting at shipping (cache misses), and where cross-station travel is inefficient (branch mispredictions).\n\n#### 4. Runtime Inspection with `/proc` Filesystem\n\nThe Linux `/proc` filesystem provides real-time visibility into your process's kernel-state relationships.\n\n**Critical `/proc` Entries for Event Loop Debugging:**\n\n| Path | Information | Diagnostic Value |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| `/proc/PID/fd` | Open file descriptors | Count and types of FDs; look for unexpected growth |\n| `/proc/PID/fdinfo/FD` | Per-FD epoll status | `pos: 0 flags: 02004002` shows O_NONBLOCK and other flags |\n| `/proc/PID/status` | Memory and thread stats | `VmRSS` for memory leaks, `Threads: 1` confirms single-threaded |\n| `/proc/PID/stack` | Kernel stack trace | Reveals if stuck in blocking syscall |\n| `/proc/sys/fs/file-nr` | System-wide FD usage | Diagnose FD exhaustion across all processes |\n| `/proc/net/tcp` | TCP connection states | Verify `ESTABLISHED` count matches your connection count |\n\n**Practical Walkthrough**: When connections appear stuck:\n1. `ls -l /proc/PID/fd | wc -l` → Count open FDs\n2. `cat /proc/PID/fdinfo/123` → Check flags for FD 123\n3. `grep -A2 -B2 \"123:\" /proc/net/tcp` → Verify kernel TCP state\n4. **Discovery**: FD 123 shows `tcp` state `CLOSE_WAIT` but your program still has it registered\n5. **Root Cause**: Missing `EPOLLHUP` handling or not checking `read() == 0`\n\n#### 5. Network Diagnostic Tools\n\nNetwork-level issues often masquerade as application bugs in high-concurrency servers.\n\n| Tool | Command Example | Diagnostic Purpose |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **`ss` (socket statistics)** | `ss -tlnp | grep PID` | List listening sockets and their processes |\n| | `ss -to state established dst :8080` | TCP timers and options for established connections |\n| **`netstat`** | `netstat -tpn | grep PID` | Legacy alternative to `ss` |\n| **`tcpdump`** | `tcpdump -i lo -n port 8080 -c 10` | Capture packets to verify protocol compliance |\n| **`nc` (netcat)** | `nc -zv localhost 8080` | Quick connectivity test |\n| **`socat`** | `socat - TCP4:localhost:8080` | Manual protocol interaction |\n\n**Network Debugging Mindset**: When a connection behaves strangely, ask: \"Is this my program's fault, or is the network/TCP stack doing something unexpected?\" Use `ss -to` to see TCP retransmits, zero windows, or keepalive expirations that explain application-level symptoms.\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Event Loop Debugging\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Heisenbugs from Debug Logging**\nAdding `printf` to diagnose a problem changes timing enough to make the bug disappear. This is especially common in race conditions around timer expiration and event registration.\n- **Why it's wrong**: The debugging itself becomes a confounding variable.\n- **Fix**: Use atomic counters instead of I/O in hot paths, or write to memory-mapped ring buffers that have minimal timing impact.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming Linear Causality**\nIn event-driven systems, symptom and cause may be separated by thousands of event loop ticks. A connection drop at time T might be caused by a memory allocation failure at time T-1000.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Looking only at immediate context misses root causes.\n- **Fix**: Implement correlation IDs that track chains of events, and use timeline visualization tools.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overlooking Kernel Resources**\nYour application logic may be perfect, but the kernel may be out of TCP buffers, file descriptors, or ephemeral ports.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Application-level debugging shows no bugs, but the system still fails.\n- **Fix**: Monitor `/proc` metrics alongside application metrics, set `ulimit -n` appropriately, and implement graceful degradation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Statistically Rare Events**\nA bug that affects 1 in 10,000 connections might not appear in small-scale testing but will cause periodic failures in production.\n- **Why it's wrong**: \"It works on my machine\" with 100 connections doesn't guarantee correctness at scale.\n- **Fix**: Use property-based testing that generates edge cases, and run load tests that exceed target concurrency by 2x.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints for C\n\n- **Atomic Counters**: Use `__atomic_add_fetch(&counter, 1, __ATOMIC_RELAXED)` for performance counters without locking.\n- **Backtrace on Signal**: Install handler with `sigaction(SIGSEGV, ...)` and use `backtrace()` from `<execinfo.h>` to get stack traces.\n- **FD Status Checking**: Use `fcntl(fd, F_GETFL)` to verify `O_NONBLOCK` is set, and `getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, ...)` to check for pending errors.\n- **Memory Sanitizers**: Compile with `-fsanitize=address,undefined` for runtime memory error detection during development.\n- **Static Analysis**: Use `clang-tidy` with checks for null pointer dereferences, resource leaks, and concurrency issues.\n\n#### F.

The foundational design—with its clean separation of I/O multiplexing, timer management, and protocol handling—provides a solid base for several advanced enhancements. Think of the current event loop as a high-performance single-engine aircraft; these extensions represent potential upgrades to multi-engine configurations, improved navigation systems, and specialized payload capabilities.\n\n### Multi-threaded Reactor and Protocol Upgrades\n\nThe single-threaded reactor pattern achieves remarkable efficiency for I/O-bound workloads but faces limitations with CPU-intensive tasks or when maximum hardware utilization is required. Extending the architecture to leverage multiple CPU cores while preserving the event-driven model is a natural progression.\n\n#### Mental Model: The Post Office with Specialized Departments\n\nImagine our single-threaded event loop as a small-town post office with one exceptionally efficient postal worker. This worker handles everything: sorting mail, operating the counter, and loading trucks. As mail volume grows, we could:\n\n1. **Open Multiple Identical Post Offices (Multi-Process)**: Run independent event loops in separate processes, each with its own epoll instance and connection set.\n2. **Add Specialized Workers (Thread Pool)**: Keep the main postal worker for sorting but hire specialized workers for heavy tasks like package processing.\n3. **Create Regional Sorting Centers (Multi-Threaded Reactor)**: Build a larger facility where multiple workers collaboratively sort mail using shared infrastructure.\n\nThe third approach—multi-threaded reactor—provides the best scalability for our server architecture while maintaining the event-driven paradigm.\n\n#### Multi-Threaded Reactor Pattern\n\n**Decision: Multi-Threaded Reactor with Worker Threads**\n\n> **Decision: Threading Model for CPU-Intensive Work**\n> - **Context**: The single-threaded event loop can efficiently handle 10K+ connections but saturates a single CPU core. HTTP parsing, compression, and business logic remain CPU-bound. We need to utilize multiple CPU cores without introducing blocking or excessive context switching.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Multi-Process (Prefork)**: Run multiple independent event loops in separate processes, balancing connections via SO_REUSEPORT.\n>   2. **Thread Pool for Blocking Operations**: Maintain single-threaded reactor but offload CPU-intensive tasks to a worker thread pool.\n>   3. **Multi-Threaded Reactor**: Run multiple reactor threads, each with its own epoll instance, sharing the listening socket and load-balancing connections.\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach combining Option 2 and 3—multi-threaded reactor with protocol-specific worker threads for CPU-heavy operations.\n> - **Rationale**: Pure multi-process wastes memory (duplicate buffers) and complicates shared state. Pure thread pool still bottlenecks on single epoll thread. Hybrid approach maximizes CPU utilization while keeping I/O dispatch efficient. Each reactor thread can handle its own set of connections, with expensive operations dispatched to shared worker pools.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables horizontal scaling across CPU cores, adds complexity for shared data synchronization, requires careful connection affinity to avoid thread contention.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| **Multi-Process (Prefork)** | Simple, strong isolation, crash doesn't affect all connections | Memory overhead (per-process buffers), difficult shared state, load balancing less precise | No |\n| **Thread Pool for Blocking Ops** | Maintains simple single-threaded I/O model, good for isolated CPU tasks | Single epoll thread remains bottleneck, all I/O still serialized | Partial |\n| **Multi-Threaded Reactor** | Scales I/O handling across cores, maximizes hardware utilization | Complex synchronization, potential for thread contention | **Yes** (with worker pool) |\n\nThe multi-threaded reactor architecture introduces several new components and modifications to the existing design:\n\n| Component | New Responsibility | Integration with Existing System |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Reactor Thread Pool** | Multiple threads running independent `event_loop_run()` instances | Share listening socket via `SO_REUSEPORT` or round-robin `accept()` |\n| **Load Balancer** | Distributes new connections across reactor threads | Integrated into modified `accept()` logic using thread-local queues |\n| **Worker Thread Pool** | Executes CPU-intensive callbacks (HTTP parsing, compression) | Receives tasks via thread-safe queue from reactor threads |\n| **Synchronization Primitives** | Protects shared timer wheel and statistics | Uses atomic operations and fine-grained locking where necessary |\n\nThe connection state machine expands to handle cross-thread operations:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------------|\n| `STATE_READING` | Data requires CPU-intensive parsing | `STATE_PROCESSING` | 1. Suspend read events on reactor thread<br>2. Enqueue parsing task to worker pool<br>3. Store connection reference in pending tasks map |\n| `STATE_PROCESSING` | Worker completes parsing | `STATE_WRITING` or `STATE_READING` | 1. Worker thread signals completion via pipe<br>2. Reactor thread resumes event registration<br>3. Apply parsed results to connection |\n| `STATE_ACCEPTED` | Load balancer decision | `STATE_READING` (on different thread) | 1. Main acceptor thread selects target reactor thread<br>2. Passes socket via Unix domain socket or eventfd<br>3. Target thread registers socket with its epoll instance |\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Multi-Threaded Extension:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Shared Timer Wheel Contention**\n- **Description**: Having all reactor threads share a single `timer_wheel` structure causes lock contention on every tick and timer operation.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Timer operations should be O(1); adding locks makes them unpredictable and creates scaling bottlenecks.\n- **Fix**: Use thread-local timer wheels with a shared \"next expiration\" coordinator, or implement a lock-free hierarchical timer wheel with atomic operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cross-Thread Connection Handoff Blocking**\n- **Description**: Passing sockets between threads using blocking writes to pipes or sockets.\n- **Why it's wrong**: If the receiving thread's pipe buffer fills, the sending thread blocks, potentially stalling connection acceptance.\n- **Fix**: Use `eventfd` with non-blocking writes and edge-triggered epoll monitoring, or implement a lock-free ring buffer for socket descriptors.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Worker Pool Task Queue Backpressure**\n- **Description**: Reactor threads enqueue parsing tasks faster than workers can process them, causing unbounded queue growth.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Memory exhaustion and increased latency as tasks wait in queue.\n- **Fix**: Implement bounded task queues with backpressure signaling—when queue reaches high watermark, reactor threads temporarily pause parsing and buffer data locally.\n\n#### Protocol Upgrades: WebSockets and TLS\n\nThe event loop's protocol-agnostic design makes it an excellent foundation for additional protocols beyond HTTP/1.1.\n\n**Decision: Protocol Handler Plug-in Architecture**\n\n> **Decision: Extensible Protocol Support**\n> - **Context**: The event loop currently handles HTTP/1.1, but real applications need WebSockets for real-time communication and TLS for secure connections. We need a design that accommodates multiple protocols without rewriting core components.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Monolithic Protocol Switch**: Extend `http_parser` with flags and states for WebSockets and TLS handshakes.\n>   2. **Protocol-Specific Connection Types**: Create separate `websocket_connection` and `tls_connection` structures with their own state machines.\n>   3. **Protocol Handler Interface**: Define a clean interface that all protocols implement, with the connection delegating to the active protocol handler.\n> - **Decision**: Protocol Handler Interface with connection upgrade capability.\n> - **Rationale**: Monolithic approach becomes unwieldy and violates single responsibility. Separate connection types duplicate I/O buffer logic. The interface approach keeps protocol logic isolated while sharing common infrastructure. Connection upgrade (HTTP → WebSockets, plain → TLS) becomes a simple handler swap.\n> - **Consequences**: Clean separation of concerns, easy to add new protocols, slight indirection overhead, requires careful design of handler lifecycle.\n\nThe protocol handler interface would define these core operations:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `handle_read` | `conn struct connection*` | `int` (bytes processed) | Process incoming data from read buffer, update connection state |\n| `handle_write` | `conn struct connection*` | `int` (bytes sent) | Prepare and send data from write buffer |\n| `handle_timeout` | `conn struct connection*` | `void` | Protocol-specific idle timeout logic |\n| `can_upgrade_to` | `proto_name const char*` | `int` (1 if possible) | Check if protocol can upgrade to another protocol |\n| `upgrade` | `conn struct connection*`, `new_handler void*` | `int` (success) | Transition connection to new protocol handler |\n\n**WebSockets Implementation Strategy:**\n\nWebSockets begin as HTTP connections with an upgrade request, making them ideal for the protocol handler approach:\n\n1. **HTTP Handler Phase**: Normal HTTP parsing until complete headers\n2. **Upgrade Detection**: `http_parser` detects `Connection: Upgrade` and `Upgrade: websocket`\n3. **Handler Swap**: Connection's protocol handler changes from `http_handler` to `websocket_handler`\n4. **Handshake Response**: Original handler generates HTTP 101 response\n5. **WebSocket Frame Processing**: New handler processes binary frames using its own state machine\n\nThe WebSocket handler maintains additional state:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `frame_state` | `enum` | Current frame parsing state (OPCODE, LENGTH, MASK, PAYLOAD) |\n| `frame_opcode` | `uint8_t` | Type of WebSocket frame (TEXT, BINARY, CLOSE, etc.) |\n| `frame_payload_length` | `uint64_t` | Total expected payload length |\n| `frame_bytes_received` | `uint64_t` | Bytes received for current frame |\n| `fragmentation_buffer` | `char*` | Buffer for fragmented frames |\n| `mask_key` | `uint32_t` | XOR mask for client-to-server frames |\n| `close_code` | `uint16_t` | Close status code for graceful shutdown |\n\n**TLS/SSL Integration Strategy:**\n\nTLS adds encryption/decryption layers between the socket and application protocol. The most practical approach is the **Bump-in-the-Stack** pattern:\n\n1. **TLS Handler Wrapping**: Create a `tls_handler` that wraps another protocol handler (HTTP or WebSocket)\n2. **Bio Callbacks**: Use OpenSSL's BIO abstraction with custom read/write callbacks that use the connection's buffers\n3. **Handshake State Machine**: TLS handler manages the multi-phase handshake before delegating to the wrapped protocol\n4. **Record Layer Buffering**: TLS requires reading/writing complete records, necessitating additional buffering\n\nThe sequence for a TLS upgrade looks like:\n\n1. Client connects on HTTPS port (typically 443)\n2. Listening socket accepts and creates connection with `tls_handler` as initial protocol\n3. TLS handler performs handshake via OpenSSL library calls\n4. During handshake, TLS handler uses `connection_read()` and `connection_write()` for network I/O\n5. After handshake completion, TLS handler swaps itself for `http_handler` but remains as a wrapper\n6. All subsequent `handle_read`/`handle_write` calls go through TLS decryption/encryption first\n\n**Performance Considerations for Protocol Upgrades:**\n\n| Protocol Aspect | Performance Impact | Mitigation Strategy |\n|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **TLS Handshake** | CPU-intensive asymmetric crypto | Session resumption, TLS tickets, worker thread offloading |\n| **WebSocket Frame Parsing** | Per-message overhead | Batch small frames, use binary protocols where possible |\n| **Protocol Switching** | Memory allocation/free | Pool protocol handler objects, reuse buffers |\n| **TLS Record Buffering** | Additional memory copies | Use scatter/gather I/O (writev/readv) with OpenSSL |\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Protocol Implementation:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Half-Implemented WebSocket Close Handshake**\n- **Description**: Implementing WebSocket data frames but neglecting proper close frame exchange and connection teardown.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Clients may hang waiting for close response, and servers may not release resources properly.\n- **Fix**: Implement complete WebSocket state machine including close frame sending/receiving, with proper timeout for unresponsive peers.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: TLS Renegotiation without Backpressure**\n- **Description**: Allowing TLS renegotiation during data transfer without pausing application data flow.\n- **Why it's wrong**: Interleaved handshake and application records cause protocol violations and decryption failures.\n- **Fix**: Buffer application data during renegotiation, or disable renegotiation entirely for security and simplicity.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mixed Protocol Port Sharing**\n- **Description**: Running HTTP and HTTPS on the same port using opportunistic TLS (detecting TLS client hello).\n- **Why it's wrong**: Complexity increases, and some clients may timeout during detection phase.\n- **Fix**: Use separate ports (80/443) or implement proper ALPN/SNI with a single TLS-wrapped handler that can fall back to plain HTTP only if explicitly configured.\n\n#### Load Balancing Across Reactor Threads\n\nFor the multi-threaded reactor to scale effectively, connections must be distributed evenly across threads. Several load balancing strategies are possible:\n\n| Strategy | Implementation | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n|----------|---------------|------|------|----------|\n| **Accept Lock** | Global mutex around `accept()` | Simple, guaranteed even distribution | Contention point, doesn't consider thread load | Small core counts (2-4) |\n| **SO_REUSEPORT** | Multiple listeners on same port, each thread binds independently | Kernel-level balancing, no contention | Uneven distribution under some workloads, connection skew | Linux 3.9+, high connection rate |\n| **Thread Local Queue** | Dedicated acceptor thread passes sockets via queue | Customizable balancing logic | Extra thread overhead, queue management | Heterogeneous workloads |\n| **Least Connections** | Acceptor tracks per-thread counts, assigns to least busy | Good load distribution | Requires shared atomic counters | Mixed connection durations |\n\nA hybrid approach often works best: use `SO_REUSEPORT` for raw connection acceptance speed, complemented by work-stealing for load rebalancing when threads become unevenly loaded.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The optimal threading model depends on workload characteristics. For many small, short-lived connections (HTTP/1.0), `SO_REUSEPORT` works well. For persistent connections with variable processing needs (WebSockets with messaging), work-stealing between reactor threads provides better balance.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nWhile the full implementation of these extensions is beyond the project's scope, this guidance provides starting points for exploration.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints (C with POSIX and OpenSSL):**\n\n- **Thread-Local Storage**: Use `__thread` keyword or `pthread_key_create()` for thread-local variables like error buffers or temporary workspaces.\n- **Atomic Operations**: For counters shared between threads, use GCC's `__atomic_*` builtins or C11 `stdatomic.h` if available.\n- **OpenSSL Thread Safety**: Call `CRYPTO_set_locking_callback()` to provide thread-safe locking for OpenSSL, or use OpenSSL 1.1.0+ which has built-in thread support.\n- **Non-Blocking OpenSSL**: Configure SSL with `SSL_set_mode(ssl, SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE | SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER)` for non-blocking behavior.\n- **Eventfd for Wakeups**: Use `eventfd()` instead of pipes for inter-thread signaling—it's lighter weight and edge-triggered friendly.\n- **CPU Affinity**: Consider `pthread_setaffinity_np()` to pin reactor threads to specific CPU cores, reducing cache invalidation.\n\n**F.

Understanding this terminology is essential for working with the event loop architecture, debugging issues, and extending the system. Terms are listed alphabetically for quick reference.\n\n### Terminology Table\n\n| Term | Definition | First Reference/Context |\n|------|------------|-------------------------|\n| **ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation)** | A TLS extension that allows a client and server to negotiate which application-layer protocol (like HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or WebSocket) will be used within a TLS connection before data transmission begins. | Future Extensions (TLS integration) |\n| **backpressure** | A flow control mechanism where a data consumer (like our event loop when writing to a slow client) signals to the producer (our application logic) to slow down or stop sending data because buffers are full and cannot be processed quickly enough. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (slow clients) |\n| **bump-in-the-stack** | A design pattern for implementing TLS/SSL where encryption/decryption is inserted as a layer between the raw socket I/O and the application protocol handler. The event loop sees encrypted bytes, but the protocol handler works with plaintext. | Future Extensions (protocol handler architecture) |\n| **buffer management** | The systematic approach to allocating, tracking, filling, and draining memory buffers used for reading from and writing to network sockets. This includes managing `read_buffer_used`, `write_buffer_used`, and `write_buffer_sent` fields in the `connection` struct. | Data Model (connection fields) |\n| **buffer watermark** | A predetermined threshold (e.g., 80% full) within a buffer that triggers specific actions. For example, a write buffer reaching its high watermark might stop registering for `EPOLLOUT` to prevent busy loops, while dropping below a low watermark might re-enable it. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (flow control) |\n| **C10K problem** | The classic challenge of designing a network server capable of handling ten thousand concurrent connections efficiently on commodity hardware. It exposed the limitations of the thread-per-connection model and spurred the adoption of event-driven architectures and I/O multiplexing. | Context and Problem Statement |\n| **callback API** | A programming interface where the application registers functions (callbacks) to be invoked by the framework when specific events occur (e.g., `http_handle_read` for `EPOLLIN`). This is the core of the Reactor pattern's inversion of control. | Component Design (Async Task Scheduling) |\n| **connection state machine** | A finite state machine (FSM) that models the lifecycle of a network connection using states like `STATE_ACCEPTED`, `STATE_READING`, `STATE_WRITING`, and `STATE_CLOSING`. Transitions between states are driven by I/O events, timer expirations, and protocol logic. | Data Model (state constants) & Interactions and Data Flow |\n| **CPU affinity** | The practice of binding a specific thread or process to a particular CPU core (or set of cores). This can improve performance in multi-threaded reactors by reducing cache invalidation and context-switching overhead between cores. | Future Extensions (multi-threaded reactor) |\n| **edge-triggered** | An event notification mode (set with `EPOLLET`) where `epoll` signals a file descriptor only when its I/O status *changes* (e.g., when data first becomes available). The application must assume it can read/write until it receives `EAGAIN`. | Component Design (Event Loop - pitfalls) |\n| **epoll** | A Linux-specific I/O event notification facility that efficiently monitors multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them. It scales better than `select()` or `poll()` for large numbers of connections. | Context and Problem Statement (comparison table) |\n| **error categorization** | The process of classifying system call errors (from `errno`) into categories like `ERROR_RETRYABLE` (`EAGAIN`), `ERROR_CONNECTION_FATAL` (`ECONNRESET`), and `ERROR_SYSTEM_FATAL` (`ENOMEM`) to determine the appropriate recovery action. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (error table) |\n| **event loop** | The central coordinating component of the Reactor pattern. It continuously waits for events (using `epoll_wait`), then dispatches them to registered handlers or callbacks. Also referred to as the \"reactor\" or \"dispatcher.\" | High-Level Architecture (component diagram) |\n| **event loop tick** | A single complete iteration of the event loop's main cycle: calling `epoll_wait`, processing all returned I/O events, ticking the timer wheel to process expired timers, and executing any deferred tasks. | Interactions and Data Flow (sequence diagram) |\n| **finite state machine (FSM)** | An abstract model of computation consisting of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and actions. Used extensively to model connection lifecycles and protocol parsing states (e.g., in `http_parser`). | Data Model (connection states) |\n| **half-closed connection** | A TCP connection state where one endpoint has sent a FIN packet (indicating it has finished sending data) but is still willing to receive data from the other endpoint. This state must be handled correctly to avoid writing to a closed connection. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (edge cases) |\n| **hierarchical timer wheel** | A multi-level circular buffer data structure for managing large numbers of timers with O(1) amortized cost for insertion, deletion, and expiration. Higher levels represent larger time intervals (e.g., minutes), lower levels represent smaller ones (e.g., milliseconds). | Component Design (Timer Wheel) |\n| **HTTP keep-alive** | An HTTP/1.1 feature that allows multiple request/response transactions to occur over a single TCP connection, reducing connection establishment overhead. The server must manage an idle timeout for these persistent connections. | Component Design (HTTP Server) |\n| **idle timeout** | A timer associated with a connection that fires if no read or write activity occurs within a configured period (e.g., `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`). This prevents resource exhaustion from clients that connect but never send data (a \"slow loris\" attack pattern). | Component Design (Timer Wheel - acceptance criteria) |\n| **incremental processing** | A design approach where data is processed as it arrives in chunks, rather than waiting for a complete message. Essential for non-blocking I/O, as a single `read()` may only deliver part of an HTTP request. | Component Design (HTTP Server) |\n| **I/O multiplexing** | The capability of an operating system or system call to monitor multiple I/O sources (file descriptors) simultaneously and report which ones are ready for reading or writing. `epoll`, `select`, and `poll` are all I/O multiplexing mechanisms. | Context and Problem Statement |\n| **level-triggered** | The default event notification mode for `epoll`. The kernel notifies the application that a file descriptor is ready for I/O for as long as the condition persists (e.g., data remains in the socket buffer). This can lead to repeated notifications if not handled. | Component Design (Event Loop - pitfalls) |\n| **monotonic clock** | A system clock that continuously increases at a constant rate and is not affected by discontinuous jumps in system time (e.g., from NTP adjustments). Used for measuring intervals and timer expirations via `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`. | Component Design (Timer Wheel - implementation) |\n| **MPSC (Multi Producer Single Consumer) ring buffer** | A concurrent data structure where multiple threads (producers) can enqueue items, but only one thread (the consumer, typically the event loop) can dequeue them. Useful for passing tasks or connections between threads in a multi-threaded reactor. | Future Extensions (work-stealing) |\n| **multi-threaded reactor** | An extension of the Reactor pattern where multiple threads, each running its own event loop, work together to handle connections. Connections are distributed among the threads, often using techniques like `SO_REUSEPORT` or a central acceptor. | Future Extensions |\n| **non-blocking I/O** | A mode of socket operation where calls to `read()`, `write()`, and `accept()` return immediately, either with the completed result or with an error (`EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`) if the operation cannot be completed without waiting. | Component Design (Event Loop) |\n| **protocol handler interface** | A common interface (represented by the `protocol_handler` struct) that abstracts the specifics of different application-layer protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, TLS). It allows the event loop to treat connections uniformly, delegating protocol logic to handler functions. | Future Extensions (protocol upgrades) |\n| **Reactor pattern** | An architectural pattern for event-driven applications. It demultiplexes incoming events (I/O, timers) and dispatches them synchronously to associated request handlers (callbacks). The pattern separates the mechanism of event detection from the application logic. | High-Level Architecture (postal system analogy) |\n| **slow loris attack** | A denial-of-service attack that operates by opening many connections to a server and periodically sending small amounts of data to keep the connections open indefinitely, exhausting server resources. Defended against using aggressive idle timeouts. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (edge cases) |\n| **SO_REUSEPORT** | A socket option (`setsockopt(SO_REUSEPORT)`) that allows multiple sockets (typically in different processes or threads) to bind to the same IP address and port number. The kernel performs load balancing of incoming connections. | Future Extensions (multi-threaded reactor) |\n| **SPSC (Single Producer Single Consumer) ring buffer** | A concurrent data structure optimized for the case where exactly one thread produces data and exactly one different thread consumes it. Often used for communication between an I/O thread and a worker thread with minimal locking. | Future Extensions (task queues) |\n| **thread-local storage (TLS)** | A mechanism for allocating variables that have a distinct instance for each thread. In a multi-threaded reactor, each thread's event loop state and connection tables can be stored in thread-local storage to avoid synchronization. | Future Extensions (implementation notes) |\n| **timer cascading** | The process in a hierarchical timer wheel where, as the current time pointer advances, timers that have \"overflowed\" from a higher-precision wheel level (e.g., milliseconds) are moved down to a lower-precision level (e.g., seconds) for future expiration checking. | Component Design (Timer Wheel - algorithm) |\n| **timer wheel** | A data structure for efficient timer management, conceptually a circular buffer of linked lists. Each slot corresponds to a time interval. A pointer advances at a fixed \"tick,\" and all timers in the current slot expire. | Component Design (Timer Wheel) |\n| **work-stealing** | A load balancing strategy used in concurrent systems where idle worker threads \"steal\" tasks from the queues of busy threads. This helps keep all threads utilized evenly and can improve throughput in a multi-threaded reactor. | Future Extensions |\n| **write timeout** | A timer that fires if a write operation cannot make progress (i.e., the socket's send buffer remains full) within a specified period (e.g., `WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`). This protects the server from extremely slow clients that cannot accept data. | Error Handling and Edge Cases (slow clients) |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nWhile the glossary defines concepts, this section provides concrete guidance on how these terms manifest in the codebase and how to navigate the implementation.\n\n**A.

Core Logic Skeleton Code**\nThis skeleton for the main event loop function illustrates how the core glossary terms come together in the central dispatch mechanism:\n\n`src/core/event_loop.c`:\n```c\n#include \"event_loop.h\"\n#include \"timer_wheel.h\"\n#include \"connection.h\"\n\nint event_loop_run(struct event_loop* loop, int timeout_ms) {\n    // TODO 1: Calculate the next timer expiration using timer_wheel_next_expiration()\n    //         This ensures the event loop wakes up in time for the next timeout.\n    // TODO 2: Determine the actual timeout for epoll_wait as the minimum of\n    //         the provided timeout_ms and the time until the next timer expires.\n    // TODO 3: Call epoll_wait() with the calculated timeout.

This happens after I/O to avoid re-entrancy issues.\n    // TODO 7: Return 0 to continue the loop, or -1 on fatal error.\n}\n```\n\n**E. Language-Specific Hints (C)**\n- **Monotonic Clock**: Use `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts)` for timer calculations, not `gettimeofday()`, to avoid issues with system time changes.\n- **Non-blocking Sockets**: Always check the return value of `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` and handle errors. Consider using `accept4()` with `SOCK_NONBLOCK` for new connections.\n- **Error Handling**: After an `epoll_wait` returns an event with `EPOLLERR`, call `getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, &error, &len)` to get the specific socket error.\n- **Buffer Management**: When a `read()` returns `EAGAIN`, the data you've already read should be appended to the connection's `read_buffer`. The `read_buffer_used` field tracks how much is valid.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint**\nAfter implementing the full system (through Milestone 4), you can verify your understanding of the terminology by testing with the following scenario:\n\n```bash\n# Start the HTTP server with verbose logging\n./build/http_server -p 8080 -v\n\n# In another terminal, use netcat to simulate a slow loris attack\n# (This tests idle timeout and connection state machine)\nfor i in {1..100}; do\n  (echo -ne \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost\\r\\n\" | nc -q 0 localhost 8080 &)\ndone\n\n# Monitor server logs - you should see connections being accepted (STATE_ACCEPTED),\n# moving to HTTP_READING, then being closed by timer expiration after IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS\n# when the incomplete request times out.\n```\n\n**G. Debugging Tips**\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **CPU at 100% with no traffic** | Event loop spinning without blocking on `epoll_wait` | Check if `timer_wheel_next_expiration()` returns 0 incorrectly, or if timeout calculation is wrong. | Ensure the timeout passed to `epoll_wait` is `-1` (block forever) when there are no timers, not 0. |\n| **Connections stuck in `STATE_WRITING`** | Write buffer full, but `EPOLLOUT` not registered or not firing | Log when `connection_write()` returns `EAGAIN` and verify `event_loop_register_write()` is called. | In edge-triggered mode, you must attempt to write until `EAGAIN` after receiving `EPOLLOUT`. |\n| **Timer not firing at correct time** | Timer wheel cascading logic bug or incorrect time base | Log `current_time` in `timer_wheel_tick()` and compare with expected `expires_at` for a test timer. | Ensure you're using a monotonic clock and converting correctly to milliseconds. |\n| **Memory leak under load** | `connection_destroy()` not called for all closed connections | Use `valgrind` or log `connection_create`/`connection_destroy` calls with connection FD. | Verify every code path that closes a socket (errors, timeouts, normal finish) calls `connection_destroy`. |\n"}
