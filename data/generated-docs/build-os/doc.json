{"html":"<h1 id=\"build-your-own-os\">Build Your Own OS</h1>\n<p>This project takes you from the raw BIOS power-on sequence all the way to a preemptively scheduled multi-process kernel with user-mode isolation and system calls. You will write the bootloader that fits in 512 bytes, configure the x86 segmentation and paging hardware, wire up the programmable interrupt controller, and implement a context-switching scheduler in assembly. Every abstraction that higher-level programmers take for granted — malloc, printf, threads, file descriptors — is absent here. You build the foundation those abstractions stand on.</p>\n<p>The project is structured as four milestones that mirror the historical evolution of OS design: bootstrap and protected mode, interrupt infrastructure, memory management, and process scheduling. Each milestone reveals a hardware constraint that software must negotiate: the CPU&#39;s privilege ring model, the TLB&#39;s stale-translation problem, the PIC&#39;s vector-collision hazard, and the TSS&#39;s role in safe ring transitions. Skipping any of these reveals results in triple faults, silent memory corruption, or security holes.</p>\n<p>By the end, you will have a mental model precise enough to read Linux kernel source code, understand hypervisor design, and reason about why system calls have the latency they do. The OS you build is simple; the conceptual leverage it provides is enormous.</p>\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m1 -->\n<h1 id=\"milestone-1-bootloader-gdt-and-kernel-entry\">Milestone 1: Bootloader, GDT, and Kernel Entry</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-revelation-your-cpu-boots-into-1978\">The Revelation: Your CPU Boots Into 1978</h2>\n<p>Here is what every developer who has only written userspace code believes about program startup: memory is zeroed, a stack exists, you are running 32-bit or 64-bit code, and the operating system hands your program a clean environment. This belief is correct — for every program that runs <em>after</em> an OS exists. You are about to write the program that runs <em>before</em> any of that is true.</p>\n<p>When you press the power button, the CPU starts executing at physical address <code>0xFFFFFFF0</code> — a location in firmware ROM. No OS. No libc. No stack you chose. The processor is in <strong>16-bit real mode</strong>, a compatibility mode that mimics the Intel 8086 from 1978. The entire addressable universe is 1 megabyte. Memory protection does not exist. Any code can overwrite any other code. The interrupt table is a legacy structure called the IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) that assumes real-mode segment arithmetic, and if you enable interrupts while in the middle of switching to protected mode, you will immediately triple-fault with zero diagnostic information.</p>\n<p>This is not a historical curiosity. It is the actual hardware state of every x86 machine at power-on, including the server running your cloud VM right now. The firmware runs its POST (Power-On Self-Test), finds a bootable disk, loads the first 512 bytes into memory at physical address <code>0x7C00</code>, and jumps there. Those 512 bytes are yours. That is where this milestone begins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m1-boot-sequence.svg\" alt=\"x86 Boot Sequence: BIOS to Kernel main()\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-1-real-mode-the-ground-you-stand-on\">Section 1: Real Mode — The Ground You Stand On</h2>\n<p>Before you can escape real mode, you need to understand what it actually is and why it exists.</p>\n<p><strong>Real mode addressing</strong> works like this: the CPU has 16-bit registers but needs to address up to 1MB (20 bits of address space). Intel solved this in 1978 by combining a <strong>segment register</strong> with an <strong>offset register</strong>: <code>physical address = segment × 16 + offset</code>. So if <code>CS = 0x07C0</code> and <code>IP = 0x0000</code>, the physical address is <code>0x07C00</code> — the MBR load address.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m1-real-to-protected-mode.svg\" alt=\"Real Mode vs Protected Mode: Address Translation Comparison\"></p>\n<p>This segmentation model was the original address space mechanism. <code>CS</code> (Code Segment), <code>DS</code> (Data Segment), and <code>SS</code> (Stack Segment) are hardware-enforced boundaries in the sense that all code fetches go through <code>CS</code>, all stack operations go through <code>SS</code>, and all data accesses go through <code>DS</code>. Early DOS programs that corrupted each other&#39;s memory were abusing the fact that nothing prevented one segment from overlapping another — the hardware enforced <em>which register was used</em>, not <em>what value it contained</em>. Protected mode, as you will see, changes the semantics of these registers entirely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> In real mode, every memory access is a segment-register lookup plus an offset. The TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer — the CPU&#39;s cache of address translations) does not exist yet in any meaningful sense. Every address calculation is a simple shift-and-add in hardware, costing approximately zero cycles but providing zero protection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The BIOS, which loaded your 512-byte MBR at <code>0x7C00</code>, leaves you the following state:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DL</code> register contains the boot drive number (you need this to read more sectors from disk)</li>\n<li>Interrupts are enabled (BIOS IVT is active)</li>\n<li>The A20 line (a hardware address line that enables access above 1MB) may or may not be enabled depending on firmware vintage</li>\n<li>You are in 16-bit real mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything else — the stack pointer, direction of memory layout, which registers contain meaningful values — is undefined. Your bootloader must establish all of it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-2-the-mbr-constraint-and-two-stage-bootloaders\">Section 2: The MBR Constraint and Two-Stage Bootloaders</h2>\n<p>512 bytes sounds like a lot until you realize what you need to fit inside it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stack setup</li>\n<li>A20 line enablement code</li>\n<li>Disk read code (BIOS INT 13h)</li>\n<li>GDT descriptor table and its load instruction</li>\n<li>Protected mode switch</li>\n<li>Jump to 32-bit kernel code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is impossible in a single stage. Real bootloaders solve this with a <strong>two-stage approach</strong>: Stage 1 (512 bytes, in the MBR) does the minimum needed to load Stage 2 from disk. Stage 2 (a few kilobytes, unconstrained) does everything else: enables A20, reads the actual kernel binary, configures the GDT, and enters protected mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m1-mbr-disk-layout.svg\" alt=\"MBR and Disk Layout for Two-Stage Bootloader\"></p>\n<p><strong>The 512-byte signature:</strong> The BIOS validates your MBR by checking that bytes 510-511 contain <code>0x55 0xAA</code> (called the boot signature). If these bytes are missing or wrong, the BIOS refuses to boot from that disk. This is enforced in firmware hardware; there is no workaround. Your linker script or assembler must pad to exactly 512 bytes and place the signature correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">nasm</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>; End of boot sector (NASM syntax)\ntimes 510 - ($ - $$) db 0    ; Pad to 510 bytes\ndw 0xAA55                     ; Boot signature (little-endian: 0x55, 0xAA)</code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why <code>0x55 0xAA</code> little-endian?</strong> When stored as a 16-bit word on a little-endian CPU, <code>0xAA55</code> stores byte <code>0x55</code> first and byte <code>0xAA</code> second in memory. The BIOS checks bytes 510 and 511 for <code>0x55</code> and <code>0xAA</code> respectively. NASM&#39;s <code>dw</code> directive uses little-endian storage, so <code>dw 0xAA55</code> produces exactly <code>0x55, 0xAA</code> in memory. This is the first time byte order matters to you; it will not be the last.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-loading-the-kernel-from-disk-bios-int-13h\">Section 3: Loading the Kernel from Disk — BIOS INT 13h</h2>\n<p>With Stage 1 running at <code>0x7C00</code>, its entire job is to load Stage 2 from disk into memory at a known address and jump to it. The only tool available for disk I/O in real mode is <strong>BIOS INT 13h</strong>, a software interrupt that asks the firmware to perform a disk read on your behalf.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Software interrupt:</strong> Unlike hardware interrupts (signals from devices), a software interrupt is triggered by the <code>int</code> instruction. It looks up a handler in the IVT (using the interrupt number as an index), saves the CPU state, and jumps to firmware code that talks to the disk controller. After the firmware finishes, it executes <code>iret</code> (Interrupt Return) and your code resumes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The INT 13h function <code>0x02</code> reads sectors using <strong>CHS addressing</strong> (Cylinder-Head-Sector — a legacy coordinate system for disk geometry). For simplicity, GRUB and modern bootloaders use the <strong>LBA extension</strong> (INT 13h <code>0x42</code>, which uses logical block addresses starting from 0). For a learning OS, CHS is fine since you are always reading sectors near the start of the disk.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">nasm</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>; BIOS INT 13h: Read sectors (function 0x02)\n; Reads 'count' sectors starting at CHS (cylinder=0, head=0, sector=2)\n; into ES:BX (segment:offset address in real mode)\nmov ah, 0x02          ; Function: read sectors\nmov al, 15            ; Number of sectors to read (15 × 512 = 7680 bytes for stage2)\nmov ch, 0             ; Cylinder 0\nmov cl, 2             ; Sector 2 (sector 1 is the MBR, sectors are 1-indexed in CHS)\nmov dh, 0             ; Head 0\n; DL already contains the boot drive number from BIOS\nmov bx, 0x7E00        ; Load destination: immediately after MBR in memory\nint 0x13              ; Call BIOS disk service\njc disk_error         ; Carry flag set = error; halt or retry</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>After Stage 1 loads Stage 2, it executes a <code>jmp 0x7E00</code> (or wherever Stage 2 was loaded).

The kernel is loaded to physical address <code>0x100000</code> — above the first megabyte — because the memory below 1MB is cluttered with BIOS data structures, video memory, and the bootloader itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A20 line:</strong> A historical accident. On the original IBM PC, the 8086 had only 20 address lines (A0–A19). Memory wraparound from <code>0xFFFFF + 1</code> back to <code>0x00000</code> was a <em>feature</em> that some DOS programs depended on. When the 286 added a 21st address line (A20), IBM added a gate controlled by the keyboard controller to disable it for compatibility. Your bootloader must explicitly enable it. The most portable method is via the BIOS (INT 15h, AX=2401h). On modern hardware/VMs, A20 is often already enabled; on real hardware, skipping this check causes bizarre memory access failures above 1MB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m1-boot-sequence.svg\" alt=\"x86 Boot Sequence: BIOS to Kernel main()\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-4-the-gdt-hardware-you-talk-to-not-a-data-structure-you-design\">Section 4: The GDT — Hardware You Talk To, Not a Data Structure You Design</h2>\n<p>Here is the conceptual shift that trips up every systems programmer coming from userspace: the <strong>GDT (Global Descriptor Table)</strong> is not a software abstraction. It is a hardware register — the <code>GDTR</code> — that the CPU reads on every segment register load after protected mode is active. Misconfigure one byte of an access field, and the CPU triple-faults the instant you try to use that segment. There is no error message. There is no stack trace. The machine reboots.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Triple fault:</strong> When the CPU encounters a fault (like a General Protection Fault from a bad segment), it tries to invoke the fault handler. If that invocation itself causes a fault (double fault), it tries to invoke the double-fault handler. If <em>that</em> causes a fault, the CPU has no more recovery options and performs a hard reset. This is a triple fault. In QEMU, it causes an immediate restart. On real hardware, you see a reboot. Triple faults during protected mode setup are the most common failure mode for new OS developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In protected mode, segment registers (<code>CS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>SS</code>, etc.) no longer contain base addresses directly. Instead, they contain <strong>segment selectors</strong> — 16-bit values that are indices into the GDT. When you load a value into <code>CS</code>, the CPU looks up the corresponding GDT entry and reads the base address, limit, and access rights from it. The hardware enforces those rights on every memory access.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m1-gdt-layout.svg\" alt=\"GDT Descriptor Binary Layout\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-gdt-descriptor-byte-by-byte\">The GDT Descriptor — Byte by Byte</h3>\n<p>Each GDT entry is exactly 8 bytes.

The BIOS IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) is a real-mode structure at physical address <code>0x0000</code>. If a hardware interrupt fires after you have loaded the GDTR but before you have set up an IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) for protected mode, the CPU will try to handle it using the IVT — which contains real-mode addresses that are meaningless as protected-mode gate descriptors. The result is an immediate triple fault.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Load the GDTR</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">nasm</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>lgdt [gdt_descriptor]   ; Load the GDT register with base address and size</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><code>lgdt</code> loads the 6-byte GDTR register: a 16-bit limit (size - 1) and a 32-bit base address pointing to your GDT.

Modern CPUs prefetch and decode instructions ahead of the current instruction pointer. Some of those prefetched instructions were decoded under real-mode assumptions. The far jump forces the pipeline to discard all prefetched instructions and restart fetching from the new address under protected-mode rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Without this far jump, the pipeline might execute a few real-mode-decoded instructions in protected mode — undefined behavior that manifests as random corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>After the far jump — loading data segment registers:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">nasm</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>protected_mode_entry:\n    mov ax, 0x10     ; Kernel data segment selector (GDT entry 2)\n    mov ds, ax\n    mov es, ax\n    mov fs, ax\n    mov gs, ax\n    mov ss, ax\n    mov esp, KERNEL_STACK_TOP   ; Set up a stack</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><code>CS</code> is loaded by the far jump.

&quot;this memory access has observable side effects that you cannot see — do not optimize it.&quot; Every MMIO access must be through <code>volatile</code> pointers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> Writing to <code>0xB8000</code> does not cost a cache miss in the L1/L2/L3 sense — MMIO regions are typically mapped as uncacheable by the memory type range registers (MTRRs) in the CPU. Every write goes directly to the device. This makes MMIO writes slower than RAM writes (hundreds of nanoseconds vs tens), but it guarantees the device sees the update immediately. For a terminal driver, this is irrelevant; for high-bandwidth MMIO (like GPU framebuffers), it matters enormously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-8-the-serial-port-debug-driver-a-lifeline\">Section 8: The Serial Port Debug Driver — A Lifeline</h2>\n<p>VGA output is visible on the screen, but it cannot be logged, captured, or piped to a file. The <strong>serial port (UART — Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)</strong> — specifically COM1 at I/O port <code>0x3F8</code> — is your debug lifeline. QEMU can map the serial port to stdout with <code>-serial stdio</code>, meaning every byte your kernel writes to COM1 appears in your terminal. When your kernel triple-faults before VGA is initialized, the last serial output tells you where it died.</p>\n<p>Unlike MMIO (which uses regular memory read/write instructions), serial port communication uses <strong>port-mapped I/O</strong> — the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> instructions, which address a separate 16-bit I/O address space distinct from the memory address space.

This is a <strong>busy-wait (spin loop)</strong> — the CPU does nothing useful while waiting. In a production kernel, you would use interrupts and a transmit queue. At boot time, before interrupts are configured, busy-waiting is the only option. Every character costs approximately 260 microseconds at 38400 baud (1 / 38400 baud × 10 bits per character ≈ 260μs).

The BIOS returns with the data in memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 2 — BIOS and Firmware:</strong>\nINT 13h is a software interrupt that vectors through the IVT to BIOS code in ROM. The BIOS firmware contains drivers for legacy ATA/IDE controllers, floppy disk controllers, and (via INT 13h extensions) USB mass storage and SATA drives emulated as legacy disks. The firmware maintains an internal data structure (the BIOS Data Area at <code>0x400</code>) with disk geometry information discovered during POST. The BIOS firmware uses PIO (Programmed I/O) or DMA to transfer sectors from the disk controller&#39;s buffer to your specified memory address.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3 — Hardware:</strong>\nThe disk controller receives an ATA command (for SATA drives in legacy emulation mode: READ SECTORS, LBA28 or CHS addressing). The drive&#39;s internal controller reads data from spinning platters (HDD) or NAND flash (SSD), places it in the drive&#39;s sector buffer, and signals completion via IRQ14 (primary ATA channel). The BIOS handles the IRQ, copies data from the I/O ports (<code>0x1F0</code>-<code>0x1F7</code> for primary ATA) into memory using <code>rep insw</code> (read string from port), and returns to your code. On a real spinning disk, this read costs 3–10ms of seek time. On a VM using a file-backed disk image, it costs microseconds — the host OS has already cached it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This entire chain — INT 13h software interrupt → BIOS firmware → ATA command → disk hardware → memory DMA — is the conceptual ancestor of every I/O abstraction that follows. Linux&#39;s block layer, NVMe command queues, and io_uring are all adding buffering, reordering, and concurrency on top of this same physical read.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"pitfalls-reference-the-seven-most-common-triple-faults\">Pitfalls Reference: The Seven Most Common Triple Faults</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pitfall</th>\n<th>Why It Happens</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>GDT access byte wrong</td>\n<td>Magic numbers are easy to misinform; one wrong bit</td>\n<td>Build a descriptor macro; cross-check with OSDev wiki table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No far jump after <code>CR0.PE</code></td>\n<td>Pipeline has real-mode prefetched instructions</td>\n<td>The <code>jmp 0x08:label</code> instruction is <em>mandatory</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interrupts not disabled</td>\n<td>Hardware interrupt fires mid-transition with no IDT</td>\n<td><code>cli</code> must precede <code>lgdt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A20 not enabled</td>\n<td>Kernel loads to <code>0x100000</code>; odd addresses wrap to first 64KB</td>\n<td>Enable via BIOS INT 15h AX=2401h or I/O port method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BSS not zeroed</td>\n<td>Global <code>int x = 0</code> has garbage value; logic errors far from cause</td>\n<td><code>rep stosd</code> or <code>rep stosb</code> from <code>__bss_start</code> to <code>__bss_end</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>volatile</code> missing on VGA</td>\n<td>Compiler eliminates &quot;dead&quot; MMIO writes</td>\n<td>Every MMIO access via <code>volatile</code> pointer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Linker script address mismatch</td>\n<td>Kernel linked at <code>0x200000</code> but loaded at <code>0x100000</code>; all jumps are wrong</td>\n<td>Verify with <code>nm</code>, <code>objdump -h</code>; check load address = link address</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"knowledge-cascade-ten-things-this-unlocks\">Knowledge Cascade — Ten Things This Unlocks</h2>\n<p>This milestone introduces foundational mechanisms that reappear everywhere in systems software. Each one below is a direct extension of what you just built.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Linker scripts → shared libraries, ASLR, and PIE binaries</strong>\nThe difference between link-time address and load-time address is exactly how Linux shared libraries work. A <code>.so</code> file is compiled as <strong>position-independent code (PIC)</strong> and linked without fixed addresses. The dynamic linker relocates it to wherever in virtual memory is available. <strong>ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)</strong> randomizes the load address of every binary and library to make buffer overflow exploits harder. You just experienced the root concept: the address the linker embeds and the address the loader uses are separate concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Freestanding environments → embedded firmware, WASM runtimes, UEFI drivers</strong>\nThe discipline you just applied — no libc, no CRT0, explicit BSS zeroing, no floating-point ABI assumptions — is identical to what embedded firmware developers do for microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V) and what WASM runtimes implement as their &quot;OS-like&quot; substrate. Every UEFI driver is also a freestanding binary that runs before an OS exists. You now understand why embedded developers care about startup code.</p>\n<p><strong>3. CPU privilege rings → browser process isolation, SGX enclaves, hypervisors</strong>\nReal mode vs protected mode is your first encounter with hardware-enforced privilege boundaries. CPL 0 (ring 0) vs CPL 3 (ring 3) is why a browser tab cannot read your kernel memory — the CPU refuses to execute user-mode code that accesses supervisor-only pages. Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) creates a ring -1 of sorts where even the OS cannot read enclave memory. Hypervisors add a VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) layer below ring 0. All of these extend the same mechanism you just configured.</p>\n<p><strong>4. GDT segment registers → the death of segmentation in 64-bit mode</strong>\nIn 64-bit x86 (long mode), segmentation is almost entirely disabled. <code>CS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>SS</code> are ignored for address calculation (base=0 always, limit irrelevant). The GDT still exists (the CPU reads it for privilege level and some system segments), but the flat-memory model you configured is now the <em>only</em> model. Understanding why 32-bit protected mode needed segments — and why 64-bit mode abandoned them — is a prerequisite for understanding why ARM64 and RISC-V never added segmentation at all.</p>\n<p><strong>5. BIOS INT 13h → Linux block layer → io_uring</strong>\nThe disk read you just did is the bottom of an abstraction stack that has grown 50 years of complexity. Linux&#39;s block layer adds request queuing, elevator scheduling, and merge logic. NVMe command queues allow 65,535 queued commands per queue with zero-copy DMA. io_uring adds a shared ring buffer between kernel and userspace to eliminate syscall overhead entirely. The physical read at the bottom is the same; everything else is batching, reordering, and removing round-trips.</p>\n<p><strong>6. MMIO at 0xB8000 → GPU framebuffers → PCIe BAR mapping</strong>\nWriting to <code>0xB8000</code> and seeing characters appear is your first MMIO device. Modern GPUs expose tens of gigabytes of framebuffer and register space as MMIO via <strong>PCIe BARs (Base Address Registers)</strong>. The OS maps these physical addresses into virtual address space using page tables (flagged as uncacheable MMIO), and graphics drivers write directly to GPU registers and VRAM the same way you wrote to <code>0xB8000</code>. The mechanism scales to terabytes; the concept is identical.</p>\n<p><strong>7. The BSS section → demand-zeroing and zero pages in Linux</strong>\nLinux is lazy about zeroing memory. When you <code>mmap</code> anonymous memory, Linux maps all pages to a single read-only <strong>zero page</strong>. The first write to any of these pages triggers a copy-on-write page fault that allocates a real page and zeros it on demand. BSS segments in ELF executables are handled the same way — the kernel does not physically zero them at load time; it marks the pages as zero-fill-on-demand. You did this eagerly because you had no page fault handler yet. Linux does it lazily for efficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>8. <code>volatile</code> and MMIO → memory ordering and <code>mfence</code>/<code>sfence</code> in SMP kernels</strong>\n<code>volatile</code> prevents the compiler from reordering or eliminating MMIO accesses. On a multi-core machine, you also need <strong>memory barriers</strong> to prevent the CPU&#39;s out-of-order execution engine from reordering MMIO writes relative to other memory operations. <code>mfence</code> (Memory Fence), <code>sfence</code> (Store Fence), and <code>lfence</code> (Load Fence) are the hardware instructions for this. Device drivers in Linux use <code>wmb()</code>, <code>rmb()</code>, and <code>mb()</code> macros that compile to the appropriate fence instructions. Your <code>volatile</code> VGA driver is the conceptual root.</p>\n<p><strong>9. The bootloader size constraint → UEFI and the death of the MBR</strong>\nThe 512-byte MBR is a constraint from 1983. <strong>UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)</strong> replaces it with a firmware that reads a FAT32 partition (the EFI System Partition), loads a full ELF or PE executable (the bootloader), and provides a rich API for disk access, graphics, and device enumeration — all before the OS starts. GRUB 2 supports both BIOS MBR and UEFI. The Rust OS tutorial (phil-opp) targets UEFI. Understanding why the MBR is so constrained makes UEFI&#39;s design choices obvious.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Serial port debug output → GDB stubs → kernel crash reporters</strong>\nYour serial port is the simplest form of out-of-band debug output. Linux&#39;s <strong>kgdb</strong> (Kernel GNU Debugger) works over serial: the kernel includes a GDB stub that, on a kernel panic, starts listening on the serial port for GDB remote protocol commands. You can then attach from a second machine, inspect kernel memory, and walk the call stack — exactly like QEMU&#39;s <code>-s -S</code> flags. Production kernel crash reporters (kdump, crash) use a separate kernel loaded into reserved memory to capture the main kernel&#39;s state after a panic.</p>\n<hr>\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m2 -->\n<h1 id=\"milestone-2-interrupts-exceptions-and-keyboard\">Milestone 2: Interrupts, Exceptions, and Keyboard</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-revelation-the-pic-was-built-before-cpu-exceptions-existed\">The Revelation: The PIC Was Built Before CPU Exceptions Existed</h2>\n<p>Here is what every developer who has written event-driven code believes about hardware interrupts: the CPU pauses whatever it is doing, runs a handler function, and resumes — like a JavaScript event listener or a POSIX signal handler, but lower-level. The interrupt numbers assigned to hardware devices just work, because surely someone designed the system as a coherent whole. This belief is understandable. It is also wrong in a way that will triple-fault your kernel the moment you enable interrupts without reading this section.</p>\n<p>The Intel 8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller — the chip that translates hardware signals from devices into CPU interrupt vectors) was designed in 1976 for the 8080 processor. The x86 CPU exception model — the numbered exceptions for divide-by-zero, page faults, general protection faults — was designed in 1982 for the 286. These two teams did not coordinate. The result: the 8259 PIC, <em>out of the factory</em>, maps <strong>IRQ0 (the timer interrupt) to CPU vector 8</strong>. CPU vector 8, by the 286 exception specification, is the <strong>double fault handler</strong> — the CPU&#39;s last-resort recovery mechanism before a triple fault.</p>\n<p>The consequence is direct: if you configure the IDT and enable interrupts without first remapping the PIC, the first timer tick — arriving approximately 55 milliseconds after you call <code>sti</code> — causes the CPU to invoke your double fault handler. Your double fault handler tries to display an error message. While it does so, another timer tick arrives. The CPU tries to invoke the double fault handler <em>again</em>, but it is already executing — this is a fault inside a fault handler, which is itself a double fault. The CPU looks for a double fault handler, which it cannot invoke because it is busy. <strong>Triple fault. Reboot. No error message.</strong></p>\n<p>This is not an obscure edge case. It is the default behavior of x86 hardware. Every OS developer encounters it. Now you know why it happens before it happens to you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-pic-vector-collision.svg\" alt=\"PIC Default Mapping vs CPU Exception Vectors\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-1-the-interrupt-taxonomy-not-all-interrupts-are-created-equal\">Section 1: The Interrupt Taxonomy — Not All Interrupts Are Created Equal</h2>\n<p>Before configuring hardware, you need a clear mental model of what the CPU actually does when something demands its attention. The x86 architecture has three distinct interrupt categories, and conflating them is the source of most beginner confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Exceptions</strong> are synchronous events generated by the CPU itself in response to an instruction. They happen because of what code is doing right now, at this instruction. Examples: dividing by zero (exception 0), accessing a non-present page (exception 14 — the page fault), executing a privileged instruction from ring 3 (exception 13 — General Protection Fault). Exceptions can be further classified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faults</strong>: The CPU reports the exception <em>before</em> completing the faulting instruction. If the handler fixes the problem (like a page fault handler that maps the missing page), the instruction retries from the beginning. The saved <code>EIP</code> points to the faulting instruction.</li>\n<li><strong>Traps</strong>: The CPU reports the exception <em>after</em> completing the triggering instruction. The saved <code>EIP</code> points to the next instruction. Breakpoints (exception 3) and overflow (exception 4) are traps.</li>\n<li><strong>Aborts</strong>: Unrecoverable errors. The CPU cannot reliably report the faulting instruction&#39;s address. Double fault (exception 8) and machine check (exception 18) are aborts. You cannot resume from an abort; you halt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hardware IRQs</strong> (Interrupt Requests) are asynchronous events generated by external devices. The keyboard pressed a key. The timer ticked. The network card received a packet. These arrive between instructions — the CPU finishes the current instruction, saves state, and jumps to the handler. The device generating the IRQ does not know or care what the CPU was doing; it just signals the PIC, which decides whether to forward the signal to the CPU based on its priority mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Software interrupts</strong> are explicitly triggered by the <code>int N</code> instruction. They look like hardware interrupts to the CPU but are generated intentionally by code. <code>int 0x80</code> is the Linux system call interface (historically); <code>int 0x03</code> is the software breakpoint. You will implement <code>int 0x80</code> as your system call gate in Milestone 4.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The CPU&#39;s perspective on all three:</strong> From the CPU&#39;s point of view, all three types go through the same mechanism — the IDT. The CPU uses the interrupt vector number as an index into the IDT, loads the gate descriptor, switches stacks if privilege level changes, pushes state, and jumps to the handler. The <em>source</em> of the interrupt (exception logic, PIC signal, or <code>int</code> instruction) is irrelevant to the dispatch mechanism. This uniformity is elegant; the complexity is in the details of each type.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-2-the-idt-256-slots-each-a-gate-to-a-handler\">Section 2: The IDT — 256 Slots, Each a Gate to a Handler</h2>\n<p>The <strong>IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)</strong> is the protected-mode analog of the real-mode IVT. Where the IVT was a flat array of 4-byte real-mode addresses (segment:offset pairs), the IDT is an array of 8-byte <strong>gate descriptors</strong> that specify not just where to jump, but <em>how</em> to jump: which privilege level is required to invoke this gate, whether to clear the interrupt flag on entry, and which code segment to use for the handler.</p>\n<p>The IDT has exactly 256 entries, addressing every possible 8-bit interrupt vector. Entries 0–31 are reserved by Intel for CPU exceptions (though not all are currently used — unused ones should still have handlers that print a meaningful error and halt). Entries 32–255 are available for hardware IRQs and software interrupts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-idt-gate-structure.svg\" alt=\"IDT Gate Descriptor: Interrupt Gate vs Trap Gate\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-gate-descriptor-eight-bytes-that-control-everything\">The Gate Descriptor — Eight Bytes That Control Everything</h3>\n<p>Each IDT entry is an 8-byte gate descriptor. The most important gate types for a kernel are:</p>\n<p><strong>Interrupt Gate (type = 0xE for 32-bit)</strong>: When the CPU invokes an interrupt gate, it automatically <strong>clears the Interrupt Flag (IF)</strong>. This means hardware interrupts are masked for the duration of the handler.

For the system call gate (DPL=3), user-mode code can explicitly call <code>int 0x80</code>.

The IDT gate descriptor&#39;s layout is defined by hardware specification — the bytes must be in exactly the positions Intel specifies, with no padding. <code>packed</code> instructs GCC to pack fields with no padding.

Understanding this stack frame is essential — miscounting the items on the stack is one of the most common sources of silent corruption in kernel development.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-isr-stack-frame.svg\" alt=\"diag-m2-isr-stack-frame\"></p>\n<p><strong>For interrupts arriving while in ring 0 (kernel mode):</strong></p>\n<p>The CPU pushes onto the <em>current</em> stack (no stack switch required since we are already in ring 0):</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>High address (top of stack before interrupt)\n┌─────────────────┐\n│     EFLAGS      │  ← Saved EFLAGS (contains IF, DF, IOPL, etc.)\n├─────────────────┤\n│       CS        │  ← Saved code segment selector (value 0x08)\n├─────────────────┤\n│      EIP        │  ← Return address (instruction to resume at)\n├─────────────────┤\n│   Error Code    │  ← Only for exceptions that push one (see below)\n└─────────────────┘   ← ESP now points here after hardware push\nLow address</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>For interrupts arriving while in ring 3 (user mode):</strong></p>\n<p>The CPU <em>also</em> performs a privilege-level transition. It reads the kernel stack pointer from the TSS (Task State Segment — configured in Milestone 4), switches to the kernel stack, and pushes additional values:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>High address (kernel stack top from TSS.ESP0)\n┌─────────────────┐\n│       SS        │  ← User-mode stack segment\n├─────────────────┤\n│      ESP        │  ← User-mode stack pointer\n├─────────────────┤\n│     EFLAGS      │  ← User-mode EFLAGS\n├─────────────────┤\n│       CS        │  ← User-mode code segment selector (0x1B)\n├─────────────────┤\n│      EIP        │  ← User-mode return address\n├─────────────────┤\n│   Error Code    │  ← Only for exceptions that push one\n└─────────────────┘   ← ESP now points here\nLow address</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><code>iret</code> (Interrupt Return) is the counterpart to this automatic push. It pops <code>EIP</code>, <code>CS</code>, and <code>EFLAGS</code> from the stack and restores them atomically. If a privilege transition occurred (CS&#39;s DPL changed), <code>iret</code> also pops <code>ESP</code> and <code>SS</code> and switches back to the user stack. This is why you cannot use <code>ret</code> to return from an interrupt handler — <code>ret</code> only pops <code>EIP</code>, leaving <code>CS</code> and <code>EFLAGS</code> on the stack, corrupting the stack pointer for the resumed code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-error-code-asymmetry-the-source-of-countless-stack-misalignments\">The Error Code Asymmetry — The Source of Countless Stack Misalignments</h3>\n<p>Of the 32 CPU exception vectors, some push an error code onto the stack <em>before</em> invoking the handler; others do not.

<strong>8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)</strong> is a chip that sits between hardware devices and the CPU. Up to 15 hardware IRQ lines feed into the PIC (or a cascade of two PICs — master and slave), and the PIC translates them into CPU interrupt vectors. The critical word is <em>programmable</em>: the mapping from IRQ number to vector number is configurable. It just ships from the factory configured incorrectly for protected-mode x86.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-pic-icw-initialization.svg\" alt=\"PIC 8259 ICW Initialization Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The standard PC architecture uses <strong>two 8259 PICs in cascade</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Master PIC</strong> (ports <code>0x20</code> / <code>0x21</code>): handles IRQ0–IRQ7</li>\n<li><strong>Slave PIC</strong> (ports <code>0xA0</code> / <code>0xA1</code>): handles IRQ8–IRQ15; connected to master via IRQ2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The IRQ-to-device mapping:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>IRQ</th>\n<th>Device</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>PIT Timer (Programmable Interval Timer)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>PS/2 Keyboard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Cascade (slave PIC)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>COM2 Serial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>COM1 Serial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>LPT2 / Sound</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Floppy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>LPT1 / Spurious</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>CMOS Real-Time Clock</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Legacy SCSI / Free</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>PS/2 Mouse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>FPU</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Primary ATA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Secondary ATA / Spurious</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Default mapping (wrong for protected mode):</strong> IRQ0→vector 8, IRQ1→vector 9, ..., IRQ7→vector 15, IRQ8→vector 112 (or 0x70), ..., IRQ15→vector 119. Vectors 8–15 collide directly with CPU exceptions (double fault, invalid TSS, segment not present, stack fault, GPF, page fault, reserved, coprocessor error).</p>\n<p><strong>Target mapping (correct for protected mode):</strong> IRQ0→vector 32, IRQ1→vector 33, ..., IRQ7→vector 39, IRQ8→vector 40, ..., IRQ15→vector 47. This places all hardware IRQs above the 32 reserved exception vectors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-icw-initialization-protocol\">The ICW Initialization Protocol</h3>\n<p>Reprogramming the PIC requires sending a precise sequence of <strong>ICW (Initialization Command Words)</strong> to specific I/O ports. The PIC enters initialization mode when it receives ICW1, then expects ICW2, ICW3, and ICW4 in order — the chip has a state machine that advances through these command words automatically.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* pic.c — PIC remapping */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"io.h\"</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* outb/inb from Milestone 1 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PIC1_CMD</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">20</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Master PIC command port */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PIC1_DATA</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">   0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">21</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Master PIC data port    */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PIC2_CMD</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">A0</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Slave PIC command port  */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PIC2_DATA</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">   0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">A1</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Slave PIC data port     */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PIC_EOI</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">     0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">20</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* End-of-Interrupt command */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> ICW1_INIT</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">   0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">10</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Initialize bit (required) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> ICW1_ICW4</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">   0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">01</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* ICW4 will be provided */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> ICW4_8086</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">   0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">01</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* 8086/88 mode (vs MCS-80/85) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Small I/O delay — some hardware needs time between PIC writes */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> io_wait</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    outb</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">80</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">0</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* Port 0x80 is unused POST diagnostic port;

The PIC will not deliver another interrupt on that line — or, for a master PIC, will not deliver lower-priority IRQs — until it receives an <strong>EOI (End of Interrupt)</strong> signal.</p>\n<p>If you forget to send EOI, the PIC permanently suppresses that IRQ line. The timer stops firing. The keyboard goes silent. The system does not crash — it simply stops responding to hardware events, with no error message. This is one of the most insidious bugs in kernel development.</p>\n<p>The rule: if the IRQ came from the <strong>slave PIC</strong> (IRQ8–15), you must send EOI to <strong>both the slave and the master</strong>. If it came from the <strong>master PIC</strong> (IRQ0–7, excluding IRQ2), send EOI only to the master.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> pic_send_eoi</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint8_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> irq</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    if</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (irq </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">>=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 8</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">        /* IRQ came from slave PIC — slave must be acknowledged first */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">        outb</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(PIC2_CMD, PIC_EOI);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Always acknowledge master PIC */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    outb</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(PIC1_CMD, PIC_EOI);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Spurious IRQs — the phantom interrupt:</strong> IRQ7 (master) and IRQ15 (slave) are special. Due to electrical characteristics of the PIC, a noise spike or very short IRQ pulse can cause the PIC to issue an interrupt but then clear it before the CPU reads the ISR. The CPU receives vector 39 (IRQ7) or 47 (IRQ15) — a &quot;spurious&quot; interrupt with no real source. Your handler must check the PIC&#39;s ISR register to distinguish real IRQ7/15 from spurious ones. A spurious IRQ7 must <em>not</em> receive an EOI (the PIC did not actually set the ISR bit); a spurious IRQ15 requires an EOI to the <em>master</em> but not the slave. Most beginner kernels ignore this and get away with it — until they run on hardware that generates noise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-5-the-irq-stub-framework\">Section 5: The IRQ Stub Framework</h2>\n<p>Hardware IRQ handlers follow the same save/restore pattern as exception handlers, but they also need to send EOI.

This is risky for non-reentrant handlers (like the keyboard buffer handler) — a second keyboard interrupt while the first is being processed can corrupt the buffer. Sending EOI <em>after</em> the handler is safer for simple kernels: the PIC waits until the handler completes. In production kernels (Linux), EOI timing is more nuanced and depends on interrupt threading. For this kernel: send EOI after the handler.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now register the IDT gates for all 48 vectors (0–31 exceptions, 32–47 IRQs):</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> idt_setup_all</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* CPU exceptions: trap gates (IF not cleared, allows debugger interruption) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">0</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,  (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)isr0,  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_TRAP_GATE);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,  (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)isr1,  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_TRAP_GATE);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* ... for all 0-31 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">8</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,  (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)isr8,  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_TRAP_GATE);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Double fault */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">13</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)isr13, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_TRAP_GATE);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* GPF */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">14</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)isr14, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_TRAP_GATE);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Page fault */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Hardware IRQs: interrupt gates (IF cleared on entry — no nested IRQs) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">32</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)irq0,  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_set_gate</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">33</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)irq1,  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">08</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* ... for all IRQ stubs */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_install</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-the-pit-building-a-100hz-clock-from-a-counting-chip\">Section 6: The PIT — Building a 100Hz Clock from a Counting Chip</h2>\n<p>With interrupts wired up and the PIC remapped, you need a source of periodic interrupts to drive future scheduling.

pit_tick_count</code>:</strong> The <code>volatile</code> qualifier is required here for the same reason it was required for MMIO in Milestone 1 — without it, the compiler may cache the value in a register and never re-read from memory. Since <code>pit_tick_count</code> is modified by the interrupt handler and read by other code, the compiler cannot see this dependency (interrupt handlers are invisible to the optimizer&#39;s control flow analysis). <code>volatile</code> forces every access to go through memory. On a multi-core system, <code>volatile</code> is insufficient — you need atomic operations. For a single-core kernel, <code>volatile</code> is correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> At 100Hz, the PIT fires every 10ms. From the CPU&#39;s perspective: the PIT asserts IRQ0 → the PIC samples it at the end of the current instruction → the CPU acknowledges, saves state (EFLAGS, CS, EIP pushed: <del>20 cycles), reads the IDT entry (1 memory access, likely L2 cache hit: ~10 cycles), jumps to the stub, <code>pusha</code> (</del>8 cycles), C handler call (~15 cycles). Total interrupt latency from IRQ assertion to first instruction of handler: roughly 50–100 cycles, or 25–50 nanoseconds at 2GHz. This is negligible for a 10ms period. The interrupt overhead at 100Hz is approximately 50ns/10ms = 0.0005% CPU time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-7-the-double-fault-handler-the-last-line-of-defense\">Section 7: The Double Fault Handler — The Last Line of Defense</h2>\n<p>Exception 8 (double fault) deserves special treatment. A double fault occurs when the CPU tries to deliver an exception but encounters another exception while doing so — for instance, a GPF while trying to invoke the GPF handler because the handler&#39;s address in the IDT is invalid, or a stack fault while pushing the exception frame because the stack pointer is invalid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-double-fault-chain.svg\" alt=\"Exception Chaining: Triple Fault Anatomy\"></p>\n<p>The double fault handler is unique: <strong>it always pushes an error code of zero</strong> (even though the error code is always zero, the CPU pushes it, so your stub must use the <code>ISR_ERR</code> macro — it accounts for the CPU-pushed error code). If the double fault handler itself faults, you get a triple fault (unrecoverable reset). Therefore, the double fault handler must be bulletproof: no function calls, no stack-heavy operations, no paging assumptions.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* In exception_handler in interrupt.c: special case for vector 8 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">if</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (frame</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">-></span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">vector </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">==</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 8</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Double fault: system is in an inconsistent state.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">       Print what we can, then halt.

A robust kernel uses a separate <strong>Task State Segment</strong> with its own stack for the double fault handler, configured in the IDT as a <strong>task gate</strong> rather than an interrupt gate. The CPU hardware switches to this separate stack before pushing the fault frame, guaranteeing the handler always has a valid stack. This is the technique Linux uses. For this milestone, a standard interrupt gate is sufficient — just ensure your kernel stack is healthy before enabling interrupts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-8-the-ps2-keyboard-driver-make-codes-break-codes-and-the-scancode-table\">Section 8: The PS/2 Keyboard Driver — Make Codes, Break Codes, and the Scancode Table</h2>\n<p>With the interrupt framework in place, the keyboard driver is its first real application. The <strong>PS/2 keyboard</strong> (the classic DIN/mini-DIN connector, still emulated by USB HID on modern hardware) communicates via two I/O ports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Port <code>0x60</code></strong> (PS/2 Data Port): Read a byte to get the next scancode; write a byte to send a command to the keyboard controller.</li>\n<li><strong>Port <code>0x64</code></strong> (PS/2 Status/Command Port): Read to get controller status; write to send controller commands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-keyboard-scancode-pipeline.svg\" alt=\"PS/2 Keyboard: Scancode to Keypress Pipeline\"></p>\n<p>When a key is pressed or released, the PS/2 controller generates IRQ1 and places a <strong>scancode</strong> in the data register at port <code>0x60</code>. Scancodes are not ASCII codes — they are hardware-level codes that represent physical key positions on the keyboard, independent of the key&#39;s character or the current modifier state. The three scancode sets have different code assignments; PS/2 keyboards default to <strong>Set 1</strong> on IBM-compatible PCs.</p>\n<p>The critical behavior: every key generates <strong>two events</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make code</strong>: sent when the key is <em>pressed</em>. For most keys in Set 1, this is a single byte in the range <code>0x01</code>–<code>0x58</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Break code</strong>: sent when the key is <em>released</em>. This is the make code with bit 7 set (ORed with <code>0x80</code>). So the <code>A</code> key&#39;s make code is <code>0x1E</code>, and its break code is <code>0x9E</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some keys (extended keys like arrow keys, Numpad Enter, right Ctrl) send a two-byte sequence starting with <code>0xE0</code>, followed by the actual code. You can handle these later; for a first implementation, handle single-byte codes only.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre

<code>kb_buffer</code> is accessed by two &quot;parties&quot; — the interrupt handler writes to it, and kernel polling code reads from it. The head pointer (<code>kb_head</code>) advances on write; the tail pointer (<code>kb_tail</code>) advances on read. The buffer is full when <code>(head + 1) % SIZE == tail</code>; empty when <code>head == tail</code>. This structure avoids needing to shift bytes around — it is O(1) per operation. It is the same data structure used for kernel pipe buffers, network socket receive queues, and audio sample ring buffers. On a single-core system, the interrupt handler cannot be interrupted by <code>keyboard_getchar</code> (since interrupts are disabled in the IRQ handler), so no lock is needed. On SMP, you need an atomic compare-and-swap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-9-wiring-it-all-together\">Section 9: Wiring It All Together</h2>\n<p>The complete initialization sequence, to be called from <code>kmain()</code> after the VGA and serial drivers:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> kmain</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Milestone 1: output drivers */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    serial_init</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    vga_clear</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    kprintf</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Kernel booted.

If the buffer is non-empty, a character is returned immediately. From the caller&#39;s perspective: a character appeared, asynchronously, via some mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 2 — The Interrupt Path:</strong>\nThe PS/2 keyboard controller (an Intel 8042-compatible chip) received a serial bit stream from the keyboard matrix, assembled it into a scancode byte, and asserted IRQ1. The PIC sampled IRQ1, determined it was not masked, and raised the <code>INTR</code> line to the CPU between instructions. The CPU finished the current instruction, saved EFLAGS/CS/EIP to the kernel stack, indexed into the IDT at vector 33 (<code>32 + IRQ1</code>), loaded the handler address, and jumped to <code>irq1</code> stub. The stub saved all registers (<code>pusha</code>), called <code>irq_dispatcher</code>, which called <code>keyboard_handler</code>, which read port <code>0x60</code> (consuming the scancode from the controller&#39;s buffer), translated it, and wrote to the circular buffer. Then EOI was sent to the master PIC, all registers were restored, and <code>iret</code> resumed the interrupted code.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3 — Hardware Timing:</strong>\nThe keyboard matrix scanner runs at roughly 1kHz, debounces key contacts (physical contacts bounce for 5–20ms when pressed), and serializes the scancode at 10–16kHz to the PS/2 controller. The PS/2 controller buffers the scancode and asserts IRQ1. The PIC&#39;s interrupt arbitration circuit checks priority (lower IRQ number = higher priority) and the master&#39;s IMR (Interrupt Mask Register) to decide whether to raise <code>INTR</code>. The CPU&#39;s interrupt recognition happens at instruction boundaries — some long instructions (like <code>rep movs</code>) check for interrupts between iterations. The total latency from key press to handler executing: 5–20ms of debounce + ~60μs of PS/2 serial transfer + ~1μs of PIC arbitration + ~50ns of CPU pipeline flush = effectively human-imperceptible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> Every <code>inb(0x60)</code> in <code>keyboard_handler</code> crosses the I/O bus — it is not cached, it stalls the CPU pipeline waiting for the I/O port to respond (typically 1–4μs for legacy I/O ports). On the 8259 PIC, the EOI write (<code>outb(PIC1_CMD, 0x20)</code>) similarly crosses the I/O bus. Total I/O bus accesses per keypress: 2 (read scancode + write EOI) × ~2μs each ≈ 4μs of pure I/O stall. Irrelevant at human typing speeds; significant if you were handling millions of IRQs per second (which is why modern NICs use MSI-X and interrupt coalescing rather than per-packet IRQs).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-interrupt-vs-trap-gate-distinction-a-design-decision-with-consequences\">The Interrupt vs Trap Gate Distinction — A Design Decision With Consequences</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m2-idt-gate-structure.svg\" alt=\"IDT Gate Descriptor: Interrupt Gate vs Trap Gate\"></p>\n<p>The difference between an interrupt gate and a trap gate is a single bit in the IDT entry (<code>type</code> field: <code>0xE</code> vs <code>0xF</code>). But the behavioral consequence shapes every I/O subsystem in the kernel.</p>\n<p><strong>Interrupt gate (IF cleared on entry):</strong> When the CPU invokes an interrupt gate, it clears the Interrupt Flag. Hardware interrupts cannot arrive while your handler runs. This prevents timer interrupts from interrupting a timer handler (no reentrancy problem), and prevents keyboard IRQs from interrupting keyboard IRQ handling. The cost: if your handler is slow, you add latency to <em>all</em> other interrupts. No preemption occurs inside the handler.</p>\n<p><strong>Trap gate (IF not cleared on entry):</strong> Interrupts remain enabled. The handler can itself be interrupted by higher-priority hardware events. This is correct for CPU exceptions (a page fault handler might perform I/O that requires timer interrupts to complete), and it is essential for system calls — a <code>read()</code> syscall might block for seconds; you must allow other processes&#39; timer interrupts to fire during that wait.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gate Type</th>\n<th>IF on Entry</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Risk</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Interrupt Gate (<code>0x8E</code>)</td>\n<td>Cleared (interrupts off)</td>\n<td>Hardware IRQ handlers</td>\n<td>Interrupt latency if handler is slow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trap Gate (<code>0x8F</code>, DPL=0)</td>\n<td>Not cleared (interrupts on)</td>\n<td>CPU exception handlers</td>\n<td>Reentrancy if not careful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trap Gate (<code>0xEF</code>, DPL=3)</td>\n<td>Not cleared (interrupts on)</td>\n<td>System call gate (INT 0x80)</td>\n<td>User code can invoke via <code>int</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Linux uses interrupt gates for hardware IRQs (to prevent handler reentrancy) and trap gates for system calls (so timer interrupts still fire during blocking syscalls).

Here is the web of concepts it connects to.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Interrupt gate vs trap gate → Linux system call design and seccomp</strong>\nThe exact reason <code>int 0x80</code> in Linux uses a trap gate (type <code>0xEF</code>, DPL=3) rather than an interrupt gate (type <code>0x8E</code>) is so that hardware interrupts continue to fire during system call execution. A <code>read()</code> blocking on disk I/O can wait for seconds; the timer interrupt must still preempt other processes during that wait. If system calls used interrupt gates, the timer would be masked for the duration of any blocking syscall, making preemptive scheduling impossible. <strong>seccomp</strong> (Secure Computing Mode — the Linux mechanism for restricting which syscalls a process can make, used by Docker, Chrome, and Firefox sandbox) works by inserting a filter into the system call dispatch path at exactly the point between the IDT trap gate and the syscall table lookup. Understanding the gate type is understanding where seccomp hooks in.</p>\n<p><strong>2. EOI protocol → interrupt coalescing in network drivers (NAPI)</strong>\nThe mandatory EOI acknowledgment after each IRQ is the conceptual ancestor of a critical Linux networking optimization: <strong>NAPI (New API)</strong>. Without NAPI, every incoming network packet triggers an IRQ, the handler processes one packet, sends EOI, and the next packet immediately triggers another IRQ. At 10Gbps line rates, this produces millions of IRQs per second — the kernel spends more time in interrupt overhead than actual packet processing. NAPI&#39;s solution: on the first IRQ for a NIC, disable that NIC&#39;s IRQ line (like never sending EOI) and switch to polling mode — the kernel polls the NIC&#39;s receive queue in a tight loop until it empties, then re-enables the IRQ. This is interrupt coalescing: batch many events into one interrupt cycle. Modern NIC firmware does this autonomously via <strong>interrupt moderation</strong>, accumulating packets for up to 50–100μs before asserting the IRQ. The mandatory acknowledgment you just implemented is the primitive they are optimizing around.</p>\n<p><strong>3. ISR stack frame layout → Linux signal frames and <code>sigreturn</code></strong>\nThe stack frame your ISR creates (EFLAGS, CS, EIP, plus the general-purpose registers you pushed) is structurally identical to the <strong>signal frame</strong> that Linux pushes onto a user process&#39;s stack before invoking a signal handler. When you call <code>signal(SIGSEGV, handler)</code>, Linux&#39;s signal delivery mechanism saves all the process registers — exactly like <code>pusha</code> — plus the CPU&#39;s automatic EFLAGS/CS/EIP push, creates a <code>sigcontext</code> struct on the user stack, and jumps to your handler. When the handler returns, it calls <code>sigreturn</code> (a dedicated syscall), which reads that struct back from the stack and restores all the registers — exactly like your <code>popa</code> + <code>iret</code> sequence. The <strong>Spectre/Meltdown mitigations</strong> that Intel deployed in 2018 broke the <code>sigreturn</code> mechanism on some configurations by changing kernel/user address space isolation, and Linux had to rewrite the signal frame layout. You now understand exactly what broke.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PIT 100Hz tick → high-resolution timers, NTP, and <code>clock_gettime</code> complexity</strong>\nYour 100Hz tick counter has 10ms resolution — you cannot measure intervals shorter than one tick. Early Linux (2.4 kernel) used 100Hz for the same reason. The problems: 10ms is too coarse for audio (introduces jitter), too coarse for network latency measurement, and wastes power on laptops (the CPU must wake up 100 times per second even when idle). The <strong>HPET (High Precision Event Timer)</strong> was introduced to provide nanosecond resolution without high interrupt rates. The <strong>TSC deadline timer</strong> (available on modern CPUs) allows the OS to program a one-shot interrupt at a specific CPU cycle count, enabling <strong>tickless kernels</strong> (Linux NO_HZ mode) where the timer only fires when actually needed. <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> on modern Linux reads the TSC directly in userspace (via the vDSO — a kernel-mapped page containing code that bypasses the syscall overhead entirely), achieving nanosecond precision without any interrupt overhead. Your 100Hz PIT is the starting point of this 40-year evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>5. PS/2 make/break codes → USB HID protocol and N-key rollover</strong>\nEvery keypress generating two events (make and release) is not a PS/2 quirk — it is a fundamental input protocol design principle. <strong>USB HID (Human Interface Device)</strong> reports work the same way: a keyboard sends a report when any key state changes, containing a bitmask of all currently pressed keys. The HID protocol&#39;s <strong>key rollover</strong> specification defines how many simultaneously pressed keys the device can distinguish. <strong>N-key rollover (NKRO)</strong> means every key has independent state tracking — 104 keys pressed simultaneously are all reported. Budget keyboards implement 6-key rollover (6KRO), losing track of 7th+ simultaneous keys. Gaming keyboards advertise NKRO as a feature. This complexity exists because the USB HID report format must encode the exact state of every key in every report, requiring bitmask representation rather than PS/2&#39;s sequential event stream. The make/break model you just implemented is USB HID&#39;s ancestor.</p>\n<p><strong>6. The double fault handler → hardware watchdog timers and kernel oops</strong>\nYour double fault handler — print diagnostic info, halt — is a simplified version of what Linux&#39;s kernel panic handler does. Linux&#39;s <strong>kernel oops</strong> mechanism prints a backtrace, register dump, and loaded module list on any unhandled kernel exception, then either halts or continues (depending on <code>oops=panic</code> configuration). The <strong>NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt — vector 2)</strong> is a special interrupt that the CPU processes even when <code>IF=0</code> (it bypasses the interrupt flag entirely). Production servers wire the <strong>hardware watchdog timer</strong> to the NMI line — if the kernel freezes and stops responding, the watchdog fires an NMI, which the kernel handles by printing a backtrace and (optionally) triggering a machine reset. Google&#39;s servers use NMI-based watchdogs to automatically recover from kernel deadlocks. Your double fault handler is the conceptual prototype.</p>\n<hr>\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m3 -->\n<h1 id=\"milestone-3-physical-and-virtual-memory-management\">Milestone 3: Physical and Virtual Memory Management</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-revelation-paging-enables-itself-or-kills-you-trying\">The Revelation: Paging Enables Itself — Or Kills You Trying</h2>\n<p>Here is what every programmer who has worked above the OS layer believes about virtual memory: it is a feature the operating system turns on during boot, and once on, programs can use any address the OS has allocated for them. The OS manages page tables in software; the CPU consults them when needed. Virtual memory feels like a software abstraction layered onto hardware.</p>\n<p>This belief is correct about the steady state. It is catastrophically wrong about the transition.</p>\n<p>When you write <code>CR0.PG = 1</code> to enable paging, the change is instantaneous and irrevocable — there is no &quot;paging enabled for the next instruction&quot; mode. The <em>current</em> instruction has already been fetched; the <em>next</em> instruction fetch immediately goes through the new page table lookup. If the physical address of that next instruction is not mapped in your page tables, the CPU raises a page fault (exception 14). But your page fault handler is code. Which means the CPU tries to look up the page fault handler&#39;s address through the page tables. Which is also not mapped. Which raises another page fault. Double fault. Triple fault. Reboot. No error message.</p>\n<p>There is no way to print a diagnostic before this happens, because your print function is also code that lives at unmapped addresses.</p>\n<p>The solution is to map the physical addresses where your code currently lives <em>before</em> setting <code>CR0.PG</code>. You must build a set of page tables that describe the current physical layout of memory, enable paging while that layout is valid, and <em>then</em> remap things as needed. This technique is called <strong>identity mapping</strong> — virtual address equals physical address for the bootstrapping region. The moment paging activates, the CPU finds your code at its expected address because you told it to.</p>\n<p>The second revelation arrives when you later modify a page table entry. The CPU has a cache of recent address translations called the <strong>TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)</strong>. If you modify a PTE and do not flush the TLB, the CPU keeps serving the old translation from cache — potentially letting code access a physical frame you just freed and reassigned to a different purpose. This is not a theoretical bug. On a single core, it causes silent memory corruption that surfaces far from the modification. On a multi-core system — not covered in this milestone but described in the cascade below — it requires inter-processor interrupts to flush remote TLBs, because each core has its own private TLB. The physics of caching creates distributed consistency problems at the scale of a single chip.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-paging-enable-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Paging Enablement: The Identity-Map Bootstrap Problem\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-1-the-physical-address-space-what-ram-actually-looks-like\">Section 1: The Physical Address Space — What RAM Actually Looks Like</h2>\n<p>Before you can manage memory, you need to know what memory exists.

They could not express non-contiguous regions, holes for ACPI tables, or memory-mapped device regions. E820 was introduced to replace all of them. It is still used by modern UEFI firmware in legacy compatibility mode, and GRUB passes the E820 data to the kernel via the <strong>multiboot information structure</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each E820 entry is a 20-byte structure:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint64_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> base;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Physical base address of region */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint64_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> length;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* Length in bytes */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> type;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Region type */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">} </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">__attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((packed)) </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">e820_entry_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Type values */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> E820_USABLE</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">     1</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* Free RAM — your allocator can use this */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> E820_RESERVED</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">   2</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* BIOS-reserved; do not touch */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> E820_ACPI_DATA</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">  3</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* ACPI tables; can reclaim after reading */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> E820_ACPI_NVS</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">   4</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* ACPI Non-Volatile Storage; never reclaim */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> E820_BAD</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">        5</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  /* Known bad RAM */</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If you are using <strong>GRUB</strong> (the most common approach for learning kernels), GRUB performs the E820 query for you and passes the memory map via the <strong>multiboot information structure</strong>.

parsed, you need a data structure to track which physical 4KB frames are free and which are in use. The two main choices are a <strong>bitmap</strong> (one bit per frame, 0=free, 1=used) and a <strong>free list</strong> (linked list of free frame descriptors). Let us examine both to understand why bitmaps are the right default for a learning kernel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-buddy-vs-bitmap-comparison.svg\" alt=\"Physical Allocator Comparison: Bitmap vs Buddy System\"></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Bitmap</th>\n<th>Free List</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory overhead for 4GB RAM</td>\n<td>128 KB (1 bit × 1M frames)</td>\n<td>4–8 MB (pointer per free frame)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Allocate single frame</td>\n<td>O(n) scan, O(1) amortized with hint</td>\n<td>O(1) pop from head</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Free a frame</td>\n<td>O(1) clear bit</td>\n<td>O(1) push to head</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache behavior</td>\n<td>64-byte cache line covers 512 frames</td>\n<td>Pointer-chasing: each access is potentially a cache miss</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Detect double-free</td>\n<td>O(1) check if bit already 0</td>\n<td>Requires O(n) scan or set membership check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contiguous multi-frame allocation</td>\n<td>O(n) scan for consecutive 0-bits</td>\n<td>Buddy allocator variant required</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For a kernel that allocates frames one at a time (for page tables and backing memory), the bitmap&#39;s cache behavior advantage is decisive. The bitmap for 4GB of RAM at 4KB frames is <code>4GB / 4KB / 8 bits = 128KB</code>. At L2 cache size of 256KB–1MB, the entire bitmap fits in cache after the first scan. Subsequent allocations that land near the previous allocation hit the same cache line — 512 frames represented in one 64-byte cache line. Free lists, by contrast, follow pointers to arbitrary physical addresses, generating a cache miss per allocation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-bitmap-allocator-layout.svg\" alt=\"Physical Frame Allocator: Bitmap Data Structure\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Buddy allocator:</strong> jemalloc, mimalloc, and the Linux kernel use a <strong>buddy allocator</strong> for physical frame management — a hierarchical structure where memory is divided into power-of-two-sized blocks, and adjacent (&quot;buddy&quot;) free blocks are merged on deallocation. Buddy allocators eliminate external fragmentation for large allocations, support contiguous multi-frame allocation efficiently, and have O(log n) alloc/free. They are more complex to implement correctly. For this milestone, the bitmap allocator is the right choice — simple, cache-friendly, and sufficient for single-frame allocation. The cascade section connects this back to jemalloc&#39;s design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"bitmap-allocator-implementation\">Bitmap Allocator Implementation</h3>\n<div

0. After the first 100 frames are allocated, each call wastes time re-scanning the occupied bitmap words. The hint records the approximate position of the last successful allocation. Since allocations tend to be sequential (kernel heap grows from low to high), the hint usually lands on or near a free frame. This is a <strong>next-fit</strong> allocation policy — as opposed to <strong>first-fit</strong> (always scan from 0) or <strong>best-fit</strong> (find the smallest free block that fits). For single-frame allocation, next-fit is both faster and more cache-friendly: subsequent allocations modify the same or adjacent bitmap words, staying in the same cache line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> The bitmap scan is essentially a sequential memory read — exactly the pattern CPUs prefetch most aggressively. The outer loop reads <code>frame_bitmap[w]</code> sequentially; the hardware prefetcher detects this stride and loads upcoming cache lines before you need them. A 64-byte cache line contains 512 bits, representing 512 frames = 2MB of physical memory. Scanning 4GB worth of frames reads <code>1M frames / 512 frames per cache line = 2048</code> cache lines = 128KB, fitting entirely in a 256KB L2 cache after the first pass. Contrast with a free list: each <code>next</code> pointer points to an arbitrary physical address, producing a random access pattern with one L2 or L3 cache miss per allocation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-x86-two-level-page-tables-the-hardware-that-makes-virtual-memory-work\">Section 3: x86 Two-Level Page Tables — The Hardware That Makes Virtual Memory Work</h2>\n<p>With physical frames available for allocation, the next task is building the structures that let the CPU translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.

The page directory is a 4KB array of 1024 32-bit <strong>Page Directory Entries (PDEs)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Index the Page Directory</strong>: Use bits [31:22] of the virtual address (the directory index, 0–1023) to select a PDE from the page directory. The PDE contains the physical address of a <strong>Page Table (PT)</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Index the Page Table</strong>: The page table is another 4KB array of 1024 32-bit <strong>Page Table Entries (PTEs)</strong>. Use bits [21:12] of the virtual address (the table index, 0–1023) to select a PTE. The PTE contains the physical address of the <strong>4KB page frame</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Add the Offset</strong>: Combine the physical frame address from the PTE with bits [11:0] of the virtual address (the byte offset within the page, 0–4095) to get the final physical address.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This entire four-memory-access sequence (CR3 → PDE → PTE → data) happens transparently on every memory access. The <strong>TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)</strong> caches recently used <code>(virtual page → physical frame)</code> translations so the CPU does not repeat all four steps for every access. A TLB hit costs 1 cycle; a TLB miss triggers the full walk, costing 20–50 cycles plus the memory access latencies for PDE and PTE reads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-pde-and-pte-entry-format\">The PDE and PTE Entry Format</h3>\n<p>Both PDEs and PTEs are 32-bit values with the same flag layout:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Page Directory Entry / Page Table Entry (32 bits):\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐\n│         Physical Frame Address [31:12]     │  Flags [11:0]    │\n│              (20 bits)                     │                  │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘\n\nFlags (bits [11:0]):\nBit 0  (P)   = Present: 1 = entry is valid; 0 = triggers page fault\nBit 1  (R/W) = Read/Write: 0 = read-only; 1 = read-write\nBit 2  (U/S) = User/Supervisor: 0 = kernel only (ring 0); 1 = user accessible (rings 0–3)\nBit 3  (PWT) = Page Write-Through: controls cache write policy\nBit 4  (PCD) = Page Cache Disable: 1 = uncacheable (use for MMIO)\nBit 5  (A)   = Accessed: CPU sets this bit on first access to the page\nBit 6  (D)   = Dirty (PTE only): CPU sets this bit on first write to the page\nBit 7  (PS)  = Page Size (PDE only): 1 = 4MB page (PSE extension); 0 = 4KB subtable\nBit 8  (G)   = Global: TLB entry not flushed on CR3 reload (requires CR4.PGE)</code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The physical address field</strong>: Bits [31:12] give the physical frame address for a 4KB page. Since pages are 4KB-aligned, the low 12 bits of the frame address are always zero — those bits are repurposed as flags. The hardware extracts the frame address by masking bits [31:12] (zeroing the low 12 bits) and the offset is added separately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most critical flags for your kernel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>P (Present)</strong>: Must be 1 for any mapping that should work. Setting P=0 effectively unmaps the page — the next access causes a page fault (exception 14). This is how demand paging and guard pages work.</li>\n<li><strong>R/W (Read/Write)</strong>: Set to 1 for writable pages (kernel data, stacks, heap). Set to 0 for code pages and read-only data — an attempt to write triggers a page fault with an error code indicating a write violation.</li>\n<li><strong>U/S (User/Supervisor)</strong>: The primary isolation mechanism between user and kernel mode. Kernel pages have U/S=0 — user-mode code that accesses them triggers a page fault. This is why a buffer overflow in a user process cannot read kernel memory. The page fault error code tells you which violation occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span

Higher-Half</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-higher-half-kernel-map.svg\" alt=\"Higher-Half Kernel: Boot Physical vs Runtime Virtual\"></p>\n<p>Your kernel needs two simultaneous mappings during the bootstrapping phase:</p>\n<p><strong>Identity mapping</strong> (virtual = physical) for the low memory region your code is currently executing from. Without this, enabling paging causes the immediate page fault described in the revelation. The identity map must cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The kernel code and data (loaded at physical <code>0x100000</code>)</li>\n<li>The VGA buffer (physical <code>0xB8000</code>) — also reachable via identity map of the first 4MB</li>\n<li>Any page directory/table structures you are about to build (they live in physical memory too)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Higher-half mapping</strong> (virtual <code>0xC0000000</code> = physical <code>0x100000</code>) for the kernel&#39;s intended virtual address home. After paging is on and you have jumped to the higher-half virtual address, you will unmap the identity mapping — user processes should not be able to &quot;accidentally&quot; use low virtual addresses to access kernel code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why <code>0xC0000000</code> (3GB)?</strong> It is a convention, not a requirement. The classic 32-bit Linux split is 3GB/1GB: user processes get virtual addresses <code>0x00000000</code>–<code>0xBFFFFFFF</code> (3GB), and the kernel occupies <code>0xC0000000</code>–<code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> (1GB). This means every user process&#39;s page directory has the upper 256 kernel entries (directory indices 768–1023) pre-populated with kernel page tables that are shared across all processes. Any other split is valid — Windows 2000 used 2GB/2GB; some embedded Linux configurations use 1GB/3GB for processes that need more than 3GB of virtual address space. The key constraint on 32-bit: user + kernel virtual ranges must fit in 4GB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"page-table-construction-before-paging-is-on\">Page Table Construction — Before Paging Is On</h3>\n<p>The page tables must be built and populated while paging is still off (using physical addresses directly). After paging enables, you must access page tables through their virtual addresses (if you moved them to higher-half virtual space) or through the identity-mapped physical addresses.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* vmm.c — Virtual Memory Manager */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"vmm.h\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"pmm.h\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"kprintf.h\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> &#x3C;string.h></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* The boot page directory — aligned to 4KB boundary */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">__attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">aligned</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(PAGE_SIZE)))</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> pde_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> boot_page_directory</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1024</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">];</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* A static page table for identity-mapping the first 4MB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   (covers kernel at 0x100000, VGA at 0xB8000, all low memory) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">__attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">aligned</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(PAGE_SIZE)))</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> pte_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> identity_page_table</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1024</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">];</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Maps virtual 0x0–0x3FFFFF */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* A static page table for the higher-half kernel (virtual 0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">__attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">aligned</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(PAGE_SIZE)))</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> pte_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> kernel_page_table</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1024</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">];</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">     /* Maps virtual 0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF */</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))</code></strong>: Page directory and page table structures must start at a 4KB-aligned address.

The page fault handler would then try to execute, also through an invalid table. CR3 must contain a valid page directory&#39;s physical address before you flip the paging bit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> Setting <code>CR0.PG</code> invalidates the entire TLB automatically — the CPU assumes that switching from no-paging to paging mode means all previous (implicit identity) translations are invalid. This is the one TLB flush you get for free. After this point, every CR3 modification (switching page directories for different processes) also flushes the TLB — except for entries marked <code>PAGE_GLOBAL</code>, which survive CR3 reloads. Kernel pages marked global are thus TLB-persistent across process switches, eliminating the cost of re-walking kernel page tables on every context switch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-jump-to-higher-half-virtual-space\">The Jump to Higher-Half Virtual Space</h3>\n<p>After enabling paging, your code is still executing at low virtual addresses (via the identity map).

Higher-half mapping is the production approach (it prevents user processes from occupying the same virtual address range as the kernel), and the acceptance criteria require demonstrating both mappings. The critical property is that both exist simultaneously in the page directory, with the identity map removable once you have verified higher-half execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-tlb-management-the-stale-translation-problem\">Section 6: TLB Management — The Stale Translation Problem</h2>\n<p>The TLB is a small, fully-associative cache (typically 32–64 entries for the L1 DTLB, a few hundred for L2 TLB) that stores recently used <code>(virtual page, ASID) → physical frame</code> translations. Without the TLB, every memory access would require three additional memory reads (CR3 → PDE → PTE → data). The TLB reduces this to zero additional reads on a hit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-tlb-shootdown-model.svg\" alt=\"diag-m3-tlb-shootdown-model\"></p>\n<p>The TLB is not coherent with your page table modifications.

This is used for kernel pages that are mapped identically in every process&#39;s page directory — you do not want to flush and re-walk kernel page tables on every process switch. The identity-mapped kernel pages and higher-half kernel pages should be global.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rule for your kernel: <strong>every time you modify a PTE or PDE, call <code>tlb_flush_page()</code> for that virtual address</strong> (or <code>tlb_flush_all()</code> if you modified many entries).

*)(PDE_FRAME(*pde))</code> accesses the page table using its <em>physical</em> address as if it were a virtual address. This works only because the identity map is active — physical address <code>X</code> is also accessible at virtual address <code>X</code>. Once you remove the identity map (after higher-half transition), you cannot access page tables this way. Production kernels solve this with the <strong>recursive page directory</strong> technique: one PDE points back to the page directory itself, making all page tables accessible at fixed virtual addresses. Alternatively, map all page tables into a dedicated kernel virtual address range. Both techniques are valuable to know; for this milestone, keeping the identity map active simplifies page table management considerably.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-9-the-kernel-heap-kmalloc-and-kfree\">Section 9: The Kernel Heap — kmalloc and kfree</h2>\n<p>The physical frame allocator gives you 4KB chunks. The page table manager maps them into virtual address space. But kernel code constantly needs variable-sized allocations: a 24-byte PCB (Process Control Block), a 36-byte interrupt descriptor, a 512-byte keyboard buffer. Allocating an entire 4KB frame for each of these wastes approximately 99% of the frame. You need a <strong>heap allocator</strong> — a subsystem that manages a region of virtual address space and provides variable-size allocation within it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m3-kmalloc-heap-layout.svg\" alt=\"Kernel Heap: kmalloc Virtual Address Space Layout\"></p>\n<p>The kernel heap allocator (<code>kmalloc</code>/<code>kfree</code>) works in two layers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Virtual address space management</strong>: A dedicated virtual address range (say, <code>0xD0000000</code>–<code>0xDFFFFFFF</code> — 256MB) is reserved for the heap. The heap grows upward from <code>0xD0000000</code> as memory is needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical frame backing</strong>: As the heap grows, new 4KB frames are allocated from <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> and mapped into the virtual heap region via <code>vmm_map_page()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A minimal first-fit heap allocator sufficient for this milestone:</p>\n<div

<code>heap_block_t</code> header overhead. On a 32-bit system: <code>magic</code>(4) + <code>size</code>(4) + <code>free</code>(1) + padding(3) + <code>next</code>(4) + <code>prev</code>(4) = 20 bytes header per allocation. A 4-byte integer allocation thus uses 24 bytes — 600% overhead. This is the same trade-off glibc&#39;s malloc makes, though glibc uses a 16-byte header and encodes the <code>free</code> flag in the low bits of <code>size</code> (exploiting alignment guarantees). The overhead is acceptable for kernel allocations; for user-mode workloads with millions of small allocations, jemalloc&#39;s size-class slabs eliminate per-object headers entirely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> The heap allocator&#39;s <code>first-fit</code> search walks a linked list of block headers. Each header is at an unpredictable address (wherever the previous allocation ended). This is a <strong>pointer-chasing</strong> access pattern — the address of <code>block-&gt;next</code> is read, then used to fetch the next block header, which is at an arbitrary address not adjacent to the current one. Every block access is likely an L1 or L2 cache miss if the heap has cooled. This is why production allocators (jemalloc, tcmalloc) organize objects into <strong>size-class slabs</strong>: all 32-byte objects live in contiguous 4KB slabs, so scanning free slots within a slab is sequential (cache-friendly). The linked-list header approach trades simplicity for cache performance. For a kernel with hundreds of allocations rather than millions, it is the right trade-off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-10-the-complete-memory-subsystem-initialization\">Section 10: The Complete Memory Subsystem Initialization</h2>\n<p>Bringing all three components together in <code>kmain()</code>, inserted after Milestone 2&#39;s interrupt setup and before any dynamic memory use:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* kmain.c */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> kmain</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">multiboot_info_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\">mbi</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Milestone 1 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    serial_init</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    vga_clear</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    kprintf</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"=== Kernel booting ===</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">\\n</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Milestone 2 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    idt_setup_all</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    pic_remap</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">20</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">28</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    pit_init</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">100</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    keyboard_init</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    __asm__</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> volatile</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">sti</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Milestone 3: Memory management */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Step A: Parse physical memory map from bootloader */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    pmm_parse_memory_map</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(mbi);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Prints memory regions;

The ordering is load-bearing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-11-the-three-level-view-what-quotaccess-virtual-addressquot-truly-means\">Section 11: The Three-Level View — What &quot;Access Virtual Address&quot; Truly Means</h2>\n<p>Tracing a single memory read instruction through the complete stack, from C source to physics:</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1 — The Application:</strong>\nYour kernel code writes <code>int x = *ptr;</code> where <code>ptr</code> is a virtual address <code>0xD0001234</code> (somewhere in the kernel heap). The C compiler emits a <code>mov eax, [0xD0001234]</code> instruction (or equivalent with a register holding the address).</p>\n<p><strong>Level 2 — The MMU and Page Table Walk:</strong>\nThe CPU&#39;s MMU intercepts the memory access. It extracts the directory index: <code>0xD0001234 &gt;&gt; 22 = 0x340 = 832</code>. It reads <code>page_directory[832]</code> from the physical address held in CR3 — this is a memory read from the page directory frame. If TLB hits: done in 1 cycle. If TLB miss: the MMU reads the PDE, extracts the page table&#39;s physical address, reads <code>page_table[(0xD0001234 &gt;&gt; 12) &amp; 0x3FF]</code> from that frame, extracts the physical frame address, adds the offset <code>0x234</code>, and loads from that final physical address. Result: 3 memory reads for the translation + 1 for the actual data = 4 total. The successful translation is cached in the TLB for subsequent accesses to the same page.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3 — Cache Hierarchy and DRAM:</strong>\nThe PDE read hits L2 cache (the page directory is hot from recent allocations). The PTE read may be an L3 hit or a DRAM access — 10ns or 60ns respectively. The data read at <code>0xD0001234</code> (physical <code>0x00201234</code> after translation, say) is likely in L1 or L2 if recently accessed. The total cost for a TLB-miss access to cold data: <del>200 cycles (TLB miss table walk + L3 misses). A TLB-hit access to L1-cached data: 4–5 cycles. The 50× difference is why TLB working set matters: if your kernel touches more unique pages than the TLB can hold (</del>64 pages for L1 DTLB), you pay the full 200-cycle penalty on every access, no matter how aggressively the CPU prefetches.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> The TLB on modern x86 CPUs is split into separate L1 instruction TLB (iTLB) and L1 data TLB (dTLB), each typically 32–64 entries. An L2 TLB (stlb — shared translation cache) holds 512–4096 entries. For a kernel with a few dozen active pages (page tables, heap blocks, stack), the working set fits in L1 TLB and the translation overhead is effectively zero. For a process with many active virtual memory areas (a large application with hundreds of mapped regions), stlb pressure causes measurable throughput degradation — this is why Linux&#39;s <strong>huge pages</strong> (2MB pages using PSE extension) dramatically improve performance for large working sets: 2MB pages occupy only 1 TLB entry instead of 512, reducing stlb pressure by 512×.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"pitfalls-reference-the-five-reasons-this-milestone-kills-your-kernel\">Pitfalls Reference — The Five Reasons This Milestone Kills Your Kernel</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pitfall</th>\n<th>Why It Kills You</th>\n<th>Prevention</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Enabling paging without identity map</td>\n<td>CPU fetches next instruction via page tables; unmapped → immediate page fault → triple fault</td>\n<td>Build identity map covering executing code <em>before</em> CR0.PG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forgetting TLB flush after PTE modification</td>\n<td>Old translation served from TLB; write goes to wrong physical frame; read returns stale data</td>\n<td><code>invlpg</code> after every PTE change; CR3 reload after bulk changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PMM marks kernel frames as free</td>\n<td>Allocator hands out frames occupied by kernel code; next write corrupts executing instructions</td>\n<td>Mark frames from <code>__kernel_start_phys</code> to <code>__kernel_end_phys</code> as used during <code>pmm_init</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Page table frames not marked used in PMM</td>\n<td>Page allocator reuses frames holding your page tables; MMU reads garbage; instant fault</td>\n<td>After building boot page tables, mark their physical frames as used in the bitmap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CR2 not read immediately in page fault handler</td>\n<td>CR2 is overwritten if another page fault fires (e.g., kprintf causes a fault while printing the first fault)</td>\n<td>Save CR2 to a local variable as the very first line of the page fault handler</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"knowledge-cascade-what-this-milestone-unlocks\">Knowledge Cascade — What This Milestone Unlocks</h2>\n<p>You have built the abstraction layer that every system above it depends on. The connections extend in every direction.</p>\n<p><strong>1. TLB shootdowns in SMP — the distributed cache invalidation problem</strong></p>\n<p>Your single-core kernel flushes one TLB with <code>invlpg</code> or a CR3 reload. On a multi-core machine, each core has its own private TLB — a CPU with 8 cores has 8 separate TLB arrays, each caching independent translation snapshots. When core 0 modifies a PTE (say, freeing a page and reassigning its physical frame), cores 1–7 still have the old translation cached. If core 1 accesses that virtual address before its TLB is flushed, it reads from the physical frame that now belongs to a <em>different</em> process — a catastrophic security violation.</p>\n<p>The solution is <strong>TLB shootdown</strong>: core 0 sends an <strong>IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt — a hardware mechanism for one CPU core to interrupt another)</strong> to all other cores, triggering an interrupt handler that each core runs to flush its own TLB for the modified address. Linux&#39;s <code>flush_tlb_others()</code> function does exactly this, using the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) to broadcast IPIs. The cost: a single <code>invlpg</code> on a 16-core machine requires 15 IPIs, each costing ~500 cycles to deliver and process. TLB shootdowns are a significant bottleneck in memory-intensive workloads on many-core systems. This is the hardware analog of distributed cache invalidation — the same problem that makes cache coherence in distributed databases so expensive. Your single-core <code>invlpg</code> is the prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Demand paging — the page fault handler as a lazy evaluator</strong></p>\n<p>Your current page fault handler prints a diagnostic and halts. That is only one possible response. When the kernel knows that a page fault at a given address is <em>expected</em> — because the page has been allocated virtually but not yet backed by a physical frame — the correct response is to allocate a frame, map it, and return from the fault handler. The CPU will retry the faulting instruction, which now succeeds.</p>\n<p>This is <strong>demand paging</strong>: physical frames are allocated only when a page is first accessed, not when it is first mapped. <code>malloc(1000000000)</code> in Linux returns immediately — Linux maps 1GB of virtual address space but allocates zero physical frames. The first write to any page triggers a fault, the kernel allocates a frame (zeroed, via the zero page copy-on-write mechanism from Milestone 1&#39;s cascade), maps it, and returns. Only the pages you actually touch cost physical memory. Your <code>CR2 → PTE lookup → allocate frame → vmm_map_page → return</code> sequence is the complete implementation. <strong>Memory-mapped files</strong> (Linux <code>mmap(fd, ...)</code>) use the same path: the page fault handler checks if the faulting address corresponds to a file-backed region, reads the page from disk into a fresh frame, maps it, and returns. Every <code>mmap</code> in Linux ultimately runs through a path structurally identical to your page fault handler. <strong>Guard pages</strong> (the unmapped page at the end of every thread&#39;s stack, which causes a segfault on stack overflow rather than silent corruption) are simply pages with a not-present PTE — P=0.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The bitmap allocator&#39;s cache behavior — tracing a lineage to jemalloc</strong></p>\n<p>Your 128KB bitmap has a critical property: scanning it for a free frame is a sequential read. A CPU hardware prefetcher detects sequential access patterns and loads cache lines before the CPU requests them. The result: after the first scan warms the cache, subsequent allocations read from L2 or L3 cache at ~10ns per cache line rather than ~60ns DRAM. This cache-friendliness is the bitmap&#39;s decisive advantage over a free list of physical frames.</p>\n<p>The same trade-off governs user-space allocator design. <strong>jemalloc</strong> (used by Firefox, FreeBSD&#39;s libc, and Rust&#39;s global allocator) uses <strong>size-class arenas</strong>: all objects of size 8, 16, 32, 64, ... 512 bytes each live in separate <strong>slabs</strong> (contiguous 4KB–2MB pages). Allocating a 32-byte object means scanning a slab&#39;s free-slot bitmap — sequential, cache-friendly, same as your frame bitmap. <strong>tcmalloc</strong> (Google&#39;s allocator, used in Chrome and many internal services) adds per-thread caches of pre-allocated objects to eliminate lock contention entirely. <strong>Linux&#39;s SLUB allocator</strong> (the kernel&#39;s own object allocator, above the frame allocator) partitions kernel objects by type into per-CPU caches — <code>kmem_cache_alloc(task_struct_cache)</code> is a single list pop, costing ~5ns. Your kmalloc&#39;s linked-list first-fit scan is the conceptually simplest version of a problem that has driven 40 years of allocator research.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Higher-half kernel mapping as the conceptual origin of KASLR</strong></p>\n<p>Mapping the kernel at virtual <code>0xC0000000</code> while it loads at physical <code>0x100000</code> establishes a clean separation: kernel virtual addresses and physical addresses are different numbers, connected only by the page table. This separation is the foundation of <strong>KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization)</strong> — instead of always mapping the kernel at <code>0xC0000000</code>, the kernel adds a random offset at boot time (say, <code>0xC0000000 + 0x3A00000</code>) and builds page tables reflecting that random offset. An attacker who wants to exploit a kernel vulnerability needs to know where kernel code and data live in virtual memory. KASLR defeats this by making the layout unpredictable. On Linux, the randomized kernel virtual base is printed in <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> but requires root to read — because knowing the address breaks KASLR. You now understand exactly what that file contains and why it is gated. <strong>SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Protection)</strong> and <strong>SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Protection)</strong> are hardware extensions to the page table flag model you just implemented: SMEP prevents the kernel from executing code at user-mode virtual addresses (U/S=1 pages), preventing jump-to-userspace ROP attacks; SMAP prevents the kernel from reading user-mode memory without explicitly setting the AC flag.</p>\n<p><strong>5. kmalloc as the kernel&#39;s malloc — why glibc, jemalloc, and SLUB all exist</strong></p>\n<p>You just implemented a first-fit heap with block headers. glibc&#39;s malloc is structurally similar for the general case: a doubly-linked list of free chunks, with headers encoding size and free status, and first-fit or best-fit search. But glibc adds: bins for common sizes (avoiding scan for 8, 16, 32, 64-byte allocations), <strong>mmap</strong> for large allocations (bypassing the heap entirely for allocations above 128KB, returning them directly to the OS on free), and thread arenas (per-thread heaps to avoid lock contention). The fundamental insight your kernel teaches: <strong>heap allocation is fundamentally a virtual address space management problem backed by page-granular physical memory</strong>. <code>sbrk()</code> (the traditional Unix heap expansion syscall) does what your <code>heap_expand()</code> does — asks the OS to map one more page at the end of the heap virtual range. Linux <code>mmap(MAP_ANONYMOUS)</code> does the same but for arbitrary-address allocations. Every user-space allocator is building a variable-size allocation service on top of page-granular OS primitives — exactly what you just built for the kernel.</p>\n<hr>\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m4 -->\n<h1 id=\"milestone-4-processes-and-preemptive-scheduling\">Milestone 4: Processes and Preemptive Scheduling</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-revelation-two-lies-you-believe-about-context-switching\">The Revelation: Two Lies You Believe About Context Switching</h2>\n<p>Here is what every developer who has used threads, goroutines, or async/await believes about context switching: it is a high-level software operation, roughly like <code>setjmp</code>/<code>longjmp</code> — save some state into a struct, restore it later, resume.

You call a syscall, the CPU &quot;just knows&quot; to switch to kernel mode, and the kernel runs on some preexisting kernel stack.</p>\n<p>Both beliefs are wrong in ways that will corrupt your kernel silently before crashing it spectacularly.</p>\n<p><strong>The first lie — context switching is like setjmp:</strong> A context switch must save every register the CPU has, including <code>EFLAGS</code> (the flags register containing the carry flag, zero flag, interrupt flag, and a dozen others), using assembly. Not C. If you write the context switch in C, the C compiler saves and restores the registers it uses — but the CPU still has values in registers the compiler did not touch. When the interrupted process resumes, those registers contain whatever the scheduler left in them. The bug manifests not in the scheduler but in the interrupted process, when it uses a register it believes it saved but was actually clobbered. The failure happens tens of thousands of instructions after the switch. There is no immediate error. This class of bug has driven systems programmers mad for decades.</p>\n<p><strong>The second lie — ring transitions are automatic:</strong> The CPU does know how to transition from ring 3 to ring 0 when an interrupt fires. What it does not know, without explicit configuration, is <em>which kernel stack to use</em>. The CPU hardware reads this from a data structure called the <strong>TSS (Task State Segment — a hardware-defined memory region that the CPU reads directly on privilege transitions)</strong>, specifically from a field called <code>ESP0</code> (the ring 0 stack pointer). If you have three processes and TSS.ESP0 still points to the kernel stack of process 1 when process 2 is running, then every interrupt that fires while process 2 is executing pushes the interrupt frame onto process 1&#39;s kernel stack. The kernel handler executes, modifying process 1&#39;s stack. Process 1 later resumes from its corrupted stack. The failure is distant, silent, and maddening.</p>\n<p>The fix for both problems is the same principle: <strong>the CPU is not a cooperative abstraction layer. It is hardware that executes exactly what you configure, nothing more.</strong> Configuring it correctly requires understanding what it does at the instruction level.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-privilege-ring-model.svg\" alt=\"diag-m4-privilege-ring-model\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-1-the-process-control-block-one-structure-to-name-them-all\">Section 1: The Process Control Block — One Structure to Name Them All</h2>\n<p>Before you can switch between processes, you need a place to put a process&#39;s state when it is not running. This is the <strong>PCB (Process Control Block)</strong> — a kernel data structure that holds everything the CPU needs to restore a process to exactly the state it was in when preempted.</p>\n<p>{{DIAGRAM:diag-m4-pcb-structure}}</p>\n<p>The PCB is not a software abstraction — it is a hardware requirement with a software body. The CPU gives you nothing for free: no automatic state saving, no process table, no PID. You define the structure; you fill it in; you restore from it. The CPU only helps by executing your assembly code correctly.</p>\n<p>What must a PCB store? Start from the CPU&#39;s state when an interrupt fires and work backward:</p>\n<p><strong>CPU register state</strong> — everything the CPU had in its registers at the moment the timer IRQ fired. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All 8 general-purpose registers: <code>EAX</code>, <code>EBX</code>, <code>ECX</code>, <code>EDX</code>, <code>ESI</code>, <code>EDI</code>, <code>EBP</code>, <code>ESP</code></li>\n<li>The instruction pointer: <code>EIP</code> (where to resume execution)</li>\n<li>The flags register: <code>EFLAGS</code> (interrupt enable state, condition codes, I/O privilege level)</li>\n<li>Segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, <code>GS</code>, <code>SS</code> (critical for distinguishing ring 0 from ring 3 processes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Memory state</strong> — which address space this process lives in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The physical address of this process&#39;s page directory (<code>CR3</code> value)</li>\n<li>When the scheduler restores a process, loading its <code>CR3</code> value simultaneously switches the entire address space</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scheduling state</strong> — metadata the scheduler needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PID (Process IDentifier — a unique integer name for this process)</li>\n<li>Process state: <code>READY</code> (can run), <code>RUNNING</code> (currently executing), <code>BLOCKED</code> (waiting for I/O or event)</li>\n<li>Kernel stack pointer (the kernel stack is per-process; TSS.ESP0 must point here)</li>\n<li>Optionally: priority, time slice remaining, accumulated CPU time</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* process.h */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#ifndef</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PROCESS_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> PROCESS_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> &#x3C;stdint.h></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"page.h\"</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* pde_t, PAGE_SIZE */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> MAX_PROCESSES</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">    16</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> KERNEL_STACK_SIZE</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 4096</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* 4KB per-process kernel stack */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Process states */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> enum</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PROCESS_UNUSED  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Slot in process table is empty */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PROCESS_READY   </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Can be scheduled; not currently running */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PROCESS_RUNNING </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 2</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Currently executing on CPU */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PROCESS_BLOCKED </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 3</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Waiting for an event (I/O, sleep, etc.) */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PROCESS_ZOMBIE  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 4</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">,</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Finished execution; waiting for parent to collect exit code */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">} </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">process_state_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Saved CPU register state — must match the layout that context_switch.asm</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   pushes and pops.

<code>cpu_state_t</code> is 52 bytes (13 fields × 4 bytes). The kernel stack is 4096 bytes. Total PCB size ≈ 4 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 52 + 4 + 4096 + 4 = ~4200 bytes per process. For 16 processes: ~67KB of kernel BSS. This fits in the 128KB kernel region with room to spare. The <code>__attribute__((aligned(16)))</code> on the kernel stack ensures the stack pointer is 16-byte aligned from the start, satisfying the System V ABI&#39;s calling convention requirement — if your kernel calls any function that uses SSE instructions, an unaligned stack causes a General Protection Fault.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why <code>kernel_stack_top</code> is stored in the PCB:</strong> The kernel stack grows downward. <code>kernel_stack[0]</code> is the lowest address; <code>kernel_stack[KERNEL_STACK_SIZE - 1]</code> is the highest. A stack that starts &quot;at the top&quot; begins at <code>kernel_stack + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE</code> and grows toward <code>kernel_stack</code>. When you initialize a new process&#39;s kernel stack, you push the initial register values from <code>kernel_stack_top</code> downward. When TSS.ESP0 must be updated to point to this process&#39;s kernel stack, you use <code>kernel_stack_top</code> — not <code>kernel_stack</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-2-the-context-switch-assembly-is-not-optional\">Section 2: The Context Switch — Assembly Is Not Optional</h2>\n<p>This is the most conceptually important routine in the entire OS. Every developer who has implemented a context switch in C first, then spent two days debugging register corruption, eventually arrives at the same conclusion: the context switch must be written in assembly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-context-switch-assembly.svg\" alt=\"Context Switch: Register Save/Restore Assembly Flow\"></p>\n<p>Here is why C is insufficient. The C calling convention (for x86 System V ABI) specifies that <code>EAX</code>, <code>ECX</code>, and <code>EDX</code> are <strong>caller-saved</strong>: the calling function assumes the callee will trash them, so the caller saves them before the call if it needs them afterward. <code>EBX</code>, <code>ESI</code>, <code>EDI</code>, <code>EBP</code> are <strong>callee-saved</strong>: the callee must preserve them across the call.</p>\n<p>If you write <code>void context_switch(process_t *from, process_t *to)</code> in C, the compiler generates code that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Saves <code>EBX</code>, <code>ESI</code>, <code>EDI</code>, <code>EBP</code> on the stack (callee-saved convention)</li>\n<li>Does your switching logic</li>\n<li>Restores those four registers from the stack and executes <code>ret</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>What the compiler does <em>not</em> save: <code>EAX</code>, <code>ECX</code>, <code>EDX</code> (caller-saved — the caller is supposed to handle them), and critically, <strong>EFLAGS</strong> (the flags register that no C calling convention saves, because C code does not assume flag values persist across function calls).</p>\n<p>But the interrupted process&#39;s caller did not save <code>EAX</code>, <code>ECX</code>, <code>EDX</code> and <code>EFLAGS</code> — it was in the middle of executing arbitrary code when the timer IRQ fired. Those registers contain that process&#39;s live state. When a context switch written in C trashes <code>EAX</code> because it used <code>EAX</code> for intermediate calculations, and then restores the process later without <code>EAX</code>&#39;s original value, the resumed process runs with the wrong value in <code>EAX</code>. Depending on what it was computing, this is anywhere from harmless to fatal.</p>\n<p>The solution: the context switch takes place at the interrupt boundary, where the ISR stack frame is already laid out. You save <em>everything</em> in assembly before C code touches a single register, and restore <em>everything</em> in assembly after C code is done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-kernel-stack-per-process.svg\" alt=\"Per-Process Kernel Stack Layout During Context Switch\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-mechanical-design\">The Mechanical Design</h3>\n<p>The timer IRQ handler (from Milestone 2) already saves all general-purpose registers via <code>pusha</code> and the segment registers explicitly. At that point, the stack contains a complete snapshot of the interrupted process&#39;s CPU state. The context switch does not need to save anything — it just needs to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Record the current stack pointer in the current process&#39;s PCB (so we can find the saved state later)</li>\n<li>Call the C scheduler to select the next process</li>\n<li>Update TSS.ESP0 to the next process&#39;s kernel stack top</li>\n<li>If switching address spaces, load the new process&#39;s <code>CR3</code></li>\n<li>Load the new process&#39;s saved stack pointer</li>\n<li>Execute <code>iret</code> — which restores <code>EFLAGS</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>EIP</code> (and <code>SS</code>, <code>ESP</code> for ring 3) from the new process&#39;s saved state</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This design means the context switch is not a separate &quot;save all registers then restore all registers&quot; operation — it rides the back of the IRQ handler&#39;s existing save/restore infrastructure. The IRQ stub saves state on entry and restores state on exit. The context switch hijacks the &quot;exit&quot; phase: instead of restoring the current process&#39;s state, it pivots to the next process&#39;s saved state.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* sched.h */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#ifndef</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> SCHED_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> SCHED_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"process.h\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> sched_init</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> sched_tick</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Called from timer IRQ handler */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> sched_yield</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Called by kernel code to voluntarily yield */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Declared in context_switch.asm; never call directly */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">extern</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> context_switch_asm</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\">old_esp</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> new_esp</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> new_cr3</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#endif</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">nasm</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>; context_switch.asm\n; void context_switch_asm(uint32_t *old_esp, uint32_t new_esp, uint32_t new_cr3)\n;\n; Called FROM WITHIN the IRQ common stub, AFTER pusha and segment register saves.\n; The stack at this point contains the complete saved state of the current process.\n; Arguments on stack (cdecl): [esp+4]=old_esp ptr, [esp+8]=new_esp, [esp+12]=new_cr3\n\n[bits 32]\n[global context_switch_asm]\n\ncontext_switch_asm:\n    ; ── Save the current process's kernel stack pointer ──\n    ; After the cdecl call setup, esp points to our return address.\n    ; The caller's esp (which holds the saved process state) is at\n    ; the value esp had BEFORE the call pushed the return address.\n    ; cdecl: [esp+4]=old_esp_ptr, [esp+8]=new_esp, [esp+12]=new_cr3\n    mov eax, [esp + 4]    ; EAX = address of current process's saved_esp field\n    mov [eax], esp         ; *old_esp = current esp (kernel stack pointer position)\n                           ; This records where the saved state lives on the stack.\n\n    ; ── Switch to the next process's kernel stack ──\n    mov esp, [esp + 8]     ; Wait — after we load [esp+8], esp changes!\n                           ; BUG: we need to save [esp+8] before modifying esp.\n                           ; Fix: load arguments first.\n    ; (Correct implementation below — argument loading before esp change)\n\n    ; ── Load new CR3 if address space is different ──\n    mov ecx, [esp + 12]    ; ECX = new_cr3\n    ; ...

The IRQ stub already saved them with <code>pusha</code> before calling the C dispatcher, and will restore them with <code>popa</code> after <code>context_switch_asm</code> returns. By switching <code>esp</code> to the next process&#39;s kernel stack, we redirect the subsequent <code>popa</code> and <code>iret</code> to restore the <em>next</em> process&#39;s registers. The switch happens between the <code>call context_switch_asm</code> and the <code>ret</code> — one line of assembly changes which process&#39;s context <code>iret</code> will restore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> The <code>mov esp, ecx</code> (stack pointer swap) is the most performance-critical moment. After this instruction, every subsequent stack access — <code>ret</code> pops the return address, <code>popa</code> reads 32 bytes, <code>iret</code> reads 12–20 bytes — goes to the <em>next</em> process&#39;s kernel stack, which is in a different physical page. If that page is cold (not in L1 cache), the cache miss costs ~60ns (L3 hit) or ~100ns (DRAM). On a 100Hz scheduler at 10ms intervals, the stack is almost certainly cold — it has not been touched in 10 million nanoseconds. This cold-stack startup cost is unavoidable; it is one of the fundamental reasons context switching has nonzero overhead even when the assembly is perfect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-3-the-scheduler-round-robin-over-a-process-table\">Section 3: The Scheduler — Round-Robin Over a Process Table</h2>\n<p>With the context switch mechanism defined, the scheduler decides <em>which</em> process to switch to.

— 100 times per second. It decrements the slice counter and returns early (within ~10 cycles) if the slice has not expired. Separating the tick accounting from the scheduling decision keeps the common path (no context switch needed) extremely fast. <code>sched_schedule</code> is called only when a switch is warranted, and can also be called voluntarily by blocking code (<code>sched_yield()</code>) when a process needs to wait for I/O.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The timer handler in Milestone 2 now calls the scheduler:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* irq.c — updated timer handler */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> timer_handler</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">interrupt_frame_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\">frame</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)frame;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    pit_tick_count</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">++</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    sched_tick</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">();</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Potentially triggers a context switch */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interrupts during <code>sched_schedule</code>:</strong> The timer IRQ fires with interrupts disabled (interrupt gate, IF cleared). <code>sched_schedule</code> runs with interrupts off. After <code>context_switch_asm</code> switches to the new process and <code>iret</code> executes, <code>EFLAGS</code> is restored — including the <code>IF</code> bit. If the new process had interrupts enabled (which it should, since it was running normal code when preempted), <code>iret</code> re-enables interrupts atomically as part of restoring EFLAGS. This is the correct behavior — interrupts are masked for the minimum possible duration (only during the scheduler&#39;s critical section).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-4-the-tss-hardware-that-reads-your-configuration-on-every-ring-transition\">Section 4: The TSS — Hardware That Reads Your Configuration on Every Ring Transition</h2>\n<p>The <strong>TSS (Task State Segment)</strong> is a 104-byte Intel-defined data structure that the CPU reads directly from memory on every ring 3 to ring 0 privilege transition. It is not a software abstraction with a hardware analog — it is a hardware register with a memory backing that you must maintain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-tss-ring-transition.svg\" alt=\"TSS: Hardware Ring 3 to Ring 0 Transition Mechanics\"></p>\n<p>When any interrupt or exception fires while the CPU is executing ring 3 code, the CPU must switch to a kernel stack before it can push the interrupt frame. It cannot use the user-mode stack because user-mode code is untrusted — a process could set <code>ESP</code> to a kernel address and trick the interrupt handler into writing a kernel stack frame into kernel memory at an attacker-controlled address. The TSS is the hardware&#39;s solution: a trusted, kernel-maintained structure that specifies which stack to use.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why not just use a fixed kernel stack?</strong> If all processes shared one kernel stack, the following would occur: process A is interrupted mid-syscall, the handler pushes a frame onto the shared stack and saves A&#39;s kernel state there. Process B runs and triggers a syscall, pushing its frame onto the same stack — immediately overwriting A&#39;s saved state. You need one kernel stack per process. The TSS.ESP0 field tells the CPU which one to use for the currently running process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The full TSS structure is defined by Intel (it is used for hardware task switching in very old x86 code, but modern OSes use it exclusively for the ESP0 field):</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* tss.h */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#ifndef</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TSS_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#define</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TSS_H</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> &#x3C;stdint.h></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Intel TSS descriptor — hardware-defined layout, do not reorder */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> __attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((packed)) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> prev_task;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">     /* Previous TSS selector (for hardware task switching;

Loading <code>TR</code> with the TSS selector causes the CPU to read the GDT descriptor and cache it. After <code>ltr</code>, when any ring 3→0 transition occurs, the CPU uses the cached TSS descriptor to find <code>kernel_tss.esp0</code> — it does not walk the GDT again. This means <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> (which modifies the in-memory TSS) works correctly: the CPU re-reads <code>esp0</code> from memory on each transition, using the cached TSS <em>base address</em> from TR but fetching <code>esp0</code> fresh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> is a single 32-bit memory write — <code>mov [kernel_tss.esp0], new_value</code>. This write goes to a known, hot address in the kernel data section. It is almost certainly in L1 cache (the TSS is accessed frequently — on every ring transition). The CPU reads <code>esp0</code> from this address on the very next ring 3 interrupt. The write must complete before the CPU takes that interrupt, which is guaranteed because: (a) we are in ring 0 kernel code running with interrupts off during the scheduler, and (b) the memory write is not reordered past an <code>iret</code> instruction (a full memory barrier). No <code>sfence</code> or <code>mfence</code> is needed because x86 stores are ordered with respect to subsequent instruction execution on the same core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-5-creating-kernel-processes-stack-setup-and-initial-state\">Section 5: Creating Kernel Processes — Stack Setup and Initial State</h2>\n<p>To schedule a process, you need its PCB in a state where <code>context_switch_asm</code> can restore it. For the very first activation of a new process — before it has ever run — there is no &quot;saved state from a previous preemption.&quot; You must manufacture a fake saved state on the process&#39;s kernel stack that looks exactly like what the IRQ stub would have pushed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-kernel-stack-per-process.svg\" alt=\"Per-Process Kernel Stack Layout During Context Switch\"></p>\n<p>When the scheduler switches to a new process for the first time, <code>context_switch_asm</code> loads <code>next-&gt;cpu.esp</code>, then <code>ret</code> (popping the return address back to <code>irq_common_stub</code>), then the stub executes <code>popa</code> (restoring the fake registers), then <code>add esp, 8</code> (discarding the fake vector and error code), then <code>iret</code> (restoring <code>EFLAGS</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>EIP</code> from the fake values you pushed). The <code>iret</code> jumps to the process&#39;s entry function at ring 0.</p>\n<p>The fake initial stack must look exactly like an IRQ stack frame:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span

it needs to return to a location in <code>irq_common_stub</code> that resumes the exit sequence (pop segment registers, <code>popa</code>, <code>add esp, 8</code>, <code>iret</code>). For an existing process that was preempted mid-run, the <code>ret</code> address on the stack is the real return address pushed when <code>irq_common_stub</code> called <code>context_switch_asm</code>. For a brand-new process, we push a trampoline address that jumps to the equivalent point in the stub. In practice, this is the address immediately after the <code>call irq_dispatcher</code> instruction in <code>irq_common_stub</code> — the same point the real scheduler returns to. Alternatively, define a minimal trampoline in assembly that directly pops segment registers, calls <code>popa</code>, adds 8, and executes <code>iret</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><code>EFLAGS = 0x00000202</code>:</strong> The value <code>0x202</code> in EFLAGS means: bit 1 (always 1 per Intel spec), and bit 9 (Interrupt Flag = 1 — interrupts enabled). Every process must resume with IF=1. If you set EFLAGS to 0, the restored process runs with interrupts disabled — the timer never fires again, the scheduler never runs again, and the system freezes with exactly one process running at 100% CPU while the others wait forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-6-three-kernel-processes-the-preemptive-multitasking-demo\">Section 6: Three Kernel Processes — The Preemptive Multitasking Demo</h2>\n<p>With process creation and the scheduler wired together, you can demonstrate genuine preemptive multitasking: three processes running concurrently, each unaware of the others, each printing to a different region of the VGA screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-multiprocess-vga-demo.svg\" alt=\"Multi-Process VGA Demo: Memory-Mapped I/O Sharing\"></p>\n<p>The critical property: these processes do not cooperate. They do not call <code>yield()</code>. They do not check a shared flag. The timer IRQ interrupts them mid-execution — potentially mid-instruction-sequence, mid-loop, mid-function — and the scheduler switches to another process. From each process&#39;s perspective, it is the only thing running.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* Three kernel processes for the demo */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> void</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> proc_a_entry</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">void</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Process A: counts in the top-left corner */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> count </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    while</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">        /* Write directly to VGA at row 2, col 0 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">        volatile</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">vga </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">volatile</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">B8000</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">        char</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> buf</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">32</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">];</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">        ksnprintf</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(buf, </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">sizeof</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(buf), </span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Process A: </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">%u</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    \"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, count</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">++</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">        for</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">int</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> i </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;

When all other processes are blocked, the scheduler wraps around to process 0, which executes <code>hlt</code> in a loop. <code>hlt</code> stops the CPU from executing instructions until the next interrupt arrives, saving power (and improving QEMU&#39;s host CPU usage). This is structurally identical to Linux&#39;s idle tasks — one per CPU core, running when no other work exists. Linux&#39;s idle task also executes <code>hlt</code> (or, with hardware support, deeper C-states like <code>mwait</code> that drop into lower-power CPU sleep states).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-7-user-mode-processes-ring-3-isolation\">Section 7: User-Mode Processes — Ring 3 Isolation</h2>\n<p>Kernel processes run in ring 0 with full hardware access and the kernel&#39;s page directory. User-mode processes run in ring 3 with restricted hardware access and their own page directory. The kernel code and data are still mapped in the user process&#39;s page directory — but with the U/S flag cleared (kernel-only), so ring 3 code that tries to access kernel memory triggers a page fault.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-user-mode-page-directory.svg\" alt=\"User Process Memory Isolation: Per-Process Page Directories\"></p>\n<p>Creating a user-mode process requires four additional steps beyond <code>process_create_kernel</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Allocate a new page directory</strong> (from the physical frame allocator)</li>\n<li><strong>Copy the kernel page table entries</strong> into the new directory — so the kernel is reachable during system calls and interrupts (ring 3 → ring 0 transitions need kernel code and stack accessible)</li>\n<li><strong>Map the user process&#39;s code and stack pages</strong> with <code>U/S=1, R/W</code> as appropriate</li>\n<li><strong>Build an initial ring 3 stack frame</strong> that includes <code>user_esp</code> and <code>user_ss</code> — the two extra fields that <code>iret</code> pops when transitioning from ring 0 back to ring

User code selector <code>0x1B</code> = <code>(3 &lt;&lt; 3) | 3</code> = GDT index 3, RPL 3. User data selector <code>0x23</code> = <code>(4 &lt;&lt; 3) | 3</code> = GDT index 4, RPL 3. The RPL bits in the selector (bits [1:0]) must match DPL=3, or the CPU raises a GPF when loading them. This is the hardware enforcement that prevents user code from loading kernel segment selectors — the GDT descriptor for the kernel code segment has DPL=0, so loading <code>0x08</code> (RPL=0) from ring 3 causes an immediate GPF.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Verifying ring 3 isolation:</strong> The acceptance criteria require that user-mode access to kernel memory triggers a page fault. The test: in the user-mode process&#39;s code (which runs at virtual <code>0x00400000</code>), attempt to read from a kernel address such as <code>0xC0000000</code>. Since the kernel page tables have U/S=0, the MMU detects the privilege violation and raises a page fault (exception 14) with error code bits: P=1 (page present), W=0 (read), U=1 (user mode). Your page fault handler from Milestone 3 prints the diagnostic and halts. This is the hardware-enforced memory isolation that makes processes safe from each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-8-the-system-call-interface-int-0x80\">Section 8: The System Call Interface — INT 0x80</h2>\n<p>User-mode processes cannot directly call kernel functions — they run in ring 3, the kernel code runs in ring 0, and the CPU prevents cross-privilege direct calls. The interface between user and kernel is the <strong>system call</strong>: a controlled entry point into the kernel that the CPU will invoke from ring 3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-m4-syscall-int80-flow.svg\" alt=\"diag-m4-syscall-int80-flow\"></p>\n<p>The mechanism: <code>int 0x80</code> is a software interrupt. In the IDT, vector <code>0x80</code> is registered as a <strong>trap gate with DPL=3</strong> (the <code>IDT_SYSCALL_GATE = 0xEF</code> constant from Milestone 2). The DPL=3 allows ring 3 code to explicitly trigger this interrupt via <code>int 0x80</code> without a GPF. The trap gate type (not interrupt gate) means interrupts remain enabled during the syscall — other processes can be preempted while one is blocked in a syscall.</p>\n<p>When <code>int 0x80</code> fires from ring 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CPU checks DPL ≥ CPL: DPL=3 ≥ CPL=3 → permitted</li>\n<li>CPU switches to ring 0 using TSS.SS0 and TSS.ESP0 (the current process&#39;s kernel stack)</li>\n<li>CPU pushes <code>SS</code>, <code>ESP</code>, <code>EFLAGS</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>EIP</code> (the five-field ring-crossing frame)</li>\n<li>CPU jumps to the IDT handler for vector 0x80</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The convention (Linux historical ABI, which you should follow for familiarity):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>EAX</code> = syscall number</li>\n<li><code>EBX</code> = first argument</li>\n<li><code>ECX</code> = second argument</li>\n<li><code>EDX</code> = third argument</li>\n<li>Return value in <code>EAX</code></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span

syscall_dispatch:</strong> The <code>buf_vaddr &gt;= 0xC0000000</code> check is the simplest possible security check. It is insufficient for production — a user process could pass a valid-looking address that spans a gap, points to an unmapped page, or points to another user process&#39;s read-only segment. Linux&#39;s <code>copy_from_user()</code> uses a more robust approach: it temporarily enables SMAP (which would fault on kernel access to user memory), then uses assembly that catches page faults during the copy and returns an error code. The page fault handler has a registered &quot;fixup&quot; table for these known-safe fault sites. This milestone&#39;s range check is sufficient to demonstrate the security principle; the production path is architecturally more sophisticated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-9-the-three-level-view-what-a-timer-interrupt-really-does\">Section 9: The Three-Level View — What a Timer Interrupt Really Does</h2>\n<p>Tracing the full path of a single timer tick that results in a context switch — from hardware signal to resumed process:</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1 — What Your Processes Experience:</strong>\nProcess A is executing its busy-loop. Nothing in Process A&#39;s code indicates an interruption — no function call, no yield, no cooperative scheduling point. Mid-loop, the CPU pauses. Later (from A&#39;s perspective, instantaneously), A resumes at exactly the instruction it was interrupted at, with all registers intact. Process B ran for 50ms while A was paused. A knows nothing about this.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 2 — The Kernel Path:</strong>\nThe PIT timer channel 0 asserts IRQ0. The PIC raises INTR on the CPU. At the end of the current instruction, the CPU checks the interrupt flag (IF=1 in EFLAGS) and accepts the interrupt. It reads TSS to get the current process&#39;s kernel stack (ESP0), pushes <code>SS</code>, <code>ESP</code>, <code>EFLAGS</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>EIP</code> onto the kernel stack, and jumps to the IRQ1 handler at vector 32 via the IDT. The <code>irq_common_stub</code> assembly pushes segment registers and calls <code>pusha</code>. The C dispatcher increments <code>pit_tick_count</code>, calls <code>sched_tick()</code>, which decrements the time slice. If zero: <code>sched_schedule()</code> calls <code>tss_set_kernel_stack(next-&gt;kernel_stack_top)</code>, then <code>context_switch_asm()</code>. The assembly loads <code>next-&gt;cpu.esp</code> into <code>esp</code>, optionally reloads <code>cr3</code> (flushing TLB), and returns. Back in <code>irq_common_stub</code>, <code>popa</code> restores next process&#39;s general registers, segment registers are popped, <code>add esp, 8</code> discards vector/error, and <code>iret</code> restores <code>EIP</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>EFLAGS</code>, <code>ESP</code>, <code>SS</code> — jumping to next process&#39;s instruction pointer in its address space, restoring its stack, its flags, and switching privilege level back to ring 3 if applicable. Total kernel time: ~200–400 CPU cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 3 — Hardware Signals:</strong>\nThe PIT chip&#39;s 16-bit counter (clocked at 1.193 MHz, configured with divisor 11932 for 100Hz) reaches zero and pulses its output line connected to the master PIC&#39;s IRQ0 input. The PIC&#39;s cascade logic checks the IMR (Interrupt Mask Register) — IRQ0 is unmasked. The PIC asserts <code>INTR</code> high. The CPU&#39;s interrupt recognition logic (checked at the end of every instruction, or every N iterations for <code>rep</code> string instructions) sees <code>INTR</code> high and <code>IF=1</code>. The CPU&#39;s microcode issues a memory read cycle to fetch the TSS (for the ESP0 field) — this read goes to main memory (DRAM, since TSS is not frequently enough accessed to stay in L1 cache): ~100 cycles latency. Then five writes to push the interrupt frame onto the kernel stack. Then an IDT lookup (the IDT is hot, stays in L2): ~10 cycles. Then a branch to the handler. The total hardware-level interrupt response time from <code>INTR</code> assertion to first handler instruction: ~150 CPU cycles (75ns at 2GHz). The PIC sees the CPU&#39;s INTA (Interrupt Acknowledge) signal and clears its ISR bit for IRQ0.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hardware Soul:</strong> The context switch touches a lot of cold memory. The current process&#39;s PCB (<code>old-&gt;cpu.esp</code> field write): probably cold (PCB last touched during previous context switch, 50ms ago). The next process&#39;s PCB (<code>next-&gt;cpu.esp</code> read): definitely cold. The next process&#39;s kernel stack (the <code>popa</code> and segment register pops after the switch): almost certainly cold. The next process&#39;s page directory (if CR3 is reloaded): cold. A context switch that requires four DRAM accesses at 60ns each costs 240ns in memory access alone — on top of the ~75ns interrupt response. Total preemptive context switch latency: approximately 350–500ns, or ~700–1000 CPU cycles at 2GHz. This is the irreducible cost of preemption. Every async framework that avoids context switches — Node.js, nginx&#39;s event loop, Go&#39;s goroutine scheduler — is building on the knowledge that 1000 cycles is an expensive boundary to cross.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"section-10-putting-it-all-together-in-kmain\">Section 10: Putting It All Together in kmain</h2>\n<p>The complete milestone 4 initialization, inserted into

The connections extend into every domain of systems software.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Context switch cost as the origin of event-driven architecture (cross-domain: web servers and distributed systems)</strong></p>\n<p>The ~1000-cycle context switch you just implemented is the direct cause of an entire architectural movement. In the early 2000s, the &quot;C10K problem&quot; described why Apache-style threaded web servers — one thread per connection — could not scale past ~10,000 simultaneous connections on commodity hardware. Each connection required a thread, each thread required ~1000 cycles per scheduler invocation, and with 10,000 threads, the scheduler overhead dominated useful work.</p>\n<p>The solution was event-driven I/O: <strong>epoll</strong> (Linux), <strong>kqueue</strong> (FreeBSD), and <strong>IOCP</strong> (Windows) allow one thread to wait on thousands of file descriptors simultaneously, switching between them cooperatively only when I/O is ready — no context switch, because there is no thread switch. Node.js built an entire ecosystem on this principle. <strong>nginx</strong> (which replaced Apache for high-concurrency workloads) uses an event loop with a small fixed number of worker threads. <strong>Go&#39;s goroutines</strong> are a middle path: lightweight green threads that context-switch in user space (M:N threading), amortizing the kernel context switch cost across thousands of goroutines that are multiplexed onto a small pool of OS threads.</p>\n<p>The reason these architectures exist — the reason Linus Torvalds&#39;s 2001 email dismissing thread-per-request as &quot;hopelessly inefficient&quot; sparked a decade of framework design — is the number you just measured: 1000 cycles, ~500ns, per switch. When you understand what those cycles are buying (register saves, TLB flush, cache cold misses), you understand why Go&#39;s goroutine scheduler can context-switch in ~100ns (no TLB flush, smaller register set, stack is hot) and why that 5× difference matters at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>2. TSS.ESP0 as the foundation of container isolation (cross-domain: Linux namespaces, Docker)</strong></p>\n<p>The per-process kernel stack you just configured — and the TSS.ESP0 update that makes it work — is not just a scheduling convenience. It is the root of OS-level process isolation.</p>\n<p>Every Linux process has a distinct kernel stack. When a process makes a syscall or receives an interrupt, the CPU jumps to kernel code using that process&#39;s stack. If two processes shared a kernel stack, one process&#39;s syscall could read or overwrite the other&#39;s saved state on the shared stack. The TSS.ESP0 mechanism prevents this by giving the CPU a per-process pointer that it uses before executing a single kernel instruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Linux containers</strong> (the foundation of Docker and Kubernetes) extend this isolation in software: namespaces (PID, network, mount, user, UTS, IPC) restrict what a container process can see. <strong>cgroups</strong> limit what it can consume. But the hardware isolation root — the one that makes a container process actually unable to access another container&#39;s memory — is the same mechanism you just built: each container process has its own page directory (CR3), and the CPU enforces the boundary at the page table level. A <strong>container escape vulnerability</strong> (a CVE that allows a containerized process to escape its isolation) almost always involves either a kernel stack smashing bug (overwriting the saved state of another process on its kernel stack) or a page table manipulation bug (tricking the kernel into mapping a container&#39;s memory as kernel-accessible). You have just built the mechanism these attacks target. Understanding it at the instruction level is prerequisite for understanding the exploit patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Round-robin as fairness, not performance — tracing the path to CFS (Linux scheduler)</strong></p>\n<p>Your scheduler gives each ready process one equal time slice in turn. It is a correct and implementable baseline. It is also inadequate for every real workload, for a reason that becomes visible the moment you add a fourth process that does I/O.</p>\n<p>An I/O-bound process (waiting for keyboard input, disk read, or network packet) is almost never in <code>PROCESS_READY</code>. It spends most of its time in <code>PROCESS_BLOCKED</code>. Round-robin skips it efficiently. But when it <em>does</em> become ready (the I/O completes), it must wait for its turn in the round-robin cycle — potentially waiting for N-1 other processes to run their full slices first. For interactive applications (terminals, text editors), this introduces perceptible latency: the user presses a key, the key arrives in the keyboard buffer, but the process that reads it does not run for another 50ms × (N-1) processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Linux&#39;s CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)</strong> solves this with <code>vruntime</code>: each process accumulates a virtual runtime counter (how much CPU time it has received, weighted by its priority). The scheduler always runs the process with the <em>lowest</em> vruntime — i.e., the process that has received the <em>least</em> CPU time proportionally. An I/O-bound process that was blocked for 100ms accumulates no vruntime during that time, so when it unblocks, it has the lowest vruntime in the system and runs immediately. <strong>SCHED_FIFO</strong> and <strong>SCHED_RR</strong> are Linux&#39;s real-time scheduling classes: FIFO runs a process until it blocks or yields (no preemption); RR gives equal time slices but never interleaves with SCHED_FIFO tasks. <strong>Go&#39;s work-stealing scheduler</strong> (which manages goroutines across OS threads) uses a local run queue per OS thread plus a global queue, and idle threads &quot;steal&quot; goroutines from busy threads — a load balancing mechanism invisible at the OS level because it happens in user space. Your round-robin scheduler is the Ur-primitive from which all of these descend.</p>\n<p><strong>4. INT 0x80 as the slow path that motivated SYSENTER/SYSCALL and the vDSO</strong></p>\n<p><code>int 0x80</code> is a software interrupt. Invoking it requires: checking DPL (2 cycles), looking up the IDT entry (memory access, ~10 cycles), switching to the kernel stack via TSS (memory access for TSS.ESP0, ~100 cycles if cold), pushing five values onto the kernel stack (5 writes), saving all registers, executing the syscall handler, then reversing all of this with <code>iret</code>. Typical <code>int 0x80</code> round-trip time: ~500 cycles.</p>\n<p>Intel recognized this bottleneck in 1996 and added <strong>SYSENTER/SYSEXIT</strong> (P6 architecture) — a pair of instructions optimized for syscall entry and exit that bypass the IDT lookup and use MSRs (Model-Specific Registers) to specify the kernel entry point and stack. This reduces syscall overhead to ~100 cycles. AMD added <strong>SYSCALL/SYSRET</strong> (similar, slightly different mechanism, now the 64-bit standard). Linux uses SYSCALL in 64-bit mode and SYSENTER in 32-bit mode.</p>\n<p>But Linux went further: the <strong>vDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object)</strong> is a small kernel-mapped page inserted into every process&#39;s address space. It contains small functions like <code>gettimeofday()</code> and <code>clock_gettime()</code> that read kernel data (the current time, updated by the timer interrupt) without crossing the ring boundary at all. A user process calling <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> reads the TSC (Time Stamp Counter — a CPU register that counts cycles since boot) directly, with no syscall, no ring transition, no context switch — and gets nanosecond precision in ~20 cycles. The vDSO is possible because the kernel can share read-only data with user processes via page tables. Understanding <code>int 0x80</code> — its cost, its path through the IDT, the TSS lookup it triggers — makes the entire SYSENTER/vDSO optimization story obvious: every optimization in that chain is eliminating one step of the <code>int 0x80</code> path you just implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Per-process page directories as the hardware root of every isolation boundary</strong></p>\n<p>Every process you just created has its own <code>CR3</code> — its own root page table. When the scheduler loads a new <code>CR3</code>, the CPU&#39;s address space switches instantaneously and completely. Every virtual address means something different. Physical address <code>0x00201234</code> might be process A&#39;s heap and process B&#39;s stack simultaneously — because they are mapped to different virtual addresses in different page directories, and the MMU translates through different tables. The hardware enforces that neither process can access the other&#39;s physical frames because neither process&#39;s page tables contain entries for the other&#39;s frames.</p>\n<p>This same mechanism is the hardware root of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Virtual machines:</strong> A hypervisor (VMX root mode) interposes another level of page tables (EPT — Extended Page Tables) between the guest OS&#39;s page tables and physical memory. The guest OS thinks it is managing physical memory; it is actually managing guest-physical memory that the hypervisor translates again. Two levels of CR3-like pointers, both enforced by MMU hardware.</li>\n<li><strong>Browser tab isolation (site isolation in Chrome):</strong> Each tab runs in a separate renderer process with its own page directory. A compromised tab cannot read another tab&#39;s memory because the kernel never maps one tab&#39;s physical frames into another&#39;s page directory.</li>\n<li><strong>Spectre/Meltdown mitigations (KPTI — Kernel Page Table Isolation):</strong> After Meltdown (2018), the Linux kernel adopted KPTI: user-mode processes run with a page directory that contains almost no kernel mappings (only the minimum needed to enter the kernel). The full kernel page directory is restored only after the ring transition. This doubles the TLB flush frequency (every ring transition requires a CR3 swap) but prevents speculative execution from reading kernel memory via cache timing channels. The cost of KPTI — measured at 5–30% overhead on syscall-heavy workloads — is the cost of swapping <code>CR3</code> twice per syscall instead of zero times. You just built the mechanism whose overhead Meltdown exploited and KPTI pays to mitigate.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"final-system-view-everything-connected\">Final System View — Everything Connected</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdiag-satellite-interrupt-to-scheduler.svg\" alt=\"Interrupt Infrastructure as Scheduler Foundation\"></p>\n<p>Standing at the end of Milestone 4, your kernel does what took the Unix team years to build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 1</strong> provided the hardware foundation: protected mode, segmentation, I/O drivers, a C execution environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 2</strong> wired in the interrupt infrastructure: the IDT, PIC remapping, the timer tick, keyboard input, the double fault safety net.</li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 3</strong> built the address space: physical frame tracking, two-level page tables, virtual-to-physical translation, a kernel heap.</li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 4</strong> animated multiple concurrent processes: PCBs that capture complete CPU state, assembly-level context switching, TSS-backed ring transitions, a preemptive round-robin scheduler, user-mode isolation, and a system call gate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every abstraction that application programmers use — <code>malloc</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>pthread_create</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>mmap</code> — sits atop one or more of these mechanisms. <code>malloc</code> calls <code>sbrk</code> which calls a page fault path in your VMM. <code>printf</code> eventually calls <code>write</code> which crosses your INT 0x80 gate into your <code>sys_write</code> handler. <code>pthread_create</code> allocates a PCB and kernel stack and calls your scheduler. <code>read</code> blocks a process (sets it to <code>PROCESS_BLOCKED</code>) until data arrives via your IRQ handler.</p>\n<p>The knowledge you have built is not academic.

Add <code>-d int</code> to QEMU flags and verify the last interrupt before hang is a disk-related INT (vector 0x13), not a CPU exception (vectors 0–20).

Hardware Soul Analysis</h2>\n<h3 id=\"vga-mmio-at-0xb8000\">VGA MMIO at <code>0xB8000</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Cache behavior:</strong> The VGA buffer is a physical MMIO region. On real hardware, the CPU&#39;s MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) or PAT (Page Attribute Table) mark it as Write-Combining or Uncacheable — writes bypass L1/L2/L3 and go directly to the ISA bus bridge. On QEMU, writes to <code>0xB8000</code> are intercepted by the virtual VGA device and rendered immediately. No cache warm-up effect exists. Each <code>uint16_t</code> write costs a full memory bus transaction (~100–200ns on real hardware; faster on QEMU).</p>\n<p><strong><code>volatile</code> is mandatory:</strong> Without <code>volatile</code>, GCC at <code>-O2</code> observes that the VGA array is written-to but never read back from C code, treats the writes as dead stores, and eliminates them entirely. The compiled binary contains no reference to <code>0xB8000</code>. The <code>volatile</code> qualifier forces every store to be emitted as a machine instruction, regardless of optimization level.</p>\n<p><strong>TLB irrelevance:</strong> No page tables are active in this module. The CPU translates addresses as physical = virtual (the MMU is bypassed before <code>CR0.PG</code> is set, which does not happen until Milestone 3). There is no TLB miss possible here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serial-port-io\">Serial Port I/O</h3>\n<p><strong>Port I/O vs MMIO:</strong> Unlike VGA, the UART uses the x86 I/O address space (a separate 16-bit address space accessed via <code>in</code>/<code>out</code> instructions, distinct from the memory address space). The <code>in</code>/<code>out</code> instructions stall the CPU until the I/O bus transaction completes — legacy ISA devices respond in 1–4µs. This is why <code>io_wait()</code> uses <code>outb(0x80, 0)</code> — a deliberate 1–4µs stall between UART configuration writes to allow the chip&#39;s internal state machine to settle.</p>\n<p><strong>Branch predictability:</strong> The <code>serial_putchar</code> busy-wait loop (<code>while (!(inb(0x3FD) &amp; 0x20))</code>) is a tight I/O-bound spin. The branch is perfectly predictable in the &quot;spin&quot; direction (the CPU predicts &quot;not ready&quot; for the first several iterations) and mispredicts exactly once (when THRE transitions from 0 to 1). Misprediction cost: ~15 cycles — negligible compared to the 260µs character time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gdt-load-and-far-jump\">GDT Load and Far Jump</h3>\n<p><strong>Pipeline flush cost:</strong> The far jump after <code>CR0.PE</code> discards all prefetched and partially-decoded instructions in the CPU&#39;s out-of-order execution pipeline. On a modern CPU with a 20-stage pipeline and aggressive out-of-order execution, this flushes up to 100+ in-flight micro-operations. Cost: ~20–30 cycles — a one-time expense that ensures no real-mode-decoded instructions execute in protected mode.</p>\n<p><strong><code>lgdt</code> instruction behavior:</strong> <code>lgdt</code> is a serializing instruction — it completes all previous memory operations before executing, and subsequent instructions see the new GDTR value. It does not flush the TLB (no page tables yet) but does serialize the instruction stream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bss-zeroing\">BSS Zeroing</h3>\n<p><strong><code>rep stosd</code> microarchitecture:</strong> On modern x86 CPUs, <code>rep stosd</code> is recognized by the microcode as a &quot;fast string&quot; operation and is executed as a DMA-like operation within the CPU core, filling ~16 bytes per cycle (4 dwords per cycle). For a 64KB BSS section: 16384 dword stores at 4 stores/cycle = ~4096 cycles = ~2µs at 2GHz. The target memory is in DRAM (not yet in any cache); the CPU will generate cache-line-sized (64-byte) store bursts, filling 16 dwords per cache line write = efficient memory bandwidth utilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory access pattern:</strong> Sequential write from <code>__bss_start</code> to <code>__bss_end</code>. Hardware prefetcher detects the stride and issues prefetch requests for upcoming cache lines. Effective throughput approaches memory bandwidth limit rather than being limited by cache miss latency. This is the ideal access pattern for bulk initialization.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftdd-diag-6.svg\" alt=\"Kernel Virtual Address Space: Linker Script Section Layout\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"11-state-diagram\">11.

On x86, all stores are visible to the I/O bus in program order (x86 Total Store Order guarantees store-store ordering). No <code>sfence</code> or <code>mfence</code> is needed because there are no other CPUs or DMA agents that could observe reordering.</p>\n<p><strong>Port I/O ordering (UART):</strong> The <code>io_wait()</code> call between UART configuration writes acts as a timing barrier, not a memory ordering barrier. The UART chip&#39;s state machine requires settling time between configuration writes. The <code>outb(0x80, 0)</code> in <code>io_wait()</code> is an I/O write that stalls the CPU for ~1–4µs while the I/O bus transaction completes. This is sufficient for the 16550 UART&#39;s state machine transitions. No explicit memory fence is required because each <code>outb</code> is already a serializing operation on legacy I/O ports.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"13-synced-criteria\">13.

Module Charter</h2>\n<p>This module configures the x86 interrupt infrastructure — the IDT, 8259 PIC cascade, CPU exception handlers, hardware IRQ handlers, PIT timer, and PS/2 keyboard driver — starting from a protected-mode kernel with no interrupt handling and ending with all 256 IDT gates populated, interrupts enabled, a 100Hz tick counter running, and a keyboard input buffer available for polling. Every interrupt that fires after <code>sti</code> goes through a path this module owns.</p>\n<p>This module does <strong>not</strong> implement a process scheduler (the timer handler only increments a counter), page tables or virtual memory, a kernel heap, the TSS, system calls, or the INT 0x80 gate (DPL=3 trap gate setup is declared here for completeness but activated in Milestone 4). The module does not implement APIC or MSI-X — only the 8259 PIC cascade is used. No floating-point state (x87/SSE registers) is saved in interrupt handlers.</p>\n<p><strong>Upstream dependency:</strong> Module <code>mod-1</code> — protected mode active, GDT loaded with kernel code (0x08) and data (0x10) selectors, VGA and serial output functional, <code>kprintf</code> available, interrupts disabled.</p>\n<p><strong>Downstream dependency:</strong> Module <code>mod-3</code> (memory management) receives a running timer tick counter (<code>pit_tick_count</code>) and the IDT infrastructure to register a page fault handler. Module <code>mod-4</code> (scheduling) installs the scheduler into the timer IRQ handler slot and registers the system call gate.</p>\n<p><strong>Invariants that must hold at module exit:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>IDT contains exactly 256 valid gate descriptors; the IDTR register points to it with limit = 2047.</li>\n<li>Master PIC delivers IRQ0–7 at vectors 32–39; slave PIC delivers IRQ8–15 at vectors 40–47. Vectors 0–31 are reserved exclusively for CPU exceptions.</li>\n<li>Every ISR/IRQ handler restores the interrupted CPU to an identical register state (all 8 general-purpose registers, 4 segment registers, EFLAGS, EIP) unless the handler explicitly modifies the saved frame to change behavior.</li>\n<li>EOI is sent to the PIC on every hardware IRQ invocation before returning from the IRQ handler.</li>\n<li><code>pit_tick_count</code> increments by 1 per timer period (10ms at 100Hz); it is never incremented by software.</li>\n<li><code>keyboard_getchar()</code> returns bytes placed there exclusively by the IRQ1 handler; no other code path writes to the circular buffer.</li>\n<li>Interrupts are enabled (<code>EFLAGS.IF = 1</code>) when <code>kmain</code> reaches its idle loop.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2-file-structure\">2.

This simplifies handler design at the cost of slightly increased interrupt latency for other IRQs while the handler runs. Acceptable for a single-core kernel with short handlers (&lt;100 cycles each).</p>\n<p><strong>Why trap gate for CPU exceptions:</strong> Exceptions (divide-by-zero, page fault, GPF) benefit from IF=1 during handling — a page fault handler may need to perform I/O that requires timer ticks. Trap gates also allow a GDB stub to break in during exception handling. For this module, all exception handlers halt, so the distinction is academic but correct.</p>\n<p><strong>C struct definition:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">/* include/idt.h */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">#include</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> &#x3C;stdint.h></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> __attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((packed)) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> offset_low;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    /* Handler address [15:0]              */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> selector;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">      /* Code segment selector (0x08)        */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint8_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  zero;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">          /* Always 0x00 per Intel spec          */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint8_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  type_attr;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">     /* P | DPL | 0 | Type                  */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> offset_high;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">   /* Handler address [31:16]             */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">} </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">idt_gate_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">               /* sizeof = 8; assert in idt.c         */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> __attribute__</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">((packed)) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint16_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> limit;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">          /* Size of IDT in bytes minus 1 = 2047 */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    uint32_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> base;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">           /* Physical address of idt[] array      */</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">} </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">idtr_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">                    /* sizeof = 6                           */</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Memory layout of <code>idt[]</code> array:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>idt[0]   bytes 0–7:    Vector 0  (Divide Error)\nidt[1]   bytes 8–15:   Vector 1  (Debug)\n...\nidt[31]  bytes 248–255: Vector 31 (Reserved)\nidt[32]  bytes 256–263: Vector 32 (IRQ0: Timer)\n...\nidt[47]  bytes 376–383: Vector 47 (IRQ15: Secondary ATA)\nidt[48]–idt[127]:  Unused; installed with a default_isr stub (prints and halts)\nidt[128] bytes 1024–1031: Vector 0x80 (system call gate, DPL=3; configured in mod-4)\nidt[129]–idt[255]: Unused; default_isr stub\n\nTotal: 256 × 8 = 2048 bytes.

The assembly stub restores registers and executes <code>iret</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why EOI after handler:</strong> Sending EOI before calling the handler would allow the PIC to re-deliver the same IRQ before the handler completes — problematic for non-reentrant handlers. Sending after prevents this at the cost that the handler runs with that IRQ line masked. For this module&#39;s short handlers (&lt;100 cycles), the difference is immeasurable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"47-pic_remapuint8_t-master_offset-uint8_t-slave_offset-void\">4.7 <code>pic_remap(uint8_t master_offset, uint8_t slave_offset) → void</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>master_offset</code>: Vector base for IRQ0–7. Must be a multiple of 8 (hardware constraint: the PIC uses the lower 3 bits for IRQ sub-number). Pass <code>0x20</code> (32).</li>\n<li><code>slave_offset</code>: Vector base for IRQ8–15. Must be a multiple of 8. Pass <code>0x28</code> (40). Must be <code>master_offset + 8</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pre-conditions:</strong> Call before <code>sti</code>. Call after IDT is fully populated (so no IRQ fires before handlers are ready).</p>\n<p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Executes the complete ICW1–ICW4 initialization sequence for both PICs with <code>io_wait()</code> between each write. Saves the IMR of both PICs before initialization and restores them afterward.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-conditions:</strong> Master PIC delivers IRQ0–7 at <code>master_offset</code> through <code>master_offset + 7</code>. Slave PIC delivers IRQ8–15 at <code>slave_offset</code> through <code>slave_offset + 7</code>. Interrupt masks are identical to pre-call state.</p>\n<p><strong>Errors:</strong> None detectable — the PIC provides no acknowledgment. If the wrong values are passed (not multiples of 8), the PIC silently uses them, causing vectors to overlap unexpectedly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"48-pic_send_eoiuint8_t-irq-void\">4.8 <code>pic_send_eoi(uint8_t irq) → void</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>irq</code>: IRQ number [0, 15].

After the slave EOI, the master sees its IRQ2 input go inactive. The master EOI then releases the master&#39;s in-service bit. If you EOI the master first, the master re-enables delivery of future IRQs while the slave still has its ISR bit set — the slave cannot deliver another IRQ through the cascade until its own ISR bit is cleared, but the ordering is still correct. Slave-first is conventional and prevents any edge-case behavior on real 8259 hardware.</p>\n<p><strong>Errors:</strong> None. If <code>pic_send_eoi</code> is never called after an IRQ, the PIC permanently suppresses further IRQs on that line with no error message.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"49-pic_get_isruint8_t-pic-uint8_t\">4.9 <code>pic_get_isr(uint8_t pic) → uint8_t</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pic</code>: <code>0</code> = master, <code>1</code> = slave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Behavior:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>outb(pic == 0 ?

Its internal state machine advances through the ICW sequence by receiving successive writes to the data port, but it requires settling time (typically 1–4µs) between writes. On real hardware, skipping <code>io_wait()</code> causes initialization failures on some chipsets. On QEMU, <code>io_wait()</code> is a no-op functionally but is retained for portability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftdd-diag-14.svg\" alt=\"PIT 8254 Channel 0: Divisor Calculation and 100Hz Configuration\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"54-ps2-keyboard-handler-full-algorithm\">5.4 PS/2 Keyboard Handler — Full Algorithm</h3>\n<p><strong>Called from:</strong> <code>irq_dispatcher</code> with <code>frame-&gt;vector == 33</code> (IRQ1).

Hardware Soul Analysis</h2>\n<h3 id=\"idt-lookup-cache-behavior\">IDT Lookup Cache Behavior</h3>\n<p>The IDT array is 2048 bytes. A typical L1 data cache is 32KB with 64-byte cache lines. The IDT occupies exactly 32 cache lines. After the first access to any IDT entry, subsequent accesses to nearby entries are L1 hits. Since interrupt handling tends to invoke the same small set of vectors (timer at vector 32, keyboard at vector 33) repeatedly, those entries are perpetually hot in L1 cache. The L1 hit latency for the IDT lookup is 4–5 cycles — negligible compared to the pipeline flush cost of the interrupt itself.</p>\n<p>The IDTR register is a CPU-internal register (not a cache-line in memory); the CPU does not &quot;cache&quot; the IDT entries themselves — it re-reads them from memory on each interrupt, but those reads hit L1 cache after the first invocation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pic-port-io-latency\">PIC Port I/O Latency</h3>\n<p>Every <code>inb</code>/<code>outb</code> to PIC ports <code>0x20</code>, <code>0x21</code>, <code>0xA0</code>, <code>0xA1</code> crosses the legacy ISA-emulated I/O bus. On real hardware, this costs 1–4µs per access (the I/O bus is slow relative to DRAM). The <code>io_wait()</code> call adds another ~1µs. Total cost of <code>pic_remap()</code>: 16 writes × ~3µs each = ~48µs — a one-time boot cost, irrelevant at runtime.</p>\n<p>At runtime, <code>pic_send_eoi()</code> issues 1–2 <code>outb</code> calls. On QEMU, each I/O write is cheaper than real hardware (sub-microsecond), but blocking is still measurable. This is why production kernels with high IRQ rates (&gt; 1M IRQs/sec) use MSI-X (Message Signaled Interrupts eXtended) — a mechanism that writes to a memory address rather than an I/O port, costing a single DRAM write (<del>60ns) instead of an ISA I/O transaction (</del>3µs), a 50× speedup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pushapopa-microarchitecture\"><code>pusha</code>/<code>popa</code> Microarchitecture</h3>\n<p>On modern Intel CPUs (Skylake+), <code>pusha</code> is not a &quot;fast string&quot; operation — it is decoded as a sequence of 8 individual push micro-operations. Each push writes 4 bytes and decrements ESP. Total: 8 micro-ops. On a CPU with 4 execution ports for integer operations, the 8 pushes complete in approximately 2–4 cycles. <code>popa</code> is symmetric. The entire <code>pusha</code> + 4 segment pushes + <code>popa</code> + 4 segment pops costs approximately 30–40 cycles — measurable but small relative to the pipeline flush cost of the interrupt itself (~20–30 cycles for the branch misprediction from the far jump to the handler).</p>\n<h3 id=\"circular-buffer-memory-access-pattern\">Circular Buffer Memory Access Pattern</h3>\n<p><code>kb_ring.buf</code> is a 256-byte array, fitting entirely within 4 cache lines (4 × 64 bytes = 256 bytes). After the first access warms the cache, all subsequent reads and writes are L1 hits. The <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> fields follow the buffer in the same struct and are likely in the same or adjacent cache line as the buffer&#39;s first bytes. A keyboard interrupt that writes to the buffer and increments <code>head</code> therefore requires at most 2 L1 cache accesses — essentially free from a memory latency perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"branch-predictability-in-exception-dispatch\">Branch Predictability in Exception Dispatch</h3>\n<p><code>exception_handler</code>&#39;s switch on <code>frame-&gt;vector</code> is compiled as a series of conditional branches or a jump table. For a kernel that almost never triggers exceptions during normal operation, these branches are almost always not-taken — the predictor learns quickly that exceptions are rare events. On the rare invocation (a real fault), the misprediction cost (~15 cycles) is irrelevant because the handler is about to halt the system.</p>\n<p>The keyboard handler&#39;s branch on <code>is_break</code> is highly predictable: in a typical interactive session, half of all IRQ1 firings are make codes and half are break codes (each key generates exactly one of each). The predictor cannot predict this alternating pattern better than 50% accuracy — a 50% misprediction rate at 15 cycles each = ~7.5 cycles average branch cost per keyboard event. Completely negligible at human typing speeds (&lt;20 characters/second).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftdd-diag-16.svg\" alt=\"Module Architecture: IDT, PIC, PIT, Keyboard, and IRQ Dispatch\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"11-state-machine\">11.

No dynamic allocation needed for boot-time page tables.</p>\n<p><strong>Why <code>__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))</code>:</strong> CR3 and the frame address field of PDEs require 4KB-aligned physical addresses. Without the alignment attribute, the linker places these arrays at their natural alignment (4 bytes), which is insufficient. The GCC <code>aligned</code> attribute guarantees placement at a 4KB boundary within the <code>.bss</code> section. The linker script must specify <code>.bss</code> section alignment ≥ <code>PAGE_SIZE</code>; add <code>.bss : ALIGN(4096) { ... }</code> if not already present.</p>\n<p><strong>Two-level address translation diagram:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Virtual Address: 0xC0101234\n  ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┐\n  │  Dir [31:22] │  Tbl [21:12] │  Off [11:0]    │\n  │  0x300 = 768 │  0x101 = 257 │  0x234 = 564   │\n  └──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────┘\n         │                │                │\n         ▼                │                │\n  boot_page_directory[768] ──► physical addr of kernel_page_table\n                           │\n                           ▼\n                  kernel_page_table[257] ──► physical frame addr\n                                                      │\n                                                      ▼\n                                            physical frame + 0x234\n                                            = 0x00101234 (physical)</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>{{DIAGRAM:tdd-diag-20}}</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"35-heap_block_t-kernel-heap-allocator-header\">3.5 <code>heap_block_t</code> — Kernel Heap Allocator Header</h3>\n<p>Each allocation is preceded by a <code>heap_block_t</code> header.

Setting CR0.PG with CR3=0 would cause the CPU to attempt a page table walk from physical address 0, which is the real-mode IVT — not a valid page directory. The immediate page fault from the bad walk, followed by the page fault handler&#39;s own bad walk, would produce a triple fault.</p>\n<p><strong>Post-conditions:</strong> <code>CR0.PG = 1</code>. <code>CR3</code> = physical address of <code>boot_page_directory</code>. All subsequent memory accesses go through the two-level page table. The identity map makes this transparent for addresses ≤ <code>0x3FFFFF</code>. VGA at physical <code>0xB8000</code> is accessible at virtual <code>0xB8000</code> (within the identity-mapped first 4MB).</p>\n<p><strong>Errors:</strong> If <code>boot_page_directory</code> is not 4KB-aligned (miscompiled kernel or wrong linker script): CR3 will have garbage in its low 12 bits. The CPU ignores the low 12 bits of CR3 (it masks them to zero for page directory lookup), so this is silently tolerated on x86 — but it is a latent bug.

Hardware Soul Analysis</h2>\n<h3 id=\"identity-map-bootstrapping-the-physics-of-paging-enablement\">Identity Map Bootstrapping — The Physics of Paging Enablement</h3>\n<p>When <code>mov %0, %%cr0</code> (setting PG=1) executes, the CPU&#39;s fetch unit immediately begins translating the <em>next</em> instruction&#39;s address through the newly active page tables. The pipeline has already fetched and partially decoded the next 1–3 instructions (prefetch queue). On modern CPUs, writing CR0 is a serializing instruction — it flushes the pipeline, discards prefetched instructions, and restarts fetch from the instruction following the CR0 write. The restart uses the page tables.</p>\n<p><strong>The critical window:</strong> The instruction at <code>current_eip + N</code> (the first instruction after the CR0 write) must be mapped. Since the kernel executes at physical <code>0x100000</code> and the identity map maps virtual <code>0x100000</code> → physical <code>0x100000</code>, the fetch succeeds. If the code were at physical <code>0x500000</code> without identity mapping virtual <code>0x500000</code>, the fetch would produce a page fault. No diagnostic possible. Triple fault.</p>\n<p><strong>Why CR0 write is serializing:</strong> Intel SDM Volume 3, Section 8.3: &quot;Certain instructions cause the processor to serialize all pending memory accesses and wait for them to complete before continuing program execution.&quot; MOV to CR0, CR3, CR4 are serializing. This means no pipelining artifact can cause a prefetched instruction from &quot;before paging&quot; to execute &quot;after paging&quot; — the serialization guarantees a clean boundary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bitmap-cache-behavior-why-512-frames-per-cache-line-matters\">Bitmap Cache Behavior — Why 512 Frames Per Cache Line Matters</h3>\n<p>A 64-byte cache line holds 16 <code>uint32_t</code> words of the bitmap. Each word represents 32 frames. 16 × 32 = 512 frames per cache line = 512 × 4KB = 2MB of physical memory per cache line. The inner loop&#39;s word-skip optimization (<code>if (frame_bitmap[word] == 0xFFFFFFFF) continue</code>) skips 512 frames in a single comparison:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">if</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\">frame_bitmap</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[word] </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">==</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> 0x</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">FFFFFFFF</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    word</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">++</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">; </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">continue</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  // 512 frames checked, 1 comparison, 0 bit-level loops</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>After <code>pmm_init()</code>, a 128MB system has ~32K usable frames (32K / 32 = 1024 bitmap words = 64 cache lines). A fully-unused heap allocation scan traverses 64 cache lines in L2 (after the first pass warms the cache). At 5ns per L2 hit: 64 × 5ns = 320ns worst case for finding a free frame anywhere in 128MB. With the search hint, the typical case is 1 cache line = 5ns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"page-table-walk-latency-why-tlb-size-matters\">Page Table Walk Latency — Why TLB Size Matters</h3>\n<p>A TLB miss triggers a hardware page table walk: 2 memory reads (PDE from CR3-pointed directory, PTE from PDE-pointed table) plus the data access itself = 3 memory accesses minimum. If the page directory is hot in L1 (it&#39;s accessed on every TLB miss for any address in that directory entry&#39;s 4MB range): ~4 cycles for PDE read. If the page table is in L2 (4KB page table; accessed on every TLB miss within a 4MB region): ~12 cycles for PTE read. Data from L2: ~12 cycles. Total TLB miss cost: ~30 cycles. This is the &quot;30–50 cycles TLB miss&quot; target.</p>\n<p>The heap at virtual <code>0xD0000000</code>: heap PD index = <code>0xD0000000 &gt;&gt; 22 = 832</code>. Each heap page table covers 4MB of heap virtual space. For a heap under 4MB, there is exactly one page table, and after the first access, it stays in L2 cache. All heap accesses within 4MB share this single warm page table.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heap-block-pointer-chasing-cache-miss-profile\">Heap Block Pointer-Chasing — Cache Miss Profile</h3>\n<p>Each <code>heap_block_t</code> header is 20 bytes. After a series of allocations and frees, block headers are at addresses like <code>0xD0000000</code>, <code>0xD0000054</code>, <code>0xD000009C</code>, ... (depending on split sizes). These are sequential addresses within the first heap page — all within one 4KB page, and likely within two 64-byte cache lines after the first few allocations. The &quot;pointer-chasing is cache-hostile&quot; concern applies mainly to mature heaps with many blocks scattered across multiple pages. For a kernel with dozens of allocations (not millions), the entire heap metadata fits in L1 cache.</p>\n<p>The critical case is the first <code>kmalloc()</code> after boot: the heap block at <code>0xD0000000</code> was just mapped, so it is cold. First access = TLB miss (heap PDE was just installed) + page table walk + L3 or DRAM access = ~150–200 cycles. Subsequent accesses in the same session are L1 hits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vga-mmio-uncacheable-vs-write-combining\">VGA MMIO — Uncacheable vs Write-Combining</h3>\n<p>Physical <code>0xB8000</code> is typically in the MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) region <code>0xA0000</code>–<code>0xBFFFF</code> classified as <code>Write Combining (WC)</code>. Write-combining allows the CPU to buffer several writes and send them to the device in a burst rather than one at a time. For VGA text mode (40 bytes/screen update), this distinction doesn&#39;t matter. For high-bandwidth framebuffer writes (modern GPU, 32MB/frame at 60fps), WC is essential — without it, each write is a separate uncacheable transaction saturating the PCIe bus.</p>\n<p>Our identity map sets <code>PAGE_CACHE_DISABLE</code> (PCD) for the VGA range if following the policy table in §3.3. In practice, the MTRR takes precedence over the page table PCD flag (MTRR &quot;wins&quot; for write-combined regions). Either way, VGA writes are not L1/L2 cached — each <code>uint16_t</code> write to <code>0xB8000</code> goes to the display adapter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftdd-diag-25.svg\" alt=\"Module Architecture: PMM, VMM, and Heap Subsystems\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"11-state-machine\">11.

Concurrency Specification</h2>\n<p><strong>Model:</strong> Single-core; no SMP; no threads (mod-4 introduces processes but keeps single CPU). All allocator operations are non-reentrant. The only concurrent entity is interrupt handlers.</p>\n<p><strong>PMM critical sections:</strong> <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> and <code>pmm_free_frame()</code> modify <code>frame_bitmap</code>, <code>pmm_used_frames</code>, and <code>pmm_search_hint</code>. If an interrupt handler called <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> while <code>kmain</code> was mid-way through <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> (e.g., between <code>bitmap_test()</code> and <code>bitmap_set()</code>), the same frame could be allocated twice. <strong>In this module, no interrupt handler calls <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code>.</strong> The timer handler (from mod-2) only increments <code>pit_tick_count</code>. The keyboard handler only writes to a ring buffer. <strong>No locking is required</strong> for mod-3. For production use: wrap <code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> and <code>pmm_free_frame()</code> with <code>cli</code>/<code>sti</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>VMM critical sections:</strong> <code>vmm_map_page()</code> modifies page directory and page table entries. A partially-written PTE (PDE installed, PTE not yet written) observed by an interrupt handler that accesses the partially-mapped virtual address would page-fault. Since no interrupt handler in mod-3 or mod-2 accesses heap virtual addresses, this race cannot occur. <code>vmm_unmap_page()</code> must call <code>tlb_flush_page()</code> before the function returns — this is not a concurrency issue (single-core) but a correctness requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Heap critical sections:</strong> <code>kmalloc()</code> and <code>kfree()</code> modify the heap linked list. Same analysis as PMM: no interrupt handler in mod-2 calls <code>kmalloc()</code>/<code>kfree()</code>. No locking required. <strong>Future risk:</strong> If mod-4 installs an interrupt handler that calls <code>kmalloc()</code>, a lock (or <code>cli</code>/<code>sti</code>) becomes mandatory around the linked list traversal and modification.</p>\n<p><strong><code>volatile</code> requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>frame_bitmap</code>: not <code>volatile</code> — it is only accessed from non-interrupt kernel code in this module. If an interrupt handler is added that checks frame availability, add <code>volatile</code>.</li>\n<li><code>heap_head</code>, <code>heap_end</code>: not <code>volatile</code> — same reasoning.</li>\n<li><code>boot_page_directory</code>, page tables: not <code>volatile</code> — modified only by setup code, read by CPU MMU hardware (which bypasses cache via its own mechanisms). The <code>&quot;memory&quot;</code> clobber in <code>vmm_enable_paging()</code>&#39;s inline asm ensures the compiler flushes all pending stores before the CR3 write.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"13-synced-criteria\">13.

Module Charter</h2>\n<p>This module implements the complete process lifecycle and preemptive multitasking layer on top of the interrupt infrastructure from mod-2 and the memory subsystem from mod-3. It owns: the <code>process_t</code> PCB structure capturing full CPU state per process, per-process 4KB kernel stacks isolated from each other, an assembly context switch routine that pivots the kernel stack pointer between PCBs within the existing IRQ stub framework (no separate register save/restore — it rides the <code>pusha</code>/<code>popa</code> already present in <code>irq_common_stub</code>), the Intel TSS configured with its GDT descriptor and per-switch <code>ESP0</code> updates so ring 3→ring 0 transitions find the correct kernel stack, a round-robin preemptive scheduler triggered by the 100Hz timer IRQ, fake initial stack frame construction that makes new processes look exactly like preempted ones to <code>iret</code>, user-mode process creation with per-process page directories and ring 3 segment selectors, and the INT 0x80 system call gate implementing <code>sys_write</code> and <code>sys_exit</code>.</p>\n<p>This module does <strong>not</strong> implement blocking I/O primitives, <code>PROCESS_BLOCKED</code> waiting beyond the state flag, priority scheduling, signals, ELF binary loading, <code>fork</code>/<code>exec</code>, inter-process communication, memory-mapped files, demand paging for user processes, or SMP spinlocks. The only scheduling policy is round-robin with a fixed time slice. User processes are created with a hard-coded entry function pointer; no ELF parser exists. The TSS is a single shared structure (one per kernel, not one per process — software task switching only reads <code>ESP0</code> and <code>SS0</code> from the TSS; <code>ltr</code> is issued once at boot).</p>\n<p><strong>Upstream dependencies:</strong> Module <code>mod-1</code> (GDT with 5 entries; GDT must be extended to 6 entries in this module to add the TSS descriptor; <code>gdt_flush()</code> must be callable after modification); module <code>mod-2</code> (<code>irq_common_stub</code> and <code>irq_return_trampoline</code> in <code>irq_stubs.asm</code>; <code>idt_set_gate()</code> for INT 0x80; <code>irq_install_handler(0, ...)</code> to replace the timer handler; <code>interrupt_frame_t</code> layout); module <code>mod-3</code> (<code>pmm_alloc_frame()</code> for user page directories and code/stack frames; <code>vmm_map_page()</code> for user address space construction; <code>boot_page_directory</code> for kernel PDE inheritance).</p>\n<p><strong>Downstream dependencies:</strong> None — this is the final milestone. The system is self-contained after this module.</p>\n<p><strong>Invariants that must hold at module exit:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>current_process</code> always points to a valid <code>process_t</code> in <code>PROCESS_RUNNING</code> state while inside <code>sched_schedule()</code> and after it returns.</li>\n<li><code>tss.esp0</code> equals <code>current_process-&gt;kernel_stack_top</code> at all times when user-mode code could be interrupted (i.e., after every <code>context_switch_asm()</code> and before the corresponding <code>iret</code>).</li>\n<li>Every process has a distinct <code>kernel_stack[]</code> array; no two process PCBs share any byte of kernel stack memory.</li>\n<li>The saved <code>cpu_state_t.esp</code> in a preempted process&#39;s PCB points into that process&#39;s own <code>kernel_stack[]</code> array, never into another process&#39;s stack.</li>\n<li><code>EFLAGS.IF = 1</code> in every process&#39;s initial frame (<code>eflags = 0x00000202</code>); no process starts with interrupts disabled.</li>\n<li>User-mode processes execute at CPL=3 (verified via CS selector <code>0x1B</code>); kernel pages with U/S=0 trigger page fault on user access.</li>\n<li><code>sys_write</code> validates that the user buffer pointer is below <code>0xC0000000</code> before dereferencing; <code>sys_exit</code> transitions the process to <code>PROCESS_ZOMBIE</code> and calls <code>sched_schedule()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2-file-structure\">2.

Only the stack pointer (<code>saved_esp</code>) that points to it is stored in the PCB. This is correct: when a process is preempted, <code>irq_common_stub</code> has already pushed all the register state onto the kernel stack. <code>context_switch_asm</code> records where on that stack the state lives by saving ESP. On resume, loading <code>saved_esp</code> into ESP and executing <code>ret</code> + <code>popa</code> + <code>iret</code> restores everything from the stack. The PCB is a thin envelope; the stack is the real state store.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory layout of <code>process_table[]</code>:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>process_table[0]:\n  Offset   0: pid               (4 bytes)\n  Offset   4: name[32]          (32 bytes)\n  Offset  36: state             (4 bytes)\n  Offset  40: ticks_remaining   (4 bytes)\n  Offset  44: saved_esp         (4 bytes)\n  Offset  48: page_directory*   (4 bytes)\n  Offset  52: kernel_stack_top  (4 bytes)\n  Offset  56: kernel_stack[4096] (4096 bytes)\n  Total:       4152 bytes\n\nprocess_table[1]: starts at offset 4152\nprocess_table[2]: starts at offset 8304\n...\nprocess_table[15]: starts at offset 62280\nTotal table: 16 × 4152 = 66,432 bytes ≈ 64.875 KB (in .bss)</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/build-os/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftdd-diag-27.svg\" alt=\"Per-Process Kernel Stack Layout: Initial Frame vs Preempted Frame\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"33-tss_t-task-state-segment-intel-defined-104-bytes\">3.3 <code>tss_t</code> — Task State Segment (Intel-Defined, 104 Bytes)</h3>\n<p>The TSS is a hardware-defined structure.

While B runs (for 50ms or more), <code>current_process == B</code> correctly. When B&#39;s timer fires, <code>sched_schedule()</code> picks C, sets <code>current_process = C</code>, switches. Eventually A&#39;s saved <code>context_switch_asm</code> return point executes: <code>current_process = old (A); A-&gt;state = RUNNING</code>. This correctly restores A&#39;s identity as the currently running process.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"48-sched_yieldvoid-void\">4.8 <code>sched_yield(void) → void</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Force an immediate context switch without waiting for the timer slice to expire.

Hardware Soul Analysis</h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-stack-pivot-one-instruction-that-changes-everything\">The Stack Pivot — One Instruction That Changes Everything</h3>\n<p><code>mov esp, ecx</code> in <code>context_switch_asm</code> is the single instruction that transitions between processes. Before it: every stack operation goes to the current process&#39;s kernel stack. After it: every stack operation goes to the next process&#39;s kernel stack. The instruction is not atomic in the OS sense — it is a single memory write (ESP is a register; the write is to the register file, not RAM). But the x86 pipeline sees it as a register write that takes effect immediately for all subsequent <code>[esp+N]</code> addressing.</p>\n<p><strong>TLB implications of the stack pivot:</strong> The new ESP points into a different physical page (the next process&#39;s <code>kernel_stack[]</code>). If that page&#39;s translation is not in the TLB, the first stack access after the pivot (the <code>ret</code> instruction, which pops <code>[esp+0]</code>) generates a TLB miss → page table walk (~30–50 cycles). Since kernel stacks are in the identity-mapped first 4MB region (physical <code>0x100000</code>–<code>0x1FFFFF</code>), their PTEs are in <code>identity_page_table</code> which is hot in L2 cache (it is accessed frequently for all kernel code accesses). TLB miss latency for kernel stack pages: ~10–15 cycles (L2 hit for page table walk), not 50–100 cycles (DRAM).</p>\n<h3 id=\"tssesp0-read-timing-hardware-imposed-ordering\">TSS.ESP0 Read Timing — Hardware-Imposed Ordering</h3>\n<p>When the CPU processes an interrupt while in ring 3, it reads <code>esp0</code> from the TSS before pushing any values onto the kernel stack. The sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CPU finishes current instruction (ring 3 code).</li>\n<li>CPU detects <code>INTR</code> high.</li>\n<li>CPU checks DPL, privilege transition needed (CPL=3 → IDT gate DPL=0).</li>\n<li>CPU <strong>reads <code>esp0</code> from TSS</strong> (physical address of <code>kernel_tss.esp0</code>).</li>\n<li>CPU switches to kernel stack: <code>SS:ESP = SS0:ESP0</code> from TSS.</li>\n<li>CPU pushes <code>SS_user, ESP_user, EFLAGS, CS_user, EIP_user</code> onto kernel stack.</li>\n<li>CPU jumps to IDT handler.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 4 reads <code>kernel_tss.esp0</code> from main memory (or cache). This means <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> must complete its write to <code>kernel_tss.esp0</code> <strong>before</strong> any ring-3 code runs on the new process. The write is a simple store; on x86 with Total Store Order, stores are visible to all subsequent loads in program order. Since <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> is called with IF=0 (we are in the scheduler, which runs with IF=0 from the timer IRQ), no interrupt can fire between the write and the context switch. The ordering is guaranteed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cache-behavior-of-the-process-table\">Cache Behavior of the Process Table</h3>\n<p><code>process_table[16]</code> is 66,432 bytes ≈ 64.875 KB. A typical L1 data cache is 32KB; L2 is 256KB–512KB. The entire process table fits in L2. After the first few scheduling cycles, the L2 is warm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The scheduler reads <code>process_table[i].state</code> for each slot in the round-robin loop — 16 reads of 1 byte each, from 16 different cache lines (each PCB is 4152 bytes, spanning ~65 cache lines; but the <code>state</code> field is in the first cache line at offset 36). After warming: 16 L2 hits at ~5ns each = 80ns for the full round-robin search. Cold (DRAM): 16 × 60ns = 960ns.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The kernel stack for each process is 4KB. On a context switch, the <code>popa</code> instruction reads 32 bytes from the new stack. If the stack is cold (last used 50ms ago — 100M cycles at 2GHz), the 32 bytes span at most 2 cache lines, triggering 2 DRAM accesses at 60ns each = 120ns.

Concurrency Specification</h2>\n<p><strong>Model:</strong> Single-core. Preemptive interrupts only (no threads, no SMP). The timer IRQ (IF=0, interrupt gate) is the only concurrency mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical section analysis:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><code>sched_schedule()</code> — called with IF=0:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The timer IRQ handler runs with IF=0 (interrupt gate). Therefore <code>sched_timer_irq()</code> and everything it calls (including <code>sched_schedule()</code> and <code>context_switch_asm()</code>) runs with IF=0. No reentrant interrupt can fire.</li>\n<li><code>sched_yield()</code> explicitly calls <code>cli</code> before <code>sched_schedule()</code>. The <code>sti</code> after is optional since <code>iret</code> restores EFLAGS anyway.</li>\n<li><strong>Invariant:</strong> <code>current_process</code>, <code>process_table[i].state</code>, <code>kernel_tss.esp0</code> — all modified only while IF=0. Consistent view guaranteed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><code>process_create_kernel/user()</code> — called with IF=1 (from <code>kmain</code> before <code>sti</code>):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All process creation happens before <code>sti</code> in <code>kmain</code>. After <code>sti</code>, no new process is created in this module. <strong>If</strong> <code>process_create_*</code> were called after <code>sti</code>, a timer IRQ could fire during process table modification. The critical window: between finding an UNUSED slot and setting <code>state = PROCESS_READY</code>. If IRQ fires mid-creation with the slot partially initialized, <code>sched_schedule()</code> might try to schedule it. Prevention: set <code>state = PROCESS_READY</code> as the <strong>last</strong> write, after all other fields are initialized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><code>current_process</code> visibility:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written by <code>sched_schedule()</code> (IF=0).</li>\n<li>Read by <code>sched_timer_irq()</code>, <code>sys_exit_impl()</code>, <code>sys_write_impl()</code>, all process functions that call <code>kprintf(&quot;[PID %u]&quot;, current_process-&gt;pid)</code>.</li>\n<li>On a single-core with IF=0 during scheduler, reads by kernel handlers are always from the correct value (no race). Reads by process functions (IF=1) see the value set by the last context switch — always correct since single-core.</li>\n<li><strong>No locking required</strong> for <code>current_process</code> reads in this module.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><code>pit_tick_count</code> — retained from mod-2:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written by <code>sched_timer_irq()</code> (IF=0).</li>\n<li>Read by <code>kmain</code> idle loop (IF=1).</li>\n<li>Same analysis as mod-2: <code>volatile</code> prevents compiler caching; single-core guarantees no torn read of 64-bit value matters (reads are rare and for informational display only).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><code>kernel_tss.esp0</code> — write ordering:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Written by <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> (IF=0, within <code>sched_schedule()</code>).</li>\n<li>Read by CPU hardware on ring-3→ring-0 transition.</li>\n<li>x86 TSO (Total Store Order) guarantees: the store to <code>esp0</code> completes (becomes globally visible) before the CPU processes any subsequent interrupt. Since <code>tss_set_kernel_stack()</code> runs with IF=0, no ring-3 interrupt can occur before the store completes. The next ring-3 interrupt (after <code>iret</code> restores EFLAGS with IF=1) will always see the updated <code>esp0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>VGA concurrent access from multiple processes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three demo processes write to non-overlapping VGA rows (row 2, 12, 22). No shared state.</li>\n<li>They share the physical <code>0xB8000</code> MMIO region, but writes to non-overlapping addresses produce correct results even without synchronization (x86 MMIO writes are ordered per address).</li>\n<li>The <code>vga_putchar()</code> function maintains a cursor (shared mutable state). Demo processes do <strong>not</strong> use <code>vga_putchar()</code>; they write directly to <code>VGA_BASE[row * 80 + col]</code> via computed indices. This avoids the shared cursor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>User process isolation — hardware-enforced:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each user process has its own page directory (loaded as CR3 on switch). Kernel pages in user page directories have U/S=0. A user process cannot read or write kernel memory: the MMU enforces this at the hardware level, independent of software locking.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"13-synced-criteria\">13.

You will write the bootloader that fits in 512 bytes, configure the x86 segmentation and paging hardware, wire up the programmable interrupt controller, and implement a context-switching scheduler in assembly. Every abstraction that higher-level programmers take for granted — malloc, printf, threads, file descriptors — is absent here. You build the foundation those abstractions stand on.\n\nThe project is structured as four milestones that mirror the historical evolution of OS design: bootstrap and protected mode, interrupt infrastructure, memory management, and process scheduling. Each milestone reveals a hardware constraint that software must negotiate: the CPU's privilege ring model, the TLB's stale-translation problem, the PIC's vector-collision hazard, and the TSS's role in safe ring transitions. Skipping any of these reveals results in triple faults, silent memory corruption, or security holes.\n\nBy the end, you will have a mental model precise enough to read Linux kernel source code, understand hypervisor design, and reason about why system calls have the latency they do. The OS you build is simple; the conceptual leverage it provides is enormous.\n\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m1 -->\n# Milestone 1: Bootloader, GDT, and Kernel Entry\n\n## The Revelation: Your CPU Boots Into 1978\n\nHere is what every developer who has only written userspace code believes about program startup: memory is zeroed, a stack exists, you are running 32-bit or 64-bit code, and the operating system hands your program a clean environment. This belief is correct — for every program that runs *after* an OS exists. You are about to write the program that runs *before* any of that is true.\n\nWhen you press the power button, the CPU starts executing at physical address `0xFFFFFFF0` — a location in firmware ROM. No OS. No libc. No stack you chose. The processor is in **16-bit real mode**, a compatibility mode that mimics the Intel 8086 from 1978. The entire addressable universe is 1 megabyte. Memory protection does not exist. Any code can overwrite any other code. The interrupt table is a legacy structure called the IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) that assumes real-mode segment arithmetic, and if you enable interrupts while in the middle of switching to protected mode, you will immediately triple-fault with zero diagnostic information.\n\nThis is not a historical curiosity. It is the actual hardware state of every x86 machine at power-on, including the server running your cloud VM right now. The firmware runs its POST (Power-On Self-Test), finds a bootable disk, loads the first 512 bytes into memory at physical address `0x7C00`, and jumps there. Those 512 bytes are yours. That is where this milestone begins.\n\n\n![x86 Boot Sequence: BIOS to Kernel main()](./diagrams/diag-m1-boot-sequence.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 1: Real Mode — The Ground You Stand On\n\nBefore you can escape real mode, you need to understand what it actually is and why it exists.\n\n**Real mode addressing** works like this: the CPU has 16-bit registers but needs to address up to 1MB (20 bits of address space). Intel solved this in 1978 by combining a **segment register** with an **offset register**: `physical address = segment × 16 + offset`. So if `CS = 0x07C0` and `IP = 0x0000`, the physical address is `0x07C00` — the MBR load address.\n\n\n![Real Mode vs Protected Mode: Address Translation Comparison](./diagrams/diag-m1-real-to-protected-mode.svg)\n\n\nThis segmentation model was the original address space mechanism. `CS` (Code Segment), `DS` (Data Segment), and `SS` (Stack Segment) are hardware-enforced boundaries in the sense that all code fetches go through `CS`, all stack operations go through `SS`, and all data accesses go through `DS`. Early DOS programs that corrupted each other's memory were abusing the fact that nothing prevented one segment from overlapping another — the hardware enforced *which register was used*, not *what value it contained*. Protected mode, as you will see, changes the semantics of these registers entirely.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** In real mode, every memory access is a segment-register lookup plus an offset. The TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer — the CPU's cache of address translations) does not exist yet in any meaningful sense. Every address calculation is a simple shift-and-add in hardware, costing approximately zero cycles but providing zero protection.\n\nThe BIOS, which loaded your 512-byte MBR at `0x7C00`, leaves you the following state:\n- `DL` register contains the boot drive number (you need this to read more sectors from disk)\n- Interrupts are enabled (BIOS IVT is active)\n- The A20 line (a hardware address line that enables access above 1MB) may or may not be enabled depending on firmware vintage\n- You are in 16-bit real mode\n\nEverything else — the stack pointer, direction of memory layout, which registers contain meaningful values — is undefined. Your bootloader must establish all of it.\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: The MBR Constraint and Two-Stage Bootloaders\n\n512 bytes sounds like a lot until you realize what you need to fit inside it:\n\n- Stack setup\n- A20 line enablement code\n- Disk read code (BIOS INT 13h)\n- GDT descriptor table and its load instruction\n- Protected mode switch\n- Jump to 32-bit kernel code\n\nThis is impossible in a single stage. Real bootloaders solve this with a **two-stage approach**: Stage 1 (512 bytes, in the MBR) does the minimum needed to load Stage 2 from disk. Stage 2 (a few kilobytes, unconstrained) does everything else: enables A20, reads the actual kernel binary, configures the GDT, and enters protected mode.\n\n\n![MBR and Disk Layout for Two-Stage Bootloader](./diagrams/diag-m1-mbr-disk-layout.svg)\n\n\n**The 512-byte signature:** The BIOS validates your MBR by checking that bytes 510-511 contain `0x55 0xAA` (called the boot signature). If these bytes are missing or wrong, the BIOS refuses to boot from that disk. This is enforced in firmware hardware; there is no workaround. Your linker script or assembler must pad to exactly 512 bytes and place the signature correctly.\n\n```nasm\n; End of boot sector (NASM syntax)\ntimes 510 - ($ - $$) db 0    ; Pad to 510 bytes\ndw 0xAA55                     ; Boot signature (little-endian: 0x55, 0xAA)\n```\n\n> **Why `0x55 0xAA` little-endian?** When stored as a 16-bit word on a little-endian CPU, `0xAA55` stores byte `0x55` first and byte `0xAA` second in memory. The BIOS checks bytes 510 and 511 for `0x55` and `0xAA` respectively. NASM's `dw` directive uses little-endian storage, so `dw 0xAA55` produces exactly `0x55, 0xAA` in memory. This is the first time byte order matters to you; it will not be the last.\n\n---\n\n## Section 3: Loading the Kernel from Disk — BIOS INT 13h\n\nWith Stage 1 running at `0x7C00`, its entire job is to load Stage 2 from disk into memory at a known address and jump to it. The only tool available for disk I/O in real mode is **BIOS INT 13h**, a software interrupt that asks the firmware to perform a disk read on your behalf.\n\n> **Software interrupt:** Unlike hardware interrupts (signals from devices), a software interrupt is triggered by the `int` instruction. It looks up a handler in the IVT (using the interrupt number as an index), saves the CPU state, and jumps to firmware code that talks to the disk controller. After the firmware finishes, it executes `iret` (Interrupt Return) and your code resumes.\n\nThe INT 13h function `0x02` reads sectors using **CHS addressing** (Cylinder-Head-Sector — a legacy coordinate system for disk geometry). For simplicity, GRUB and modern bootloaders use the **LBA extension** (INT 13h `0x42`, which uses logical block addresses starting from 0). For a learning OS, CHS is fine since you are always reading sectors near the start of the disk.\n\n```nasm\n; BIOS INT 13h: Read sectors (function 0x02)\n; Reads 'count' sectors starting at CHS (cylinder=0, head=0, sector=2)\n; into ES:BX (segment:offset address in real mode)\nmov ah, 0x02          ; Function: read sectors\nmov al, 15            ; Number of sectors to read (15 × 512 = 7680 bytes for stage2)\nmov ch, 0             ; Cylinder 0\nmov cl, 2             ; Sector 2 (sector 1 is the MBR, sectors are 1-indexed in CHS)\nmov dh, 0             ; Head 0\n; DL already contains the boot drive number from BIOS\nmov bx, 0x7E00        ; Load destination: immediately after MBR in memory\nint 0x13              ; Call BIOS disk service\njc disk_error         ; Carry flag set = error; halt or retry\n```\n\nAfter Stage 1 loads Stage 2, it executes a `jmp 0x7E00` (or wherever Stage 2 was loaded). Stage 2 now has kilobytes of space to work with.\n\nStage 2's job, in order:\n1. Enable the A20 line (allows addressing above 1MB)\n2. Load the actual kernel binary from disk into memory at `0x100000` (1MB)\n3. Configure and load the GDT\n4. Enter protected mode\n5. Jump to the 32-bit kernel entry point\n\nThe kernel loading step uses the same INT 13h mechanism, but now reading many more sectors (the entire kernel binary). The kernel is loaded to physical address `0x100000` — above the first megabyte — because the memory below 1MB is cluttered with BIOS data structures, video memory, and the bootloader itself.\n\n> **A20 line:** A historical accident. On the original IBM PC, the 8086 had only 20 address lines (A0–A19). Memory wraparound from `0xFFFFF + 1` back to `0x00000` was a *feature* that some DOS programs depended on. When the 286 added a 21st address line (A20), IBM added a gate controlled by the keyboard controller to disable it for compatibility. Your bootloader must explicitly enable it. The most portable method is via the BIOS (INT 15h, AX=2401h). On modern hardware/VMs, A20 is often already enabled; on real hardware, skipping this check causes bizarre memory access failures above 1MB.\n\n\n![x86 Boot Sequence: BIOS to Kernel main()](./diagrams/diag-m1-boot-sequence.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 4: The GDT — Hardware You Talk To, Not a Data Structure You Design\n\nHere is the conceptual shift that trips up every systems programmer coming from userspace: the **GDT (Global Descriptor Table)** is not a software abstraction. It is a hardware register — the `GDTR` — that the CPU reads on every segment register load after protected mode is active. Misconfigure one byte of an access field, and the CPU triple-faults the instant you try to use that segment. There is no error message. There is no stack trace. The machine reboots.\n\n> **Triple fault:** When the CPU encounters a fault (like a General Protection Fault from a bad segment), it tries to invoke the fault handler. If that invocation itself causes a fault (double fault), it tries to invoke the double-fault handler. If *that* causes a fault, the CPU has no more recovery options and performs a hard reset. This is a triple fault. In QEMU, it causes an immediate restart. On real hardware, you see a reboot. Triple faults during protected mode setup are the most common failure mode for new OS developers.\n\nIn protected mode, segment registers (`CS`, `DS`, `SS`, etc.) no longer contain base addresses directly. Instead, they contain **segment selectors** — 16-bit values that are indices into the GDT. When you load a value into `CS`, the CPU looks up the corresponding GDT entry and reads the base address, limit, and access rights from it. The hardware enforces those rights on every memory access.\n\n\n![GDT Descriptor Binary Layout](./diagrams/diag-m1-gdt-layout.svg)\n\n\n### The GDT Descriptor — Byte by Byte\n\nEach GDT entry is exactly 8 bytes. The layout is famously non-contiguous because Intel extended the 286-era descriptor format in the 386 without breaking backward compatibility, splitting the limit and base fields across non-adjacent bytes:\n\n```\nByte 7    Byte 6    Byte 5    Byte 4    Byte 3    Byte 2    Byte 1    Byte 0\n┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐\n│ Base    │Flags+   │ Access  │ Base    │    Base [23:0]   │   Limit [15:0]  │\n│ [31:24] │Limit    │  Byte   │ [23:16] │                  │                 │\n│         │[19:16]  │         │         │                  │                 │\n└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘\n```\n\n- **Limit [19:0]**: Maximum addressable unit. With the 4KB granularity flag set (`G=1`), a limit of `0xFFFFF` means `0xFFFFF × 4096 = 4GB - 4096`. That is effectively a 4GB segment — the **flat memory model** that modern 32-bit code assumes.\n- **Base [31:0]**: Where the segment starts in physical memory. For a flat model, all segments have `base = 0`.\n- **Access byte**: The most critical field. Contains the DPL (Descriptor Privilege Level — ring 0 or ring 3), the segment type (code or data), and the present bit.\n\n```\nAccess Byte (bit 7 to bit 0):\n┌───┬────┬───┬───────────┬───┐\n│ P │ DPL│ S │   Type    │ A │\n│(1)│(2b)│(1)│  (4 bits) │(1)│\n└───┴────┴───┴───────────┴───┘\nP   = Present (must be 1 for valid descriptor)\nDPL = Descriptor Privilege Level (00=ring 0, 11=ring 3)\nS   = Descriptor type (1=code/data, 0=system)\nType= For code: bit3=executable, bit1=readable\n      For data: bit3=0, bit1=writable\nA   = Accessed (CPU sets this; initialize to 0)\n```\n\nYour kernel needs exactly **5 GDT entries** (entries are indexed from 0):\n\n| Index | Selector | Description | DPL | Base | Limit | Access |\n|-------|----------|-------------|-----|------|-------|--------|\n| 0 | `0x00` | **Null descriptor** (required by spec) | — | 0 | 0 | `0x00` |\n| 1 | `0x08` | Kernel code | 0 | 0 | 4GB | `0x9A` |\n| 2 | `0x10` | Kernel data | 0 | 0 | 4GB | `0x92` |\n| 3 | `0x18` | User code | 3 | 0 | 4GB | `0xFA` |\n| 4 | `0x20` | User data | 3 | 0 | 4GB | `0xF2` |\n\n> **Why is a null descriptor required?** The CPU specification reserves GDT entry 0 as invalid. Any attempt to load a segment register with selector `0x00` causes a General Protection Fault. This is the hardware's way of catching uninitialized segment register bugs — if you forget to set `DS` before using data memory, the null descriptor immediately signals the error.\n\n> **Selector arithmetic:** A segment selector is a 16-bit value. Bits [15:3] are the GDT index. Bits [2:2] select GDT vs LDT (Local Descriptor Table — not used here). Bits [1:0] are the **RPL** (Requested Privilege Level). Kernel code selector: index 1, GDT, RPL 0 → `(1 << 3) | 0 = 0x08`. User code selector: index 3, GDT, RPL 3 → `(3 << 3) | 3 = 0x1B`. Note the user selectors have RPL=3 in the low bits, distinguishing them from kernel selectors at the hardware level.\n\n```nasm\n; GDT in NASM syntax\ngdt_start:\n    ; Entry 0: Null descriptor (required)\n    dq 0\n\n    ; Entry 1: Kernel code (ring 0)\n    ; Base=0, Limit=0xFFFFF, 4KB granularity, 32-bit, executable+readable\n    dw 0xFFFF       ; Limit [15:0]\n    dw 0x0000       ; Base [15:0]\n    db 0x00         ; Base [23:16]\n    db 0x9A         ; Access: present, ring 0, code, executable, readable\n    db 0xCF         ; Flags (4KB gran, 32-bit) + Limit [19:16] = 0xF\n    db 0x00         ; Base [31:24]\n\n    ; Entry 2: Kernel data (ring 0)\n    dw 0xFFFF\n    dw 0x0000\n    db 0x00\n    db 0x92         ; Access: present, ring 0, data, writable\n    db 0xCF\n    db 0x00\n\n    ; Entry 3: User code (ring 3)\n    dw 0xFFFF\n    dw 0x0000\n    db 0x00\n    db 0xFA         ; Access: present, ring 3, code, executable, readable\n    db 0xCF\n    db 0x00\n\n    ; Entry 4: User data (ring 3)\n    dw 0xFFFF\n    dw 0x0000\n    db 0x00\n    db 0xF2         ; Access: present, ring 3, data, writable\n    db 0xCF\n    db 0x00\ngdt_end:\n\n; GDTR — the value loaded into the hardware GDTR register\ngdt_descriptor:\n    dw gdt_end - gdt_start - 1   ; Limit: size in bytes minus 1\n    dd gdt_start                  ; Base: physical address of GDT\n```\n\nThe access byte values — `0x9A`, `0x92`, `0xFA`, `0xF2` — are the most error-prone part. One wrong bit (forgetting the present bit `P=1`, or setting the wrong DPL) causes an immediate triple fault. Build a function or macro that constructs descriptors from named fields, not magic numbers, once you are writing the C-level kernel.\n\n---\n\n## Section 5: The Protected Mode Transition — Four Precise Steps\n\nThe transition from real mode to protected mode is a choreographed sequence. The CPU does not know you are about to switch; it is simply executing instructions. You must ensure that the transition is instantaneous from the CPU's perspective — no interrupt can fire in the middle of it.\n\n\n![Real Mode vs Protected Mode: Address Translation Comparison](./diagrams/diag-m1-real-to-protected-mode.svg)\n\n\n**Step 1: Disable interrupts**\n\n```nasm\ncli     ; Clear Interrupt Flag — hardware interrupts are now masked\n```\n\nThis is non-negotiable. The BIOS IVT (Interrupt Vector Table) is a real-mode structure at physical address `0x0000`. If a hardware interrupt fires after you have loaded the GDTR but before you have set up an IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) for protected mode, the CPU will try to handle it using the IVT — which contains real-mode addresses that are meaningless as protected-mode gate descriptors. The result is an immediate triple fault.\n\n**Step 2: Load the GDTR**\n\n```nasm\nlgdt [gdt_descriptor]   ; Load the GDT register with base address and size\n```\n\n`lgdt` loads the 6-byte GDTR register: a 16-bit limit (size - 1) and a 32-bit base address pointing to your GDT. After this instruction, the CPU knows where your GDT lives, but it is not yet *using* it — you are still in real mode.\n\n**Step 3: Set CR0.PE (Protection Enable)**\n\n```nasm\nmov eax, cr0\nor eax, 1        ; Set bit 0: Protection Enable\nmov cr0, eax\n```\n\n`CR0` is a **control register** — a special-purpose CPU register that controls fundamental processor behavior. Setting bit 0 (`PE = Protection Enable`) switches the CPU from real mode to protected mode. This change is immediate and atomic. The CPU is now in protected mode, but `CS` still contains the old real-mode value. This is a brief inconsistent state that must be resolved immediately.\n\n**Step 4: Far jump to flush the pipeline**\n\n```nasm\njmp 0x08:protected_mode_entry   ; Far jump: segment selector 0x08 (kernel code), offset = label\n```\n\nA **far jump** (`jmp segment:offset`) explicitly loads a new value into `CS`. This does two critical things simultaneously:\n1. It loads `CS` with `0x08` — the kernel code segment selector — causing the CPU to look up GDT entry 1 and use its base/limit/flags for all subsequent code fetches.\n2. It **flushes the instruction pipeline**. Modern CPUs prefetch and decode instructions ahead of the current instruction pointer. Some of those prefetched instructions were decoded under real-mode assumptions. The far jump forces the pipeline to discard all prefetched instructions and restart fetching from the new address under protected-mode rules.\n\nWithout this far jump, the pipeline might execute a few real-mode-decoded instructions in protected mode — undefined behavior that manifests as random corruption.\n\n**After the far jump — loading data segment registers:**\n\n```nasm\nprotected_mode_entry:\n    mov ax, 0x10     ; Kernel data segment selector (GDT entry 2)\n    mov ds, ax\n    mov es, ax\n    mov fs, ax\n    mov gs, ax\n    mov ss, ax\n    mov esp, KERNEL_STACK_TOP   ; Set up a stack\n```\n\n`CS` is loaded by the far jump. Every other segment register (`DS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`, `SS`) must be explicitly loaded with the kernel data selector. Until you do this, they still contain real-mode segment values that the CPU will now misinterpret as protected-mode selectors — likely pointing to the null descriptor or garbage, causing a GPF on the first memory access.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The far jump costs approximately 20-30 cycles on modern CPUs due to pipeline flush and branch target prediction miss — but this happens exactly once at boot. The TLB is irrelevant here (paging is not enabled yet). The critical timing constraint is that `cli` → `lgdt` → `CR0.PE` → `jmp` must be a contiguous sequence with no interrupts possible between them.\n\n---\n\n## Section 6: The Linker Script — Virtual vs Physical Addresses\n\nYou are about to confront one of the most fundamental concepts in systems programming: **the kernel's linked virtual address and its physical load address are different things**.\n\nThe bootloader loaded your kernel binary to physical address `0x100000` (1MB). But your C code, compiled to run at a different address (say, `0x100000` for now, or `0xC0100000` for a higher-half kernel), has all its symbol addresses embedded by the linker. If the linker placed `main` at virtual address `0xC0100000` but the CPU is fetching instructions from physical address `0x100000`, every function call, every global variable access, every constant's address is wrong.\n\n\n![diag-m1-linker-script-memory-map](./diagrams/diag-m1-linker-script-memory-map.svg)\n\n\nFor this milestone, we use the **identity-mapped** approach: the kernel is linked *and* loaded at `0x100000`. Virtual address = physical address. This sidesteps the complexity of higher-half mapping (which requires paging, covered in Milestone 3). Your linker script:\n\n```ld\n/* kernel.ld — simple identity-mapped kernel */\nENTRY(kernel_entry)      /* Symbol name of the first function to call */\n\nSECTIONS {\n    . = 0x100000;        /* Start placing sections at 1MB physical/virtual */\n\n    .text : {\n        *(.text)         /* All code from all object files */\n    }\n\n    .rodata : {\n        *(.rodata)       /* Read-only data: string literals, const arrays */\n    }\n\n    .data : {\n        *(.data)         /* Initialized globals */\n    }\n\n    .bss : {\n        __bss_start = .;          /* Symbol marking start of BSS */\n        *(.bss)                   /* Uninitialized globals */\n        *(COMMON)                 /* Tentative definitions (C commons) */\n        __bss_end = .;            /* Symbol marking end of BSS */\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> **What is BSS?** The `.bss` section (Block Started by Symbol — a name from 1950s assembly) contains uninitialized global variables. In an ELF binary, BSS consumes no space on disk — the file just records \"there are N bytes of zeros starting here.\" Your libc normally zeros BSS before `main()` runs. In a freestanding kernel, *no one* zeros BSS — that is your job. If you skip this, global variables that the C standard guarantees are zero start as whatever bytes happened to be in RAM.\n\nThe kernel C entry point, written in assembly (to control the stack before calling C):\n\n```nasm\n; kernel_entry.asm — first 32-bit code after protected mode switch\n[bits 32]\n[extern kmain]\n[extern __bss_start]\n[extern __bss_end]\n\nkernel_entry:\n    ; Zero the BSS section\n    mov edi, __bss_start\n    mov ecx, __bss_end\n    sub ecx, edi          ; ECX = number of bytes to zero\n    xor eax, eax          ; EAX = 0\n    rep stosd             ; Store EAX to [EDI], increment EDI, decrement ECX; repeat\n\n    ; Set up the stack (grows downward, so top of reserved region)\n    mov esp, kernel_stack_top\n\n    ; Call the C kernel main\n    call kmain\n\n    ; If kmain ever returns, halt the CPU\n    cli\n    hlt\n```\n\n`rep stosd` is an x86 string instruction: it stores the value in `EAX` to the memory address in `EDI`, increments `EDI` by 4, decrements `ECX` by 1, and repeats until `ECX` reaches 0. This zeros BSS four bytes at a time. Note: `sub ecx, edi` gives the byte count; `rep stosd` decrements by 1 per iteration but advances by 4 bytes — if BSS size is not a multiple of 4, use `rep stosb` instead.\n\n---\n\n## Section 7: The VGA Text Mode Driver — Memory-Mapped I/O\n\nAt physical address `0xB8000`, the hardware places a 2D array of character cells. Writing bytes there makes them appear on screen immediately — no syscall, no driver stack, no DMA. This is **memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)**: the CPU's memory bus is wired so that certain physical address ranges do not connect to RAM but to device registers.\n\n\n![diag-m1-vga-buffer-layout](./diagrams/diag-m1-vga-buffer-layout.svg)\n\n\nThe VGA text buffer is 80 columns × 25 rows = 2000 cells. Each cell is **2 bytes**: the ASCII character code and an attribute byte controlling color.\n\n```\nCell layout (2 bytes):\n┌───────────────────┬───────────────────┐\n│  Character (byte 0) │  Attribute (byte 1) │\n│  ASCII code 0-255   │  Background | Fore  │\n│                     │  [7:4]      | [3:0]  │\n└───────────────────┴───────────────────┘\n\nAttribute byte:\nBits [3:0] = Foreground color (0-15)\nBits [6:4] = Background color (0-7)\nBit  [7]   = Blink enable (or bright background)\n\nColor values:\n0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Green, 3=Cyan, 4=Red, 5=Magenta, 6=Brown, 7=Light Gray\n8=Dark Gray, 9=Light Blue, A=Light Green, B=Light Cyan, C=Light Red, D=Light Magenta, E=Yellow, F=White\n```\n\n```c\n/* vga.c — minimal VGA text mode driver */\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n#define VGA_BASE  ((volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000)\n#define VGA_COLS  80\n#define VGA_ROWS  25\n\nstatic int cursor_row = 0;\nstatic int cursor_col = 0;\n\n/* Encode character + attribute into a 16-bit VGA cell */\nstatic inline uint16_t vga_entry(char c, uint8_t fg, uint8_t bg) {\n    return (uint16_t)c | ((uint16_t)((bg << 4) | fg) << 8);\n}\n\nvoid vga_putchar(char c, uint8_t fg, uint8_t bg) {\n    if (c == '\\n') {\n        cursor_col = 0;\n        cursor_row++;\n    } else {\n        VGA_BASE[cursor_row * VGA_COLS + cursor_col] = vga_entry(c, fg, bg);\n        cursor_col++;\n        if (cursor_col >= VGA_COLS) {\n            cursor_col = 0;\n            cursor_row++;\n        }\n    }\n    /* TODO: scroll when cursor_row >= VGA_ROWS */\n}\n```\n\n> **The `volatile` keyword is critical here.** Without `volatile`, the C compiler may observe that you are writing to a memory location but never reading it back, and optimize the writes away as \"dead stores.\" `volatile` tells the compiler: \"this memory access has observable side effects that you cannot see — do not optimize it.\" Every MMIO access must be through `volatile` pointers.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** Writing to `0xB8000` does not cost a cache miss in the L1/L2/L3 sense — MMIO regions are typically mapped as uncacheable by the memory type range registers (MTRRs) in the CPU. Every write goes directly to the device. This makes MMIO writes slower than RAM writes (hundreds of nanoseconds vs tens), but it guarantees the device sees the update immediately. For a terminal driver, this is irrelevant; for high-bandwidth MMIO (like GPU framebuffers), it matters enormously.\n\n---\n\n## Section 8: The Serial Port Debug Driver — A Lifeline\n\nVGA output is visible on the screen, but it cannot be logged, captured, or piped to a file. The **serial port (UART — Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** — specifically COM1 at I/O port `0x3F8` — is your debug lifeline. QEMU can map the serial port to stdout with `-serial stdio`, meaning every byte your kernel writes to COM1 appears in your terminal. When your kernel triple-faults before VGA is initialized, the last serial output tells you where it died.\n\nUnlike MMIO (which uses regular memory read/write instructions), serial port communication uses **port-mapped I/O** — the `in` and `out` instructions, which address a separate 16-bit I/O address space distinct from the memory address space. In C (freestanding, no stdlib), you access port I/O via inline assembly:\n\n```c\n/* io.h — port I/O primitives */\nstatic inline void outb(uint16_t port, uint8_t value) {\n    __asm__ volatile (\"outb %0, %1\" : : \"a\"(value), \"Nd\"(port));\n}\n\nstatic inline uint8_t inb(uint16_t port) {\n    uint8_t value;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"inb %1, %0\" : \"=a\"(value) : \"Nd\"(port));\n    return value;\n}\n```\n\nThe 16550 UART (the chip behind COM1) is initialized by configuring eight registers via port I/O. The most critical settings: baud rate divisor, 8N1 framing (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), and FIFO enablement.\n\n```c\n/* serial.c — COM1 initialization */\n#define COM1_BASE 0x3F8\n\nvoid serial_init(void) {\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 1, 0x00);  // Disable interrupts\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 3, 0x80);  // Enable DLAB (Divisor Latch Access Bit)\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 0, 0x03);  // Divisor low byte: 3 → 38400 baud\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 1, 0x00);  // Divisor high byte\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 3, 0x03);  // 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit; clear DLAB\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 2, 0xC7);  // Enable FIFO, clear, 14-byte threshold\n    outb(COM1_BASE + 4, 0x0B);  // IRQs enabled, RTS/DSR set\n}\n\nvoid serial_putchar(char c) {\n    /* Wait until transmitter holding register is empty */\n    while ((inb(COM1_BASE + 5) & 0x20) == 0);\n    outb(COM1_BASE, c);\n}\n```\n\n> **Why busy-wait here?** The UART has a small transmit buffer. Before sending a byte, you poll the Line Status Register (offset +5) until bit 5 (Transmitter Holding Register Empty — THRE) is set. This is a **busy-wait (spin loop)** — the CPU does nothing useful while waiting. In a production kernel, you would use interrupts and a transmit queue. At boot time, before interrupts are configured, busy-waiting is the only option. Every character costs approximately 260 microseconds at 38400 baud (1 / 38400 baud × 10 bits per character ≈ 260μs). For debug output, this is acceptable.\n\nCombining both outputs into a `kprintf`-style function:\n\n```c\n/* kprintf — simplified: formats and writes to both VGA and serial */\nvoid kputchar(char c) {\n    vga_putchar(c, VGA_COLOR_WHITE, VGA_COLOR_BLACK);\n    serial_putchar(c);\n    if (c == '\\n') serial_putchar('\\r');  /* Serial terminals need CR+LF */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Section 9: The Complete Boot Sequence in One View\n\nLet us trace exactly what happens from power-on to your kernel's `kmain()` function executing:\n\n1. **CPU resets** → starts at `0xFFFFFFF0` (firmware ROM) in real mode\n2. **Firmware POST** → memory test, device enumeration, boot device selection\n3. **Firmware loads MBR** → reads 512 bytes from disk to `0x7C00`, verifies `0x55 0xAA`, jumps to `0x7C00`\n4. **Stage 1 runs** at `0x7C00` → uses INT 13h to load Stage 2 from disk to `0x7E00`, jumps to `0x7E00`\n5. **Stage 2 runs** at `0x7E00`:\n   - Enables A20 line\n   - Loads kernel binary from disk to `0x100000` using INT 13h\n   - Loads GDTR with `lgdt`\n   - Disables interrupts with `cli`\n   - Sets `CR0.PE = 1`\n   - Far jumps to `0x08:protected_mode_32bit`\n6. **32-bit protected mode** begins:\n   - Loads `DS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`, `SS` with kernel data selector `0x10`\n   - Sets `ESP` to kernel stack top\n   - Zeros BSS from `__bss_start` to `__bss_end`\n   - Calls `kmain()`\n7. **`kmain()`** runs:\n   - Calls `serial_init()` — COM1 is now available for debug output\n   - Calls `vga_clear()` — clears VGA buffer\n   - Calls `kprintf(\"Kernel booted successfully!\\n\")` — visible on screen and serial console\n\n\n![x86 Boot Sequence: BIOS to Kernel main()](./diagrams/diag-m1-boot-sequence.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 10: Debugging in QEMU\n\nQEMU is your primary development environment. Three essential invocations:\n\n```bash\n# Basic boot with serial output to terminal\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio\n\n# With GDB stub (allows attaching a debugger)\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio \\\n    -s -S     # -s: GDB on port 1234; -S: pause at startup\n\n# In a separate terminal, attach GDB:\ngdb kernel.elf\n(gdb) target remote :1234\n(gdb) break kmain\n(gdb) continue\n```\n\nThe most important debugging technique for this milestone: **if QEMU reboots immediately**, you have a triple fault. Add `-d int` to QEMU's flags to log every interrupt and exception to stderr. The last exception before the reset is your triple fault. Common causes at this stage:\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Triple fault immediately after `CR0.PE` set | GDT access byte wrong; forgot far jump |\n| Triple fault immediately after far jump | Segment registers not loaded with protected-mode selectors |\n| Triple fault in `kmain` | BSS not zeroed; global variable assumed to be 0 but is not; or stack not set up |\n| Black screen but no reboot | VGA write to wrong address; `volatile` missing; cursor position calculation wrong |\n| Serial silent | DLAB not cleared before setting framing; wrong baud divisor |\n\n**The linker step** is where many silent bugs live. Your build command must produce a raw binary at exactly the right addresses:\n\n```bash\n# Compile kernel (freestanding: no stdlib, no default includes, no startup files)\ni686-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -nostdinc \\\n    -fno-builtin -fno-stack-protector \\\n    -c kernel.c -o kernel.o\n\n# Link with explicit linker script\ni686-elf-ld -T kernel.ld -o kernel.elf kernel.o vga.o serial.o\n\n# Extract raw binary (strip ELF headers; bootloader loads the raw kernel)\nobjcopy -O binary kernel.elf kernel.bin\n\n# Verify entry point address\nnm kernel.elf | grep kmain      # Should show address 0x100000 or near\n```\n\n> **Cross-compiler:** The host compiler (`gcc` on your Linux machine) targets the host OS's ABI — it links against the host libc, uses the host calling convention, and may generate instructions not available on your target. For OS development, you must use a **cross-compiler** targeting `i686-elf` (32-bit x86, ELF binary format, no host OS). The OSDev Wiki has a build script. This is one setup step worth doing correctly once.\n\n---\n\n## The Three-Level View: What \"Load a Kernel from Disk\" Really Means\n\n\n![OS Kernel: Full System Atlas](./diagrams/diag-satellite-system-overview.svg)\n\n\n**Level 1 — The Operation:**\nYour bootloader calls INT 13h with `AH=0x02`, specifying a cylinder/head/sector address and a destination buffer. The BIOS returns with the data in memory.\n\n**Level 2 — BIOS and Firmware:**\nINT 13h is a software interrupt that vectors through the IVT to BIOS code in ROM. The BIOS firmware contains drivers for legacy ATA/IDE controllers, floppy disk controllers, and (via INT 13h extensions) USB mass storage and SATA drives emulated as legacy disks. The firmware maintains an internal data structure (the BIOS Data Area at `0x400`) with disk geometry information discovered during POST. The BIOS firmware uses PIO (Programmed I/O) or DMA to transfer sectors from the disk controller's buffer to your specified memory address.\n\n**Level 3 — Hardware:**\nThe disk controller receives an ATA command (for SATA drives in legacy emulation mode: READ SECTORS, LBA28 or CHS addressing). The drive's internal controller reads data from spinning platters (HDD) or NAND flash (SSD), places it in the drive's sector buffer, and signals completion via IRQ14 (primary ATA channel). The BIOS handles the IRQ, copies data from the I/O ports (`0x1F0`-`0x1F7` for primary ATA) into memory using `rep insw` (read string from port), and returns to your code. On a real spinning disk, this read costs 3–10ms of seek time. On a VM using a file-backed disk image, it costs microseconds — the host OS has already cached it.\n\n> This entire chain — INT 13h software interrupt → BIOS firmware → ATA command → disk hardware → memory DMA — is the conceptual ancestor of every I/O abstraction that follows. Linux's block layer, NVMe command queues, and io_uring are all adding buffering, reordering, and concurrency on top of this same physical read.\n\n---\n\n## Pitfalls Reference: The Seven Most Common Triple Faults\n\n| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |\n|---------|----------------|-----|\n| GDT access byte wrong | Magic numbers are easy to misinform; one wrong bit | Build a descriptor macro; cross-check with OSDev wiki table |\n| No far jump after `CR0.PE` | Pipeline has real-mode prefetched instructions | The `jmp 0x08:label` instruction is *mandatory* |\n| Interrupts not disabled | Hardware interrupt fires mid-transition with no IDT | `cli` must precede `lgdt` |\n| A20 not enabled | Kernel loads to `0x100000`; odd addresses wrap to first 64KB | Enable via BIOS INT 15h AX=2401h or I/O port method |\n| BSS not zeroed | Global `int x = 0` has garbage value; logic errors far from cause | `rep stosd` or `rep stosb` from `__bss_start` to `__bss_end` |\n| `volatile` missing on VGA | Compiler eliminates \"dead\" MMIO writes | Every MMIO access via `volatile` pointer |\n| Linker script address mismatch | Kernel linked at `0x200000` but loaded at `0x100000`; all jumps are wrong | Verify with `nm`, `objdump -h`; check load address = link address |\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Cascade — Ten Things This Unlocks\n\nThis milestone introduces foundational mechanisms that reappear everywhere in systems software. Each one below is a direct extension of what you just built.\n\n**1. Linker scripts → shared libraries, ASLR, and PIE binaries**\nThe difference between link-time address and load-time address is exactly how Linux shared libraries work. A `.so` file is compiled as **position-independent code (PIC)** and linked without fixed addresses. The dynamic linker relocates it to wherever in virtual memory is available. **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** randomizes the load address of every binary and library to make buffer overflow exploits harder. You just experienced the root concept: the address the linker embeds and the address the loader uses are separate concerns.\n\n**2. Freestanding environments → embedded firmware, WASM runtimes, UEFI drivers**\nThe discipline you just applied — no libc, no CRT0, explicit BSS zeroing, no floating-point ABI assumptions — is identical to what embedded firmware developers do for microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V) and what WASM runtimes implement as their \"OS-like\" substrate. Every UEFI driver is also a freestanding binary that runs before an OS exists. You now understand why embedded developers care about startup code.\n\n**3. CPU privilege rings → browser process isolation, SGX enclaves, hypervisors**\nReal mode vs protected mode is your first encounter with hardware-enforced privilege boundaries. CPL 0 (ring 0) vs CPL 3 (ring 3) is why a browser tab cannot read your kernel memory — the CPU refuses to execute user-mode code that accesses supervisor-only pages. Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) creates a ring -1 of sorts where even the OS cannot read enclave memory. Hypervisors add a VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) layer below ring 0. All of these extend the same mechanism you just configured.\n\n**4. GDT segment registers → the death of segmentation in 64-bit mode**\nIn 64-bit x86 (long mode), segmentation is almost entirely disabled. `CS`, `DS`, `SS` are ignored for address calculation (base=0 always, limit irrelevant). The GDT still exists (the CPU reads it for privilege level and some system segments), but the flat-memory model you configured is now the *only* model. Understanding why 32-bit protected mode needed segments — and why 64-bit mode abandoned them — is a prerequisite for understanding why ARM64 and RISC-V never added segmentation at all.\n\n**5. BIOS INT 13h → Linux block layer → io_uring**\nThe disk read you just did is the bottom of an abstraction stack that has grown 50 years of complexity. Linux's block layer adds request queuing, elevator scheduling, and merge logic. NVMe command queues allow 65,535 queued commands per queue with zero-copy DMA. io_uring adds a shared ring buffer between kernel and userspace to eliminate syscall overhead entirely. The physical read at the bottom is the same; everything else is batching, reordering, and removing round-trips.\n\n**6. MMIO at 0xB8000 → GPU framebuffers → PCIe BAR mapping**\nWriting to `0xB8000` and seeing characters appear is your first MMIO device. Modern GPUs expose tens of gigabytes of framebuffer and register space as MMIO via **PCIe BARs (Base Address Registers)**. The OS maps these physical addresses into virtual address space using page tables (flagged as uncacheable MMIO), and graphics drivers write directly to GPU registers and VRAM the same way you wrote to `0xB8000`. The mechanism scales to terabytes; the concept is identical.\n\n**7. The BSS section → demand-zeroing and zero pages in Linux**\nLinux is lazy about zeroing memory. When you `mmap` anonymous memory, Linux maps all pages to a single read-only **zero page**. The first write to any of these pages triggers a copy-on-write page fault that allocates a real page and zeros it on demand. BSS segments in ELF executables are handled the same way — the kernel does not physically zero them at load time; it marks the pages as zero-fill-on-demand. You did this eagerly because you had no page fault handler yet. Linux does it lazily for efficiency.\n\n**8. `volatile` and MMIO → memory ordering and `mfence`/`sfence` in SMP kernels**\n`volatile` prevents the compiler from reordering or eliminating MMIO accesses. On a multi-core machine, you also need **memory barriers** to prevent the CPU's out-of-order execution engine from reordering MMIO writes relative to other memory operations. `mfence` (Memory Fence), `sfence` (Store Fence), and `lfence` (Load Fence) are the hardware instructions for this. Device drivers in Linux use `wmb()`, `rmb()`, and `mb()` macros that compile to the appropriate fence instructions. Your `volatile` VGA driver is the conceptual root.\n\n**9. The bootloader size constraint → UEFI and the death of the MBR**\nThe 512-byte MBR is a constraint from 1983. **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** replaces it with a firmware that reads a FAT32 partition (the EFI System Partition), loads a full ELF or PE executable (the bootloader), and provides a rich API for disk access, graphics, and device enumeration — all before the OS starts. GRUB 2 supports both BIOS MBR and UEFI. The Rust OS tutorial (phil-opp) targets UEFI. Understanding why the MBR is so constrained makes UEFI's design choices obvious.\n\n**10. Serial port debug output → GDB stubs → kernel crash reporters**\nYour serial port is the simplest form of out-of-band debug output. Linux's **kgdb** (Kernel GNU Debugger) works over serial: the kernel includes a GDB stub that, on a kernel panic, starts listening on the serial port for GDB remote protocol commands. You can then attach from a second machine, inspect kernel memory, and walk the call stack — exactly like QEMU's `-s -S` flags. Production kernel crash reporters (kdump, crash) use a separate kernel loaded into reserved memory to capture the main kernel's state after a panic.\n\n---\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m2 -->\n# Milestone 2: Interrupts, Exceptions, and Keyboard\n\n## The Revelation: The PIC Was Built Before CPU Exceptions Existed\n\nHere is what every developer who has written event-driven code believes about hardware interrupts: the CPU pauses whatever it is doing, runs a handler function, and resumes — like a JavaScript event listener or a POSIX signal handler, but lower-level. The interrupt numbers assigned to hardware devices just work, because surely someone designed the system as a coherent whole. This belief is understandable. It is also wrong in a way that will triple-fault your kernel the moment you enable interrupts without reading this section.\n\nThe Intel 8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller — the chip that translates hardware signals from devices into CPU interrupt vectors) was designed in 1976 for the 8080 processor. The x86 CPU exception model — the numbered exceptions for divide-by-zero, page faults, general protection faults — was designed in 1982 for the 286. These two teams did not coordinate. The result: the 8259 PIC, *out of the factory*, maps **IRQ0 (the timer interrupt) to CPU vector 8**. CPU vector 8, by the 286 exception specification, is the **double fault handler** — the CPU's last-resort recovery mechanism before a triple fault.\n\nThe consequence is direct: if you configure the IDT and enable interrupts without first remapping the PIC, the first timer tick — arriving approximately 55 milliseconds after you call `sti` — causes the CPU to invoke your double fault handler. Your double fault handler tries to display an error message. While it does so, another timer tick arrives. The CPU tries to invoke the double fault handler *again*, but it is already executing — this is a fault inside a fault handler, which is itself a double fault. The CPU looks for a double fault handler, which it cannot invoke because it is busy. **Triple fault. Reboot. No error message.**\n\nThis is not an obscure edge case. It is the default behavior of x86 hardware. Every OS developer encounters it. Now you know why it happens before it happens to you.\n\n\n![PIC Default Mapping vs CPU Exception Vectors](./diagrams/diag-m2-pic-vector-collision.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 1: The Interrupt Taxonomy — Not All Interrupts Are Created Equal\n\nBefore configuring hardware, you need a clear mental model of what the CPU actually does when something demands its attention. The x86 architecture has three distinct interrupt categories, and conflating them is the source of most beginner confusion.\n\n**Exceptions** are synchronous events generated by the CPU itself in response to an instruction. They happen because of what code is doing right now, at this instruction. Examples: dividing by zero (exception 0), accessing a non-present page (exception 14 — the page fault), executing a privileged instruction from ring 3 (exception 13 — General Protection Fault). Exceptions can be further classified:\n\n- **Faults**: The CPU reports the exception *before* completing the faulting instruction. If the handler fixes the problem (like a page fault handler that maps the missing page), the instruction retries from the beginning. The saved `EIP` points to the faulting instruction.\n- **Traps**: The CPU reports the exception *after* completing the triggering instruction. The saved `EIP` points to the next instruction. Breakpoints (exception 3) and overflow (exception 4) are traps.\n- **Aborts**: Unrecoverable errors. The CPU cannot reliably report the faulting instruction's address. Double fault (exception 8) and machine check (exception 18) are aborts. You cannot resume from an abort; you halt.\n\n**Hardware IRQs** (Interrupt Requests) are asynchronous events generated by external devices. The keyboard pressed a key. The timer ticked. The network card received a packet. These arrive between instructions — the CPU finishes the current instruction, saves state, and jumps to the handler. The device generating the IRQ does not know or care what the CPU was doing; it just signals the PIC, which decides whether to forward the signal to the CPU based on its priority mask.\n\n**Software interrupts** are explicitly triggered by the `int N` instruction. They look like hardware interrupts to the CPU but are generated intentionally by code. `int 0x80` is the Linux system call interface (historically); `int 0x03` is the software breakpoint. You will implement `int 0x80` as your system call gate in Milestone 4.\n\n> **The CPU's perspective on all three:** From the CPU's point of view, all three types go through the same mechanism — the IDT. The CPU uses the interrupt vector number as an index into the IDT, loads the gate descriptor, switches stacks if privilege level changes, pushes state, and jumps to the handler. The *source* of the interrupt (exception logic, PIC signal, or `int` instruction) is irrelevant to the dispatch mechanism. This uniformity is elegant; the complexity is in the details of each type.\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: The IDT — 256 Slots, Each a Gate to a Handler\n\nThe **IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table)** is the protected-mode analog of the real-mode IVT. Where the IVT was a flat array of 4-byte real-mode addresses (segment:offset pairs), the IDT is an array of 8-byte **gate descriptors** that specify not just where to jump, but *how* to jump: which privilege level is required to invoke this gate, whether to clear the interrupt flag on entry, and which code segment to use for the handler.\n\nThe IDT has exactly 256 entries, addressing every possible 8-bit interrupt vector. Entries 0–31 are reserved by Intel for CPU exceptions (though not all are currently used — unused ones should still have handlers that print a meaningful error and halt). Entries 32–255 are available for hardware IRQs and software interrupts.\n\n\n![IDT Gate Descriptor: Interrupt Gate vs Trap Gate](./diagrams/diag-m2-idt-gate-structure.svg)\n\n\n### The Gate Descriptor — Eight Bytes That Control Everything\n\nEach IDT entry is an 8-byte gate descriptor. The most important gate types for a kernel are:\n\n**Interrupt Gate (type = 0xE for 32-bit)**: When the CPU invokes an interrupt gate, it automatically **clears the Interrupt Flag (IF)**. This means hardware interrupts are masked for the duration of the handler. This is the correct type for hardware IRQ handlers — you do not want a timer interrupt to interrupt your timer handler.\n\n**Trap Gate (type = 0xF for 32-bit)**: When invoked, the IF flag is *not* cleared. Hardware interrupts can arrive while the handler is running. This is the correct type for CPU exceptions (which should be debuggable — you want to be able to break into a debugger while a page fault is being handled) and for system calls (so that other processes can be interrupted while one is making a syscall).\n\n```\nIDT Gate Descriptor (8 bytes):\nByte 7    Byte 6    Byte 5    Byte 4  Byte 3  Byte 2  Byte 1  Byte 0\n┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────────────┬────────────────┐\n│ Offset  │P|DPL|0|Type|0|0|0│ (0)  │   Segment      │ Offset [15:0]  │\n│ [31:16] │                  │      │   Selector      │                │\n└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────┴────────────────┴────────────────┘\n\nP    = Present bit (1 = valid gate)\nDPL  = Descriptor Privilege Level (0 = only ring 0 can explicitly invoke; 3 = any ring)\nType = Gate type: 0xE = 32-bit interrupt gate, 0xF = 32-bit trap gate\nOffset [31:16] = High 16 bits of handler address\nOffset [15:0]  = Low 16 bits of handler address\nSegment Selector = Which code segment the handler runs in (usually 0x08: kernel code)\n```\n\n> **DPL on IDT gates:** The DPL field controls which privilege level can *explicitly invoke* this gate with the `int N` instruction. For hardware IRQ handlers (DPL=0), user-mode code cannot trigger them via `int N` — only the hardware can. For the system call gate (DPL=3), user-mode code can explicitly call `int 0x80`. This is the gating mechanism that prevents user processes from directly triggering arbitrary kernel handlers.\n\nIn C, a gate descriptor is a packed struct:\n\n```c\n/* idt.h */\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint16_t offset_low;    /* Handler address bits [15:0]  */\n    uint16_t selector;      /* Code segment selector (0x08) */\n    uint8_t  zero;          /* Always 0                     */\n    uint8_t  type_attr;     /* P|DPL|0|Type bits            */\n    uint16_t offset_high;   /* Handler address bits [31:16] */\n} idt_gate_t;\n\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint16_t limit;         /* Size of IDT in bytes minus 1 */\n    uint32_t base;          /* Physical address of IDT      */\n} idtr_t;\n\n#define IDT_ENTRIES 256\nstatic idt_gate_t idt[IDT_ENTRIES];\nstatic idtr_t idtr;\n\n/* Gate type + attribute bytes */\n#define IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE  0x8E   /* P=1, DPL=0, type=0xE (32-bit interrupt gate) */\n#define IDT_TRAP_GATE       0x8F   /* P=1, DPL=0, type=0xF (32-bit trap gate)      */\n#define IDT_SYSCALL_GATE    0xEF   /* P=1, DPL=3, type=0xF (user-callable trap)    */\n\nvoid idt_set_gate(uint8_t vector, uint32_t handler, uint16_t selector, uint8_t type_attr) {\n    idt[vector].offset_low  = handler & 0xFFFF;\n    idt[vector].selector    = selector;\n    idt[vector].zero        = 0;\n    idt[vector].type_attr   = type_attr;\n    idt[vector].offset_high = (handler >> 16) & 0xFFFF;\n}\n\nvoid idt_install(void) {\n    idtr.limit = sizeof(idt) - 1;\n    idtr.base  = (uint32_t)&idt;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"lidt %0\" : : \"m\"(idtr));\n}\n```\n\n> **`__attribute__((packed))`**: GCC normally inserts padding bytes between struct fields to align them to their natural alignment (4-byte fields at 4-byte-aligned offsets). The IDT gate descriptor's layout is defined by hardware specification — the bytes must be in exactly the positions Intel specifies, with no padding. `packed` instructs GCC to pack fields with no padding. This is essential for any struct whose layout is dictated by hardware rather than software convention.\n\n---\n\n## Section 3: The ISR Stack Frame — Why iret Is Not ret\n\nWhen the CPU invokes an interrupt handler, it does something that `call` does not: it automatically saves not just the return address but the entire privilege-transition context. Understanding this stack frame is essential — miscounting the items on the stack is one of the most common sources of silent corruption in kernel development.\n\n\n![diag-m2-isr-stack-frame](./diagrams/diag-m2-isr-stack-frame.svg)\n\n\n**For interrupts arriving while in ring 0 (kernel mode):**\n\nThe CPU pushes onto the *current* stack (no stack switch required since we are already in ring 0):\n\n```\nHigh address (top of stack before interrupt)\n┌─────────────────┐\n│     EFLAGS      │  ← Saved EFLAGS (contains IF, DF, IOPL, etc.)\n├─────────────────┤\n│       CS        │  ← Saved code segment selector (value 0x08)\n├─────────────────┤\n│      EIP        │  ← Return address (instruction to resume at)\n├─────────────────┤\n│   Error Code    │  ← Only for exceptions that push one (see below)\n└─────────────────┘   ← ESP now points here after hardware push\nLow address\n```\n\n**For interrupts arriving while in ring 3 (user mode):**\n\nThe CPU *also* performs a privilege-level transition. It reads the kernel stack pointer from the TSS (Task State Segment — configured in Milestone 4), switches to the kernel stack, and pushes additional values:\n\n```\nHigh address (kernel stack top from TSS.ESP0)\n┌─────────────────┐\n│       SS        │  ← User-mode stack segment\n├─────────────────┤\n│      ESP        │  ← User-mode stack pointer\n├─────────────────┤\n│     EFLAGS      │  ← User-mode EFLAGS\n├─────────────────┤\n│       CS        │  ← User-mode code segment selector (0x1B)\n├─────────────────┤\n│      EIP        │  ← User-mode return address\n├─────────────────┤\n│   Error Code    │  ← Only for exceptions that push one\n└─────────────────┘   ← ESP now points here\nLow address\n```\n\n`iret` (Interrupt Return) is the counterpart to this automatic push. It pops `EIP`, `CS`, and `EFLAGS` from the stack and restores them atomically. If a privilege transition occurred (CS's DPL changed), `iret` also pops `ESP` and `SS` and switches back to the user stack. This is why you cannot use `ret` to return from an interrupt handler — `ret` only pops `EIP`, leaving `CS` and `EFLAGS` on the stack, corrupting the stack pointer for the resumed code.\n\n### The Error Code Asymmetry — The Source of Countless Stack Misalignments\n\nOf the 32 CPU exception vectors, some push an error code onto the stack *before* invoking the handler; others do not. The asymmetry is not random — it reflects whether the exception provides meaningful fault information:\n\n| Vector | Name | Error Code? |\n|--------|------|-------------|\n| 0 | Divide Error | No |\n| 1 | Debug | No |\n| 2 | NMI | No |\n| 3 | Breakpoint | No |\n| 4 | Overflow | No |\n| 5 | Bound Range | No |\n| 6 | Invalid Opcode | No |\n| 7 | Device Not Available | No |\n| **8** | **Double Fault** | **Yes (always 0)** |\n| 10 | Invalid TSS | Yes |\n| 11 | Segment Not Present | Yes |\n| 12 | Stack-Segment Fault | Yes |\n| **13** | **General Protection Fault** | **Yes** |\n| **14** | **Page Fault** | **Yes** |\n| 17 | Alignment Check | Yes |\n\nIf you write a single ISR stub that does not account for this asymmetry, exceptions without error codes will have a misaligned stack when the handler reads `esp+8` for the error code — it will read garbage, and `iret` will restore the wrong `EIP`. The standard solution: for exceptions without error codes, push a **dummy zero** as an error code before calling the generic handler.\n\n```nasm\n; isr_stubs.asm — NASM syntax\n; For exceptions WITHOUT error code: push dummy 0 first\n%macro ISR_NOERR 1\n    global isr%1\n    isr%1:\n        cli\n        push dword 0    ; Dummy error code (maintains uniform stack frame)\n        push dword %1   ; Exception vector number\n        jmp isr_common_stub\n%endmacro\n\n; For exceptions WITH error code: CPU already pushed it\n%macro ISR_ERR 1\n    global isr%1\n    isr%1:\n        cli\n        push dword %1   ; Exception vector number (error code already on stack)\n        jmp isr_common_stub\n%endmacro\n\nISR_NOERR 0   ; Divide error\nISR_NOERR 1   ; Debug\nISR_NOERR 2   ; NMI\nISR_NOERR 3   ; Breakpoint\nISR_NOERR 4   ; Overflow\nISR_NOERR 5   ; Bound range\nISR_NOERR 6   ; Invalid opcode\nISR_NOERR 7   ; Device not available\nISR_ERR   8   ; Double fault (error code = 0, but CPU pushes it)\nISR_NOERR 9   ; Coprocessor segment overrun (legacy)\nISR_ERR   10  ; Invalid TSS\nISR_ERR   11  ; Segment not present\nISR_ERR   12  ; Stack-segment fault\nISR_ERR   13  ; General protection fault\nISR_ERR   14  ; Page fault\nISR_NOERR 15  ; Reserved\nISR_NOERR 16  ; x87 FPU error\nISR_ERR   17  ; Alignment check\nISR_NOERR 18  ; Machine check\nISR_NOERR 19  ; SIMD floating-point\n; ...

This saves and restores the entire general-purpose register state. If you omit `pusha`/`popa`, the interrupted code resumes with garbage in any register that your handler modified — a bug that manifests far from the interrupt, because the corrupted register might not be used until many instructions later.\n\nThe C handler receives a pointer to the saved register frame on the stack:\n\n```c\n/* interrupt.c */\ntypedef struct {\n    uint32_t gs, fs, es, ds;                   /* Segment registers (pushed last → restored first) */\n    uint32_t edi, esi, ebp, esp;               /* From pusha */\n    uint32_t ebx, edx, ecx, eax;              /* From pusha */\n    uint32_t vector, error_code;               /* Pushed by ISR stub */\n    uint32_t eip, cs, eflags;                 /* Pushed by CPU */\n    /* uint32_t user_esp, user_ss; — only present on ring-3 → ring-0 transition */\n} interrupt_frame_t;\n\nstatic const char *exception_names[] = {\n    \"Divide Error\",            /* 0  */\n    \"Debug\",                   /* 1  */\n    \"Non-Maskable Interrupt\",  /* 2  */\n    \"Breakpoint\",              /* 3  */\n    \"Overflow\",                /* 4  */\n    \"Bound Range Exceeded\",    /* 5  */\n    \"Invalid Opcode\",          /* 6  */\n    \"Device Not Available\",    /* 7  */\n    \"Double Fault\",            /* 8  */\n    \"Coprocessor Seg Overrun\", /* 9  */\n    \"Invalid TSS\",             /* 10 */\n    \"Segment Not Present\",     /* 11 */\n    \"Stack-Segment Fault\",     /* 12 */\n    \"General Protection Fault\",/* 13 */\n    \"Page Fault\",              /* 14 */\n    \"Reserved\",                /* 15 */\n    \"x87 Floating-Point\",      /* 16 */\n    \"Alignment Check\",         /* 17 */\n    \"Machine Check\",           /* 18 */\n    \"SIMD Floating-Point\",     /* 19 */\n    /* 20-31: reserved */\n};\n\nvoid exception_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    if (frame->vector < 32) {\n        kprintf(\"\\n=== KERNEL EXCEPTION ===\\n\");\n        kprintf(\"Exception: %s (vector %d)\\n\",\n                exception_names[frame->vector], frame->vector);\n        kprintf(\"Error code: 0x%08x\\n\", frame->error_code);\n        kprintf(\"EIP: 0x%08x  CS: 0x%04x  EFLAGS: 0x%08x\\n\",\n                frame->eip, frame->cs, frame->eflags);\n        kprintf(\"EAX: 0x%08x  EBX: 0x%08x  ECX: 0x%08x  EDX: 0x%08x\\n\",\n                frame->eax, frame->ebx, frame->ecx, frame->edx);\n\n        /* For page faults, CR2 contains the faulting virtual address */\n        if (frame->vector == 14) {\n            uint32_t cr2;\n            __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr2, %0\" : \"=r\"(cr2));\n            kprintf(\"Faulting address (CR2): 0x%08x\\n\", cr2);\n        }\n\n        /* Halt — cannot recover from unhandled kernel exceptions */\n        kprintf(\"System halted.\\n\");\n        for (;;) { __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\"); }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Section 4: The 8259 PIC — Remapping Before It Kills You\n\nThe **8259 PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)** is a chip that sits between hardware devices and the CPU. Up to 15 hardware IRQ lines feed into the PIC (or a cascade of two PICs — master and slave), and the PIC translates them into CPU interrupt vectors. The critical word is *programmable*: the mapping from IRQ number to vector number is configurable. It just ships from the factory configured incorrectly for protected-mode x86.\n\n\n![PIC 8259 ICW Initialization Sequence](./diagrams/diag-m2-pic-icw-initialization.svg)\n\n\nThe standard PC architecture uses **two 8259 PICs in cascade**:\n- **Master PIC** (ports `0x20` / `0x21`): handles IRQ0–IRQ7\n- **Slave PIC** (ports `0xA0` / `0xA1`): handles IRQ8–IRQ15; connected to master via IRQ2\n\nThe IRQ-to-device mapping:\n\n| IRQ | Device |\n|-----|--------|\n| 0 | PIT Timer (Programmable Interval Timer) |\n| 1 | PS/2 Keyboard |\n| 2 | Cascade (slave PIC) |\n| 3 | COM2 Serial |\n| 4 | COM1 Serial |\n| 5 | LPT2 / Sound |\n| 6 | Floppy |\n| 7 | LPT1 / Spurious |\n| 8 | CMOS Real-Time Clock |\n| 9 | Legacy SCSI / Free |\n| 10 | Free |\n| 11 | Free |\n| 12 | PS/2 Mouse |\n| 13 | FPU |\n| 14 | Primary ATA |\n| 15 | Secondary ATA / Spurious |\n\n**Default mapping (wrong for protected mode):** IRQ0→vector 8, IRQ1→vector 9, ..., IRQ7→vector 15, IRQ8→vector 112 (or 0x70), ..., IRQ15→vector 119. Vectors 8–15 collide directly with CPU exceptions (double fault, invalid TSS, segment not present, stack fault, GPF, page fault, reserved, coprocessor error).\n\n**Target mapping (correct for protected mode):** IRQ0→vector 32, IRQ1→vector 33, ..., IRQ7→vector 39, IRQ8→vector 40, ..., IRQ15→vector 47. This places all hardware IRQs above the 32 reserved exception vectors.\n\n### The ICW Initialization Protocol\n\nReprogramming the PIC requires sending a precise sequence of **ICW (Initialization Command Words)** to specific I/O ports. The PIC enters initialization mode when it receives ICW1, then expects ICW2, ICW3, and ICW4 in order — the chip has a state machine that advances through these command words automatically.\n\n```c\n/* pic.c — PIC remapping */\n#include \"io.h\"   /* outb/inb from Milestone 1 */\n\n#define PIC1_CMD    0x20    /* Master PIC command port */\n#define PIC1_DATA   0x21    /* Master PIC data port    */\n#define PIC2_CMD    0xA0    /* Slave PIC command port  */\n#define PIC2_DATA   0xA1    /* Slave PIC data port     */\n\n#define PIC_EOI     0x20    /* End-of-Interrupt command */\n#define ICW1_INIT   0x10    /* Initialize bit (required) */\n#define ICW1_ICW4   0x01    /* ICW4 will be provided */\n#define ICW4_8086   0x01    /* 8086/88 mode (vs MCS-80/85) */\n\n/* Small I/O delay — some hardware needs time between PIC writes */\nstatic void io_wait(void) {\n    outb(0x80, 0);  /* Port 0x80 is unused POST diagnostic port; write is ~1μs delay */\n}\n\nvoid pic_remap(uint8_t master_offset, uint8_t slave_offset) {\n    /* Save current interrupt masks (we will restore them after remapping) */\n    uint8_t master_mask = inb(PIC1_DATA);\n    uint8_t slave_mask  = inb(PIC2_DATA);\n\n    /* ICW1: Start initialization sequence, cascade mode, ICW4 needed */\n    outb(PIC1_CMD, ICW1_INIT | ICW1_ICW4); io_wait();\n    outb(PIC2_CMD, ICW1_INIT | ICW1_ICW4); io_wait();\n\n    /* ICW2: Set vector offsets\n       Master PIC: IRQ0-7 → vectors master_offset to master_offset+7\n       Slave PIC:  IRQ8-15 → vectors slave_offset to slave_offset+7   */\n    outb(PIC1_DATA, master_offset); io_wait();  /* e.g., 0x20 = 32 */\n    outb(PIC2_DATA, slave_offset);  io_wait();  /* e.g., 0x28 = 40 */\n\n    /* ICW3: Configure cascade wiring\n       Master: bitmask of which IRQ line the slave is connected to (IRQ2 = bit 2 = 0x04)\n       Slave:  numeric IRQ line it is connected to on master (2 = 0x02) */\n    outb(PIC1_DATA, 0x04); io_wait();  /* Slave on master's IRQ2 */\n    outb(PIC2_DATA, 0x02); io_wait();  /* Slave ID = 2 */\n\n    /* ICW4: Set 8086 mode (vs legacy 8080 mode) */\n    outb(PIC1_DATA, ICW4_8086); io_wait();\n    outb(PIC2_DATA, ICW4_8086); io_wait();\n\n    /* Restore saved masks */\n    outb(PIC1_DATA, master_mask);\n    outb(PIC2_DATA, slave_mask);\n}\n```\n\nCall this as: `pic_remap(0x20, 0x28)` — mapping IRQ0–7 to vectors 32–39, IRQ8–15 to vectors 40–47. This must be called **before** `sti` (enabling interrupts) and ideally before setting up IRQ handlers in the IDT, so there is never a window where an IRQ can arrive at the wrong vector.\n\n### EOI — The Acknowledgment That Must Never Be Forgotten\n\nAfter the PIC delivers an IRQ to the CPU and the CPU starts executing the handler, the PIC sets an **ISR bit (In-Service Register bit)** for that IRQ line and masks further interrupts on that line. The PIC will not deliver another interrupt on that line — or, for a master PIC, will not deliver lower-priority IRQs — until it receives an **EOI (End of Interrupt)** signal.\n\nIf you forget to send EOI, the PIC permanently suppresses that IRQ line. The timer stops firing. The keyboard goes silent. The system does not crash — it simply stops responding to hardware events, with no error message. This is one of the most insidious bugs in kernel development.\n\nThe rule: if the IRQ came from the **slave PIC** (IRQ8–15), you must send EOI to **both the slave and the master**. If it came from the **master PIC** (IRQ0–7, excluding IRQ2), send EOI only to the master.\n\n```c\nvoid pic_send_eoi(uint8_t irq) {\n    if (irq >= 8) {\n        /* IRQ came from slave PIC — slave must be acknowledged first */\n        outb(PIC2_CMD, PIC_EOI);\n    }\n    /* Always acknowledge master PIC */\n    outb(PIC1_CMD, PIC_EOI);\n}\n```\n\n> **Spurious IRQs — the phantom interrupt:** IRQ7 (master) and IRQ15 (slave) are special. Due to electrical characteristics of the PIC, a noise spike or very short IRQ pulse can cause the PIC to issue an interrupt but then clear it before the CPU reads the ISR. The CPU receives vector 39 (IRQ7) or 47 (IRQ15) — a \"spurious\" interrupt with no real source. Your handler must check the PIC's ISR register to distinguish real IRQ7/15 from spurious ones. A spurious IRQ7 must *not* receive an EOI (the PIC did not actually set the ISR bit); a spurious IRQ15 requires an EOI to the *master* but not the slave. Most beginner kernels ignore this and get away with it — until they run on hardware that generates noise.\n\n---\n\n## Section 5: The IRQ Stub Framework\n\nHardware IRQ handlers follow the same save/restore pattern as exception handlers, but they also need to send EOI. The cleanest approach: separate stubs for each IRQ (vectors 32–47), each pushing the IRQ number and jumping to a common handler:\n\n```nasm\n; irq_stubs.asm — IRQ handler stubs (vectors 32-47)\n%macro IRQ_STUB 1\n    global irq%1\n    irq%1:\n        cli\n        push dword 0        ; No error code for hardware IRQs\n        push dword (%1 + 32); Vector number (IRQ0 → 32, IRQ1 → 33, etc.)\n        jmp irq_common_stub\n%endmacro\n\nIRQ_STUB 0   ; Timer (PIT, IRQ0 → vector 32)\nIRQ_STUB 1   ; Keyboard (IRQ1 → vector 33)\nIRQ_STUB 2   ; Cascade (IRQ2 → vector 34, should never fire)\nIRQ_STUB 3   ; COM2\nIRQ_STUB 4   ; COM1\nIRQ_STUB 5   ; LPT2\nIRQ_STUB 6   ; Floppy\nIRQ_STUB 7   ; LPT1 / Spurious\nIRQ_STUB 8   ; RTC (IRQ8 → vector 40)\nIRQ_STUB 9\nIRQ_STUB 10\nIRQ_STUB 11\nIRQ_STUB 12  ; PS/2 Mouse\nIRQ_STUB 13  ; FPU\nIRQ_STUB 14  ; Primary ATA\nIRQ_STUB 15  ; Secondary ATA / Spurious\n\nirq_common_stub:\n    pusha\n    push ds\n    push es\n    push fs\n    push gs\n    mov ax, 0x10\n    mov ds, ax\n    mov es, ax\n    mov fs, ax\n    mov gs, ax\n    push esp\n    call irq_dispatcher     ; C function: void irq_dispatcher(interrupt_frame_t*)\n    add esp, 4\n    pop eax\n    mov gs, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov fs, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov es, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov ds, ax\n    popa\n    add esp, 8              ; Pop dummy error code and vector number\n    iret\n```\n\nThe C dispatcher routes to registered handlers:\n\n```c\n/* irq.c */\ntypedef void (*irq_handler_t)(interrupt_frame_t *frame);\nstatic irq_handler_t irq_handlers[16];  /* Handlers for IRQ0-15 */\n\nvoid irq_install_handler(uint8_t irq, irq_handler_t handler) {\n    irq_handlers[irq] = handler;\n}\n\nvoid irq_dispatcher(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    uint8_t irq = frame->vector - 32;   /* Convert vector back to IRQ number */\n\n    if (irq_handlers[irq]) {\n        irq_handlers[irq](frame);\n    }\n\n    pic_send_eoi(irq);  /* ALWAYS send EOI, even if no handler registered */\n}\n```\n\n> **EOI before or after the handler?** Sending EOI before calling the handler allows the PIC to deliver another interrupt on the same IRQ line while the handler is still running. This is risky for non-reentrant handlers (like the keyboard buffer handler) — a second keyboard interrupt while the first is being processed can corrupt the buffer. Sending EOI *after* the handler is safer for simple kernels: the PIC waits until the handler completes. In production kernels (Linux), EOI timing is more nuanced and depends on interrupt threading. For this kernel: send EOI after the handler.\n\nNow register the IDT gates for all 48 vectors (0–31 exceptions, 32–47 IRQs):\n\n```c\nvoid idt_setup_all(void) {\n    /* CPU exceptions: trap gates (IF not cleared, allows debugger interruption) */\n    idt_set_gate(0,  (uint32_t)isr0,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(1,  (uint32_t)isr1,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    /* ... for all 0-31 */\n    idt_set_gate(8,  (uint32_t)isr8,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);   /* Double fault */\n    idt_set_gate(13, (uint32_t)isr13, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);   /* GPF */\n    idt_set_gate(14, (uint32_t)isr14, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);   /* Page fault */\n\n    /* Hardware IRQs: interrupt gates (IF cleared on entry — no nested IRQs) */\n    idt_set_gate(32, (uint32_t)irq0,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(33, (uint32_t)irq1,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    /* ... for all IRQ stubs */\n\n    idt_install();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Section 6: The PIT — Building a 100Hz Clock from a Counting Chip\n\nWith interrupts wired up and the PIC remapped, you need a source of periodic interrupts to drive future scheduling. The **PIT (Programmable Interval Timer — Intel 8253/8254)** is a chip with three independent 16-bit countdown counters clocked at **1,193,182 Hz** (a frequency inherited from television hardware standards — NTSC broadcast frequency divided down through several stages to land on this oddly specific number). Channel 0 is wired to IRQ0, making it the system timer.\n\n\n![PIT 8253/8254: Timer Channel 0 Configuration for 100Hz](./diagrams/diag-m2-pit-timer-configuration.svg)\n\n\nThe PIT works by loading a divisor into the counter. The counter decrements on each clock cycle. When it reaches zero, it triggers IRQ0 and reloads the divisor. The interrupt frequency is therefore:\n\n```\nIRQ0 frequency = 1,193,182 Hz ÷ divisor\n```\n\nFor 100Hz (10ms per tick): `divisor = 1,193,182 ÷ 100 = 11,931.82 → round to 11,932`\n\n```c\n/* pit.c — PIT channel 0 configuration */\n#define PIT_CHANNEL0  0x40   /* Channel 0 data port */\n#define PIT_CMD       0x43   /* Mode/command register */\n#define PIT_FREQUENCY 1193182\n\nvolatile uint64_t pit_tick_count = 0;   /* Incremented every IRQ0 */\n\nvoid pit_set_frequency(uint32_t hz) {\n    uint32_t divisor = PIT_FREQUENCY / hz;\n    if (divisor > 0xFFFF) divisor = 0xFFFF;  /* Clamp to 16-bit maximum */\n    if (divisor < 1)      divisor = 1;        /* Divisor of 0 means 65536 */\n\n    /* Command byte: channel 0, lo/hi byte access, mode 2 (rate generator), binary */\n    /* 0x36 = 00 11 011 0:\n              ^^ channel 0 (bits 7:6 = 00)\n                ^^ lo/hi access (bits 5:4 = 11): send low byte, then high byte\n                  ^^^ mode 2 = rate generator (bits 3:1 = 011): continuous square wave\n                          ^ binary counting (bit 0 = 0) */\n    outb(PIT_CMD, 0x36);\n    outb(PIT_CHANNEL0, divisor & 0xFF);         /* Low byte */\n    outb(PIT_CHANNEL0, (divisor >> 8) & 0xFF);  /* High byte */\n}\n\nvoid timer_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    (void)frame;              /* Unused for now; scheduler will use it in M4 */\n    pit_tick_count++;         /* Atomic on single-core; needs lock on SMP */\n}\n\nvoid pit_init(uint32_t hz) {\n    pit_set_frequency(hz);\n    irq_install_handler(0, timer_handler);  /* IRQ0 → timer_handler */\n}\n```\n\n> **`volatile uint64_t pit_tick_count`:** The `volatile` qualifier is required here for the same reason it was required for MMIO in Milestone 1 — without it, the compiler may cache the value in a register and never re-read from memory. Since `pit_tick_count` is modified by the interrupt handler and read by other code, the compiler cannot see this dependency (interrupt handlers are invisible to the optimizer's control flow analysis). `volatile` forces every access to go through memory. On a multi-core system, `volatile` is insufficient — you need atomic operations. For a single-core kernel, `volatile` is correct.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** At 100Hz, the PIT fires every 10ms. From the CPU's perspective: the PIT asserts IRQ0 → the PIC samples it at the end of the current instruction → the CPU acknowledges, saves state (EFLAGS, CS, EIP pushed: ~20 cycles), reads the IDT entry (1 memory access, likely L2 cache hit: ~10 cycles), jumps to the stub, `pusha` (~8 cycles), C handler call (~15 cycles). Total interrupt latency from IRQ assertion to first instruction of handler: roughly 50–100 cycles, or 25–50 nanoseconds at 2GHz. This is negligible for a 10ms period. The interrupt overhead at 100Hz is approximately 50ns/10ms = 0.0005% CPU time.\n\n---\n\n## Section 7: The Double Fault Handler — The Last Line of Defense\n\nException 8 (double fault) deserves special treatment. A double fault occurs when the CPU tries to deliver an exception but encounters another exception while doing so — for instance, a GPF while trying to invoke the GPF handler because the handler's address in the IDT is invalid, or a stack fault while pushing the exception frame because the stack pointer is invalid.\n\n\n![Exception Chaining: Triple Fault Anatomy](./diagrams/diag-m2-double-fault-chain.svg)\n\n\nThe double fault handler is unique: **it always pushes an error code of zero** (even though the error code is always zero, the CPU pushes it, so your stub must use the `ISR_ERR` macro — it accounts for the CPU-pushed error code). If the double fault handler itself faults, you get a triple fault (unrecoverable reset). Therefore, the double fault handler must be bulletproof: no function calls, no stack-heavy operations, no paging assumptions.\n\n```c\n/* In exception_handler in interrupt.c: special case for vector 8 */\nif (frame->vector == 8) {\n    /* Double fault: system is in an inconsistent state.\n       Print what we can, then halt. Do not attempt complex operations. */\n    kprintf(\"\\n\\n!!! DOUBLE FAULT !!!\\n\");\n    kprintf(\"Error code: 0x%08x (always 0 for double fault)\\n\", frame->error_code);\n    kprintf(\"EIP at time of original fault: 0x%08x\\n\", frame->eip);\n    kprintf(\"System cannot recover. Halting.\\n\");\n\n    /* Disable interrupts and halt all CPU activity */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\");\n    for (;;);  /* Should never reach here; satisfy compiler */\n}\n```\n\n> **An advanced technique: the double fault TSS.** Because a double fault may occur due to a corrupted stack (ESP is invalid), the normal ISR stack frame push will itself fault. A robust kernel uses a separate **Task State Segment** with its own stack for the double fault handler, configured in the IDT as a **task gate** rather than an interrupt gate. The CPU hardware switches to this separate stack before pushing the fault frame, guaranteeing the handler always has a valid stack. This is the technique Linux uses. For this milestone, a standard interrupt gate is sufficient — just ensure your kernel stack is healthy before enabling interrupts.\n\n---\n\n## Section 8: The PS/2 Keyboard Driver — Make Codes, Break Codes, and the Scancode Table\n\nWith the interrupt framework in place, the keyboard driver is its first real application. The **PS/2 keyboard** (the classic DIN/mini-DIN connector, still emulated by USB HID on modern hardware) communicates via two I/O ports:\n\n- **Port `0x60`** (PS/2 Data Port): Read a byte to get the next scancode; write a byte to send a command to the keyboard controller.\n- **Port `0x64`** (PS/2 Status/Command Port): Read to get controller status; write to send controller commands.\n\n\n![PS/2 Keyboard: Scancode to Keypress Pipeline](./diagrams/diag-m2-keyboard-scancode-pipeline.svg)\n\n\nWhen a key is pressed or released, the PS/2 controller generates IRQ1 and places a **scancode** in the data register at port `0x60`. Scancodes are not ASCII codes — they are hardware-level codes that represent physical key positions on the keyboard, independent of the key's character or the current modifier state. The three scancode sets have different code assignments; PS/2 keyboards default to **Set 1** on IBM-compatible PCs.\n\nThe critical behavior: every key generates **two events**:\n- **Make code**: sent when the key is *pressed*. For most keys in Set 1, this is a single byte in the range `0x01`–`0x58`.\n- **Break code**: sent when the key is *released*. This is the make code with bit 7 set (ORed with `0x80`). So the `A` key's make code is `0x1E`, and its break code is `0x9E`.\n\nSome keys (extended keys like arrow keys, Numpad Enter, right Ctrl) send a two-byte sequence starting with `0xE0`, followed by the actual code. You can handle these later; for a first implementation, handle single-byte codes only.\n\n```c\n/* keyboard.c */\n#define KB_DATA_PORT    0x60\n#define KB_STATUS_PORT  0x64\n#define KB_BUFFER_SIZE  256\n\n/* Scancode Set 1: index = make code, value = ASCII character\n   0x00 = no mapping (shift, ctrl, extended, etc.) */\nstatic const char scancode_to_ascii[128] = {\n/*00*/  0,   27,  '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0', '-', '=',  '\\b',\n/*0F*/  '\\t','q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'y', 'u', 'i', 'o', 'p', '[', ']', '\\n',\n/*1D*/  0,   'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', ';', '\\'','`',\n/*2A*/  0,   '\\\\','z', 'x', 'c', 'v', 'b', 'n', 'm', ',', '.', '/', 0,  '*',\n/*38*/  0,   ' ', 0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  0,\n/*48*/  0,   0,   0,   '-', 0,   0,   0,   '+', 0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  0,\n/*58*/  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  0,\n/*68*/  0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,  0\n};\n\n/* Circular keyboard input buffer */\nstatic char    kb_buffer[KB_BUFFER_SIZE];\nstatic uint8_t kb_head = 0;   /* Next position to write */\nstatic uint8_t kb_tail = 0;   /* Next position to read  */\nstatic uint8_t kb_shift = 0;  /* Non-zero if Shift is held */\n\n/* Called from IRQ1 handler */\nvoid keyboard_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    (void)frame;\n    uint8_t scancode = inb(KB_DATA_PORT);\n\n    if (scancode & 0x80) {\n        /* Break code (key release): clear make code, check for shift release */\n        uint8_t make = scancode & 0x7F;\n        if (make == 0x2A || make == 0x36) {   /* Left or right Shift */\n            kb_shift = 0;\n        }\n        /* Ignore other break codes — we do not need to act on key releases\n           for a simple single-key ASCII driver */\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Make code (key press) */\n    if (scancode == 0x2A || scancode == 0x36) {  /* Left or right Shift */\n        kb_shift = 1;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    char c = scancode_to_ascii[scancode];\n    if (c == 0) return;   /* Unmapped key (function keys, arrow keys, etc.) */\n\n    /* Apply shift: uppercase letters and shifted symbols */\n    if (kb_shift && c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {\n        c = c - 'a' + 'A';\n    }\n\n    /* Write to circular buffer — discard if full */\n    uint8_t next_head = (kb_head + 1) % KB_BUFFER_SIZE;\n    if (next_head != kb_tail) {\n        kb_buffer[kb_head] = c;\n        kb_head = next_head;\n    }\n}\n\n/* Called from kernel code to read a character; returns 0 if buffer is empty */\nchar keyboard_getchar(void) {\n    if (kb_head == kb_tail) return 0;  /* Buffer empty */\n    char c = kb_buffer[kb_tail];\n    kb_tail = (kb_tail + 1) % KB_BUFFER_SIZE;\n    return c;\n}\n\nvoid keyboard_init(void) {\n    irq_install_handler(1, keyboard_handler);  /* IRQ1 → keyboard_handler */\n}\n```\n\n> **The circular buffer (ring buffer):** `kb_buffer` is accessed by two \"parties\" — the interrupt handler writes to it, and kernel polling code reads from it. The head pointer (`kb_head`) advances on write; the tail pointer (`kb_tail`) advances on read. The buffer is full when `(head + 1) % SIZE == tail`; empty when `head == tail`. This structure avoids needing to shift bytes around — it is O(1) per operation. It is the same data structure used for kernel pipe buffers, network socket receive queues, and audio sample ring buffers. On a single-core system, the interrupt handler cannot be interrupted by `keyboard_getchar` (since interrupts are disabled in the IRQ handler), so no lock is needed. On SMP, you need an atomic compare-and-swap.\n\n---\n\n## Section 9: Wiring It All Together\n\nThe complete initialization sequence, to be called from `kmain()` after the VGA and serial drivers:\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(void) {\n    /* Milestone 1: output drivers */\n    serial_init();\n    vga_clear();\n    kprintf(\"Kernel booted.

IDT before PIC: prevents a window where an IRQ arrives before there is a valid handler in the IDT.\n2. PIC remapping before `sti`: absolutely mandatory to avoid the double-fault collision described at the start of this milestone.\n3. `sti` last: the atomic boundary. Nothing fires until you say so.\n\n---\n\n## Section 10: The Three-Level View — What \"Keyboard Press\" Truly Means\n\nTracing a single keypress from your finger to your kernel's character buffer:\n\n**Level 1 — The Kernel API:**\nYour code calls `keyboard_getchar()`, which reads from the circular buffer. If the buffer is non-empty, a character is returned immediately. From the caller's perspective: a character appeared, asynchronously, via some mechanism.\n\n**Level 2 — The Interrupt Path:**\nThe PS/2 keyboard controller (an Intel 8042-compatible chip) received a serial bit stream from the keyboard matrix, assembled it into a scancode byte, and asserted IRQ1. The PIC sampled IRQ1, determined it was not masked, and raised the `INTR` line to the CPU between instructions. The CPU finished the current instruction, saved EFLAGS/CS/EIP to the kernel stack, indexed into the IDT at vector 33 (`32 + IRQ1`), loaded the handler address, and jumped to `irq1` stub. The stub saved all registers (`pusha`), called `irq_dispatcher`, which called `keyboard_handler`, which read port `0x60` (consuming the scancode from the controller's buffer), translated it, and wrote to the circular buffer. Then EOI was sent to the master PIC, all registers were restored, and `iret` resumed the interrupted code.\n\n**Level 3 — Hardware Timing:**\nThe keyboard matrix scanner runs at roughly 1kHz, debounces key contacts (physical contacts bounce for 5–20ms when pressed), and serializes the scancode at 10–16kHz to the PS/2 controller. The PS/2 controller buffers the scancode and asserts IRQ1. The PIC's interrupt arbitration circuit checks priority (lower IRQ number = higher priority) and the master's IMR (Interrupt Mask Register) to decide whether to raise `INTR`. The CPU's interrupt recognition happens at instruction boundaries — some long instructions (like `rep movs`) check for interrupts between iterations. The total latency from key press to handler executing: 5–20ms of debounce + ~60μs of PS/2 serial transfer + ~1μs of PIC arbitration + ~50ns of CPU pipeline flush = effectively human-imperceptible.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** Every `inb(0x60)` in `keyboard_handler` crosses the I/O bus — it is not cached, it stalls the CPU pipeline waiting for the I/O port to respond (typically 1–4μs for legacy I/O ports). On the 8259 PIC, the EOI write (`outb(PIC1_CMD, 0x20)`) similarly crosses the I/O bus. Total I/O bus accesses per keypress: 2 (read scancode + write EOI) × ~2μs each ≈ 4μs of pure I/O stall. Irrelevant at human typing speeds; significant if you were handling millions of IRQs per second (which is why modern NICs use MSI-X and interrupt coalescing rather than per-packet IRQs).\n\n---\n\n## The Interrupt vs Trap Gate Distinction — A Design Decision With Consequences\n\n\n![IDT Gate Descriptor: Interrupt Gate vs Trap Gate](./diagrams/diag-m2-idt-gate-structure.svg)\n\n\nThe difference between an interrupt gate and a trap gate is a single bit in the IDT entry (`type` field: `0xE` vs `0xF`). But the behavioral consequence shapes every I/O subsystem in the kernel.\n\n**Interrupt gate (IF cleared on entry):** When the CPU invokes an interrupt gate, it clears the Interrupt Flag. Hardware interrupts cannot arrive while your handler runs. This prevents timer interrupts from interrupting a timer handler (no reentrancy problem), and prevents keyboard IRQs from interrupting keyboard IRQ handling. The cost: if your handler is slow, you add latency to *all* other interrupts. No preemption occurs inside the handler.\n\n**Trap gate (IF not cleared on entry):** Interrupts remain enabled. The handler can itself be interrupted by higher-priority hardware events. This is correct for CPU exceptions (a page fault handler might perform I/O that requires timer interrupts to complete), and it is essential for system calls — a `read()` syscall might block for seconds; you must allow other processes' timer interrupts to fire during that wait.\n\n| Gate Type | IF on Entry | Use Case | Risk |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|------|\n| Interrupt Gate (`0x8E`) | Cleared (interrupts off) | Hardware IRQ handlers | Interrupt latency if handler is slow |\n| Trap Gate (`0x8F`, DPL=0) | Not cleared (interrupts on) | CPU exception handlers | Reentrancy if not careful |\n| Trap Gate (`0xEF`, DPL=3) | Not cleared (interrupts on) | System call gate (INT 0x80) | User code can invoke via `int` |\n\nLinux uses interrupt gates for hardware IRQs (to prevent handler reentrancy) and trap gates for system calls (so timer interrupts still fire during blocking syscalls). The specific gate type for the system call vector (`0x80`) has DPL=3, allowing user-mode code to invoke it with `int 0x80` without triggering a General Protection Fault. You will wire this up in Milestone 4.\n\n---\n\n## Debugging Interrupt Problems\n\nWhen interrupt code goes wrong, the failure modes are particularly opaque. A taxonomy of what you will encounter:\n\n| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix |\n|---------|-----------|-----|\n| Immediate triple fault after `sti` | PIC not remapped; first timer tick hits double fault vector | Call `pic_remap()` before `sti` |\n| System hangs silently after first IRQ | Forgot `pic_send_eoi()`; PIC masked that IRQ line forever | Add EOI at end of every IRQ handler |\n| Triple fault at `iret` | Stack misaligned: forgot to `add esp, 8` after `pusha`/handler/popa | Count every push and pop; verify stack symmetry |\n| Keyboard generates characters twice | Not ignoring break codes; handler called on both press and release | Check `scancode & 0x80` for break codes |\n| Exception handler corrupts caller registers | Missing `pusha`/`popa` pair | Every ISR stub must save and restore all registers |\n| `pit_tick_count` always zero in polling code | Missing `volatile`; compiler cached value in register | Add `volatile` to the tick count variable |\n| QEMU reboots with no output | Triple fault before serial is initialized; PIC collision | Test with `cli` permanently; confirm IDT setup before `sti` |\n\nUse QEMU's `-d int` flag during development. It logs every interrupt and exception to stderr with the vector number, error code, and EIP. Combined with serial output, this tells you exactly which instruction triggered each exception.\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio -d int 2>interrupts.log\n```\n\nThe `interrupts.log` will show something like:\n```\n     2: v=08 e=0000 i=0 cpl=0 IP=0008:001000a4 pc=001000a4 SP=0010:001ffff8\n```\n`v=08` = vector 8 (double fault). `IP=0008:001000a4` = the instruction that caused it. This line, immediately after `sti`, is the unmistakable signature of a non-remapped PIC.\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Cascade — What This Milestone Unlocks\n\nYou have just built the interrupt infrastructure that every operating system feature above this layer depends on. Here is the web of concepts it connects to.\n\n**1. Interrupt gate vs trap gate → Linux system call design and seccomp**\nThe exact reason `int 0x80` in Linux uses a trap gate (type `0xEF`, DPL=3) rather than an interrupt gate (type `0x8E`) is so that hardware interrupts continue to fire during system call execution. A `read()` blocking on disk I/O can wait for seconds; the timer interrupt must still preempt other processes during that wait. If system calls used interrupt gates, the timer would be masked for the duration of any blocking syscall, making preemptive scheduling impossible. **seccomp** (Secure Computing Mode — the Linux mechanism for restricting which syscalls a process can make, used by Docker, Chrome, and Firefox sandbox) works by inserting a filter into the system call dispatch path at exactly the point between the IDT trap gate and the syscall table lookup. Understanding the gate type is understanding where seccomp hooks in.\n\n**2. EOI protocol → interrupt coalescing in network drivers (NAPI)**\nThe mandatory EOI acknowledgment after each IRQ is the conceptual ancestor of a critical Linux networking optimization: **NAPI (New API)**. Without NAPI, every incoming network packet triggers an IRQ, the handler processes one packet, sends EOI, and the next packet immediately triggers another IRQ. At 10Gbps line rates, this produces millions of IRQs per second — the kernel spends more time in interrupt overhead than actual packet processing. NAPI's solution: on the first IRQ for a NIC, disable that NIC's IRQ line (like never sending EOI) and switch to polling mode — the kernel polls the NIC's receive queue in a tight loop until it empties, then re-enables the IRQ. This is interrupt coalescing: batch many events into one interrupt cycle. Modern NIC firmware does this autonomously via **interrupt moderation**, accumulating packets for up to 50–100μs before asserting the IRQ. The mandatory acknowledgment you just implemented is the primitive they are optimizing around.\n\n**3. ISR stack frame layout → Linux signal frames and `sigreturn`**\nThe stack frame your ISR creates (EFLAGS, CS, EIP, plus the general-purpose registers you pushed) is structurally identical to the **signal frame** that Linux pushes onto a user process's stack before invoking a signal handler. When you call `signal(SIGSEGV, handler)`, Linux's signal delivery mechanism saves all the process registers — exactly like `pusha` — plus the CPU's automatic EFLAGS/CS/EIP push, creates a `sigcontext` struct on the user stack, and jumps to your handler. When the handler returns, it calls `sigreturn` (a dedicated syscall), which reads that struct back from the stack and restores all the registers — exactly like your `popa` + `iret` sequence. The **Spectre/Meltdown mitigations** that Intel deployed in 2018 broke the `sigreturn` mechanism on some configurations by changing kernel/user address space isolation, and Linux had to rewrite the signal frame layout. You now understand exactly what broke.\n\n**4. PIT 100Hz tick → high-resolution timers, NTP, and `clock_gettime` complexity**\nYour 100Hz tick counter has 10ms resolution — you cannot measure intervals shorter than one tick. Early Linux (2.4 kernel) used 100Hz for the same reason. The problems: 10ms is too coarse for audio (introduces jitter), too coarse for network latency measurement, and wastes power on laptops (the CPU must wake up 100 times per second even when idle). The **HPET (High Precision Event Timer)** was introduced to provide nanosecond resolution without high interrupt rates. The **TSC deadline timer** (available on modern CPUs) allows the OS to program a one-shot interrupt at a specific CPU cycle count, enabling **tickless kernels** (Linux NO_HZ mode) where the timer only fires when actually needed. `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` on modern Linux reads the TSC directly in userspace (via the vDSO — a kernel-mapped page containing code that bypasses the syscall overhead entirely), achieving nanosecond precision without any interrupt overhead. Your 100Hz PIT is the starting point of this 40-year evolution.\n\n**5. PS/2 make/break codes → USB HID protocol and N-key rollover**\nEvery keypress generating two events (make and release) is not a PS/2 quirk — it is a fundamental input protocol design principle. **USB HID (Human Interface Device)** reports work the same way: a keyboard sends a report when any key state changes, containing a bitmask of all currently pressed keys. The HID protocol's **key rollover** specification defines how many simultaneously pressed keys the device can distinguish. **N-key rollover (NKRO)** means every key has independent state tracking — 104 keys pressed simultaneously are all reported. Budget keyboards implement 6-key rollover (6KRO), losing track of 7th+ simultaneous keys. Gaming keyboards advertise NKRO as a feature. This complexity exists because the USB HID report format must encode the exact state of every key in every report, requiring bitmask representation rather than PS/2's sequential event stream. The make/break model you just implemented is USB HID's ancestor.\n\n**6. The double fault handler → hardware watchdog timers and kernel oops**\nYour double fault handler — print diagnostic info, halt — is a simplified version of what Linux's kernel panic handler does. Linux's **kernel oops** mechanism prints a backtrace, register dump, and loaded module list on any unhandled kernel exception, then either halts or continues (depending on `oops=panic` configuration). The **NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt — vector 2)** is a special interrupt that the CPU processes even when `IF=0` (it bypasses the interrupt flag entirely). Production servers wire the **hardware watchdog timer** to the NMI line — if the kernel freezes and stops responding, the watchdog fires an NMI, which the kernel handles by printing a backtrace and (optionally) triggering a machine reset. Google's servers use NMI-based watchdogs to automatically recover from kernel deadlocks. Your double fault handler is the conceptual prototype.\n\n---\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m3 -->\n# Milestone 3: Physical and Virtual Memory Management\n\n## The Revelation: Paging Enables Itself — Or Kills You Trying\n\nHere is what every programmer who has worked above the OS layer believes about virtual memory: it is a feature the operating system turns on during boot, and once on, programs can use any address the OS has allocated for them. The OS manages page tables in software; the CPU consults them when needed. Virtual memory feels like a software abstraction layered onto hardware.\n\nThis belief is correct about the steady state. It is catastrophically wrong about the transition.\n\nWhen you write `CR0.PG = 1` to enable paging, the change is instantaneous and irrevocable — there is no \"paging enabled for the next instruction\" mode. The *current* instruction has already been fetched; the *next* instruction fetch immediately goes through the new page table lookup. If the physical address of that next instruction is not mapped in your page tables, the CPU raises a page fault (exception 14). But your page fault handler is code. Which means the CPU tries to look up the page fault handler's address through the page tables. Which is also not mapped. Which raises another page fault. Double fault. Triple fault. Reboot. No error message.\n\nThere is no way to print a diagnostic before this happens, because your print function is also code that lives at unmapped addresses.\n\nThe solution is to map the physical addresses where your code currently lives *before* setting `CR0.PG`. You must build a set of page tables that describe the current physical layout of memory, enable paging while that layout is valid, and *then* remap things as needed. This technique is called **identity mapping** — virtual address equals physical address for the bootstrapping region. The moment paging activates, the CPU finds your code at its expected address because you told it to.\n\nThe second revelation arrives when you later modify a page table entry. The CPU has a cache of recent address translations called the **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**. If you modify a PTE and do not flush the TLB, the CPU keeps serving the old translation from cache — potentially letting code access a physical frame you just freed and reassigned to a different purpose. This is not a theoretical bug. On a single core, it causes silent memory corruption that surfaces far from the modification. On a multi-core system — not covered in this milestone but described in the cascade below — it requires inter-processor interrupts to flush remote TLBs, because each core has its own private TLB. The physics of caching creates distributed consistency problems at the scale of a single chip.\n\n\n![Paging Enablement: The Identity-Map Bootstrap Problem](./diagrams/diag-m3-paging-enable-sequence.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 1: The Physical Address Space — What RAM Actually Looks Like\n\nBefore you can manage memory, you need to know what memory exists. This sounds like a trivial question — you have 256MB of RAM, so you have 256MB. But the physical address space is not a clean flat array of usable bytes. It is a patchwork of RAM, firmware ROM, device registers, and reserved regions, with holes punched through it by hardware that was never designed to be coherent.\n\n\n![E820 Memory Map: Physical Address Space Classification](./diagrams/diag-m3-e820-memory-map.svg)\n\n\nThe physical address space of a typical x86 machine looks like this:\n\n```\nPhysical Address   Region                          Notes\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n0x00000000         Real-mode IVT                   Interrupt Vector Table (legacy)\n0x00000400         BIOS Data Area                  BIOS-maintained hardware state\n0x00007C00         MBR load address                Where the bootloader runs\n0x00080000         Extended BIOS Data Area (EBDA)  Variable size, avoid\n0x000A0000         VGA framebuffer (CGA/EGA)       Legacy video memory\n0x000B8000         VGA text mode buffer            Your kprintf target\n0x000C0000         Video BIOS ROM                  Option ROM space\n0x000F0000         System BIOS ROM                 Firmware code, not RAM\n0x00100000  (1MB)  Usable RAM begins               Where your kernel loads\n      ...

The firmware knows it — the BIOS probed the hardware during POST. Your bootloader must ask the BIOS to report what it found.\n\n### The E820 Memory Map — Asking the Firmware\n\n**E820** is a BIOS function (INT 15h, EAX=0xE820) that returns a list of memory region descriptors. Each descriptor specifies a base address, a length, and a type. This call must be made in real mode, which means your Stage 2 bootloader or GRUB must perform it and store the results in a known location before entering protected mode.\n\n> **Why E820 and not just reading a configuration byte?** Older methods (INT 15h, AX=0xE801 for extended memory; INT 15h, AH=0x88 for simple memory size) returned a single number representing contiguous memory above 1MB. They could not express non-contiguous regions, holes for ACPI tables, or memory-mapped device regions. E820 was introduced to replace all of them. It is still used by modern UEFI firmware in legacy compatibility mode, and GRUB passes the E820 data to the kernel via the **multiboot information structure**.\n\nEach E820 entry is a 20-byte structure:\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n    uint64_t base;    /* Physical base address of region */\n    uint64_t length;  /* Length in bytes */\n    uint32_t type;    /* Region type */\n} __attribute__((packed)) e820_entry_t;\n\n/* Type values */\n#define E820_USABLE     1  /* Free RAM — your allocator can use this */\n#define E820_RESERVED   2  /* BIOS-reserved; do not touch */\n#define E820_ACPI_DATA  3  /* ACPI tables; can reclaim after reading */\n#define E820_ACPI_NVS   4  /* ACPI Non-Volatile Storage; never reclaim */\n#define E820_BAD        5  /* Known bad RAM */\n```\n\nIf you are using **GRUB** (the most common approach for learning kernels), GRUB performs the E820 query for you and passes the memory map via the **multiboot information structure**. Your kernel entry point receives a pointer to this structure in the `EBX` register (set by GRUB before jumping to your kernel). The multiboot spec defines a `flags` field indicating which information is present, and a `mmap_addr`/`mmap_length` pair pointing to the memory map:\n\n```c\n/* multiboot.h — simplified multiboot information structure */\ntypedef struct {\n    uint32_t flags;           /* Flags indicating which fields are valid */\n    uint32_t mem_lower;       /* Kilobytes of lower memory (below 1MB) */\n    uint32_t mem_upper;       /* Kilobytes of upper memory (above 1MB) */\n    /* ... many other fields ... */\n    uint32_t mmap_length;     /* Length of memory map buffer in bytes */\n    uint32_t mmap_addr;       /* Physical address of first mmap_entry_t */\n} multiboot_info_t;\n\n/* Each entry in the multiboot memory map */\ntypedef struct {\n    uint32_t size;      /* Size of this entry (not including this field itself) */\n    uint64_t addr;      /* Physical base address */\n    uint64_t len;       /* Length in bytes */\n    uint32_t type;      /* E820 type: 1=usable, 2=reserved, 3=ACPI, etc. */\n} __attribute__((packed)) mmap_entry_t;\n```\n\n> **The `size` field quirk:** Each multiboot mmap entry begins with a `size` field that gives the size of the *remaining* fields. The next entry is at `(uint8_t*)entry + entry->size + 4` — you add 4 to account for the `size` field itself, which is not counted. This non-obvious arithmetic trips up nearly every developer who iterates the memory map for the first time.\n\nParsing the multiboot memory map:\n\n```c\n/* pmm.c — Physical Memory Manager */\n#include \"multiboot.h\"\n#include \"pmm.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n\nstatic uint64_t total_memory_bytes = 0;\nstatic uint64_t usable_memory_bytes = 0;\n\nvoid pmm_parse_memory_map(multiboot_info_t *mbi) {\n    /* Verify the memory map flag is set (bit 6) */\n    if (!(mbi->flags & (1 << 6))) {\n        kprintf(\"[PMM] FATAL: Bootloader did not provide memory map.\\n\");\n        for (;;);\n    }\n\n    kprintf(\"[PMM] Memory map (from bootloader):\\n\");\n\n    mmap_entry_t *entry = (mmap_entry_t *)(uintptr_t)mbi->mmap_addr;\n    mmap_entry_t *end   = (mmap_entry_t *)(uintptr_t)(mbi->mmap_addr + mbi->mmap_length);\n\n    while (entry < end) {\n        const char *type_str;\n        switch (entry->type) {\n            case 1: type_str = \"Usable RAM\";    usable_memory_bytes += entry->len; break;\n            case 2: type_str = \"Reserved\";       break;\n            case 3: type_str = \"ACPI Data\";      break;\n            case 4: type_str = \"ACPI NVS\";       break;\n            case 5: type_str = \"Bad RAM\";        break;\n            default: type_str = \"Unknown\";       break;\n        }\n        total_memory_bytes += entry->len;\n\n        kprintf(\"  [0x%08x%08x - 0x%08x%08x] %s\\n\",\n                (uint32_t)(entry->addr >> 32), (uint32_t)entry->addr,\n                (uint32_t)((entry->addr + entry->len - 1) >> 32),\n                (uint32_t)(entry->addr + entry->len - 1),\n                type_str);\n\n        /* Advance to next entry: size field + size of remaining fields */\n        entry = (mmap_entry_t *)((uint8_t *)entry + entry->size + 4);\n    }\n\n    kprintf(\"[PMM] Total: %u MB, Usable: %u MB\\n\",\n            (uint32_t)(total_memory_bytes / (1024*1024)),\n            (uint32_t)(usable_memory_bytes / (1024*1024)));\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: The Bitmap Physical Frame Allocator\n\nWith the memory map parsed, you need a data structure to track which physical 4KB frames are free and which are in use. The two main choices are a **bitmap** (one bit per frame, 0=free, 1=used) and a **free list** (linked list of free frame descriptors). Let us examine both to understand why bitmaps are the right default for a learning kernel.\n\n\n![Physical Allocator Comparison: Bitmap vs Buddy System](./diagrams/diag-m3-buddy-vs-bitmap-comparison.svg)\n\n\n| Property | Bitmap | Free List |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| Memory overhead for 4GB RAM | 128 KB (1 bit × 1M frames) | 4–8 MB (pointer per free frame) |\n| Allocate single frame | O(n) scan, O(1) amortized with hint | O(1) pop from head |\n| Free a frame | O(1) clear bit | O(1) push to head |\n| Cache behavior | 64-byte cache line covers 512 frames | Pointer-chasing: each access is potentially a cache miss |\n| Detect double-free | O(1) check if bit already 0 | Requires O(n) scan or set membership check |\n| Contiguous multi-frame allocation | O(n) scan for consecutive 0-bits | Buddy allocator variant required |\n\nFor a kernel that allocates frames one at a time (for page tables and backing memory), the bitmap's cache behavior advantage is decisive. The bitmap for 4GB of RAM at 4KB frames is `4GB / 4KB / 8 bits = 128KB`. At L2 cache size of 256KB–1MB, the entire bitmap fits in cache after the first scan. Subsequent allocations that land near the previous allocation hit the same cache line — 512 frames represented in one 64-byte cache line. Free lists, by contrast, follow pointers to arbitrary physical addresses, generating a cache miss per allocation.\n\n\n![Physical Frame Allocator: Bitmap Data Structure](./diagrams/diag-m3-bitmap-allocator-layout.svg)\n\n\n> **Buddy allocator:** jemalloc, mimalloc, and the Linux kernel use a **buddy allocator** for physical frame management — a hierarchical structure where memory is divided into power-of-two-sized blocks, and adjacent (\"buddy\") free blocks are merged on deallocation. Buddy allocators eliminate external fragmentation for large allocations, support contiguous multi-frame allocation efficiently, and have O(log n) alloc/free. They are more complex to implement correctly. For this milestone, the bitmap allocator is the right choice — simple, cache-friendly, and sufficient for single-frame allocation. The cascade section connects this back to jemalloc's design.\n\n### Bitmap Allocator Implementation\n\n```c\n/* pmm.h */\n#ifndef PMM_H\n#define PMM_H\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <stddef.h>\n\n#define PAGE_SIZE    4096\n#define PAGE_SHIFT   12        /* log2(PAGE_SIZE) */\n#define FRAME_COUNT  (4UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 / PAGE_SIZE)  /* 4GB / 4KB = 1M frames */\n\n/* Physical address → frame number conversion */\n#define ADDR_TO_FRAME(addr)  ((addr) >> PAGE_SHIFT)\n#define FRAME_TO_ADDR(frame) ((frame) << PAGE_SHIFT)\n\nvoid  pmm_init(multiboot_info_t *mbi);\nvoid  pmm_mark_used(uint64_t addr, uint64_t length);\nvoid  pmm_mark_free(uint64_t addr, uint64_t length);\nvoid *pmm_alloc_frame(void);

After the first 100 frames are allocated, each call wastes time re-scanning the occupied bitmap words. The hint records the approximate position of the last successful allocation. Since allocations tend to be sequential (kernel heap grows from low to high), the hint usually lands on or near a free frame. This is a **next-fit** allocation policy — as opposed to **first-fit** (always scan from 0) or **best-fit** (find the smallest free block that fits). For single-frame allocation, next-fit is both faster and more cache-friendly: subsequent allocations modify the same or adjacent bitmap words, staying in the same cache line.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The bitmap scan is essentially a sequential memory read — exactly the pattern CPUs prefetch most aggressively. The outer loop reads `frame_bitmap[w]` sequentially; the hardware prefetcher detects this stride and loads upcoming cache lines before you need them. A 64-byte cache line contains 512 bits, representing 512 frames = 2MB of physical memory. Scanning 4GB worth of frames reads `1M frames / 512 frames per cache line = 2048` cache lines = 128KB, fitting entirely in a 256KB L2 cache after the first pass. Contrast with a free list: each `next` pointer points to an arbitrary physical address, producing a random access pattern with one L2 or L3 cache miss per allocation.\n\n---\n\n## Section 3: x86 Two-Level Page Tables — The Hardware That Makes Virtual Memory Work\n\nWith physical frames available for allocation, the next task is building the structures that let the CPU translate virtual addresses to physical addresses. On 32-bit x86, this is a **two-level page table**: a page directory at the top level, and page tables at the second level.\n\n{{DIAGRAM:diag-m3-two-level-page-table}}\n\n### Address Translation — How the CPU Decodes a Virtual Address\n\nA 32-bit virtual address is divided into three fields by the CPU's Memory Management Unit (MMU — the hardware component that performs address translation):\n\n```\nVirtual Address (32 bits):\n┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┐\n│ Directory Index │   Table Index   │            Offset              │\n│    [31:22]      │   [21:12]       │           [11:0]               │\n│   10 bits       │   10 bits       │           12 bits              │\n│  (0–1023)       │  (0–1023)       │          (0–4095)              │\n└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nThe translation process — performed in hardware by the MMU on every memory access:\n\n1. **Load CR3**: The CPU holds the physical address of the **Page Directory (PD)** in the `CR3` register. The page directory is a 4KB array of 1024 32-bit **Page Directory Entries (PDEs)**.\n\n2. **Index the Page Directory**: Use bits [31:22] of the virtual address (the directory index, 0–1023) to select a PDE from the page directory. The PDE contains the physical address of a **Page Table (PT)**.\n\n3. **Index the Page Table**: The page table is another 4KB array of 1024 32-bit **Page Table Entries (PTEs)**. Use bits [21:12] of the virtual address (the table index, 0–1023) to select a PTE. The PTE contains the physical address of the **4KB page frame**.\n\n4. **Add the Offset**: Combine the physical frame address from the PTE with bits [11:0] of the virtual address (the byte offset within the page, 0–4095) to get the final physical address.\n\nThis entire four-memory-access sequence (CR3 → PDE → PTE → data) happens transparently on every memory access. The **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)** caches recently used `(virtual page → physical frame)` translations so the CPU does not repeat all four steps for every access. A TLB hit costs 1 cycle; a TLB miss triggers the full walk, costing 20–50 cycles plus the memory access latencies for PDE and PTE reads.\n\n### The PDE and PTE Entry Format\n\nBoth PDEs and PTEs are 32-bit values with the same flag layout:\n\n```\nPage Directory Entry / Page Table Entry (32 bits):\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐\n│         Physical Frame Address [31:12]     │  Flags [11:0]    │\n│              (20 bits)                     │                  │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘\n\nFlags (bits [11:0]):\nBit 0  (P)   = Present: 1 = entry is valid; 0 = triggers page fault\nBit 1  (R/W) = Read/Write: 0 = read-only; 1 = read-write\nBit 2  (U/S) = User/Supervisor: 0 = kernel only (ring 0); 1 = user accessible (rings 0–3)\nBit 3  (PWT) = Page Write-Through: controls cache write policy\nBit 4  (PCD) = Page Cache Disable: 1 = uncacheable (use for MMIO)\nBit 5  (A)   = Accessed: CPU sets this bit on first access to the page\nBit 6  (D)   = Dirty (PTE only): CPU sets this bit on first write to the page\nBit 7  (PS)  = Page Size (PDE only): 1 = 4MB page (PSE extension); 0 = 4KB subtable\nBit 8  (G)   = Global: TLB entry not flushed on CR3 reload (requires CR4.PGE)\n```\n\n> **The physical address field**: Bits [31:12] give the physical frame address for a 4KB page. Since pages are 4KB-aligned, the low 12 bits of the frame address are always zero — those bits are repurposed as flags. The hardware extracts the frame address by masking bits [31:12] (zeroing the low 12 bits) and the offset is added separately.\n\nThe most critical flags for your kernel:\n- **P (Present)**: Must be 1 for any mapping that should work. Setting P=0 effectively unmaps the page — the next access causes a page fault (exception 14). This is how demand paging and guard pages work.\n- **R/W (Read/Write)**: Set to 1 for writable pages (kernel data, stacks, heap). Set to 0 for code pages and read-only data — an attempt to write triggers a page fault with an error code indicating a write violation.\n- **U/S (User/Supervisor)**: The primary isolation mechanism between user and kernel mode. Kernel pages have U/S=0 — user-mode code that accesses them triggers a page fault. This is why a buffer overflow in a user process cannot read kernel memory. The page fault error code tells you which violation occurred.\n\n```c\n/* page.h — page table entry flags */\n#define PAGE_PRESENT    (1 << 0)\n#define PAGE_WRITABLE   (1 << 1)\n#define PAGE_USER       (1 << 2)\n#define PAGE_WRITETHROUGH (1 << 3)\n#define PAGE_NOCACHE    (1 << 4)\n#define PAGE_ACCESSED   (1 << 5)\n#define PAGE_DIRTY      (1 << 6)\n#define PAGE_LARGE      (1 << 7)   /* PDE only: 4MB page if CR4.PSE set */\n#define PAGE_GLOBAL     (1 << 8)\n\n/* Extract physical frame address from a PDE/PTE */\n#define PDE_FRAME(pde)  ((pde) & 0xFFFFF000)\n#define PTE_FRAME(pte)  ((pte) & 0xFFFFF000)\n\n/* Page directory and page table types */\ntypedef uint32_t pde_t;   /* Page Directory Entry */\ntypedef uint32_t pte_t;   /* Page Table Entry */\n```\n\n---\n\n## Section 4: Building the Page Directory — Identity Map and Higher-Half\n\n\n![Higher-Half Kernel: Boot Physical vs Runtime Virtual](./diagrams/diag-m3-higher-half-kernel-map.svg)\n\n\nYour kernel needs two simultaneous mappings during the bootstrapping phase:\n\n**Identity mapping** (virtual = physical) for the low memory region your code is currently executing from. Without this, enabling paging causes the immediate page fault described in the revelation. The identity map must cover:\n- The kernel code and data (loaded at physical `0x100000`)\n- The VGA buffer (physical `0xB8000`) — also reachable via identity map of the first 4MB\n- Any page directory/table structures you are about to build (they live in physical memory too)\n\n**Higher-half mapping** (virtual `0xC0000000` = physical `0x100000`) for the kernel's intended virtual address home. After paging is on and you have jumped to the higher-half virtual address, you will unmap the identity mapping — user processes should not be able to \"accidentally\" use low virtual addresses to access kernel code.\n\n> **Why `0xC0000000` (3GB)?** It is a convention, not a requirement. The classic 32-bit Linux split is 3GB/1GB: user processes get virtual addresses `0x00000000`–`0xBFFFFFFF` (3GB), and the kernel occupies `0xC0000000`–`0xFFFFFFFF` (1GB). This means every user process's page directory has the upper 256 kernel entries (directory indices 768–1023) pre-populated with kernel page tables that are shared across all processes. Any other split is valid — Windows 2000 used 2GB/2GB; some embedded Linux configurations use 1GB/3GB for processes that need more than 3GB of virtual address space. The key constraint on 32-bit: user + kernel virtual ranges must fit in 4GB.\n\n### Page Table Construction — Before Paging Is On\n\nThe page tables must be built and populated while paging is still off (using physical addresses directly). After paging enables, you must access page tables through their virtual addresses (if you moved them to higher-half virtual space) or through the identity-mapped physical addresses.\n\n```c\n/* vmm.c — Virtual Memory Manager */\n#include \"vmm.h\"\n#include \"pmm.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n#include <string.h>\n\n/* The boot page directory — aligned to 4KB boundary */\n__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))\nstatic pde_t boot_page_directory[1024];\n\n/* A static page table for identity-mapping the first 4MB\n   (covers kernel at 0x100000, VGA at 0xB8000, all low memory) */\n__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))\nstatic pte_t identity_page_table[1024];   /* Maps virtual 0x0–0x3FFFFF */\n\n/* A static page table for the higher-half kernel (virtual 0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF) */\n__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))\nstatic pte_t kernel_page_table[1024];     /* Maps virtual 0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF */\n```\n\n> **`__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))`**: Page directory and page table structures must start at a 4KB-aligned address. The CPU reads the physical address from CR3 and the PDE's frame field — both assume 4KB alignment. GCC's `aligned` attribute instructs the linker to place this variable at a 4KB-aligned address. If you put these in BSS (as static variables), the linker honors the alignment. If you allocate them dynamically, use `pmm_alloc_frame()` which always returns 4KB-aligned physical addresses.\n\nPopulating the page tables:\n\n```c\nvoid vmm_init(void) {\n    /* ── Step 1: Clear the page directory ── */\n    memset(boot_page_directory, 0, sizeof(boot_page_directory));\n\n    /* ── Step 2: Build identity map for virtual 0x0 – 0x3FFFFF (first 4MB) ──\n       This covers: real-mode IVT, BIOS data, VGA (0xB8000), kernel (0x100000)\n       Directory index for 0x00000000 → bits [31:22] = 0 */\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {\n        /* Virtual page i → Physical frame i (identity) */\n        identity_page_table[i] = (pte_t)((i * PAGE_SIZE) | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n    }\n    /* Install in page directory at index 0 (virtual 0x00000000–0x003FFFFF) */\n    boot_page_directory[0] =\n        (pde_t)((uintptr_t)identity_page_table | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n\n    /* ── Step 3: Build higher-half kernel map for virtual 0xC0000000 – 0xC03FFFFF ──\n       Maps to physical 0x00000000 – 0x003FFFFF (same frames as identity map)\n       Directory index for 0xC0000000 → bits [31:22] = 768 (0xC0000000 >> 22) */\n    for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {\n        /* Virtual page (768*1024 + i) → Physical frame i */\n        kernel_page_table[i] = (pte_t)((i * PAGE_SIZE) | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n    }\n    /* Install at directory index 768 */\n    boot_page_directory[768] =\n        (pde_t)((uintptr_t)kernel_page_table | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n\n    kprintf(\"[VMM] Page directory built. Identity [0x0–0x3FFFFF], \"\n            \"Higher-half [0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF]\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n> **Covering VGA with the identity map:** Physical `0xB8000` falls within the first 4MB identity-mapped range (it is less than `0x400000`). The identity map page table entry for this physical address sets `PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE` — no `PAGE_NOCACHE`. This is technically incorrect for a device MMIO region (VGA should be uncached), but for a simple kernel the caching effects are negligible since VGA writes are write-combining anyway on modern systems. For correctness, set `PAGE_NOCACHE | PAGE_WRITETHROUGH` on the VGA page table entries.\n\n---\n\n## Section 5: Enabling Paging — The Point of No Return\n\n\n![Paging Enablement: The Identity-Map Bootstrap Problem](./diagrams/diag-m3-paging-enable-sequence.svg)\n\n\nWith the page directory built, enabling paging is a three-instruction sequence. But those three instructions have precise ordering requirements:\n\n```c\nvoid vmm_enable_paging(void) {\n    /* ── Step 1: Load CR3 with the physical address of the page directory ──\n       CR3 must receive a PHYSICAL address — paging is not on yet, so\n       the CPU cannot translate a virtual address to find the PD. */\n    uint32_t pd_phys = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %0, %%cr3\" : : \"r\"(pd_phys));\n\n    /* ── Step 2: Set CR0.PG (bit 31) and CR0.WP (bit 16 — Write Protect)\n       WP: when set, ring 0 code cannot write to read-only user pages.\n           This enables copy-on-write semantics even for kernel accesses.\n       PG: enables paging. THE NEXT INSTRUCTION FETCH GOES THROUGH PAGE TABLES. */\n    uint32_t cr0;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr0, %0\" : \"=r\"(cr0));\n    cr0 |= (1U << 31);   /* CR0.PG = 1: enable paging */\n    cr0 |= (1U << 16);   /* CR0.WP = 1: write-protect enable */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %0, %%cr0\" : : \"r\"(cr0));\n\n    /* ── At this point, paging is ON. The identity map means this code\n       is still reachable at its current physical=virtual address.\n       The next lines execute at their physical addresses via the identity map. ── */\n\n    /* ── Step 3: Far jump to flush pipeline and begin using virtual addresses ──\n       (Optional for identity-mapped kernel; mandatory when jumping to higher-half) */\n    kprintf(\"[VMM] Paging enabled. Virtual memory is now active.\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n> **Why load CR3 before CR0.PG?** If you set CR0.PG first with CR3=0 (or garbage), the CPU immediately tries to do a page table walk from physical address 0, which is the real-mode IVT — clearly not a valid page directory. The page fault handler would then try to execute, also through an invalid table. CR3 must contain a valid page directory's physical address before you flip the paging bit.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** Setting `CR0.PG` invalidates the entire TLB automatically — the CPU assumes that switching from no-paging to paging mode means all previous (implicit identity) translations are invalid. This is the one TLB flush you get for free. After this point, every CR3 modification (switching page directories for different processes) also flushes the TLB — except for entries marked `PAGE_GLOBAL`, which survive CR3 reloads. Kernel pages marked global are thus TLB-persistent across process switches, eliminating the cost of re-walking kernel page tables on every context switch.\n\n### The Jump to Higher-Half Virtual Space\n\nAfter enabling paging, your code is still executing at low virtual addresses (via the identity map). If you want to transition to higher-half virtual addresses (so that your kernel runs at `0xC0100000` virtual rather than `0x100000`), you need a far jump or an indirect jump through a higher-half symbol:\n\n```c\n/* After paging is on, jump to the higher-half virtual address of kmain */\nextern void kmain_high(void);  /* Linked at 0xC0xxxxxx */\n\nvoid transition_to_higher_half(void) {\n    /* An indirect call through a function pointer forces the CPU to use\n       the higher-half address rather than the identity-mapped address */\n    void (*kmain_virt)(void) = (void (*)(void))((uintptr_t)&kmain_high);\n    kmain_virt();\n\n    /* Unmap the identity map now that we are in higher-half space */\n    boot_page_directory[0] = 0;            /* Remove identity PDE */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr3, %%eax; mov %%eax, %%cr3\" ::: \"eax\");  /* Flush TLB */\n}\n```\n\n> **This milestone's simplification:** For a learning kernel, running the kernel at its identity-mapped physical address throughout is acceptable. Higher-half mapping is the production approach (it prevents user processes from occupying the same virtual address range as the kernel), and the acceptance criteria require demonstrating both mappings. The critical property is that both exist simultaneously in the page directory, with the identity map removable once you have verified higher-half execution.\n\n---\n\n## Section 6: TLB Management — The Stale Translation Problem\n\nThe TLB is a small, fully-associative cache (typically 32–64 entries for the L1 DTLB, a few hundred for L2 TLB) that stores recently used `(virtual page, ASID) → physical frame` translations. Without the TLB, every memory access would require three additional memory reads (CR3 → PDE → PTE → data). The TLB reduces this to zero additional reads on a hit.\n\n\n![diag-m3-tlb-shootdown-model](./diagrams/diag-m3-tlb-shootdown-model.svg)\n\n\nThe TLB is not coherent with your page table modifications. When you change a PTE — mapping a virtual page to a new physical frame, or changing its flags from read-only to writable — the TLB may still contain the old translation. The CPU will serve accesses from the stale TLB entry, sending traffic to the wrong physical frame or enforcing wrong permissions, until the TLB entry is evicted or explicitly invalidated.\n\nThere are two invalidation mechanisms:\n\n**`invlpg` — Invalidate a single TLB entry** (specific virtual page):\n\n```c\nstatic inline void tlb_flush_page(uint32_t virtual_addr) {\n    /* invlpg [mem] invalidates the TLB entry for the page containing virtual_addr.\n       The operand is a memory address, not a value; we use a memory constraint. */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"invlpg (%0)\" : : \"r\"(virtual_addr) : \"memory\");\n}\n```\n\nUse `invlpg` when you are modifying a single PTE. It is precise — only the one translated page is invalidated. Cost: ~20 cycles on modern CPUs.\n\n**CR3 reload — Flush the entire TLB**:\n\n```c\nstatic inline void tlb_flush_all(void) {\n    /* Writing CR3 with the same value flushes all non-global TLB entries */\n    uint32_t cr3;\n    __asm__ volatile (\n        \"mov %%cr3, %0\\n\\t\"\n        \"mov %0, %%cr3\"\n        : \"=r\"(cr3)\n        :\n        : \"memory\"\n    );\n}\n```\n\nUse a CR3 reload when you have made many page table changes — for instance, after building a new process's page directory. It flushes all non-global entries. Cost: ~30 cycles for the reload itself, plus the cost of TLB cold misses on subsequent accesses (each miss requires a page table walk).\n\n> **Global pages (PAGE_GLOBAL):** If you set the `G` flag in a PTE and enable `CR4.PGE` (Page Global Enable), that TLB entry survives CR3 reloads. This is used for kernel pages that are mapped identically in every process's page directory — you do not want to flush and re-walk kernel page tables on every process switch. The identity-mapped kernel pages and higher-half kernel pages should be global.\n\nThe rule for your kernel: **every time you modify a PTE or PDE, call `tlb_flush_page()` for that virtual address** (or `tlb_flush_all()` if you modified many entries). Forgetting this is silent corruption — the stale translation sends accesses to the wrong frame, and the bug often manifests in unrelated code that accesses a page that has since been remapped.\n\n---\n\n## Section 7: The Page Fault Handler — CR2 as Your Diagnostic Oracle\n\nPage fault (exception 14) is the CPU's mechanism for saying: \"I tried to translate this virtual address and something was wrong.\" It is the most informative exception in the system — it fires for accessing unmapped pages, writing to read-only pages, and user-mode code touching supervisor-only pages. In future milestones, you will also use it for demand paging (allocate frames lazily on first access) and copy-on-write.\n\n\n![Page Fault Handler: CR2 Decoding and Response Decision Tree](./diagrams/diag-m3-page-fault-handler-decision-tree.svg)\n\n\nWhen a page fault fires, the CPU provides two pieces of information automatically:\n\n**CR2 — The Faulting Virtual Address:** The CPU stores the virtual address that caused the fault in `CR2`. This is the address the MMU tried to translate when the fault occurred. Your handler must read CR2 *immediately* — it is a CPU register that will be overwritten if another page fault occurs before you save it.\n\n**The Error Code** (pushed onto the stack by the CPU, already handled by your ISR framework from Milestone 2):\n\n```\nPage Fault Error Code (pushed by CPU):\n┌────────────────────────┬───┬───┬───┐\n│       Reserved (0)     │ U │ W │ P │\n│        [31:3]          │[2]│[1]│[0]│\n└────────────────────────┴───┴───┴───┘\nP (bit 0): 0 = Page not present (PTE.P was 0)\n           1 = Protection violation (page present but wrong permissions)\nW (bit 1): 0 = Fault caused by a read\n           1 = Fault caused by a write\nU (bit 2): 0 = Fault in supervisor mode (ring 0)\n           1 = Fault in user mode (ring 3)\n```\n\nThe combination of these three bits tells you everything about the nature of the fault:\n\n| P | W | U | Meaning |\n|---|---|---|---------|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | Kernel read of unmapped page — null pointer dereference in kernel? |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | Kernel write of unmapped page — stack overflow, heap corruption? |\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | User read of unmapped page — user null pointer dereference |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | User write of unmapped page — user null pointer dereference (write) |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | User read of kernel page — security violation (U/S=0 page) |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | User write of kernel page — security violation |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | Kernel write to read-only page — kernel bug, or COW trigger |\n\nThe page fault handler is already registered at vector 14 in your IDT from Milestone 2. Now you give it meaningful behavior:\n\n```c\n/* In interrupt.c — page fault handler (exception 14) */\nvoid page_fault_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    /* Read CR2: the faulting virtual address */\n    uint32_t faulting_addr;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr2, %0\" : \"=r\"(faulting_addr));\n\n    /* Decode the error code */\n    int present = frame->error_code & 0x1;   /* P bit */\n    int write   = frame->error_code & 0x2;   /* W bit */\n    int user    = frame->error_code & 0x4;   /* U bit */\n\n    kprintf(\"\\n=== PAGE FAULT ===\\n\");\n    kprintf(\"Faulting address (CR2): 0x%08x\\n\", faulting_addr);\n    kprintf(\"Error: %s%s%s\\n\",\n            present ? \"protection-violation \" : \"page-not-present \",\n            write   ? \"write \" : \"read \",\n            user    ? \"user-mode\" : \"kernel-mode\");\n    kprintf(\"Fault at EIP: 0x%08x\\n\", frame->eip);\n\n    /* Security check: user process touching kernel space */\n    if (user && faulting_addr >= 0xC0000000) {\n        kprintf(\"SECURITY: User process attempted to access kernel memory.\\n\");\n        /* In Milestone 4, this kills the offending process.\n           For now, halt. */\n    }\n\n    /* Kernel null pointer dereference */\n    if (!user && faulting_addr < PAGE_SIZE) {\n        kprintf(\"KERNEL BUG: Null pointer dereference in kernel code!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    /* For now: all page faults are fatal. Milestone 4+ adds demand paging here. */\n    kprintf(\"System halted.\\n\");\n    for (;;) { __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\"); }\n}\n```\n\n> **Why is CR2 read in the fault handler rather than in the ISR stub?** The ISR stub saves general-purpose registers via `pusha`, but `CR2` is not a general-purpose register — `pusha` does not touch it. You must read `CR2` explicitly in your handler. The window between CR2 being set by the hardware and your handler reading it is safe: another page fault cannot fire while you are in the fault handler (interrupts are disabled via the interrupt gate, and exceptions that fire in ring 0 with the current interrupt gate settings would immediately cause a double fault rather than a nested page fault invocation).\n\n---\n\n## Section 8: Dynamic Page Table Management — vmm_map_page\n\nThe static identity and higher-half mappings you built during `vmm_init` cover only the first 4MB. As your kernel allocates new data structures, stack space, and heap memory beyond 4MB, you need a function to map arbitrary virtual pages to physical frames on demand.\n\n```c\n/* vmm.c — dynamic page table management */\n\n/* Map a single virtual page to a physical frame with given flags.\n   Allocates a new page table if the directory entry is not present. */\nvoid vmm_map_page(pde_t *page_directory,\n                  uint32_t virt_addr,\n                  uint32_t phys_addr,\n                  uint32_t flags) {\n    /* Extract directory and table indices from virtual address */\n    uint32_t dir_idx   = virt_addr >> 22;          /* Bits [31:22] */\n    uint32_t table_idx = (virt_addr >> 12) & 0x3FF; /* Bits [21:12] */\n\n    pde_t *pde = &page_directory[dir_idx];\n\n    if (!(*pde & PAGE_PRESENT)) {\n        /* No page table exists for this directory entry yet.\n           Allocate a new physical frame for the page table. */\n        void *new_table_phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\n        if (!new_table_phys) {\n            kprintf(\"[VMM] FATAL: Cannot allocate page table frame.\\n\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        /* Zero the new page table (all entries: not present) */\n        memset(new_table_phys, 0, PAGE_SIZE);\n\n        /* Install the page table in the directory */\n        *pde = (pde_t)((uintptr_t)new_table_phys | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE |\n                       (flags & PAGE_USER));  /* Propagate user bit to PDE */\n\n        /* Flush TLB for this directory entry */\n        tlb_flush_page((uint32_t)pde);\n    }\n\n    /* Get pointer to the page table */\n    pte_t *page_table = (pte_t *)(PDE_FRAME(*pde));\n\n    /* Install the mapping */\n    page_table[table_idx] = (pte_t)(phys_addr | PAGE_PRESENT | flags);\n\n    /* Flush the specific virtual address from TLB */\n    tlb_flush_page(virt_addr);\n}\n\n/* Unmap a virtual page (set PTE to not-present) */\nvoid vmm_unmap_page(pde_t *page_directory, uint32_t virt_addr) {\n    uint32_t dir_idx   = virt_addr >> 22;\n    uint32_t table_idx = (virt_addr >> 12) & 0x3FF;\n\n    pde_t pde = page_directory[dir_idx];\n    if (!(pde & PAGE_PRESENT)) return;  /* Already not mapped */\n\n    pte_t *page_table = (pte_t *)(PDE_FRAME(pde));\n    page_table[table_idx] = 0;          /* Clear the PTE (P=0: not present) */\n\n    tlb_flush_page(virt_addr);  /* MANDATORY: remove stale TLB entry */\n}\n```\n\n> **Accessing page tables after paging is enabled:** In the code above, `(pte_t *)(PDE_FRAME(*pde))` accesses the page table using its *physical* address as if it were a virtual address. This works only because the identity map is active — physical address `X` is also accessible at virtual address `X`. Once you remove the identity map (after higher-half transition), you cannot access page tables this way. Production kernels solve this with the **recursive page directory** technique: one PDE points back to the page directory itself, making all page tables accessible at fixed virtual addresses. Alternatively, map all page tables into a dedicated kernel virtual address range. Both techniques are valuable to know; for this milestone, keeping the identity map active simplifies page table management considerably.\n\n---\n\n## Section 9: The Kernel Heap — kmalloc and kfree\n\nThe physical frame allocator gives you 4KB chunks. The page table manager maps them into virtual address space. But kernel code constantly needs variable-sized allocations: a 24-byte PCB (Process Control Block), a 36-byte interrupt descriptor, a 512-byte keyboard buffer. Allocating an entire 4KB frame for each of these wastes approximately 99% of the frame. You need a **heap allocator** — a subsystem that manages a region of virtual address space and provides variable-size allocation within it.\n\n\n![Kernel Heap: kmalloc Virtual Address Space Layout](./diagrams/diag-m3-kmalloc-heap-layout.svg)\n\n\nThe kernel heap allocator (`kmalloc`/`kfree`) works in two layers:\n1. **Virtual address space management**: A dedicated virtual address range (say, `0xD0000000`–`0xDFFFFFFF` — 256MB) is reserved for the heap. The heap grows upward from `0xD0000000` as memory is needed.\n2. **Physical frame backing**: As the heap grows, new 4KB frames are allocated from `pmm_alloc_frame()` and mapped into the virtual heap region via `vmm_map_page()`.\n\nA minimal first-fit heap allocator sufficient for this milestone:\n\n```c\n/* heap.c — kernel heap allocator */\n#include \"heap.h\"\n#include \"pmm.h\"\n#include \"vmm.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n\n#define HEAP_START    0xD0000000   /* Virtual address where heap begins */\n#define HEAP_MAX      0xDFFFFFFF   /* Virtual address where heap ends */\n#define HEAP_MAGIC    0xDEADBEEF   /* Canary value for block header validation */\n\n/* Each allocation is preceded by a header and followed by a footer */\ntypedef struct heap_block {\n    uint32_t          magic;    /* HEAP_MAGIC — detect header corruption */\n    uint32_t          size;     /* Size of the usable region (excluding header+footer) */\n    uint8_t           free;     /* 1 = free, 0 = allocated */\n    struct heap_block *next;    /* Next block in the heap (doubly-linked for coalescing) */\n    struct heap_block *prev;    /* Previous block */\n} heap_block_t;\n\n/* Heap state */\nstatic uint32_t heap_start   = HEAP_START;\nstatic uint32_t heap_end     = HEAP_START;   /* Current end of mapped heap */\nstatic heap_block_t *heap_head = NULL;       /* First block */\n\n/* Extend the heap by adding one more physical frame (4KB) */\nstatic void heap_expand(void) {\n    if (heap_end >= HEAP_MAX) {\n        kprintf(\"[HEAP] FATAL: Heap exhausted at 0x%x\\n\", heap_end);\n        for (;;);\n    }\n\n    /* Allocate a physical frame */\n    void *phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\n    if (!phys) {\n        kprintf(\"[HEAP] FATAL: pmm_alloc_frame() returned NULL\\n\");\n        for (;;);\n    }\n\n    /* Map the new frame at the current heap_end virtual address */\n    vmm_map_page(boot_page_directory,\n                 heap_end,\n                 (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)phys,\n                 PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n\n    heap_end += PAGE_SIZE;\n}\n\nvoid heap_init(void) {\n    /* Map the first page of the heap */\n    heap_expand();\n\n    /* Initialize the first (and only) free block spanning the entire first page */\n    heap_head = (heap_block_t *)(uintptr_t)heap_start;\n    heap_head->magic = HEAP_MAGIC;\n    heap_head->size  = PAGE_SIZE -

On a 32-bit system: `magic`(4) + `size`(4) + `free`(1) + padding(3) + `next`(4) + `prev`(4) = 20 bytes header per allocation. A 4-byte integer allocation thus uses 24 bytes — 600% overhead. This is the same trade-off glibc's malloc makes, though glibc uses a 16-byte header and encodes the `free` flag in the low bits of `size` (exploiting alignment guarantees). The overhead is acceptable for kernel allocations; for user-mode workloads with millions of small allocations, jemalloc's size-class slabs eliminate per-object headers entirely.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The heap allocator's `first-fit` search walks a linked list of block headers. Each header is at an unpredictable address (wherever the previous allocation ended). This is a **pointer-chasing** access pattern — the address of `block->next` is read, then used to fetch the next block header, which is at an arbitrary address not adjacent to the current one. Every block access is likely an L1 or L2 cache miss if the heap has cooled. This is why production allocators (jemalloc, tcmalloc) organize objects into **size-class slabs**: all 32-byte objects live in contiguous 4KB slabs, so scanning free slots within a slab is sequential (cache-friendly). The linked-list header approach trades simplicity for cache performance. For a kernel with hundreds of allocations rather than millions, it is the right trade-off.\n\n---\n\n## Section 10: The Complete Memory Subsystem Initialization\n\nBringing all three components together in `kmain()`, inserted after Milestone 2's interrupt setup and before any dynamic memory use:\n\n```c\n/* kmain.c */\nvoid kmain(multiboot_info_t *mbi) {\n    /* Milestone 1 */\n    serial_init();\n    vga_clear();\n    kprintf(\"=== Kernel booting ===\\n\");\n\n    /* Milestone 2 */\n    idt_setup_all();\n    pic_remap(0x20, 0x28);\n    pit_init(100);\n    keyboard_init();\n    __asm__ volatile (\"sti\");\n\n    /* Milestone 3: Memory management */\n\n    /* Step A: Parse physical memory map from bootloader */\n    pmm_parse_memory_map(mbi);   /* Prints memory regions; determines usable frames */\n\n    /* Step B: Initialize physical frame allocator */\n    pmm_init(mbi);               /* Builds bitmap; marks kernel + reserved frames as used */\n\n    /* Step C: Build page tables and enable virtual memory */\n    vmm_init();                  /* Constructs page directory with identity + higher-half maps */\n    vmm_enable_paging();         /* Loads CR3, sets CR0.PG — from this point, paging is on */\n\n    /* Step D: Initialize kernel heap */\n    heap_init();                 /* Maps first heap page; initializes free block list */\n\n    kprintf(\"[M3] Memory subsystem ready.\\n\");\n    kprintf(\"[M3] Physical frames: %u free / %u total\\n\",\n            pmm_frames_free(), pmm_frames_free() + pmm_frames_used());\n\n    /* Verify kmalloc/kfree */\n    void *p1 = kmalloc(64);\n    void *p2 = kmalloc(128);\n    kprintf(\"[M3] kmalloc test: p1=0x%x p2=0x%x\\n\", p1, p2);\n    kfree(p1);\n    void *p3 = kmalloc(32);   /* Should reuse p1's space */\n    kprintf(\"[M3] kfree+realloc test: p3=0x%x (should be near p1)\\n\", p3);\n    kfree(p2);\n    kfree(p3);\n\n    /* Verify page fault handler */\n    kprintf(\"[M3] Testing page fault handler...

More subtly: `vmm_init()` itself allocates no physical frames (it uses statically declared page tables) but `vmm_map_page()` inside `heap_init()` does call `pmm_alloc_frame()`. The ordering is load-bearing.\n\n---\n\n## Section 11: The Three-Level View — What \"Access Virtual Address\" Truly Means\n\nTracing a single memory read instruction through the complete stack, from C source to physics:\n\n**Level 1 — The Application:**\nYour kernel code writes `int x = *ptr;` where `ptr` is a virtual address `0xD0001234` (somewhere in the kernel heap). The C compiler emits a `mov eax, [0xD0001234]` instruction (or equivalent with a register holding the address).\n\n**Level 2 — The MMU and Page Table Walk:**\nThe CPU's MMU intercepts the memory access. It extracts the directory index: `0xD0001234 >> 22 = 0x340 = 832`. It reads `page_directory[832]` from the physical address held in CR3 — this is a memory read from the page directory frame. If TLB hits: done in 1 cycle. If TLB miss: the MMU reads the PDE, extracts the page table's physical address, reads `page_table[(0xD0001234 >> 12) & 0x3FF]` from that frame, extracts the physical frame address, adds the offset `0x234`, and loads from that final physical address. Result: 3 memory reads for the translation + 1 for the actual data = 4 total. The successful translation is cached in the TLB for subsequent accesses to the same page.\n\n**Level 3 — Cache Hierarchy and DRAM:**\nThe PDE read hits L2 cache (the page directory is hot from recent allocations). The PTE read may be an L3 hit or a DRAM access — 10ns or 60ns respectively. The data read at `0xD0001234` (physical `0x00201234` after translation, say) is likely in L1 or L2 if recently accessed. The total cost for a TLB-miss access to cold data: ~200 cycles (TLB miss table walk + L3 misses). A TLB-hit access to L1-cached data: 4–5 cycles. The 50× difference is why TLB working set matters: if your kernel touches more unique pages than the TLB can hold (~64 pages for L1 DTLB), you pay the full 200-cycle penalty on every access, no matter how aggressively the CPU prefetches.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The TLB on modern x86 CPUs is split into separate L1 instruction TLB (iTLB) and L1 data TLB (dTLB), each typically 32–64 entries. An L2 TLB (stlb — shared translation cache) holds 512–4096 entries. For a kernel with a few dozen active pages (page tables, heap blocks, stack), the working set fits in L1 TLB and the translation overhead is effectively zero. For a process with many active virtual memory areas (a large application with hundreds of mapped regions), stlb pressure causes measurable throughput degradation — this is why Linux's **huge pages** (2MB pages using PSE extension) dramatically improve performance for large working sets: 2MB pages occupy only 1 TLB entry instead of 512, reducing stlb pressure by 512×.\n\n---\n\n## Pitfalls Reference — The Five Reasons This Milestone Kills Your Kernel\n\n| Pitfall | Why It Kills You | Prevention |\n|---------|-----------------|------------|\n| Enabling paging without identity map | CPU fetches next instruction via page tables; unmapped → immediate page fault → triple fault | Build identity map covering executing code *before* CR0.PG |\n| Forgetting TLB flush after PTE modification | Old translation served from TLB; write goes to wrong physical frame; read returns stale data | `invlpg` after every PTE change; CR3 reload after bulk changes |\n| PMM marks kernel frames as free | Allocator hands out frames occupied by kernel code; next write corrupts executing instructions | Mark frames from `__kernel_start_phys` to `__kernel_end_phys` as used during `pmm_init` |\n| Page table frames not marked used in PMM | Page allocator reuses frames holding your page tables; MMU reads garbage; instant fault | After building boot page tables, mark their physical frames as used in the bitmap |\n| CR2 not read immediately in page fault handler | CR2 is overwritten if another page fault fires (e.g., kprintf causes a fault while printing the first fault) | Save CR2 to a local variable as the very first line of the page fault handler |\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Cascade — What This Milestone Unlocks\n\nYou have built the abstraction layer that every system above it depends on. The connections extend in every direction.\n\n**1. TLB shootdowns in SMP — the distributed cache invalidation problem**\n\nYour single-core kernel flushes one TLB with `invlpg` or a CR3 reload. On a multi-core machine, each core has its own private TLB — a CPU with 8 cores has 8 separate TLB arrays, each caching independent translation snapshots. When core 0 modifies a PTE (say, freeing a page and reassigning its physical frame), cores 1–7 still have the old translation cached. If core 1 accesses that virtual address before its TLB is flushed, it reads from the physical frame that now belongs to a *different* process — a catastrophic security violation.\n\nThe solution is **TLB shootdown**: core 0 sends an **IPI (Inter-Processor Interrupt — a hardware mechanism for one CPU core to interrupt another)** to all other cores, triggering an interrupt handler that each core runs to flush its own TLB for the modified address. Linux's `flush_tlb_others()` function does exactly this, using the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) to broadcast IPIs. The cost: a single `invlpg` on a 16-core machine requires 15 IPIs, each costing ~500 cycles to deliver and process. TLB shootdowns are a significant bottleneck in memory-intensive workloads on many-core systems. This is the hardware analog of distributed cache invalidation — the same problem that makes cache coherence in distributed databases so expensive. Your single-core `invlpg` is the prototype.\n\n**2. Demand paging — the page fault handler as a lazy evaluator**\n\nYour current page fault handler prints a diagnostic and halts. That is only one possible response. When the kernel knows that a page fault at a given address is *expected* — because the page has been allocated virtually but not yet backed by a physical frame — the correct response is to allocate a frame, map it, and return from the fault handler. The CPU will retry the faulting instruction, which now succeeds.\n\nThis is **demand paging**: physical frames are allocated only when a page is first accessed, not when it is first mapped. `malloc(1000000000)` in Linux returns immediately — Linux maps 1GB of virtual address space but allocates zero physical frames. The first write to any page triggers a fault, the kernel allocates a frame (zeroed, via the zero page copy-on-write mechanism from Milestone 1's cascade), maps it, and returns. Only the pages you actually touch cost physical memory. Your `CR2 → PTE lookup → allocate frame → vmm_map_page → return` sequence is the complete implementation. **Memory-mapped files** (Linux `mmap(fd, ...)`) use the same path: the page fault handler checks if the faulting address corresponds to a file-backed region, reads the page from disk into a fresh frame, maps it, and returns. Every `mmap` in Linux ultimately runs through a path structurally identical to your page fault handler. **Guard pages** (the unmapped page at the end of every thread's stack, which causes a segfault on stack overflow rather than silent corruption) are simply pages with a not-present PTE — P=0.\n\n**3. The bitmap allocator's cache behavior — tracing a lineage to jemalloc**\n\nYour 128KB bitmap has a critical property: scanning it for a free frame is a sequential read. A CPU hardware prefetcher detects sequential access patterns and loads cache lines before the CPU requests them. The result: after the first scan warms the cache, subsequent allocations read from L2 or L3 cache at ~10ns per cache line rather than ~60ns DRAM. This cache-friendliness is the bitmap's decisive advantage over a free list of physical frames.\n\nThe same trade-off governs user-space allocator design. **jemalloc** (used by Firefox, FreeBSD's libc, and Rust's global allocator) uses **size-class arenas**: all objects of size 8, 16, 32, 64, ... 512 bytes each live in separate **slabs** (contiguous 4KB–2MB pages). Allocating a 32-byte object means scanning a slab's free-slot bitmap — sequential, cache-friendly, same as your frame bitmap. **tcmalloc** (Google's allocator, used in Chrome and many internal services) adds per-thread caches of pre-allocated objects to eliminate lock contention entirely. **Linux's SLUB allocator** (the kernel's own object allocator, above the frame allocator) partitions kernel objects by type into per-CPU caches — `kmem_cache_alloc(task_struct_cache)` is a single list pop, costing ~5ns. Your kmalloc's linked-list first-fit scan is the conceptually simplest version of a problem that has driven 40 years of allocator research.\n\n**4. Higher-half kernel mapping as the conceptual origin of KASLR**\n\nMapping the kernel at virtual `0xC0000000` while it loads at physical `0x100000` establishes a clean separation: kernel virtual addresses and physical addresses are different numbers, connected only by the page table. This separation is the foundation of **KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization)** — instead of always mapping the kernel at `0xC0000000`, the kernel adds a random offset at boot time (say, `0xC0000000 + 0x3A00000`) and builds page tables reflecting that random offset. An attacker who wants to exploit a kernel vulnerability needs to know where kernel code and data live in virtual memory. KASLR defeats this by making the layout unpredictable. On Linux, the randomized kernel virtual base is printed in `/proc/kallsyms` but requires root to read — because knowing the address breaks KASLR. You now understand exactly what that file contains and why it is gated. **SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Protection)** and **SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Protection)** are hardware extensions to the page table flag model you just implemented: SMEP prevents the kernel from executing code at user-mode virtual addresses (U/S=1 pages), preventing jump-to-userspace ROP attacks; SMAP prevents the kernel from reading user-mode memory without explicitly setting the AC flag.\n\n**5. kmalloc as the kernel's malloc — why glibc, jemalloc, and SLUB all exist**\n\nYou just implemented a first-fit heap with block headers. glibc's malloc is structurally similar for the general case: a doubly-linked list of free chunks, with headers encoding size and free status, and first-fit or best-fit search. But glibc adds: bins for common sizes (avoiding scan for 8, 16, 32, 64-byte allocations), **mmap** for large allocations (bypassing the heap entirely for allocations above 128KB, returning them directly to the OS on free), and thread arenas (per-thread heaps to avoid lock contention). The fundamental insight your kernel teaches: **heap allocation is fundamentally a virtual address space management problem backed by page-granular physical memory**. `sbrk()` (the traditional Unix heap expansion syscall) does what your `heap_expand()` does — asks the OS to map one more page at the end of the heap virtual range. Linux `mmap(MAP_ANONYMOUS)` does the same but for arbitrary-address allocations. Every user-space allocator is building a variable-size allocation service on top of page-granular OS primitives — exactly what you just built for the kernel.\n\n---\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n<!-- MS_ID: build-os-m4 -->\n# Milestone 4: Processes and Preemptive Scheduling\n\n## The Revelation: Two Lies You Believe About Context Switching\n\nHere is what every developer who has used threads, goroutines, or async/await believes about context switching: it is a high-level software operation, roughly like `setjmp`/`longjmp` — save some state into a struct, restore it later, resume. The OS is in control throughout. The second belief follows naturally: ring 3 to ring 0 transitions are automatic. You call a syscall, the CPU \"just knows\" to switch to kernel mode, and the kernel runs on some preexisting kernel stack.\n\nBoth beliefs are wrong in ways that will corrupt your kernel silently before crashing it spectacularly.\n\n**The first lie — context switching is like setjmp:** A context switch must save every register the CPU has, including `EFLAGS` (the flags register containing the carry flag, zero flag, interrupt flag, and a dozen others), using assembly. Not C. If you write the context switch in C, the C compiler saves and restores the registers it uses — but the CPU still has values in registers the compiler did not touch. When the interrupted process resumes, those registers contain whatever the scheduler left in them. The bug manifests not in the scheduler but in the interrupted process, when it uses a register it believes it saved but was actually clobbered. The failure happens tens of thousands of instructions after the switch. There is no immediate error. This class of bug has driven systems programmers mad for decades.\n\n**The second lie — ring transitions are automatic:** The CPU does know how to transition from ring 3 to ring 0 when an interrupt fires. What it does not know, without explicit configuration, is *which kernel stack to use*. The CPU hardware reads this from a data structure called the **TSS (Task State Segment — a hardware-defined memory region that the CPU reads directly on privilege transitions)**, specifically from a field called `ESP0` (the ring 0 stack pointer). If you have three processes and TSS.ESP0 still points to the kernel stack of process 1 when process 2 is running, then every interrupt that fires while process 2 is executing pushes the interrupt frame onto process 1's kernel stack. The kernel handler executes, modifying process 1's stack. Process 1 later resumes from its corrupted stack. The failure is distant, silent, and maddening.\n\nThe fix for both problems is the same principle: **the CPU is not a cooperative abstraction layer. It is hardware that executes exactly what you configure, nothing more.** Configuring it correctly requires understanding what it does at the instruction level.\n\n\n![diag-m4-privilege-ring-model](./diagrams/diag-m4-privilege-ring-model.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## Section 1: The Process Control Block — One Structure to Name Them All\n\nBefore you can switch between processes, you need a place to put a process's state when it is not running. This is the **PCB (Process Control Block)** — a kernel data structure that holds everything the CPU needs to restore a process to exactly the state it was in when preempted.\n\n{{DIAGRAM:diag-m4-pcb-structure}}\n\nThe PCB is not a software abstraction — it is a hardware requirement with a software body. The CPU gives you nothing for free: no automatic state saving, no process table, no PID. You define the structure; you fill it in; you restore from it. The CPU only helps by executing your assembly code correctly.\n\nWhat must a PCB store? Start from the CPU's state when an interrupt fires and work backward:\n\n**CPU register state** — everything the CPU had in its registers at the moment the timer IRQ fired. This includes:\n- All 8 general-purpose registers: `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP`, `ESP`\n- The instruction pointer: `EIP` (where to resume execution)\n- The flags register: `EFLAGS` (interrupt enable state, condition codes, I/O privilege level)\n- Segment registers: `CS`, `DS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`, `SS` (critical for distinguishing ring 0 from ring 3 processes)\n\n**Memory state** — which address space this process lives in:\n- The physical address of this process's page directory (`CR3` value)\n- When the scheduler restores a process, loading its `CR3` value simultaneously switches the entire address space\n\n**Scheduling state** — metadata the scheduler needs:\n- PID (Process IDentifier — a unique integer name for this process)\n- Process state: `READY` (can run), `RUNNING` (currently executing), `BLOCKED` (waiting for I/O or event)\n- Kernel stack pointer (the kernel stack is per-process; TSS.ESP0 must point here)\n- Optionally: priority, time slice remaining, accumulated CPU time\n\n```c\n/* process.h */\n#ifndef PROCESS_H\n#define PROCESS_H\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include \"page.h\"   /* pde_t, PAGE_SIZE */\n\n#define MAX_PROCESSES    16\n#define KERNEL_STACK_SIZE 4096   /* 4KB per-process kernel stack */\n\n/* Process states */\ntypedef enum {\n    PROCESS_UNUSED  = 0,   /* Slot in process table is empty */\n    PROCESS_READY   = 1,   /* Can be scheduled; not currently running */\n    PROCESS_RUNNING = 2,   /* Currently executing on CPU */\n    PROCESS_BLOCKED = 3,   /* Waiting for an event (I/O, sleep, etc.) */\n    PROCESS_ZOMBIE  = 4,   /* Finished execution; waiting for parent to collect exit code */\n} process_state_t;\n\n/* Saved CPU register state — must match the layout that context_switch.asm\n   pushes and pops.

The kernel stack is 4096 bytes. Total PCB size ≈ 4 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 52 + 4 + 4096 + 4 = ~4200 bytes per process. For 16 processes: ~67KB of kernel BSS. This fits in the 128KB kernel region with room to spare. The `__attribute__((aligned(16)))` on the kernel stack ensures the stack pointer is 16-byte aligned from the start, satisfying the System V ABI's calling convention requirement — if your kernel calls any function that uses SSE instructions, an unaligned stack causes a General Protection Fault.\n\n> **Why `kernel_stack_top` is stored in the PCB:** The kernel stack grows downward. `kernel_stack[0]` is the lowest address; `kernel_stack[KERNEL_STACK_SIZE - 1]` is the highest. A stack that starts \"at the top\" begins at `kernel_stack + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE` and grows toward `kernel_stack`. When you initialize a new process's kernel stack, you push the initial register values from `kernel_stack_top` downward. When TSS.ESP0 must be updated to point to this process's kernel stack, you use `kernel_stack_top` — not `kernel_stack`.\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: The Context Switch — Assembly Is Not Optional\n\nThis is the most conceptually important routine in the entire OS. Every developer who has implemented a context switch in C first, then spent two days debugging register corruption, eventually arrives at the same conclusion: the context switch must be written in assembly.\n\n\n![Context Switch: Register Save/Restore Assembly Flow](./diagrams/diag-m4-context-switch-assembly.svg)\n\n\nHere is why C is insufficient. The C calling convention (for x86 System V ABI) specifies that `EAX`, `ECX`, and `EDX` are **caller-saved**: the calling function assumes the callee will trash them, so the caller saves them before the call if it needs them afterward. `EBX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP` are **callee-saved**: the callee must preserve them across the call.\n\nIf you write `void context_switch(process_t *from, process_t *to)` in C, the compiler generates code that:\n1. Saves `EBX`, `ESI`, `EDI`, `EBP` on the stack (callee-saved convention)\n2. Does your switching logic\n3. Restores those four registers from the stack and executes `ret`\n\nWhat the compiler does *not* save: `EAX`, `ECX`, `EDX` (caller-saved — the caller is supposed to handle them), and critically, **EFLAGS** (the flags register that no C calling convention saves, because C code does not assume flag values persist across function calls).\n\nBut the interrupted process's caller did not save `EAX`, `ECX`, `EDX` and `EFLAGS` — it was in the middle of executing arbitrary code when the timer IRQ fired. Those registers contain that process's live state. When a context switch written in C trashes `EAX` because it used `EAX` for intermediate calculations, and then restores the process later without `EAX`'s original value, the resumed process runs with the wrong value in `EAX`. Depending on what it was computing, this is anywhere from harmless to fatal.\n\nThe solution: the context switch takes place at the interrupt boundary, where the ISR stack frame is already laid out. You save *everything* in assembly before C code touches a single register, and restore *everything* in assembly after C code is done.\n\n\n![Per-Process Kernel Stack Layout During Context Switch](./diagrams/diag-m4-kernel-stack-per-process.svg)\n\n\n### The Mechanical Design\n\nThe timer IRQ handler (from Milestone 2) already saves all general-purpose registers via `pusha` and the segment registers explicitly. At that point, the stack contains a complete snapshot of the interrupted process's CPU state. The context switch does not need to save anything — it just needs to:\n\n1. Record the current stack pointer in the current process's PCB (so we can find the saved state later)\n2. Call the C scheduler to select the next process\n3. Update TSS.ESP0 to the next process's kernel stack top\n4. If switching address spaces, load the new process's `CR3`\n5. Load the new process's saved stack pointer\n6. Execute `iret` — which restores `EFLAGS`, `CS`, `EIP` (and `SS`, `ESP` for ring 3) from the new process's saved state\n\nThis design means the context switch is not a separate \"save all registers then restore all registers\" operation — it rides the back of the IRQ handler's existing save/restore infrastructure. The IRQ stub saves state on entry and restores state on exit. The context switch hijacks the \"exit\" phase: instead of restoring the current process's state, it pivots to the next process's saved state.\n\n```c\n/* sched.h */\n#ifndef SCHED_H\n#define SCHED_H\n\n#include \"process.h\"\n\nvoid sched_init(void);\nvoid sched_tick(void);    /* Called from timer IRQ handler */\nvoid sched_yield(void);   /* Called by kernel code to voluntarily yield */\n\n/* Declared in context_switch.asm; never call directly */\nextern void context_switch_asm(uint32_t *old_esp, uint32_t new_esp, uint32_t new_cr3);\n\n#endif\n```\n\n```nasm\n; context_switch.asm\n; void context_switch_asm(uint32_t *old_esp, uint32_t new_esp, uint32_t new_cr3)\n;\n; Called FROM WITHIN the IRQ common stub, AFTER pusha and segment register saves.\n; The stack at this point contains the complete saved state of the current process.\n; Arguments on stack (cdecl): [esp+4]=old_esp ptr, [esp+8]=new_esp, [esp+12]=new_cr3\n\n[bits 32]\n[global context_switch_asm]\n\ncontext_switch_asm:\n    ; ── Save the current process's kernel stack pointer ──\n    ; After the cdecl call setup, esp points to our return address.\n    ; The caller's esp (which holds the saved process state) is at\n    ; the value esp had BEFORE the call pushed the return address.\n    ; cdecl: [esp+4]=old_esp_ptr, [esp+8]=new_esp, [esp+12]=new_cr3\n    mov eax, [esp + 4]    ; EAX = address of current process's saved_esp field\n    mov [eax], esp         ; *old_esp = current esp (kernel stack pointer position)\n                           ; This records where the saved state lives on the stack.\n\n    ; ── Switch to the next process's kernel stack ──\n    mov esp, [esp + 8]     ; Wait — after we load [esp+8], esp changes!\n                           ; BUG: we need to save [esp+8] before modifying esp.\n                           ; Fix: load arguments first.\n    ; (Correct implementation below — argument loading before esp change)\n\n    ; ── Load new CR3 if address space is different ──\n    mov ecx, [esp + 12]    ; ECX = new_cr3\n    ; ...

The corrected version loads all arguments into registers before touching `esp`:\n\n```nasm\n; context_switch.asm — CORRECT implementation\n[bits 32]\n[global context_switch_asm]\n\ncontext_switch_asm:\n    ; Load all three arguments before touching ESP\n    ; (cdecl: return addr at [esp], args at [esp+4], [esp+8], [esp+12])\n    mov eax, [esp + 4]     ; EAX = &current->cpu.esp (where to save current esp)\n    mov ecx, [esp + 8]     ; ECX = next->cpu.esp     (new esp to restore)\n    mov edx, [esp + 12]    ; EDX = next->page_directory (new CR3, physical addr)\n\n    ; ── Step 1: Save current process kernel stack pointer ──\n    ; esp currently points to our return address (top of IRQ handler's saved state).\n    ; Saving esp here allows us to find the saved register state on resume.\n    mov [eax], esp\n\n    ; ── Step 2: Switch to next process's kernel stack ──\n    mov esp, ecx           ; From this point, we are on the next process's stack.\n                           ; The \"current\" process is now unreachable until resumed.\n\n    ; ── Step 3: Switch address space (load next process's page directory) ──\n    ; Only flush TLB if the address space is actually changing.\n    ; (Comparing CR3 to new CR3 avoids unnecessary TLB flush for kernel threads\n    ;  that share the kernel page directory.)\n    mov eax, cr3\n    cmp eax, edx\n    je  .same_address_space    ; Skip CR3 reload if page directory is the same\n    mov cr3, edx               ; Load new page directory — flushes non-global TLB\n.same_address_space:\n\n    ; ── Step 4: Return ──\n    ; At this point:\n    ; - esp points to the next process's saved stack state\n    ; - The stack holds: [return address to irq_common_stub]\n    ;                    then the next process's saved registers (pushed by pusha)\n    ;                    then the CPU-pushed interrupt frame (EFLAGS, CS, EIP [, SS, ESP])\n    ; Returning from this function pops the return address and jumps back to\n    ; irq_common_stub, which will then:\n    ;   pop gs, fs, es, ds   (restore segment registers)\n    ;   popa                  (restore general-purpose registers)\n    ;   add esp, 8            (pop vector + error code)\n    ;   iret                  (restore EIP, CS, EFLAGS [, ESP, SS for ring 3])\n    ; — all from the NEXT process's saved state on the new stack. \n    ret\n```\n\n> **The key insight:** `context_switch_asm` does not save or restore any general-purpose registers itself. The IRQ stub already saved them with `pusha` before calling the C dispatcher, and will restore them with `popa` after `context_switch_asm` returns. By switching `esp` to the next process's kernel stack, we redirect the subsequent `popa` and `iret` to restore the *next* process's registers. The switch happens between the `call context_switch_asm` and the `ret` — one line of assembly changes which process's context `iret` will restore.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The `mov esp, ecx` (stack pointer swap) is the most performance-critical moment. After this instruction, every subsequent stack access — `ret` pops the return address, `popa` reads 32 bytes, `iret` reads 12–20 bytes — goes to the *next* process's kernel stack, which is in a different physical page. If that page is cold (not in L1 cache), the cache miss costs ~60ns (L3 hit) or ~100ns (DRAM). On a 100Hz scheduler at 10ms intervals, the stack is almost certainly cold — it has not been touched in 10 million nanoseconds. This cold-stack startup cost is unavoidable; it is one of the fundamental reasons context switching has nonzero overhead even when the assembly is perfect.\n\n---\n\n## Section 3: The Scheduler — Round-Robin Over a Process Table\n\nWith the context switch mechanism defined, the scheduler decides *which* process to switch to. Round-robin is the simplest fair scheduler: cycle through the process table in order, giving each ready process one time slice, then move to the next.\n\n\n![Process State Machine and Round-Robin Scheduler](./diagrams/diag-m4-scheduler-state-machine.svg)\n\n\n```c\n/* sched.c — Round-robin preemptive scheduler */\n#include \"sched.h\"\n#include \"process.h\"\n#include \"tss.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n\nprocess_t  process_table[MAX_PROCESSES];\nprocess_t *current_process = NULL;\n\nstatic int sched_initialized = 0;\n\nvoid sched_init(void) {\n    /* Zero all PCB slots — state = PROCESS_UNUSED */\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PROCESSES; i++) {\n        process_table[i].state = PROCESS_UNUSED;\n        process_table[i].pid   = 0;\n    }\n    sched_initialized = 1;\n    kprintf(\"[SCHED] Scheduler initialized (%d slots).\\n\", MAX_PROCESSES);\n}\n\n/* Called from the timer IRQ handler (IRQ0, every 10ms at 100Hz) */\nvoid sched_tick(void) {\n    if (!sched_initialized || !current_process) return;\n\n    /* Decrement the current process's time slice */\n    if (current_process->ticks_remaining > 0) {\n        current_process->ticks_remaining--;\n        if (current_process->ticks_remaining > 0) {\n            return;   /* Slice not expired — keep running current process */\n        }\n    }\n\n    /* Time slice expired: find the next ready process */\n    sched_schedule();\n}\n\n/* Select and switch to the next ready process (round-robin) */\nvoid sched_schedule(void) {\n    process_t *old = current_process;\n\n    /* Find the index of the current process in the table */\n    int current_idx = (int)(old - process_table);\n\n    /* Search for next ready process, wrapping around */\n    process_t *next = NULL;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_PROCESSES; i++) {\n        int idx = (current_idx + i) % MAX_PROCESSES;\n        if (process_table[idx].state == PROCESS_READY) {\n            next = &process_table[idx];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!next) {\n        /* No other ready process — continue running current */\n        /* Reset its time slice so it gets a full new slice */\n        current_process->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Transition states */\n    if (old->state == PROCESS_RUNNING) {\n        old->state = PROCESS_READY;\n    }\n    next->state          = PROCESS_RUNNING;\n    next->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE;\n    current_process       = next;\n\n    /* ── Critical: update TSS.ESP0 to point to the NEXT process's kernel stack ──\n       This must happen BEFORE context_switch_asm, because if an interrupt fires\n       during or after the switch, the CPU reads TSS.ESP0 to find the kernel stack.\n       If TSS.ESP0 still points to the OLD process's stack, the interrupt handler\n       will push its frame there — corrupting the old process's saved state. */\n    tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top);\n\n    /* ── Perform the assembly context switch ──\n       Pass: address to save old esp, new esp value, new CR3 value */\n    context_switch_asm(\n        &old->cpu.esp,                           /* Where to save old kernel ESP */\n        next->cpu.esp,                           /* New kernel ESP to restore    */\n        (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)next->page_directory /* New CR3 (physical address)  */\n    );\n\n    /* ── Execution resumes here when THIS process is rescheduled ──\n       (The above call returns only when the old process runs again) */\n}\n\n#define SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE  5   /* 5 timer ticks × 10ms = 50ms per slice */\n```\n\n> **Why `sched_tick` and `sched_schedule` are separate:** `sched_tick` is called on every timer IRQ — 100 times per second. It decrements the slice counter and returns early (within ~10 cycles) if the slice has not expired. Separating the tick accounting from the scheduling decision keeps the common path (no context switch needed) extremely fast. `sched_schedule` is called only when a switch is warranted, and can also be called voluntarily by blocking code (`sched_yield()`) when a process needs to wait for I/O.\n\nThe timer handler in Milestone 2 now calls the scheduler:\n\n```c\n/* irq.c — updated timer handler */\nvoid timer_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    (void)frame;\n    pit_tick_count++;\n    sched_tick();   /* Potentially triggers a context switch */\n}\n```\n\n> **Interrupts during `sched_schedule`:** The timer IRQ fires with interrupts disabled (interrupt gate, IF cleared). `sched_schedule` runs with interrupts off. After `context_switch_asm` switches to the new process and `iret` executes, `EFLAGS` is restored — including the `IF` bit. If the new process had interrupts enabled (which it should, since it was running normal code when preempted), `iret` re-enables interrupts atomically as part of restoring EFLAGS. This is the correct behavior — interrupts are masked for the minimum possible duration (only during the scheduler's critical section).\n\n---\n\n## Section 4: The TSS — Hardware That Reads Your Configuration on Every Ring Transition\n\nThe **TSS (Task State Segment)** is a 104-byte Intel-defined data structure that the CPU reads directly from memory on every ring 3 to ring 0 privilege transition. It is not a software abstraction with a hardware analog — it is a hardware register with a memory backing that you must maintain.\n\n\n![TSS: Hardware Ring 3 to Ring 0 Transition Mechanics](./diagrams/diag-m4-tss-ring-transition.svg)\n\n\nWhen any interrupt or exception fires while the CPU is executing ring 3 code, the CPU must switch to a kernel stack before it can push the interrupt frame. It cannot use the user-mode stack because user-mode code is untrusted — a process could set `ESP` to a kernel address and trick the interrupt handler into writing a kernel stack frame into kernel memory at an attacker-controlled address. The TSS is the hardware's solution: a trusted, kernel-maintained structure that specifies which stack to use.\n\n> **Why not just use a fixed kernel stack?** If all processes shared one kernel stack, the following would occur: process A is interrupted mid-syscall, the handler pushes a frame onto the shared stack and saves A's kernel state there. Process B runs and triggers a syscall, pushing its frame onto the same stack — immediately overwriting A's saved state. You need one kernel stack per process. The TSS.ESP0 field tells the CPU which one to use for the currently running process.\n\nThe full TSS structure is defined by Intel (it is used for hardware task switching in very old x86 code, but modern OSes use it exclusively for the ESP0 field):\n\n```c\n/* tss.h */\n#ifndef TSS_H\n#define TSS_H\n\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n/* Intel TSS descriptor — hardware-defined layout, do not reorder */\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint32_t prev_task;     /* Previous TSS selector (for hardware task switching; unused) */\n    uint32_t esp0;          /* Ring 0 stack pointer — THE critical field */\n    uint32_t ss0;           /* Ring 0 stack segment selector (must be kernel data: 0x10) */\n    uint32_t esp1;          /* Ring 1/2 stack pointers — unused (no ring 1/2 in our kernel) */\n    uint32_t ss1;\n    uint32_t esp2;\n    uint32_t ss2;\n    uint32_t cr3;           /* Page directory (not used by CPU here; we manage CR3 ourselves) */\n    uint32_t eip;\n    uint32_t eflags;\n    uint32_t eax, ecx, edx, ebx;\n    uint32_t esp, ebp, esi, edi;\n    uint32_t es, cs, ss, ds, fs, gs;\n    uint32_t ldt;           /* LDT selector (unused) */\n    uint16_t debug_trap;    /* Debug trap flag */\n    uint16_t iomap_base;    /* I/O permission bitmap offset */\n} tss_t;\n\nextern tss_t kernel_tss;\n\nvoid tss_init(void);\nvoid tss_set_kernel_stack(uint32_t esp0);\n\n#endif\n```\n\n```c\n/* tss.c */\n#include \"tss.h\"\n#include \"gdt.h\"    /* To install the TSS descriptor in the GDT */\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n\ntss_t kernel_tss;\n\nvoid tss_init(void) {\n    /* Zero all fields — most are unused in software-task-switching mode */\n    uint8_t *p = (uint8_t *)&kernel_tss;\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(kernel_tss); i++) p[i] = 0;\n\n    /* Configure the only field the CPU reads on ring transitions */\n    kernel_tss.ss0 = 0x10;    /* Kernel data segment selector */\n    kernel_tss.esp0 = 0;      /* Will be set properly on first process switch */\n\n    /* I/O permission bitmap: offset beyond TSS size = all I/O ports restricted */\n    kernel_tss.iomap_base = sizeof(tss_t);\n\n    /* Install the TSS descriptor in the GDT (entry index 5, after the 4 existing entries)\n       The TSS GDT entry is a \"system\" descriptor (S=0) with type=0x9 (TSS, not busy) */\n    gdt_install_tss(5, (uint32_t)&kernel_tss, sizeof(kernel_tss) - 1);\n\n    /* Load the Task Register — tells the CPU which GDT entry describes the TSS\n       Selector: index 5, GDT, RPL 0 → (5 << 3) | 0 = 0x28 */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"ltr %0\" : : \"r\"((uint16_t)0x28));\n\n    kprintf(\"[TSS] Initialized.

Loading `TR` with the TSS selector causes the CPU to read the GDT descriptor and cache it. After `ltr`, when any ring 3→0 transition occurs, the CPU uses the cached TSS descriptor to find `kernel_tss.esp0` — it does not walk the GDT again. This means `tss_set_kernel_stack()` (which modifies the in-memory TSS) works correctly: the CPU re-reads `esp0` from memory on each transition, using the cached TSS *base address* from TR but fetching `esp0` fresh.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** `tss_set_kernel_stack()` is a single 32-bit memory write — `mov [kernel_tss.esp0], new_value`. This write goes to a known, hot address in the kernel data section. It is almost certainly in L1 cache (the TSS is accessed frequently — on every ring transition). The CPU reads `esp0` from this address on the very next ring 3 interrupt. The write must complete before the CPU takes that interrupt, which is guaranteed because: (a) we are in ring 0 kernel code running with interrupts off during the scheduler, and (b) the memory write is not reordered past an `iret` instruction (a full memory barrier). No `sfence` or `mfence` is needed because x86 stores are ordered with respect to subsequent instruction execution on the same core.\n\n---\n\n## Section 5: Creating Kernel Processes — Stack Setup and Initial State\n\nTo schedule a process, you need its PCB in a state where `context_switch_asm` can restore it. For the very first activation of a new process — before it has ever run — there is no \"saved state from a previous preemption.\" You must manufacture a fake saved state on the process's kernel stack that looks exactly like what the IRQ stub would have pushed.\n\n\n![Per-Process Kernel Stack Layout During Context Switch](./diagrams/diag-m4-kernel-stack-per-process.svg)\n\n\nWhen the scheduler switches to a new process for the first time, `context_switch_asm` loads `next->cpu.esp`, then `ret` (popping the return address back to `irq_common_stub`), then the stub executes `popa` (restoring the fake registers), then `add esp, 8` (discarding the fake vector and error code), then `iret` (restoring `EFLAGS`, `CS`, `EIP` from the fake values you pushed). The `iret` jumps to the process's entry function at ring 0.\n\nThe fake initial stack must look exactly like an IRQ stack frame:\n\n```c\n/* process.c — creating a kernel-mode process */\n#include \"process.h\"\n#include \"sched.h\"\n#include \"vmm.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n#include <string.h>\n\nprocess_t process_table[MAX_PROCESSES];\nprocess_t *current_process = NULL;\n\nstatic uint32_t next_pid = 1;\n\nprocess_t *process_create_kernel(const char *name, void (*entry)(void)) {\n    /* Find a free slot */\n    process_t *proc = NULL;\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_PROCESSES; i++) {\n        if (process_table[i].state == PROCESS_UNUSED) {\n            proc = &process_table[i];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (!proc) {\n        kprintf(\"[PROC] FATAL: Process table full!\\n\");\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    /* Initialize the PCB */\n    memset(proc, 0, sizeof(process_t));\n    proc->pid   = next_pid++;\n    proc->state = PROCESS_READY;\n    proc->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE;\n\n    /* Copy name, truncating to fit */\n    for (int i = 0; i < 31 && name[i]; i++) proc->name[i] = name[i];\n    proc->name[31] = '\\0';\n\n    /* Kernel processes share the boot page directory (all kernel memory mapped) */\n    extern pde_t boot_page_directory[];\n    proc->page_directory = boot_page_directory;\n\n    /* ── Build the fake initial stack frame ──\n       The kernel stack grows downward from kernel_stack_top.\n       We push values from the highest address downward, mimicking what\n       irq_common_stub and the CPU would have pushed during an IRQ. */\n    proc->kernel_stack_top = (uint32_t)proc->kernel_stack + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE;\n\n    /* Use a uint32_t pointer, decrementing before each push (like a real stack) */\n    uint32_t *sp = (uint32_t *)(uintptr_t)proc->kernel_stack_top;\n\n    /* CPU-pushed interrupt frame (iret will consume these) */\n    *--sp = 0x00000202;        /* EFLAGS: IF=1 (interrupts enabled), reserved bit 1 set */\n    *--sp = 0x08;              /* CS: kernel code segment selector */\n    *--sp = (uint32_t)entry;   /* EIP: process entry point — where iret jumps to */\n\n    /* Error code + vector (discarded by 'add esp, 8' in irq_common_stub) */\n    *--sp = 0;                 /* Vector number (dummy) */\n    *--sp = 0;                 /* Error code (dummy) */\n\n    /* Segment registers (popped by the stub after popa) */\n    *--sp = 0x10;              /* GS = kernel data */\n    *--sp = 0x10;              /* FS = kernel data */\n    *--sp = 0x10;              /* ES = kernel data */\n    *--sp = 0x10;              /* DS = kernel data */\n\n    /* General-purpose registers (restored by popa) */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* EDI */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* ESI */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* EBP */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* ESP (value popa restores into ESP is ignored by hardware) */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* EBX */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* EDX */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* ECX */\n    *--sp = 0;    /* EAX */\n\n    /* The return address for context_switch_asm's 'ret' instruction.\n       context_switch_asm is called FROM irq_common_stub, so 'ret' should\n       return to the instruction AFTER 'call context_switch_asm' in the stub.\n       We store the address of a trampoline that re-enters the stub's exit sequence. */\n    extern void irq_return_trampoline(void);   /* Defined in context_switch.asm */\n    *--sp = (uint32_t)irq_return_trampoline;\n\n    /* Save the stack pointer — context_switch_asm will load this */\n    proc->cpu.esp = (uint32_t)sp;\n\n    kprintf(\"[PROC] Created kernel process '%s' (PID %u), entry 0x%x, esp 0x%x\\n\",\n            proc->name, proc->pid, entry, proc->cpu.esp);\n\n    return proc;\n}\n```\n\n> **The `irq_return_trampoline`:** When `context_switch_asm` executes `ret`, it needs to return to a location in `irq_common_stub` that resumes the exit sequence (pop segment registers, `popa`, `add esp, 8`, `iret`). For an existing process that was preempted mid-run, the `ret` address on the stack is the real return address pushed when `irq_common_stub` called `context_switch_asm`. For a brand-new process, we push a trampoline address that jumps to the equivalent point in the stub. In practice, this is the address immediately after the `call irq_dispatcher` instruction in `irq_common_stub` — the same point the real scheduler returns to. Alternatively, define a minimal trampoline in assembly that directly pops segment registers, calls `popa`, adds 8, and executes `iret`.\n\n> **`EFLAGS = 0x00000202`:** The value `0x202` in EFLAGS means: bit 1 (always 1 per Intel spec), and bit 9 (Interrupt Flag = 1 — interrupts enabled). Every process must resume with IF=1. If you set EFLAGS to 0, the restored process runs with interrupts disabled — the timer never fires again, the scheduler never runs again, and the system freezes with exactly one process running at 100% CPU while the others wait forever.\n\n---\n\n## Section 6: Three Kernel Processes — The Preemptive Multitasking Demo\n\nWith process creation and the scheduler wired together, you can demonstrate genuine preemptive multitasking: three processes running concurrently, each unaware of the others, each printing to a different region of the VGA screen.\n\n\n![Multi-Process VGA Demo: Memory-Mapped I/O Sharing](./diagrams/diag-m4-multiprocess-vga-demo.svg)\n\n\nThe critical property: these processes do not cooperate. They do not call `yield()`. They do not check a shared flag. The timer IRQ interrupts them mid-execution — potentially mid-instruction-sequence, mid-loop, mid-function — and the scheduler switches to another process. From each process's perspective, it is the only thing running.\n\n```c\n/* Three kernel processes for the demo */\n\nstatic void proc_a_entry(void) {\n    /* Process A: counts in the top-left corner */\n    uint32_t count = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        /* Write directly to VGA at row 2, col 0 */\n        volatile uint16_t *vga = (volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000;\n        char buf[32];\n        ksnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"Process A: %u    \", count++);\n        for (int i = 0; buf[i]; i++) {\n            vga[2 * 80 + i] = (uint16_t)buf[i] | (0x0A << 8);  /* Green text */\n        }\n        /* Busy loop — intentionally wastes CPU to make preemption visible */\n        for (volatile int delay = 0; delay < 1000000; delay++);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void proc_b_entry(void) {\n    /* Process B: counts in the middle of the screen */\n    uint32_t count = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        volatile uint16_t *vga = (volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000;\n        char buf[32];\n        ksnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"Process B: %u    \", count++);\n        for (int i = 0; buf[i]; i++) {\n            vga[12 * 80 + i] = (uint16_t)buf[i] | (0x0C << 8); /* Red text */\n        }\n        for (volatile int delay = 0; delay < 1000000; delay++);\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void proc_c_entry(void) {\n    /* Process C: counts at the bottom of the screen */\n    uint32_t count = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        volatile uint16_t *vga = (volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000;\n        char buf[32];\n        ksnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"Process C: %u    \", count++);\n        for (int i = 0; buf[i]; i++) {\n            vga[22 * 80 + i] = (uint16_t)buf[i] | (0x0E << 8); /* Yellow text */\n        }\n        for (volatile int delay = 0; delay < 1000000; delay++);\n    }\n}\n\n/* In kmain, after all previous milestone initialization: */\nvoid launch_multiprocess_demo(void) {\n    sched_init();\n    tss_init();\n\n    /* Create three kernel processes */\n    process_t *pa = process_create_kernel(\"proc_a\", proc_a_entry);\n    process_t *pb = process_create_kernel(\"proc_b\", proc_b_entry);\n    process_t *pc = process_create_kernel(\"proc_c\", proc_c_entry);\n\n    if (!pa || !pb || !pc) {\n        kprintf(\"FATAL: Could not create processes.\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    /* Make the kernel's current execution context into \"process 0\" —\n       the idle process.

When all other processes are blocked, the scheduler wraps around to process 0, which executes `hlt` in a loop. `hlt` stops the CPU from executing instructions until the next interrupt arrives, saving power (and improving QEMU's host CPU usage). This is structurally identical to Linux's idle tasks — one per CPU core, running when no other work exists. Linux's idle task also executes `hlt` (or, with hardware support, deeper C-states like `mwait` that drop into lower-power CPU sleep states).\n\n---\n\n## Section 7: User-Mode Processes — Ring 3 Isolation\n\nKernel processes run in ring 0 with full hardware access and the kernel's page directory. User-mode processes run in ring 3 with restricted hardware access and their own page directory. The kernel code and data are still mapped in the user process's page directory — but with the U/S flag cleared (kernel-only), so ring 3 code that tries to access kernel memory triggers a page fault.\n\n\n![User Process Memory Isolation: Per-Process Page Directories](./diagrams/diag-m4-user-mode-page-directory.svg)\n\n\nCreating a user-mode process requires four additional steps beyond `process_create_kernel`:\n\n1. **Allocate a new page directory** (from the physical frame allocator)\n2. **Copy the kernel page table entries** into the new directory — so the kernel is reachable during system calls and interrupts (ring 3 → ring 0 transitions need kernel code and stack accessible)\n3. **Map the user process's code and stack pages** with `U/S=1, R/W` as appropriate\n4. **Build an initial ring 3 stack frame** that includes `user_esp` and `user_ss` — the two extra fields that `iret` pops when transitioning from ring 0 back to ring 3\n\n```c\nprocess_t *process_create_user(const char *name, void (*entry)(void)) {\n    /* ── Step 1: Allocate a new page directory ── */\n    pde_t *user_pd = (pde_t *)pmm_alloc_frame();\n    if (!user_pd) return NULL;\n    memset(user_pd, 0, PAGE_SIZE);\n\n    /* ── Step 2: Copy kernel PDE entries (upper 1GB: directory indices 768–1023)\n       These entries point to kernel page tables — shared across all processes.\n       Marked supervisor-only (U/S=0 in the page tables themselves). ── */\n    extern pde_t boot_page_directory[];\n    for (int i = 768;

User data selector `0x23` = `(4 << 3) | 3` = GDT index 4, RPL 3. The RPL bits in the selector (bits [1:0]) must match DPL=3, or the CPU raises a GPF when loading them. This is the hardware enforcement that prevents user code from loading kernel segment selectors — the GDT descriptor for the kernel code segment has DPL=0, so loading `0x08` (RPL=0) from ring 3 causes an immediate GPF.\n\n> **Verifying ring 3 isolation:** The acceptance criteria require that user-mode access to kernel memory triggers a page fault. The test: in the user-mode process's code (which runs at virtual `0x00400000`), attempt to read from a kernel address such as `0xC0000000`. Since the kernel page tables have U/S=0, the MMU detects the privilege violation and raises a page fault (exception 14) with error code bits: P=1 (page present), W=0 (read), U=1 (user mode). Your page fault handler from Milestone 3 prints the diagnostic and halts. This is the hardware-enforced memory isolation that makes processes safe from each other.\n\n---\n\n## Section 8: The System Call Interface — INT 0x80\n\nUser-mode processes cannot directly call kernel functions — they run in ring 3, the kernel code runs in ring 0, and the CPU prevents cross-privilege direct calls. The interface between user and kernel is the **system call**: a controlled entry point into the kernel that the CPU will invoke from ring 3.\n\n\n![diag-m4-syscall-int80-flow](./diagrams/diag-m4-syscall-int80-flow.svg)\n\n\nThe mechanism: `int 0x80` is a software interrupt. In the IDT, vector `0x80` is registered as a **trap gate with DPL=3** (the `IDT_SYSCALL_GATE = 0xEF` constant from Milestone 2). The DPL=3 allows ring 3 code to explicitly trigger this interrupt via `int 0x80` without a GPF. The trap gate type (not interrupt gate) means interrupts remain enabled during the syscall — other processes can be preempted while one is blocked in a syscall.\n\nWhen `int 0x80` fires from ring 3:\n1. CPU checks DPL ≥ CPL: DPL=3 ≥ CPL=3 → permitted\n2. CPU switches to ring 0 using TSS.SS0 and TSS.ESP0 (the current process's kernel stack)\n3. CPU pushes `SS`, `ESP`, `EFLAGS`, `CS`, `EIP` (the five-field ring-crossing frame)\n4. CPU jumps to the IDT handler for vector 0x80\n\nThe convention (Linux historical ABI, which you should follow for familiarity):\n- `EAX` = syscall number\n- `EBX` = first argument\n- `ECX` = second argument\n- `EDX` = third argument\n- Return value in `EAX`\n\n```c\n/* syscall.c */\n#include \"syscall.h\"\n#include \"process.h\"\n#include \"sched.h\"\n#include \"vga.h\"\n#include \"kprintf.h\"\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <stddef.h>\n\n/* Syscall numbers — user processes use these constants */\n#define SYS_EXIT    1\n#define SYS_WRITE   4\n\n/* Called from the INT 0x80 handler (which saves all registers via irq_common_stub) */\nvoid syscall_dispatch(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    uint32_t syscall_num = frame->eax;\n    uint32_t arg1        = frame->ebx;\n    uint32_t arg2        = frame->ecx;\n    uint32_t arg3        = frame->edx;\n\n    switch (syscall_num) {\n\n    case SYS_WRITE: {\n        /* sys_write(fd, buf_vaddr, count)\n           fd=1 → stdout (VGA), fd=2 → stderr (serial)\n           buf_vaddr: virtual address in USER address space\n           count: number of bytes */\n        uint32_t fd       = arg1;\n        uint32_t buf_vaddr = arg2;\n        uint32_t count    = arg3;\n\n        /* ── Security: validate the user buffer pointer ──\n           The user passed us a virtual address in their address space.\n           We must verify it is a valid user-space address (below kernel region)\n           and readable before dereferencing it.

It is insufficient for production — a user process could pass a valid-looking address that spans a gap, points to an unmapped page, or points to another user process's read-only segment. Linux's `copy_from_user()` uses a more robust approach: it temporarily enables SMAP (which would fault on kernel access to user memory), then uses assembly that catches page faults during the copy and returns an error code. The page fault handler has a registered \"fixup\" table for these known-safe fault sites. This milestone's range check is sufficient to demonstrate the security principle; the production path is architecturally more sophisticated.\n\n---\n\n## Section 9: The Three-Level View — What a Timer Interrupt Really Does\n\nTracing the full path of a single timer tick that results in a context switch — from hardware signal to resumed process:\n\n**Level 1 — What Your Processes Experience:**\nProcess A is executing its busy-loop. Nothing in Process A's code indicates an interruption — no function call, no yield, no cooperative scheduling point. Mid-loop, the CPU pauses. Later (from A's perspective, instantaneously), A resumes at exactly the instruction it was interrupted at, with all registers intact. Process B ran for 50ms while A was paused. A knows nothing about this.\n\n**Level 2 — The Kernel Path:**\nThe PIT timer channel 0 asserts IRQ0. The PIC raises INTR on the CPU. At the end of the current instruction, the CPU checks the interrupt flag (IF=1 in EFLAGS) and accepts the interrupt. It reads TSS to get the current process's kernel stack (ESP0), pushes `SS`, `ESP`, `EFLAGS`, `CS`, `EIP` onto the kernel stack, and jumps to the IRQ1 handler at vector 32 via the IDT. The `irq_common_stub` assembly pushes segment registers and calls `pusha`. The C dispatcher increments `pit_tick_count`, calls `sched_tick()`, which decrements the time slice. If zero: `sched_schedule()` calls `tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top)`, then `context_switch_asm()`. The assembly loads `next->cpu.esp` into `esp`, optionally reloads `cr3` (flushing TLB), and returns. Back in `irq_common_stub`, `popa` restores next process's general registers, segment registers are popped, `add esp, 8` discards vector/error, and `iret` restores `EIP`, `CS`, `EFLAGS`, `ESP`, `SS` — jumping to next process's instruction pointer in its address space, restoring its stack, its flags, and switching privilege level back to ring 3 if applicable. Total kernel time: ~200–400 CPU cycles.\n\n**Level 3 — Hardware Signals:**\nThe PIT chip's 16-bit counter (clocked at 1.193 MHz, configured with divisor 11932 for 100Hz) reaches zero and pulses its output line connected to the master PIC's IRQ0 input. The PIC's cascade logic checks the IMR (Interrupt Mask Register) — IRQ0 is unmasked. The PIC asserts `INTR` high. The CPU's interrupt recognition logic (checked at the end of every instruction, or every N iterations for `rep` string instructions) sees `INTR` high and `IF=1`. The CPU's microcode issues a memory read cycle to fetch the TSS (for the ESP0 field) — this read goes to main memory (DRAM, since TSS is not frequently enough accessed to stay in L1 cache): ~100 cycles latency. Then five writes to push the interrupt frame onto the kernel stack. Then an IDT lookup (the IDT is hot, stays in L2): ~10 cycles. Then a branch to the handler. The total hardware-level interrupt response time from `INTR` assertion to first handler instruction: ~150 CPU cycles (75ns at 2GHz). The PIC sees the CPU's INTA (Interrupt Acknowledge) signal and clears its ISR bit for IRQ0.\n\n> **Hardware Soul:** The context switch touches a lot of cold memory. The current process's PCB (`old->cpu.esp` field write): probably cold (PCB last touched during previous context switch, 50ms ago). The next process's PCB (`next->cpu.esp` read): definitely cold. The next process's kernel stack (the `popa` and segment register pops after the switch): almost certainly cold. The next process's page directory (if CR3 is reloaded): cold. A context switch that requires four DRAM accesses at 60ns each costs 240ns in memory access alone — on top of the ~75ns interrupt response. Total preemptive context switch latency: approximately 350–500ns, or ~700–1000 CPU cycles at 2GHz. This is the irreducible cost of preemption. Every async framework that avoids context switches — Node.js, nginx's event loop, Go's goroutine scheduler — is building on the knowledge that 1000 cycles is an expensive boundary to cross.\n\n---\n\n## Section 10: Putting It All Together in kmain\n\nThe complete milestone 4 initialization, inserted into `kmain()` after the memory management setup from Milestone 3:\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(multiboot_info_t *mbi) {\n    /* ── Milestones 1-3: output, interrupts, memory ── */\n    serial_init();\n    vga_clear();\n    kprintf(\"=== Kernel starting ===\\n\");\n\n    idt_setup_all();\n    pic_remap(0x20, 0x28);\n    pit_init(100);\n    keyboard_init();\n\n    pmm_parse_memory_map(mbi);\n    pmm_init(mbi);\n    vmm_init();\n    vmm_enable_paging();\n    heap_init();\n\n    __asm__ volatile (\"sti\");\n\n    /* ── Milestone 4: Processes and Scheduling ── */\n\n    /* Initialize scheduler and TSS before creating any processes */\n    sched_init();\n    tss_init();\n\n    /* Register INT 0x80 system call gate (DPL=3 trap gate) */\n    extern void isr128(void);\n    idt_set_gate(0x80, (uint32_t)isr128, 0x08, IDT_SYSCALL_GATE);\n\n    /* Create three kernel-mode processes */\n    process_t *pa = process_create_kernel(\"proc_a\", proc_a_entry);\n    process_t *pb = process_create_kernel(\"proc_b\", proc_b_entry);\n    process_t *pc = process_create_kernel(\"proc_c\", proc_c_entry);\n\n    /* Create one user-mode process */\n    process_t *pu = process_create_user(\"user_hello\", user_main);\n\n    kprintf(\"[M4] Created %d processes.

A systematic approach:\n\n| Symptom | Root Cause | Diagnostic |\n|---------|------------|------------|\n| System freezes after `sti`, no preemption | Timer handler not calling `sched_tick`; or `current_process` is NULL | Add `kprintf` to `timer_handler` before and after `sched_tick` |\n| Triple fault immediately on first context switch | `context_switch_asm` reads wrong stack offsets after modifying `esp`; or fake initial frame wrong | Verify argument loading order in asm; print `proc->cpu.esp` before switch |\n| Process resumes with wrong register values | `pusha`/`popa` imbalance in IRQ stub; context switch asm not saving all registers | Compare `pusha` order with PCB field order; add register printout in fault handler |\n| User process triggers GPF instead of running | Wrong CS selector in initial frame (must be `0x1B`, not `0x08`); or DPL mismatch | Print the CS value from `iret` exception frame |\n| INT 0x80 causes GPF | IDT gate has wrong DPL (must be 3 for user-callable); or wrong gate type | Print IDT entry byte at offset for vector 0x80; verify `IDT_SYSCALL_GATE = 0xEF` |\n| Kernel memory access from ring 3 does not fault | User page directory has U/S=1 on kernel pages (inherited PDE incorrectly) | Dump the PDE flags for the kernel region in the user page directory |\n| TSS not updated — wrong process's kernel stack corrupted | `tss_set_kernel_stack()` called after `context_switch_asm` instead of before | Move the TSS update to *before* the `context_switch_asm` call |\n| Double free or heap corruption | Process A's kernel stack overlaps another structure (pcb sizing error) | Print `proc->kernel_stack` and `proc->kernel_stack_top` for each process; verify no overlap |\n\nThe QEMU GDB stub is essential for this milestone:\n\n```bash\n# Launch QEMU with GDB stub, paused at boot\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio \\\n    -s -S -d int 2>qemu_ints.log\n\n# In another terminal\ngdb kernel.elf\n(gdb) target remote :1234\n(gdb) break sched_schedule\n(gdb) continue\n# When breakpoint hits:\n(gdb) print *current_process    # Inspect current PCB\n(gdb) print next->cpu.esp       # Inspect next process's saved ESP\n(gdb) x/20x next->cpu.esp       # Dump the fake initial stack frame\n```\n\nExamining `qemu_ints.log` after a triple fault will show the last successful interrupt before the crash — typically a timer IRQ followed by an exception during the context switch attempt, pinpointing the exact failure.\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Cascade — What This Milestone Unlocks\n\nYou have just built the engine that drives everything above the OS layer. The connections extend into every domain of systems software.\n\n**1. Context switch cost as the origin of event-driven architecture (cross-domain: web servers and distributed systems)**\n\nThe ~1000-cycle context switch you just implemented is the direct cause of an entire architectural movement. In the early 2000s, the \"C10K problem\" described why Apache-style threaded web servers — one thread per connection — could not scale past ~10,000 simultaneous connections on commodity hardware. Each connection required a thread, each thread required ~1000 cycles per scheduler invocation, and with 10,000 threads, the scheduler overhead dominated useful work.\n\nThe solution was event-driven I/O: **epoll** (Linux), **kqueue** (FreeBSD), and **IOCP** (Windows) allow one thread to wait on thousands of file descriptors simultaneously, switching between them cooperatively only when I/O is ready — no context switch, because there is no thread switch. Node.js built an entire ecosystem on this principle. **nginx** (which replaced Apache for high-concurrency workloads) uses an event loop with a small fixed number of worker threads. **Go's goroutines** are a middle path: lightweight green threads that context-switch in user space (M:N threading), amortizing the kernel context switch cost across thousands of goroutines that are multiplexed onto a small pool of OS threads.\n\nThe reason these architectures exist — the reason Linus Torvalds's 2001 email dismissing thread-per-request as \"hopelessly inefficient\" sparked a decade of framework design — is the number you just measured: 1000 cycles, ~500ns, per switch. When you understand what those cycles are buying (register saves, TLB flush, cache cold misses), you understand why Go's goroutine scheduler can context-switch in ~100ns (no TLB flush, smaller register set, stack is hot) and why that 5× difference matters at scale.\n\n**2. TSS.ESP0 as the foundation of container isolation (cross-domain: Linux namespaces, Docker)**\n\nThe per-process kernel stack you just configured — and the TSS.ESP0 update that makes it work — is not just a scheduling convenience. It is the root of OS-level process isolation.\n\nEvery Linux process has a distinct kernel stack. When a process makes a syscall or receives an interrupt, the CPU jumps to kernel code using that process's stack. If two processes shared a kernel stack, one process's syscall could read or overwrite the other's saved state on the shared stack. The TSS.ESP0 mechanism prevents this by giving the CPU a per-process pointer that it uses before executing a single kernel instruction.\n\n**Linux containers** (the foundation of Docker and Kubernetes) extend this isolation in software: namespaces (PID, network, mount, user, UTS, IPC) restrict what a container process can see. **cgroups** limit what it can consume. But the hardware isolation root — the one that makes a container process actually unable to access another container's memory — is the same mechanism you just built: each container process has its own page directory (CR3), and the CPU enforces the boundary at the page table level. A **container escape vulnerability** (a CVE that allows a containerized process to escape its isolation) almost always involves either a kernel stack smashing bug (overwriting the saved state of another process on its kernel stack) or a page table manipulation bug (tricking the kernel into mapping a container's memory as kernel-accessible). You have just built the mechanism these attacks target. Understanding it at the instruction level is prerequisite for understanding the exploit patterns.\n\n**3. Round-robin as fairness, not performance — tracing the path to CFS (Linux scheduler)**\n\nYour scheduler gives each ready process one equal time slice in turn. It is a correct and implementable baseline. It is also inadequate for every real workload, for a reason that becomes visible the moment you add a fourth process that does I/O.\n\nAn I/O-bound process (waiting for keyboard input, disk read, or network packet) is almost never in `PROCESS_READY`. It spends most of its time in `PROCESS_BLOCKED`. Round-robin skips it efficiently. But when it *does* become ready (the I/O completes), it must wait for its turn in the round-robin cycle — potentially waiting for N-1 other processes to run their full slices first. For interactive applications (terminals, text editors), this introduces perceptible latency: the user presses a key, the key arrives in the keyboard buffer, but the process that reads it does not run for another 50ms × (N-1) processes.\n\n**Linux's CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)** solves this with `vruntime`: each process accumulates a virtual runtime counter (how much CPU time it has received, weighted by its priority). The scheduler always runs the process with the *lowest* vruntime — i.e., the process that has received the *least* CPU time proportionally. An I/O-bound process that was blocked for 100ms accumulates no vruntime during that time, so when it unblocks, it has the lowest vruntime in the system and runs immediately. **SCHED_FIFO** and **SCHED_RR** are Linux's real-time scheduling classes: FIFO runs a process until it blocks or yields (no preemption); RR gives equal time slices but never interleaves with SCHED_FIFO tasks. **Go's work-stealing scheduler** (which manages goroutines across OS threads) uses a local run queue per OS thread plus a global queue, and idle threads \"steal\" goroutines from busy threads — a load balancing mechanism invisible at the OS level because it happens in user space. Your round-robin scheduler is the Ur-primitive from which all of these descend.\n\n**4. INT 0x80 as the slow path that motivated SYSENTER/SYSCALL and the vDSO**\n\n`int 0x80` is a software interrupt. Invoking it requires: checking DPL (2 cycles), looking up the IDT entry (memory access, ~10 cycles), switching to the kernel stack via TSS (memory access for TSS.ESP0, ~100 cycles if cold), pushing five values onto the kernel stack (5 writes), saving all registers, executing the syscall handler, then reversing all of this with `iret`. Typical `int 0x80` round-trip time: ~500 cycles.\n\nIntel recognized this bottleneck in 1996 and added **SYSENTER/SYSEXIT** (P6 architecture) — a pair of instructions optimized for syscall entry and exit that bypass the IDT lookup and use MSRs (Model-Specific Registers) to specify the kernel entry point and stack. This reduces syscall overhead to ~100 cycles. AMD added **SYSCALL/SYSRET** (similar, slightly different mechanism, now the 64-bit standard). Linux uses SYSCALL in 64-bit mode and SYSENTER in 32-bit mode.\n\nBut Linux went further: the **vDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object)** is a small kernel-mapped page inserted into every process's address space. It contains small functions like `gettimeofday()` and `clock_gettime()` that read kernel data (the current time, updated by the timer interrupt) without crossing the ring boundary at all. A user process calling `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` reads the TSC (Time Stamp Counter — a CPU register that counts cycles since boot) directly, with no syscall, no ring transition, no context switch — and gets nanosecond precision in ~20 cycles. The vDSO is possible because the kernel can share read-only data with user processes via page tables. Understanding `int 0x80` — its cost, its path through the IDT, the TSS lookup it triggers — makes the entire SYSENTER/vDSO optimization story obvious: every optimization in that chain is eliminating one step of the `int 0x80` path you just implemented.\n\n**5. Per-process page directories as the hardware root of every isolation boundary**\n\nEvery process you just created has its own `CR3` — its own root page table. When the scheduler loads a new `CR3`, the CPU's address space switches instantaneously and completely. Every virtual address means something different. Physical address `0x00201234` might be process A's heap and process B's stack simultaneously — because they are mapped to different virtual addresses in different page directories, and the MMU translates through different tables. The hardware enforces that neither process can access the other's physical frames because neither process's page tables contain entries for the other's frames.\n\nThis same mechanism is the hardware root of:\n\n- **Virtual machines:** A hypervisor (VMX root mode) interposes another level of page tables (EPT — Extended Page Tables) between the guest OS's page tables and physical memory. The guest OS thinks it is managing physical memory; it is actually managing guest-physical memory that the hypervisor translates again. Two levels of CR3-like pointers, both enforced by MMU hardware.\n- **Browser tab isolation (site isolation in Chrome):** Each tab runs in a separate renderer process with its own page directory. A compromised tab cannot read another tab's memory because the kernel never maps one tab's physical frames into another's page directory.\n- **Spectre/Meltdown mitigations (KPTI — Kernel Page Table Isolation):** After Meltdown (2018), the Linux kernel adopted KPTI: user-mode processes run with a page directory that contains almost no kernel mappings (only the minimum needed to enter the kernel). The full kernel page directory is restored only after the ring transition. This doubles the TLB flush frequency (every ring transition requires a CR3 swap) but prevents speculative execution from reading kernel memory via cache timing channels. The cost of KPTI — measured at 5–30% overhead on syscall-heavy workloads — is the cost of swapping `CR3` twice per syscall instead of zero times. You just built the mechanism whose overhead Meltdown exploited and KPTI pays to mitigate.\n\n---\n\n## Final System View — Everything Connected\n\n\n![Interrupt Infrastructure as Scheduler Foundation](./diagrams/diag-satellite-interrupt-to-scheduler.svg)\n\n\nStanding at the end of Milestone 4, your kernel does what took the Unix team years to build:\n\n- **Milestone 1** provided the hardware foundation: protected mode, segmentation, I/O drivers, a C execution environment.\n- **Milestone 2** wired in the interrupt infrastructure: the IDT, PIC remapping, the timer tick, keyboard input, the double fault safety net.\n- **Milestone 3** built the address space: physical frame tracking, two-level page tables, virtual-to-physical translation, a kernel heap.\n- **Milestone 4** animated multiple concurrent processes: PCBs that capture complete CPU state, assembly-level context switching, TSS-backed ring transitions, a preemptive round-robin scheduler, user-mode isolation, and a system call gate.\n\nEvery abstraction that application programmers use — `malloc`, `printf`, `pthread_create`, `read`, `mmap` — sits atop one or more of these mechanisms. `malloc` calls `sbrk` which calls a page fault path in your VMM. `printf` eventually calls `write` which crosses your INT 0x80 gate into your `sys_write` handler. `pthread_create` allocates a PCB and kernel stack and calls your scheduler. `read` blocks a process (sets it to `PROCESS_BLOCKED`) until data arrives via your IRQ handler.\n\nThe knowledge you have built is not academic. It is executable understanding of the substrate that every software system runs on.\n\n\n![OS Concepts as Foundation for Cross-Domain Systems](./diagrams/diag-satellite-cross-domain-connections.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n```\n\n```\n<!-- END_MS -->\n\n\n\n\n# TDD\n\nA bottom-up x86 kernel implementation that negotiates directly with hardware constraints at every layer: the 1978 real-mode boot environment, the 8259 PIC's vector collision hazard, the TLB coherence problem during paging enablement, and the TSS's role as the hardware root of privilege isolation. Each module exposes one fundamental tension between what software wants and what hardware provides, building implementation-grade understanding of mechanisms that underlie every modern computing platform.\n\n\n\n<!-- TDD_MOD_ID: mod-1 -->\n# Technical Design Specification: Boot, GDT, and Kernel Entry\n\n**Module ID:** `mod-1` | **Milestone:** `build-os-m1` | **Estimated Hours:** 17–27\n\n---\n\n## 1. Module Charter\n\nThis module transitions the x86 CPU from the BIOS-provided 16-bit real-mode environment at `0x7C00` through a two-stage bootloader into 32-bit protected mode, depositing control at a C kernel entry point with a clean execution environment. It owns the complete boot path: MBR Stage1 (512 bytes exactly), Stage2 (A20 enablement, kernel disk loading, GDT construction, protected-mode transition), the linker script defining kernel section addresses, assembly entry glue (BSS zeroing, stack setup), a VGA text-mode driver writing to `0xB8000`, and a serial UART driver on COM1. The module terminates at the first instruction of `kmain()` with all output drivers functional.\n\nThis module does **not** implement an IDT, any interrupt handlers, the 8259 PIC, page tables, virtual memory, a heap allocator, or any process management. Interrupts remain disabled (`cli`) for the entire duration. No dynamic allocation occurs; all data structures are statically sized and placed by the linker. The module assumes a single-core execution context with no preemption.\n\n**Upstream dependency:** BIOS firmware — provides INT 13h disk services, the memory map at `0x400`–`0x4FF`, and the initial CPU state. **Downstream dependency:** Milestone 2 (interrupts) which requires `cli` to already hold and segment registers to be loaded with protected-mode selectors.\n\n**Invariants that must hold at module exit:**\n1. `CR0.PE = 1` — CPU is in 32-bit protected mode, never to return to real mode.\n2. `CS = 0x08`, `DS = ES = FS = GS = SS = 0x10` — all segment registers contain valid protected-mode kernel selectors.\n3. All bytes in `.bss` are zero.\n4. `ESP` points within a valid 16KB kernel stack region in `.bss`.\n5. The GDT contains exactly 5 valid entries at the offsets specified in §3.\n6. `0xB8000` is accessible as a writable MMIO region producing visible VGA output.\n7. COM1 UART is initialized at 38400/8N1 and transmits bytes synchronously.\n\n---\n\n## 2. File Structure\n\nCreate files in this exact sequence. Later files depend on earlier ones compiling cleanly.\n\n```\nbuild-os/\n├── 01  boot/\n│   ├── 01  stage1.asm          # 512-byte MBR: load stage2 from disk, jump\n│   └── 02  stage2.asm          # A20, load kernel, build GDT, enter protected mode\n├── 02  kernel/\n│   ├── 01  linker.ld           # Section layout: kernel at 0x100000\n│   ├── 02  entry.asm           # 32-bit entry: zero BSS, set ESP, call kmain\n│   ├── 03  include/\n│   │   ├── 01  stdint.h        # Freestanding type aliases (uint8_t … uint32_t)\n│   │   ├── 02  stddef.h        # size_t, NULL, offsetof\n│   │   ├── 03  io.h            # outb/inb inline asm port I/O\n│   │   ├── 04  vga.h           # VGA driver public interface\n│   │   └── 05  serial.h        # Serial driver public interface\n│   ├── 04  drivers/\n│   │   ├── 01  vga.c           # VGA text-mode driver implementation\n│   │   └── 02  serial.c        # COM1 UART driver implementation\n│   ├── 05  kprintf.c           # Minimal formatted output to VGA + serial\n│   ├── 06  kprintf.h           # kprintf declaration\n│   └── 07  kmain.c             # Kernel C entry point: calls drivers, prints welcome\n├── 03  Makefile                 # Build rules: assemble, compile, link, create image\n└── 04  run.sh                   # QEMU launch script with -serial stdio\n```\n\n**Why this order:** `stdint.h` and `stddef.h` must exist before any C file compiles. `io.h` is included by both drivers. Drivers are compiled before `kmain.c` to catch header mismatches early. The bootloader files are assembled independently of the kernel; the Makefile stitches them into a single disk image.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Interface Contracts\n\n### 4.1 `vga_init(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** CPU in 32-bit protected mode. `0xB8000` is identity-mapped and writable (no paging yet; physical = virtual).\n\n**Post-conditions:** Internal cursor at (0,0). All 2000 cells written with `' '` (space, ASCII 0x20) and attribute `0x07` (white-on-black). Internal `default_fg = VGA_WHITE (0xF)`, `default_bg = VGA_BLACK (0x0)`.\n\n**Side effects:** Writes 4000 bytes to physical `0xB8000`–`0xB8F9F`.\n\n**Errors:** None. Cannot fail — `0xB8000` is always present on x86 hardware and in QEMU.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 `vga_putchar(char c, uint8_t fg, uint8_t bg) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `c`: ASCII character or control code. Valid range: all `uint8_t` values. Special handling for `\\n` (0x0A) and `\\r` (0x0D) only; all other values are printed literally including non-printable codes.\n- `fg`: Foreground color, range `[0x0, 0xF]`. Values above `0xF` are masked: `fg & 0xF`.\n- `bg`: Background color, range `[0x0, 0x7]`. Values above `0x7` are masked: `bg & 0x7`.\n\n**Behavior:**\n- If `c == '\\n'`: set `cursor_col = 0`, `cursor_row++`. Do not write a cell.\n- If `c == '\\r'`: set `cursor_col = 0`. Do not write a cell. Do not advance `cursor_row`.\n- Otherwise: write `(uint16_t)c | (((bg & 0x7) << 4 | (fg & 0xF)) << 8)` to `VGA_BASE[cursor_row * 80 + cursor_col]`. Advance `cursor_col`. If `cursor_col >= 80`: set `cursor_col = 0`, `cursor_row++`.\n- After any operation that increments `cursor_row`: if `cursor_row >= 25`, call `vga_scroll()`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** Cell at previous cursor position contains the character. Cursor advanced one position or wrapped.\n\n**Errors:** None propagated. Silent mask of out-of-range fg/bg values.\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 `vga_scroll(void) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** Copy rows 1–24 into rows 0–23 (a `memmove` equivalent on the VGA buffer: `2 * 80 * 24 = 3840` bytes moved from `VGA_BASE + 80` to `VGA_BASE`). Fill row 24 with space characters (`' '`) and attribute `(default_bg << 4 | default_fg) << 8`. Set `cursor_row = 24`, `cursor_col = 0`.\n\n**Implementation note:** Use a word-at-a-time copy (copy `uint16_t` values, not bytes) to minimize MMIO write count. 1920 `uint16_t` writes for the scroll, 80 `uint16_t` writes to clear the last row.\n\n**Why `cursor_row = 24` not `0`:** After scrolling, the next character goes on the newly cleared last row, not back to the top. The scroll moves content up; writing continues at the bottom.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 `vga_write_string(const char *s, uint8_t fg, uint8_t bg) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `s`: Null-terminated C string. Must not be NULL. If NULL is passed, behavior is undefined (no null check for performance; callers are responsible).\n- `fg`, `bg`: As in `vga_putchar`.\n\n**Behavior:** Calls `vga_putchar(s[i], fg, bg)` for each byte until `s[i] == '\\0'`. The null terminator is not printed.\n\n---\n\n### 4.5 `vga_set_cursor(int row, int col) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `row`: [0, 24]. Values outside range: clamped. `row < 0` → `row = 0`. `row > 24` → `row = 24`.\n- `col`: [0, 79]. Values outside range: clamped.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `cursor_row = row`, `cursor_col = col`. No VGA memory written.\n\n---\n\n### 4.6 `vga_clear(void) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** Equivalent to `vga_init()` except does not reinitialize default colors if already set. Writes space + `0x07` attribute to all 2000 cells. Sets cursor to (0,0).\n\n---\n\n### 4.7 `serial_init(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** CPU in protected mode. Port I/O accessible (no IOPL check needed at ring 0).\n\n**Behavior:** Executes the 8-write initialization sequence from §3.3. Uses `io_wait()` between each write (single `outb(0x80, 0)` to POST diagnostic port, ~1–4µs delay).\n\n**Post-conditions:** COM1 accepts bytes via `serial_putchar`. Baud rate = 38400. Format = 8N1. FIFO enabled.\n\n**Errors:** None detectable without a loopback test (which this module omits). If COM1 hardware is absent (not the case on QEMU), writes are silently ignored.\n\n---\n\n### 4.8 `serial_putchar(char c) → void`\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Busy-wait: spin on `(inb(0x3FD) & 0x20) == 0` (LSR bit 5 = THRE — Transmitter Holding Register Empty). Loop iteration: one `inb` (~1–4µs per iteration on legacy I/O bus).\n2. When THRE=1: `outb(0x3F8, (uint8_t)c)`.\n\n**Maximum wait time:** At 38400 baud, 10 bits per frame, the UART flushes in `10 / 38400 ≈ 260µs`. The busy-wait terminates within one character-time.\n\n**Errors:** None. If the UART never asserts THRE (hardware fault), the function spins forever. This is acceptable for a debug-only driver without interrupt infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### 4.9 `serial_write_string(const char *s) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** Calls `serial_putchar(s[i])` for each byte until `s[i] == '\\0'`. If `s[i] == '\\n'`, also calls `serial_putchar('\\r')` immediately after — serial terminals expect CRLF line endings.\n\n---\n\n### 4.10 `kprintf(const char *fmt, ...) → void`\n\n**Supported format specifiers:**\n\n| Specifier | Argument Type | Behavior |\n|-----------|--------------|---------|\n| `%c` | `int` (char) | Single character |\n| `%s` | `const char *` | Null-terminated string; NULL pointer prints `\"(null)\"` |\n| `%d`, `%i` | `int` | Signed decimal integer |\n| `%u` | `unsigned int` | Unsigned decimal integer |\n| `%x` | `unsigned int` | Lowercase hexadecimal, no `0x` prefix |\n| `%X` | `unsigned int` | Uppercase hexadecimal, no `0x` prefix |\n| `%08x` | `unsigned int` | Zero-padded 8-digit hex (only width=1–8 with `0` flag supported) |\n| `%%` | — | Literal `%` |\n\n**Unsupported specifiers:** `%f`, `%g`, `%e`, `%p`, `%l`, `%ll`. If encountered, print `%?` where `?` is the unknown character.\n\n**Output targets:** Both `vga_putchar` (with `VGA_WHITE` on `VGA_BLACK`) and `serial_putchar`. Every character goes to both destinations synchronously before `kprintf` returns.\n\n**Implementation:** Uses `va_list` / `va_start` / `va_arg` / `va_end` from a freestanding `<stdarg.h>`. Integer-to-string conversion via a local static buffer of 32 bytes (sufficient for a 32-bit integer in any base). No heap allocation.\n\n**Error behavior:** If a format string ends with a lone `%` (e.g., `\"hello %\"`), print `%` and return. Do not read past the null terminator.\n\n---\n\n### 4.11 `outb(uint16_t port, uint8_t value) → void` (inline, `io.h`)\n\n```c\nstatic inline void outb(uint16_t port, uint8_t value) {\n    __asm__ volatile (\"outb %0, %1\" : : \"a\"(value), \"Nd\"(port) : \"memory\");\n}\n```\n\n**Constraints:** `\"Nd\"` encodes port as an immediate 8-bit value (if constant and ≤ 255) or via `DX` register (if variable or > 255). `\"memory\"` clobber prevents the compiler from reordering memory accesses across the I/O operation.\n\n---\n\n### 4.12 `inb(uint16_t port) → uint8_t` (inline, `io.h`)\n\n```c\nstatic inline uint8_t inb(uint16_t port) {\n    uint8_t ret;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"inb %1, %0\" : \"=a\"(ret) : \"Nd\"(port) : \"memory\");\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.13 `io_wait(void) → void` (inline, `io.h`)\n\n```c\nstatic inline void io_wait(void) {\n    outb(0x80, 0x00);  /* Write to unused POST port; ~1–4µs delay on legacy bus */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5.

If Stage1 grows, remove the error message and use a simple `hlt` for disk_error.\n\n\n![Real Mode vs Protected Mode Address Translation](./diagrams/tdd-diag-3.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.2 Stage2 Bootloader\n\n**Input state:** Executing at `0x7E00` in real mode, `DS=ES=SS=0`, `SP` valid, interrupts enabled.\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Print \"Loading kernel...\" via INT 10h teletype\n  - Provides visual confirmation that Stage2 ran\n\nStep 2: Enable the A20 Line (BIOS method — most portable)\n  A20 via BIOS INT 15h AX=2401h:\n    MOV AX, 0x2401\n    INT 15h\n    JC a20_failed        ; CF=1 if not supported; fall through to Port 0x92 method\n\n  A20 via Fast A20 (Port 0x92) fallback:\n    IN AL, 0x92\n    OR AL, 0x02          ; Set bit 1 = A20 enable\n    AND AL, 0xFE         ; Clear bit 0 = do NOT reset CPU (bit 0 = fast CPU reset)\n    OUT 0x92, AL\n\n  A20 verify (test that address 0x100000 and 0x000000 are different):\n    MOV AX, 0xFFFF\n    MOV ES, AX\n    MOV WORD [ES:0x0010], 0x1234   ; Write at physical 0x100000\n    MOV AX, 0x0000\n    MOV ES, AX\n    CMP WORD [ES:0x0000], 0x1234   ; Read physical 0x000000\n    JE a20_failed                  ; Same = A20 still off (wraparound)\n    ; Restore [0x000000] to 0 (IVT entry 0):\n    MOV WORD [ES:0x0000], 0x0000\n\nStep 3: Load kernel from disk into 0x100000\n  Problem: INT 13h in real mode cannot directly address above 1MB (ES:BX is 20-bit).\n  Solution A (BIOS Extended Read — INT 13h AH=0x42, LBA):\n    Construct a DAP (Disk Address Packet) in memory:\n      dap:\n        db 0x10       ; Size of packet (16 bytes)\n        db 0          ; Reserved\n        dw 64         ; Number of sectors to read (64 × 512 = 32KB)\n        dw 0x0000     ; Buffer offset (for 32-bit address in bytes 8–11)\n        dw 0x0000     ; Buffer segment (unused when 32-bit address present)\n        dq 9          ; LBA start sector (sector 9, 0-indexed)\n    ; Extended read (not available on all hardware; check with AH=0x41, BX=0x55AA)\n    ; Falls back to solution B if not supported.\n\n  Solution B (Unreal Mode — read above 1MB from real mode):\n    Enter \"Unreal Mode\" (temporarily enable protected mode to load 32-bit segments,\n    then return to real mode with 32-bit segment cache still active):\n      1.

Interrupt enable state:\n\n```\nBefore step 4 (cli): EFLAGS.IF may be 1\nAfter cli:           EFLAGS.IF = 0 (guaranteed)\nAfter lgdt:          EFLAGS.IF = 0 (lgdt does not change IF)\nAfter mov cr0, eax:  EFLAGS.IF = 0; CPU in protected mode; IVT useless\nAfter far jmp:       EFLAGS.IF = 0; CS valid; pipeline flushed; safe\nAfter segment reload: EFLAGS.IF = 0; all segments valid; protected mode fully operational\n```\n\n**Why `jmp 0x08:0x100000` rather than `jmp 0x08:pm32_entry`:** Stage2 is loaded at `0x7E00`. The `pm32_entry` label is at approximately `0x7E00 + N` (wherever it falls in Stage2). After protected mode is entered, Stage2 code is still accessible via the flat 4GB kernel code segment (base=0). But the kernel binary is at `0x100000`. The final jump to `0x100000` transfers control to the kernel's own entry point in `entry.asm`.\n\n---\n\n### 5.4 Kernel Entry Point — BSS Zeroing and Stack Setup (`entry.asm`)\n\n**Input state:** 32-bit protected mode, `CS=0x08`, `DS=ES=FS=GS=SS=0x10`, `ESP` undefined (or whatever Stage2 left it at).\n\n```\nStep 1: Establish kernel stack immediately\n  MOV ESP, __stack_top    ; __stack_top is a linker symbol pointing to top of kernel_stack[]\n  ; All subsequent C ABI operations are valid\n\nStep 2: Zero BSS\n  MOV EDI, __bss_start    ; Destination: start of BSS\n  MOV ECX, __bss_end\n  SUB ECX, EDI            ; ECX = byte count\n  SHR ECX, 2              ; ECX = dword count (÷4; BSS is always multiple of 4 per linker)\n  XOR EAX, EAX            ; Value to store: 0\n  REP STOSD               ; Store 0 to [EDI], advance EDI by 4, decrement ECX; repeat\n\n  ; Handle remainder if BSS is not a multiple of 4:\n  MOV ECX, __bss_end\n  SUB ECX, EDI            ; Remaining bytes (0–3)\n  REP STOSB               ; Store remaining bytes one at a time\n\nStep 3: Call kmain\n  CALL kmain              ; Transfer to C kernel\n\nStep 4: Halt if kmain returns (should never happen)\n  CLI\n  HLT\n  JMP $                   ; Catch NMI wakeup\n```\n\n**Why set ESP before zeroing BSS:** If BSS zeroing were to cause an exception (impossible here, but defensive coding), the CPU would need a valid stack to push the exception frame. More practically: C code called from `kmain` uses the stack immediately.\n\n**Why `rep stosd` then `rep stosb`:** `stosd` stores 4 bytes per iteration, which is faster (fewer loop iterations, instruction-level parallelism). A BSS section not aligned to 4 bytes leaves a 0–3 byte remainder handled by `stosb`. The linker script aligns BSS to 4 bytes by default, making the `stosb` loop zero iterations in practice; it is present for correctness regardless.\n\n\n![Protected Mode Transition: Instruction-Level Sequence Diagram](./diagrams/tdd-diag-5.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.5 VGA Scroll Algorithm\n\n**Input:** Screen full (cursor_row was incremented to 25).\n\n```\nStep 1: Shift rows 1–24 into rows 0–23\n  uint16_t *dst = VGA_BASE;            // row 0\n  uint16_t *src = VGA_BASE + 80;       // row 1\n  uint32_t  count = 80 * 24;           // 1920 cells\n  for (i = 0; i < count; i++) dst[i] = src[i];\n\nStep 2: Clear row 24\n  uint16_t blank = (uint16_t)' ' | ((uint16_t)((default_bg << 4) | default_fg) << 8);\n  uint16_t *last_row = VGA_BASE + (24 * 80);\n  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) last_row[i] = blank;\n\nStep 3: Update cursor\n  cursor_row = 24;\n  cursor_col = 0;\n```\n\n**Performance:** 1920 + 80 = 2000 MMIO writes per scroll. At ~200ns per write (uncached MMIO): ~400µs per scroll. Acceptable for a debug terminal; production would use hardware cursor or direct DMA.\n\n---\n\n### 5.6 Integer-to-String Conversion in `kprintf`\n\n```c\n// Converts unsigned 32-bit integer to string in given base [2,16]\n// Returns pointer to null-terminated string in static buffer\n// NOT reentrant — call sequence must be single-threaded\nstatic const char *uint_to_str(uint32_t value, int base, int uppercase) {\n    static char buf[33];   // 32 binary digits + null\n    static const char lower[] = \"0123456789abcdef\";\n    static const char upper[] = \"0123456789ABCDEF\";\n    const char *digits = uppercase ? upper : lower;\n    int pos = 32;\n    buf[pos] = '\\0';\n    if (value == 0) { buf[--pos] = '0'; return &buf[pos]; }\n    while (value > 0) {\n        buf[--pos] = digits[value % base];\n        value /= base;\n    }\n    return &buf[pos];\n}\n```\n\n**Zero-padding for `%08x`:** After generating the hex string, if a width specifier was parsed (e.g., width=8, pad='0'), prepend `'0'` characters until the string length equals the specified width before writing to output.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Implementation Sequence with Checkpoints\n\n### Phase 1 — Stage1 MBR (3–5 hours)\n\nCreate `boot/stage1.asm`. Assemble with `nasm -f bin -o stage1.bin boot/stage1.asm`. Verify binary is exactly 512 bytes: `wc -c stage1.bin` must print `512`. Verify last two bytes: `xxd stage1.bin | tail -1` must show `55 aa` at positions 510–511.\n\n**Checkpoint 1:** Run `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=stage1.bin -serial stdio`. QEMU should either hang (no Stage2 loaded yet) or print `\"Boot error\"` because the INT 13h read of Stage2 finds no data. Either outcome confirms the MBR runs. Add `-d int` to QEMU flags and verify the last interrupt before hang is a disk-related INT (vector 0x13), not a CPU exception (vectors 0–20). If QEMU immediately reboots with an interrupt vector 8 (double fault), the boot signature is missing.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 — Stage2: A20, kernel load, GDT construction (4–6 hours)\n\nCreate `boot/stage2.asm`. At this phase, Stage2 does NOT yet enter protected mode — it just enables A20, attempts to load a known byte pattern to `0x100000`, verifies it, and prints \"A20 OK\" + \"Kernel loaded\" via INT 10h. The kernel binary does not exist yet; fill sectors 9–72 with a known pattern (e.g., `db 0xAA`) via the Makefile for testing purposes.\n\nCreate `Makefile` rules to assemble stage1 and stage2 and create a disk image:\n```makefile\n# Create raw disk image: stage1 at sector 0, stage2 at sectors 1-8\ndd if=/dev/zero of=os.img bs=512 count=2880\ndd if=stage1.bin of=os.img conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=0\ndd if=stage2.bin of=os.img conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=1\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 2:** `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio`. Should see \"A20 OK\" and \"Kernel loaded\" on QEMU screen (via INT 10h teletype, before protected mode). If A20 verify fails, check: did you restore `[0x000000]` after the verify test? Did you use `ES:BX` or `GS:offset` correctly for the unreal mode load?\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3 — Protected mode transition (2–3 hours)\n\nComplete Stage2 with the GDT table, `lgdt`, `cli`, `CR0.PE`, far jump, segment register reload, and final `jmp 0x100000`. The kernel binary placeholder at `0x100000` must now contain valid 32-bit code to avoid a triple fault. Create a minimal `kernel_placeholder.bin`: 16 bytes of `0xF4` (HLT instruction) assembled with `nasm -f bin`.\n\n```makefile\n# Add kernel placeholder to image at sector 9\ndd if=kernel_placeholder.bin of=os.img conv=notrunc bs=512 seek=9\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 3:** `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio -d int 2>int.log`. QEMU should appear to hang (the HLT loop). In `int.log`, verify:\n- No exception vectors 0–20 appear after the disk reads\n- No vector 8 (double fault) from PIC/IVT collision — this would only occur if interrupts were enabled, which they should not be\n- The last CPU state shows `CS=0x0008`, `EFLAGS` with `PE=1` bit in CR0\n\nIf QEMU reboots: `grep \"v=0\" int.log | tail -20` and examine the last vector before reset. Vector 13 (GPF) means segment selector wrong. Vector 6 (invalid opcode) means the far jump address is wrong and CPU is executing data.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4 — Linker script, BSS zeroing, C entry point (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `kernel/linker.ld`, `kernel/entry.asm`, `kernel/include/stdint.h`, `kernel/include/stddef.h`, and `kernel/kmain.c` with a minimal body:\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(void) {\n    volatile uint16_t *vga = (volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000;\n    vga[0] = (uint16_t)'K' | (0x0F << 8);  // White 'K' on black\n    for(;;);\n}\n```\n\nBuild the full kernel:\n```makefile\ni686-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -nostdinc -fno-builtin \\\n    -fno-stack-protector -c kernel/kmain.c -o kmain.o\ni686-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -nostdinc -fno-builtin \\\n    -fno-stack-protector -c kernel/entry.asm -o entry.o  # Use nasm or gas\ni686-elf-ld -T kernel/linker.ld -o kernel.elf entry.o kmain.o\nobjcopy -O binary kernel.elf kernel.bin\n# Verify:\nnm kernel.elf | grep kmain   # Must show address >= 0x100000\nobjdump -h kernel.elf        # Verify .text at 0x100000, .bss after .data\n```\n\nAdd `kernel.bin` to the disk image at sector 9.\n\n**Checkpoint 4:** `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio`. QEMU screen should show a white `K` in the top-left corner. Nothing else. If the screen is blank: check `volatile` on the VGA pointer. If QEMU reboots: `objdump -d kernel.elf | head -30` — verify the first instruction is a valid 32-bit instruction at address `0x100000`.\n\nVerify BSS zeroing: add a `static int bss_test;` global in `kmain.c`, assert its value is 0 via VGA (display `'0'` or `'1'`). If BSS was not zeroed, `bss_test` is non-zero.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5 — VGA text-mode driver (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `kernel/drivers/vga.c` and `kernel/include/vga.h`. Implement `vga_init`, `vga_putchar`, `vga_scroll`, `vga_write_string`, `vga_set_cursor`, `vga_clear`. Update `kmain.c`:\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(void) {\n    vga_init();\n    vga_write_string(\"VGA driver OK\\n\", VGA_WHITE, VGA_BLACK);\n    for(;;);\n}\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 5:** Screen shows `\"VGA driver OK\"` on row 0. Add a test that writes 26 lines of `\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\\n\"` — after the 26th line, scrolling should kick in and the first line should have scrolled off the top. Verify by inspection. Verify `\\n` goes to column 0 of next row. Verify the cursor position after scroll is row 24.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6 — Serial UART driver and kprintf (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `kernel/drivers/serial.c`, `kernel/include/serial.h`, `kernel/kprintf.c`, `kernel/kprintf.h`. Update `kmain.c`:\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(void) {\n    serial_init();\n    vga_init();\n    kprintf(\"Boot OK: hex=0x%08x dec=%d str=%s\\n\", 0xDEADBEEF, -42, \"hello\");\n    for(;;);\n}\n```\n\nLaunch QEMU with: `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio`\n\n**Checkpoint 6:** Terminal shows `\"Boot OK: hex=0xdeadbeef dec=-42 str=hello\"`. VGA shows the same string. Verify:\n- `0x%08x` → `0xdeadbeef` (8 digits, lowercase)\n- `%d` with `-42` → `-42` (not the unsigned representation `4294967254`)\n- `%s` → `hello`\n- The newline scrolls or moves cursor to next line\n\n---\n\n### Phase 7 — Integration test (2–4 hours)\n\nUpdate `kmain.c` to print a complete welcome message with multiple format specifiers. Build and run. The complete QEMU command for the final acceptance test:\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 7 (final):** Screen and terminal both show:\n\n```\nBuild-OS Kernel v0.1\n--------------------\nVGA: OK  Serial: OK\nGDT: 5 descriptors loaded\nMode: 32-bit protected\nCS=0x0008 DS=0x0010\nBSS: zeroed\nBoot complete.\n```\n\nThe `CS` and `DS` values are read via inline assembly and printed with `%04x`. The BSS test confirms `bss_test == 0`. The output appears on both VGA (row 0 onward) and serial (captured in terminal).\n\n---\n\n## 8. Test Specification\n\nAll tests are run in QEMU with `-serial stdio`. Each test verifies one specific behavior. Expected output is exact string match unless noted.\n\n### 8.1 VGA Driver Tests\n\n**T-VGA-1: Single character write**\n- Setup: `vga_init()`, then `vga_putchar('A', VGA_WHITE, VGA_BLACK)`\n- Verify: Cell at VGA `[0][0]` = `0x0F41` (attribute `0x0F`, char `'A'` = `0x41`)\n- Verify via: Read `*(volatile uint16_t*)0xB8000 == 0x0F41` and print result via serial\n\n**T-VGA-2: Cursor advance**\n- Setup: `vga_init()`. Call `vga_putchar('X', fg, bg)` 80 times\n- Verify: After 80 calls, `cursor_row == 1`, `cursor_col == 0` (auto-wrapped to next row)\n\n**T-VGA-3: Newline behavior**\n- Setup: `vga_init()`. `vga_putchar('\\n', fg, bg)` from (row=5, col=30)\n- Verify: `cursor_row == 6`, `cursor_col == 0`. No cell written at (5, 30)\n\n**T-VGA-4: Scroll trigger**\n- Setup: `vga_init()`. Write 26 full lines (26 × `\\n`)\n- Verify: `cursor_row == 24` (scroll occurred); rows 0–23 contain shifted content; row 24 is blank\n\n**T-VGA-5: Color attribute encoding**\n- Setup: `vga_putchar('Z', 0x4 /*red*/, 0x2 /*green*/)`\n- Verify: Written cell = `0x245A` (attribute = `(0x2 << 4) | 0x4 = 0x24`, char = `'Z'` = `0x5A`)\n\n**T-VGA-6: `volatile` required (MMIO not elided)**\n- Compile `vga.c` with optimization `-O2`. Confirm the write to `VGA_BASE` is present in the disassembly: `objdump -d vga.o | grep -A5 \"mov.*0xb8000\"` must show a `mov` instruction to address `0xB8000`\n\n**T-VGA-7: `vga_clear` resets all cells**\n- Setup: Write various characters. Call `vga_clear()`.\n- Verify: All 2000 cells = space + attribute `0x07`. `cursor_row == 0`, `cursor_col == 0`\n\n**T-VGA-8: `vga_scroll` does not corrupt row 0**\n- Setup: Write known values to row 0. Fill screen to trigger scroll.\n- Verify: Row 0 after scroll contains what was previously on row 1, not garbage\n\n---\n\n### 8.2 Serial Driver Tests\n\n**T-SER-1: Initialization completes**\n- Verify: `serial_init()` returns (does not hang). Then `serial_putchar('X')` produces `'X'` on terminal\n\n**T-SER-2: CRLF conversion**\n- Setup: `serial_write_string(\"hello\\nworld\")`\n- Verify: Terminal receives bytes `h e l l o \\r \\n w o r l d` (the `\\n` sends both `\\r` and `\\n`)\n- Verify by: capturing output with `| xxd` in QEMU serial pipe\n\n**T-SER-3: Busy-wait respects THRE**\n- Verify: After writing 100 characters at high rate, no character is lost and no garbled output appears on terminal. This tests that the THRE polling is working.\n\n**T-SER-4: Baud rate sanity**\n- Verify: Output appears at normal readable speed in terminal (not instant = using interrupts incorrectly, not frozen = THRE never set)\n\n---\n\n### 8.3 kprintf Tests\n\n**T-KPRINTF-1: `%d` signed integer**\n- `kprintf(\"%d\", -1)` → `\"-1\"` on both outputs\n- `kprintf(\"%d\", 0)` → `\"0\"`\n- `kprintf(\"%d\", 2147483647)` → `\"2147483647\"` (INT32_MAX)\n- `kprintf(\"%d\", -2147483648)` → `\"-2147483648\"` (INT32_MIN)\n\n**T-KPRINTF-2: `%u` unsigned integer**\n- `kprintf(\"%u\", 4294967295u)` → `\"4294967295\"` (UINT32_MAX)\n- `kprintf(\"%u\", 0)` → `\"0\"`\n\n**T-KPRINTF-3: `%x` hexadecimal**\n- `kprintf(\"%x\", 0xDEADBEEF)` → `\"deadbeef\"` (lowercase)\n- `kprintf(\"%X\", 0xDEADBEEF)` → `\"DEADBEEF\"` (uppercase)\n- `kprintf(\"%x\", 0)` → `\"0\"`\n- `kprintf(\"%08x\", 0xFF)` → `\"000000ff\"` (zero-padded to 8)\n- `kprintf(\"%08x\", 0x0)` → `\"00000000\"`\n\n**T-KPRINTF-4: `%s` string**\n- `kprintf(\"%s\", \"hello\")` → `\"hello\"`\n- `kprintf(\"%s\", NULL)` → `\"(null)\"`\n- `kprintf(\"%s\", \"\")` → `\"\"` (empty, no crash)\n\n**T-KPRINTF-5: `%c` character**\n- `kprintf(\"%c\", 'A')` → `\"A\"`\n- `kprintf(\"%c\", '\\n')` → newline (cursor moves)\n\n**T-KPRINTF-6: `%%` escape**\n- `kprintf(\"100%%\")` → `\"100%\"`\n\n**T-KPRINTF-7: Mixed format**\n- `kprintf(\"PID=%d addr=0x%08x name=%s\\n\", 42, 0x100000, \"kernel\")` → `\"PID=42 addr=0x00100000 name=kernel\\n\"`\n\n**T-KPRINTF-8: Both outputs receive identical content**\n- Any `kprintf` call: verify VGA display and serial terminal receive the same bytes in the same order\n\n---\n\n### 8.4 GDT and Boot Tests\n\n**T-GDT-1: GDT loaded correctly**\n- Verify: After boot, read GDTR via inline asm `sgdt [buf]` and confirm: limit=39, base=expected address\n- `kprintf(\"GDTR base=0x%08x limit=%d\\n\", gdtr_base, gdtr_limit)`\n\n**T-GDT-2: Segment registers**\n- Read CS, DS via inline asm:\n  ```c\n  uint16_t cs, ds;\n  __asm__(\"mov %%cs, %0\" : \"=r\"(cs));\n  __asm__(\"mov %%ds, %0\" : \"=r\"(ds));\n  kprintf(\"CS=0x%04x DS=0x%04x\\n\", cs, ds);\n  ```\n- Expected: `CS=0x0008 DS=0x0010`\n\n**T-GDT-3: Protection active — null descriptor fault**\n- Attempt to load DS with selector 0x00 and verify GPF (triple fault) occurs\n- This is a destructive test; run in a separate QEMU session with `-d int` and verify `v=0d` (GPF vector 13) appears immediately\n\n**T-BOOT-1: Exact 512-byte MBR**\n- `wc -c stage1.bin` → `512`\n\n**T-BOOT-2: Boot signature**\n- `xxd stage1.bin | tail -1` → last bytes are `55 aa`\n\n**T-BOOT-3: BSS is zero**\n- Declare `static volatile uint32_t bss_canary;` in `kmain.c` (no initializer)\n- In `kmain`: `kprintf(\"BSS canary: %u (expect 0)\\n\", bss_canary);`\n- Expected: `\"BSS canary: 0 (expect 0)\"`\n\n**T-BOOT-4: Kernel load address**\n- `nm kernel.elf | grep \"T kmain\"` → address ≥ `0x100000`\n- `objdump -h kernel.elf` → `.text` VMA = `0x00100000`\n\n**T-BOOT-5: A20 operational**\n- Write `0xDEAD` to physical `0x100000` (in Stage2, before kernel load)\n- Write `0xBEEF` to physical `0x000000` (IVT entry 0)\n- Verify the two values are different (A20 enabled, no wraparound)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Performance Targets\n\n| Operation | Target | How to Measure |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|\n| Total boot to `kmain()` | < 500ms | `date` before QEMU launch; observe first VGA character |\n| INT 13h sector read (QEMU) | < 1ms per sector | Timestamp via PIT if available; otherwise empirical |\n| `vga_putchar` single character | 100–200ns | Count cycles with `rdtsc` before/after; divide by clock rate |\n| `vga_scroll` (full screen shift) | < 1ms (2000 MMIO writes × 200ns) | `rdtsc` around scroll call |\n| `serial_putchar` single byte | < 270µs (one char-time at 38400 baud) | Measure wall time for 100 chars: should be ~26ms |\n| BSS zero (64KB) | < 50µs | `rdtsc`; 16K dword stores at ~1 cycle each ÷ clock |\n| `kprintf` 80-char string to both outputs | < 25ms | Dominated by serial (~260µs × 80 chars) |\n| GDT load (`lgdt` + far jump) | < 100 cycles (one-time) | `rdtsc` before/after in Stage2; subtract baseline |\n| `kprintf` integer formatting (no I/O) | < 500ns | Instrument with `rdtsc`; subtract VGA/serial time |\n\n**How to use `rdtsc` before interrupt infrastructure exists:**\n\n```c\nstatic inline uint64_t rdtsc(void) {\n    uint32_t lo, hi;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"rdtsc\" : \"=a\"(lo), \"=d\"(hi));\n    return ((uint64_t)hi << 32) | lo;\n}\n// Usage:\nuint64_t t0 = rdtsc();\nvga_scroll();\nuint64_t t1 = rdtsc();\nkprintf(\"scroll cycles: %u\\n\", (uint32_t)(t1 - t0));\n```\n\nQEMU's virtual TSC runs at approximately the host CPU frequency. On a 2GHz host: 1 cycle ≈ 0.5ns. Use this to convert cycle counts to wall-clock estimates.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Hardware Soul Analysis\n\n### VGA MMIO at `0xB8000`\n\n**Cache behavior:** The VGA buffer is a physical MMIO region. On real hardware, the CPU's MTRR (Memory Type Range Registers) or PAT (Page Attribute Table) mark it as Write-Combining or Uncacheable — writes bypass L1/L2/L3 and go directly to the ISA bus bridge. On QEMU, writes to `0xB8000` are intercepted by the virtual VGA device and rendered immediately. No cache warm-up effect exists. Each `uint16_t` write costs a full memory bus transaction (~100–200ns on real hardware; faster on QEMU).\n\n**`volatile` is mandatory:** Without `volatile`, GCC at `-O2` observes that the VGA array is written-to but never read back from C code, treats the writes as dead stores, and eliminates them entirely. The compiled binary contains no reference to `0xB8000`. The `volatile` qualifier forces every store to be emitted as a machine instruction, regardless of optimization level.\n\n**TLB irrelevance:** No page tables are active in this module. The CPU translates addresses as physical = virtual (the MMU is bypassed before `CR0.PG` is set, which does not happen until Milestone 3). There is no TLB miss possible here.\n\n### Serial Port I/O\n\n**Port I/O vs MMIO:** Unlike VGA, the UART uses the x86 I/O address space (a separate 16-bit address space accessed via `in`/`out` instructions, distinct from the memory address space). The `in`/`out` instructions stall the CPU until the I/O bus transaction completes — legacy ISA devices respond in 1–4µs. This is why `io_wait()` uses `outb(0x80, 0)` — a deliberate 1–4µs stall between UART configuration writes to allow the chip's internal state machine to settle.\n\n**Branch predictability:** The `serial_putchar` busy-wait loop (`while (!(inb(0x3FD) & 0x20))`) is a tight I/O-bound spin. The branch is perfectly predictable in the \"spin\" direction (the CPU predicts \"not ready\" for the first several iterations) and mispredicts exactly once (when THRE transitions from 0 to 1). Misprediction cost: ~15 cycles — negligible compared to the 260µs character time.\n\n### GDT Load and Far Jump\n\n**Pipeline flush cost:** The far jump after `CR0.PE` discards all prefetched and partially-decoded instructions in the CPU's out-of-order execution pipeline. On a modern CPU with a 20-stage pipeline and aggressive out-of-order execution, this flushes up to 100+ in-flight micro-operations. Cost: ~20–30 cycles — a one-time expense that ensures no real-mode-decoded instructions execute in protected mode.\n\n**`lgdt` instruction behavior:** `lgdt` is a serializing instruction — it completes all previous memory operations before executing, and subsequent instructions see the new GDTR value. It does not flush the TLB (no page tables yet) but does serialize the instruction stream.\n\n### BSS Zeroing\n\n**`rep stosd` microarchitecture:** On modern x86 CPUs, `rep stosd` is recognized by the microcode as a \"fast string\" operation and is executed as a DMA-like operation within the CPU core, filling ~16 bytes per cycle (4 dwords per cycle). For a 64KB BSS section: 16384 dword stores at 4 stores/cycle = ~4096 cycles = ~2µs at 2GHz. The target memory is in DRAM (not yet in any cache); the CPU will generate cache-line-sized (64-byte) store bursts, filling 16 dwords per cache line write = efficient memory bandwidth utilization.\n\n**Memory access pattern:** Sequential write from `__bss_start` to `__bss_end`. Hardware prefetcher detects the stride and issues prefetch requests for upcoming cache lines. Effective throughput approaches memory bandwidth limit rather than being limited by cache miss latency. This is the ideal access pattern for bulk initialization.\n\n\n![Kernel Virtual Address Space: Linker Script Section Layout](./diagrams/tdd-diag-6.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## 11. State Diagram\n\n\n![VGA Text Buffer Memory-Mapped Layout: 80×25 Cell Grid](./diagrams/tdd-diag-7.svg)\n\n\n**States:**\n\n| State | CR0.PE | IF | CS Value | Valid Actions |\n|-------|--------|-----|----------|---------------|\n| `REAL_MODE_16BIT` | 0 | 1 | 0x0000 | BIOS calls, real-mode execution |\n| `UNREAL_MODE` | 0→1→0 | 0 | 0x0000 | Read/write > 1MB via extended segment |\n| `CLI_ACTIVE` | 0 | **0** | 0x0000 | `lgdt` only; no BIOS calls |\n| `GDT_LOADED` | 0 | 0 | 0x0000 | `mov cr0, eax` only |\n| `PROTECTED_MODE_UNSTABLE` | 1 | 0 | 0x0000 (stale!) | `jmp 0x08:label` ONLY |\n| `PROTECTED_MODE_STABLE` | 1 | 0 | 0x0008 | Segment register loads, kernel jump |\n| `KERNEL_EXECUTING` | 1 | 0 | 0x0008 | All valid kernel operations |\n\n**Illegal transitions:**\n- `PROTECTED_MODE_*` → `REAL_MODE`: Undefined behavior; no supported return path in this module\n- `CLI_ACTIVE` → BIOS interrupt fires: Results in `TRIPLE_FAULT` (IVT invalid in protected mode)\n- `GDT_LOADED` → any operation except `mov cr0`: Technically legal but wastes the atomic protection window\n- `PROTECTED_MODE_UNSTABLE` → any instruction except far jump: CPU prefetch may execute real-mode-decoded instructions in protected mode\n\n---\n\n## 12. Concurrency Specification\n\nThis module runs on a single core with interrupts disabled from `cli` (in Stage2) through the end of `kmain()`. There is no concurrency. However, two aspects of the code require reasoning about execution order that resembles a concurrency concern:\n\n**MMIO write ordering (VGA):** The `volatile` qualifier ensures the compiler emits stores to `0xB8000` in program order. On x86, all stores are visible to the I/O bus in program order (x86 Total Store Order guarantees store-store ordering). No `sfence` or `mfence` is needed because there are no other CPUs or DMA agents that could observe reordering.\n\n**Port I/O ordering (UART):** The `io_wait()` call between UART configuration writes acts as a timing barrier, not a memory ordering barrier. The UART chip's state machine requires settling time between configuration writes. The `outb(0x80, 0)` in `io_wait()` is an I/O write that stalls the CPU for ~1–4µs while the I/O bus transaction completes. This is sufficient for the 16550 UART's state machine transitions. No explicit memory fence is required because each `outb` is already a serializing operation on legacy I/O ports.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Synced Criteria\n\n```\n\n```\n\n\n<!-- TDD_MOD_ID: mod-2 -->\n# Technical Design Specification: Interrupts, Exceptions, and Keyboard\n\n**Module ID:** `mod-2` | **Milestone:** `build-os-m2` | **Estimated Hours:** 18–26\n\n---\n\n## 1. Module Charter\n\nThis module configures the x86 interrupt infrastructure — the IDT, 8259 PIC cascade, CPU exception handlers, hardware IRQ handlers, PIT timer, and PS/2 keyboard driver — starting from a protected-mode kernel with no interrupt handling and ending with all 256 IDT gates populated, interrupts enabled, a 100Hz tick counter running, and a keyboard input buffer available for polling. Every interrupt that fires after `sti` goes through a path this module owns.\n\nThis module does **not** implement a process scheduler (the timer handler only increments a counter), page tables or virtual memory, a kernel heap, the TSS, system calls, or the INT 0x80 gate (DPL=3 trap gate setup is declared here for completeness but activated in Milestone 4). The module does not implement APIC or MSI-X — only the 8259 PIC cascade is used. No floating-point state (x87/SSE registers) is saved in interrupt handlers.\n\n**Upstream dependency:** Module `mod-1` — protected mode active, GDT loaded with kernel code (0x08) and data (0x10) selectors, VGA and serial output functional, `kprintf` available, interrupts disabled.\n\n**Downstream dependency:** Module `mod-3` (memory management) receives a running timer tick counter (`pit_tick_count`) and the IDT infrastructure to register a page fault handler. Module `mod-4` (scheduling) installs the scheduler into the timer IRQ handler slot and registers the system call gate.\n\n**Invariants that must hold at module exit:**\n1. IDT contains exactly 256 valid gate descriptors; the IDTR register points to it with limit = 2047.\n2. Master PIC delivers IRQ0–7 at vectors 32–39; slave PIC delivers IRQ8–15 at vectors 40–47. Vectors 0–31 are reserved exclusively for CPU exceptions.\n3. Every ISR/IRQ handler restores the interrupted CPU to an identical register state (all 8 general-purpose registers, 4 segment registers, EFLAGS, EIP) unless the handler explicitly modifies the saved frame to change behavior.\n4. EOI is sent to the PIC on every hardware IRQ invocation before returning from the IRQ handler.\n5. `pit_tick_count` increments by 1 per timer period (10ms at 100Hz); it is never incremented by software.\n6. `keyboard_getchar()` returns bytes placed there exclusively by the IRQ1 handler; no other code path writes to the circular buffer.\n7.

Assembly stubs reference C symbols declared in headers; headers must exist when assembly is assembled. `pic.c` must compile before `pit.c` and `keyboard.c` because both call `irq_install_handler` which references the IRQ dispatcher registered in `interrupt.c`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Complete Data Model\n\n### 3.1 IDT Gate Descriptor — Byte-Level Layout\n\nEach IDT entry is exactly **8 bytes**, hardware-defined by Intel. The layout must match the CPU specification precisely; `__attribute__((packed))` is mandatory.\n\n```\nByte offset within one 8-byte IDT gate entry:\n\nByte:  7        6        5        4        3-2      1-0\n      ┌────────┬─────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────────────┐\n      │Offset  │P│DPL│0  │Type    │Zero    │Segment │Offset          │\n      │[31:16] │ │   │   │[3:0]   │(0x00)  │Selector│[15:0]          │\n      │2 bytes │1│2b │1b │4 bits  │1 byte  │2 bytes │2 bytes         │\n      └────────┴─────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────────────┘\n\nByte 0–1:  offset_low   Handler address bits [15:0]\nByte 2–3:  selector     Code segment selector to use for handler (always 0x08: kernel code)\nByte 4:    zero         Reserved; must be 0x00\nByte 5:    type_attr    Packed field: P|DPL[1:0]|0|Type[3:0]\nByte 6–7:  offset_high  Handler address bits [31:16]\n```\n\n**`type_attr` bit decomposition (byte 5):**\n\n```\nBit:  7    6  5    4    3  2  1  0\n      P   DPL[1:0]  0   Type[3:0]\n      │    │  │     │    └─────────── Gate type\n      │    └──┘     └──────────────── Must be 0\n      └──────────────────────────────── Present (1 = valid gate)\n\nGate types used in this module:\n  0xE = 0b1110  32-bit Interrupt Gate  (clears IF on entry)\n  0xF = 0b1111  32-bit Trap Gate       (preserves IF on entry)\n```\n\n**Predefined `type_attr` constants:**\n\n| Constant | Value | Binary | Meaning |\n|----------|-------|--------|---------|\n| `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE` | `0x8E` | `1 00 0 1110` | P=1, DPL=0, 32-bit interrupt gate; IF cleared on entry |\n| `IDT_TRAP_GATE` | `0x8F` | `1 00 0 1111` | P=1, DPL=0, 32-bit trap gate; IF preserved on entry |\n| `IDT_SYSCALL_GATE` | `0xEF` | `1 11 0 1111` | P=1, DPL=3, 32-bit trap gate; user-mode callable via `int N` |\n\n**Why interrupt gate for IRQ handlers:** Setting IF=0 on entry prevents a timer IRQ from interrupting the timer handler (no reentrancy), and prevents a keyboard IRQ from interrupting the keyboard handler. This simplifies handler design at the cost of slightly increased interrupt latency for other IRQs while the handler runs. Acceptable for a single-core kernel with short handlers (<100 cycles each).\n\n**Why trap gate for CPU exceptions:** Exceptions (divide-by-zero, page fault, GPF) benefit from IF=1 during handling — a page fault handler may need to perform I/O that requires timer ticks. Trap gates also allow a GDB stub to break in during exception handling. For this module, all exception handlers halt, so the distinction is academic but correct.\n\n**C struct definition:**\n\n```c\n/* include/idt.h */\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint16_t offset_low;    /* Handler address [15:0]              */\n    uint16_t selector;      /* Code segment selector (0x08)        */\n    uint8_t  zero;          /* Always 0x00 per Intel spec          */\n    uint8_t  type_attr;     /* P | DPL | 0 | Type                  */\n    uint16_t offset_high;   /* Handler address [31:16]             */\n} idt_gate_t;               /* sizeof = 8; assert in idt.c         */\n\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint16_t limit;          /* Size of IDT in bytes minus 1 = 2047 */\n    uint32_t base;           /* Physical address of idt[] array      */\n} idtr_t;                    /* sizeof = 6                           */\n```\n\n**Memory layout of `idt[]` array:**\n\n```\nidt[0]   bytes 0–7:    Vector 0  (Divide Error)\nidt[1]   bytes 8–15:   Vector 1  (Debug)\n...\nidt[31]  bytes 248–255: Vector 31 (Reserved)\nidt[32]  bytes 256–263: Vector 32 (IRQ0: Timer)\n...\nidt[47]  bytes 376–383: Vector 47 (IRQ15: Secondary ATA)\nidt[48]–idt[127]:  Unused; installed with a default_isr stub (prints and halts)\nidt[128] bytes 1024–1031: Vector 0x80 (system call gate, DPL=3; configured in mod-4)\nidt[129]–idt[255]: Unused; default_isr stub\n\nTotal: 256 × 8 = 2048 bytes.

Every byte offset is load-bearing — the assembly stubs push values in a fixed order and the C code reads them by field offset.\n\n**Stack state when `exception_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame)` is called:**\n\nThe argument `frame` is a pointer to the stack, laid out (from lower to higher address) as:\n\n```\nLow address (top of stack, frame pointer)\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  gs           [frame + 0]    uint32_t   Saved GS     │\n│  fs           [frame + 4]    uint32_t   Saved FS     │\n│  es           [frame + 8]    uint32_t   Saved ES     │\n│  ds           [frame + 12]   uint32_t   Saved DS     │\n│  edi          [frame + 16]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  esi          [frame + 20]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  ebp          [frame + 24]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  esp_pusha    [frame + 28]   uint32_t   ESP at pusha (ignored by popa) │\n│  ebx          [frame + 32]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  edx          [frame + 36]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  ecx          [frame + 40]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  eax          [frame + 44]   uint32_t   From pusha   │\n│  vector       [frame + 48]   uint32_t   Pushed by ISR stub           │\n│  error_code   [frame + 52]   uint32_t   CPU-pushed or dummy 0        │\n│  eip          [frame + 56]   uint32_t   CPU-pushed return address     │\n│  cs           [frame + 60]   uint32_t   CPU-pushed code segment       │\n│  eflags       [frame + 64]   uint32_t   CPU-pushed flags              │\n│  user_esp     [frame + 68]   uint32_t   Only if ring-3 → ring-0      │\n│  user_ss      [frame + 72]   uint32_t   Only if ring-3 → ring-0      │\n└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nHigh address (bottom of stack)\n```\n\n**C struct definition:**\n\n```c\n/* include/interrupt.h */\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    /* Saved by isr_common_stub / irq_common_stub (in push order, low→high) */\n    uint32_t gs, fs, es, ds;                /* Segment registers (pushed last → first pop) */\n    uint32_t edi, esi, ebp, esp_pusha;      /* pusha order: EDI, ESI, EBP, ESP, EBX, EDX, ECX, EAX */\n    uint32_t ebx, edx, ecx, eax;\n    /* Pushed by ISR/IRQ stub before jmp common_stub */\n    uint32_t vector;                         /* Interrupt vector number (0–255)             */\n    uint32_t error_code;                     /* CPU error code or 0 (dummy) for no-error exceptions */\n    /* CPU-pushed automatically on interrupt (always present) */\n    uint32_t eip;                            /* Return address (instruction to resume)      */\n    uint32_t cs;                             /* Code segment at time of interrupt           */\n    uint32_t eflags;                         /* EFLAGS at time of interrupt                 */\n    /* CPU-pushed ONLY for ring-3 → ring-0 transitions */\n    uint32_t user_esp;                       /* User-mode ESP (only valid when cs & 3 == 3) */\n    uint32_t user_ss;                        /* User-mode SS  (only valid when cs & 3 == 3) */\n} interrupt_frame_t;\n\n/* Check ring level: was the interrupted code in user mode? */\n#define FRAME_FROM_RING3(frame) (((frame)->cs & 0x3) == 3)\n```\n\n**Why `esp_pusha` is not the real ESP:** The `pusha` instruction pushes ESP's value as it was *before* `pusha` executed (i.e., before the eight pushes). The `popa` instruction ignores the ESP field it pops (it does not restore ESP from the saved value; ESP is advanced by 32 bytes by the `popa` instruction itself). Field `esp_pusha` is present in the struct for layout accuracy but should not be used to read or write the interrupted process's stack pointer — use `user_esp` for user-mode stack pointer access.\n\n\n![ISR Stack Frame Layout: Ring 0 vs Ring 3 Interrupt](./diagrams/tdd-diag-10.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 8259 PIC Register Map\n\nTwo 8259 PICs in cascade.

Extended key prefix `0xE0` causes the driver to set a one-shot flag that discards the next scancode byte; this prevents `0xE0 0x1D` (right Ctrl) from being interpreted as `0x1D` (left Ctrl).\n\n### 3.6 Circular Keyboard Buffer\n\n```c\n#define KB_BUFFER_SIZE  256   /* Must be a power of 2 for mask-based wrap */\n\ntypedef struct {\n    char     buf[KB_BUFFER_SIZE]; /* Storage                                */\n    uint8_t  head;                /* Next write position (written by IRQ1)  */\n    uint8_t  tail;                /* Next read position  (read by getchar)  */\n} kb_ring_t;\n```\n\n**Invariants:**\n- Buffer is empty when `head == tail`.\n- Buffer is full when `(head + 1) & (KB_BUFFER_SIZE - 1) == tail`.\n- `head` and `tail` are `uint8_t` (8-bit). With `KB_BUFFER_SIZE = 256`, incrementing wraps automatically via unsigned overflow — no modulo operation needed.\n- Exactly one writer (IRQ1 handler) and exactly one reader (`keyboard_getchar()`). On a single-core system with IF=0 during the IRQ1 handler, no locking is required.\n- On overflow (buffer full), the incoming character is **silently dropped** (head is not advanced). The oldest unread characters are preserved. This is the standard terminal behavior.\n\n**Memory layout:**\n\n```\nOffset  Field     Type      Purpose\n0       buf       char[256] Character storage; circular\n256     head      uint8_t   IRQ1 handler writes here; advance after write\n257     tail      uint8_t   getchar reads here; advance after read\n258     (pad)     2 bytes   Align to 4 bytes\nTotal:  260 bytes\n```\n\n\n![PIC Default vs Remapped Vector Assignment and Collision Diagram](./diagrams/tdd-diag-11.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## 4. Interface Contracts\n\n### 4.1 `idt_set_gate(uint8_t vector, uint32_t handler, uint16_t selector, uint8_t type_attr) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `vector`: IDT index [0, 255]. No range check performed; caller is responsible. Out-of-range value writes beyond the IDT array (undefined behavior).\n- `handler`: Full 32-bit virtual address of the ISR/IRQ assembly stub. Must be a valid code address in kernel space. If 0 is passed, the gate is technically valid (handler at address 0) but will crash if invoked; this is not checked.\n- `selector`: GDT code segment selector. Must be `0x08` (kernel code segment) for all handlers in this module. Other values are accepted but result in a GPF if the selector is not a valid present code descriptor.\n- `type_attr`: Gate type and flags byte. Must be one of `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE` (0x8E), `IDT_TRAP_GATE` (0x8F), or `IDT_SYSCALL_GATE` (0xEF). Other values produce non-standard gate configurations and may cause GPF on invocation.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `idt[vector].offset_low == handler & 0xFFFF`, `idt[vector].offset_high == (handler >> 16) & 0xFFFF`, `idt[vector].selector == selector`, `idt[vector].zero == 0`, `idt[vector].type_attr == type_attr`.\n\n**Errors:** None propagated. Silent on invalid inputs.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```c\nvoid idt_set_gate(uint8_t vector, uint32_t handler, uint16_t selector, uint8_t type_attr) {\n    idt[vector].offset_low  = (uint16_t)(handler & 0xFFFF);\n    idt[vector].selector    = selector;\n    idt[vector].zero        = 0x00;\n    idt[vector].type_attr   = type_attr;\n    idt[vector].offset_high = (uint16_t)((handler >> 16) & 0xFFFF);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 `idt_install(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** `idt[]` array fully populated (all 256 entries set to either a real handler or the default stub).\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Sets `idtr.limit = sizeof(idt) - 1 = 2047`.\n2. Sets `idtr.base = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)idt`.\n3. Executes `lidt [idtr]` via inline assembly: `__asm__ volatile (\"lidt %0\" : : \"m\"(idtr))`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** The CPU's IDTR register holds the base address of `idt[]` and limit 2047. Any subsequent interrupt uses this table.\n\n**Errors:** None. If `idt[]` was not fully populated before this call, subsequent interrupts will invoke uninitialized gate descriptors, which will triple-fault.\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 `idt_setup_all(void) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** Calls `idt_set_gate` for all 256 vectors, then calls `idt_install()`. Calls are made in vector-number order (0 first, 255 last). All exception vectors (0–31) use `IDT_TRAP_GATE`. All IRQ vectors (32–47) use `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE`. Vectors 48–127 and 129–255 use `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE` with the `default_isr` handler. Vector 128 (0x80) is set to `default_isr` with `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE` in this module; `idt_setup_all` does not install the system call gate (that is mod-4's responsibility, which calls `idt_set_gate(0x80, ...)` after `idt_setup_all` returns).\n\n**Post-conditions:** IDTR loaded. All 256 gates valid. No interrupt vector points to an uninitialized gate.\n\n**Errors:** None propagated. If any `isr*` or `irq*` symbol is undefined (linker error), the build fails before this function is ever called.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 `exception_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Called from `isr_common_stub` with `frame` pointing to the kernel stack containing the saved CPU state. Interrupts may be enabled (trap gate) or disabled (interrupt gate). DS, ES, FS, GS have been loaded with kernel data segment (0x10) by the stub.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `frame`: Pointer to the complete saved CPU state on the kernel stack. Must not be NULL. The caller (assembly stub) guarantees this.\n\n**Behavior for `frame->vector < 32` (CPU exception):**\n1. Print `\"\\n=== CPU EXCEPTION ===\" ` via `kprintf`.\n2. Print `\"Exception: [name] (vector [N])\\n\"` using the `exception_names[]` table.\n3. Print `\"Error code: 0x%08x\\n\"` using `frame->error_code`.\n4. Print `\"EIP=0x%08x CS=0x%04x EFLAGS=0x%08x\\n\"`.\n5. Print `\"EAX=0x%08x EBX=0x%08x ECX=0x%08x EDX=0x%08x\\n\"`.\n6. Print `\"ESI=0x%08x EDI=0x%08x EBP=0x%08x\\n\"`.\n7. If `frame->vector == 14` (page fault): Read CR2 via `mov %%cr2, %0` inline asm. Print `\"CR2 (faulting addr): 0x%08x\\n\"`.\n8. If `FRAME_FROM_RING3(frame)`: Print `\"User-mode fault: user_esp=0x%08x user_ss=0x%04x\\n\"`.\n9. Print `\"System halted.\\n\"`.\n10. Execute `for (;;) { __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\"); }`.\n\n**Behavior for `frame->vector >= 32`:** This path should never be reached (IRQ handlers go through `irq_dispatcher`, not `exception_handler`). If somehow invoked: print `\"Unexpected vector %d in exception_handler\\n\"` and halt.\n\n**Return:** Never returns for vectors 0–31 (halts). For vectors ≥32, halts as above.\n\n**Errors:** `kprintf` cannot fail. If VGA/serial were not initialized (impossible given module ordering), output is lost but halt still occurs.\n\n---\n\n### 4.5 `irq_install_handler(uint8_t irq, irq_handler_t handler) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `irq`: IRQ number [0, 15]. Values outside this range: no-op (silently ignored after bounds check).\n- `handler`: Function pointer of type `void (*)(interrupt_frame_t *)`. NULL is valid and means \"uninstall the handler for this IRQ\" (future IRQs on this line invoke only EOI, no user function).\n\n**Post-conditions:** `irq_handlers[irq] == handler`.\n\n**Thread safety:** Single-core only. Must be called before `sti` or with `cli`/`sti` around the call.\n\n**Errors:** Out-of-range `irq` (> 15): silently ignored. NULL `handler`: accepted; `irq_dispatcher` checks for NULL before calling.\n\n---\n\n### 4.6 `irq_dispatcher(interrupt_frame_t *frame) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Called from `irq_common_stub` with `frame` pointing to the kernel stack. `frame->vector` is in range [32, 47]. All segment registers loaded with kernel data selector.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Extract `irq = (uint8_t)(frame->vector - 32)`.\n2. If `irq_handlers[irq] != NULL`: call `irq_handlers[irq](frame)`.\n3. Call `pic_send_eoi(irq)` unconditionally (even if no handler registered, even if the handler did not run).\n\n**Return:** Returns normally. The assembly stub restores registers and executes `iret`.\n\n**Why EOI after handler:** Sending EOI before calling the handler would allow the PIC to re-deliver the same IRQ before the handler completes — problematic for non-reentrant handlers. Sending after prevents this at the cost that the handler runs with that IRQ line masked. For this module's short handlers (<100 cycles), the difference is immeasurable.\n\n---\n\n### 4.7 `pic_remap(uint8_t master_offset, uint8_t slave_offset) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `master_offset`: Vector base for IRQ0–7. Must be a multiple of 8 (hardware constraint: the PIC uses the lower 3 bits for IRQ sub-number). Pass `0x20` (32).\n- `slave_offset`: Vector base for IRQ8–15. Must be a multiple of 8. Pass `0x28` (40). Must be `master_offset + 8`.\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Call before `sti`. Call after IDT is fully populated (so no IRQ fires before handlers are ready).\n\n**Behavior:** Executes the complete ICW1–ICW4 initialization sequence for both PICs with `io_wait()` between each write. Saves the IMR of both PICs before initialization and restores them afterward.\n\n**Post-conditions:** Master PIC delivers IRQ0–7 at `master_offset` through `master_offset + 7`. Slave PIC delivers IRQ8–15 at `slave_offset` through `slave_offset + 7`. Interrupt masks are identical to pre-call state.\n\n**Errors:** None detectable — the PIC provides no acknowledgment. If the wrong values are passed (not multiples of 8), the PIC silently uses them, causing vectors to overlap unexpectedly.\n\n---\n\n### 4.8 `pic_send_eoi(uint8_t irq) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `irq`: IRQ number [0, 15]. Values > 15 are treated as master EOI only (safe fallback).\n\n**Behavior:**\n- If `irq >= 8`: `outb(PIC2_CMD, PIC_EOI)` — acknowledge slave PIC first.\n- Always: `outb(PIC1_CMD, PIC_EOI)` — acknowledge master PIC.\n\n**Why slave first:** The slave connects to the master via IRQ2. After the slave EOI, the master sees its IRQ2 input go inactive. The master EOI then releases the master's in-service bit. If you EOI the master first, the master re-enables delivery of future IRQs while the slave still has its ISR bit set — the slave cannot deliver another IRQ through the cascade until its own ISR bit is cleared, but the ordering is still correct. Slave-first is conventional and prevents any edge-case behavior on real 8259 hardware.\n\n**Errors:** None. If `pic_send_eoi` is never called after an IRQ, the PIC permanently suppresses further IRQs on that line with no error message.\n\n---\n\n### 4.9 `pic_get_isr(uint8_t pic) → uint8_t`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `pic`: `0` = master, `1` = slave.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. `outb(pic == 0 ? PIC1_CMD : PIC2_CMD, 0x0B)` — OCW3: read ISR.\n2. `return inb(pic == 0 ? PIC1_CMD : PIC2_CMD)`.\n\n**Returns:** 8-bit ISR register value. Bit N set = IRQ N is currently being serviced (in-service register).\n\n**Purpose:** Used by spurious IRQ handlers (IRQ7 and IRQ15) to verify whether the IRQ was genuine (ISR bit set) or spurious (ISR bit clear). See §5.3.\n\n---\n\n### 4.10 `pic_set_mask(uint8_t irq) → void` and `pic_clear_mask(uint8_t irq) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `irq`: IRQ number [0, 15].\n\n**`pic_set_mask` behavior:** Reads the current IMR from the appropriate PIC data port. Sets bit `(irq % 8)`. Writes back. Effect: that IRQ line is masked (suppressed); the PIC will not forward it to the CPU until unmasked.\n\n**`pic_clear_mask` behavior:** Reads IMR, clears bit `(irq % 8)`, writes back. Effect: IRQ line enabled.\n\n**Use case in this module:** After `pic_remap()`, all IRQs are unmasked (masks restored from pre-remap state, which is typically all-enabled except for lines with no devices). `pic_set_mask` is not called during normal initialization but is declared for completeness and future use.\n\n---\n\n### 4.11 `pit_init(uint32_t hz) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `hz`: Desired timer frequency in Hz. Valid range: [1, 1193182]. Values outside this range are clamped: `hz < 1 → hz = 1` (minimum frequency, divisor = 65535); `hz > 1193182 → hz = 1193182` (maximum, divisor = 1). Pass `100` for this module.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Compute divisor: `uint32_t divisor = 1193182 / hz`. Clamp to [1, 65535].\n2. `outb(0x43, 0x36)` — PIT command: channel 0, lo/hi, mode 2, binary.\n3. `outb(0x40, (uint8_t)(divisor & 0xFF))` — low byte.\n4. `outb(0x40, (uint8_t)((divisor >> 8) & 0xFF))` — high byte.\n5. `irq_install_handler(0, timer_handler)` — register timer IRQ handler.\n\n**Post-conditions:** PIT channel 0 fires IRQ0 at approximately `hz` Hz. `irq_handlers[0]` points to `timer_handler`.\n\n**Errors:** None. If `irq_install_handler` was not available (impossible given module structure), the timer would fire but no handler would increment `pit_tick_count`.\n\n---\n\n### 4.12 `timer_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) → void`\n\n**Parameters:** `frame` — ignored in this module (pointer set to `(void)frame`).\n\n**Behavior:** `pit_tick_count++`. Returns immediately. EOI is sent by `irq_dispatcher` after this function returns.\n\n**Errors:** None.\n\n**Note:** In Milestone 4, this function is replaced (or extended) by the scheduler. The function is declared `static` in `pit.c` and registered via `irq_install_handler` — it can be overridden by calling `irq_install_handler(0, new_handler)` from mod-4's `sched_init()`.\n\n---\n\n### 4.13 `keyboard_init(void) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** \n1. Zeros the `kb_ring` struct: `head = 0`, `tail = 0`, all buffer bytes = 0.\n2. Calls `irq_install_handler(1, keyboard_handler)`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `irq_handlers[1] == keyboard_handler`. Keyboard buffer is empty and ready.\n\n---\n\n### 4.14 `keyboard_getchar(void) → char`\n\n**Returns:** Next ASCII character from the keyboard buffer, or `0` (null byte) if the buffer is empty.\n\n**Behavior:**\n```c\nchar keyboard_getchar(void) {\n    if (kb_ring.head == kb_ring.tail) return 0;  /* Empty */\n    char c = kb_ring.buf[kb_ring.tail];\n    kb_ring.tail++;   /* uint8_t overflow wraps at 256 = KB_BUFFER_SIZE */\n    return c;\n}\n```\n\n**Thread safety:** Single-core only. On a multi-core system, atomic load/store or a lock would be required. For this module: acceptable.\n\n**Errors:** Returns `0` if buffer empty. `0` is not a valid printable ASCII character; callers check for non-zero before acting on the return value.\n\n---\n\n### 4.15 `keyboard_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Called from `irq_dispatcher` with interrupts disabled (interrupt gate). DS = kernel data segment.\n\n**Behavior:** See full algorithm in §5.4.\n\n**Returns:** Returns normally. `irq_dispatcher` sends EOI after return.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Algorithm Specification\n\n### 5.1 ISR Assembly Stubs — Error Code Asymmetry\n\n**Problem:** CPU exceptions 0–31 push an error code onto the stack before invoking the handler, but only for specific exceptions. All IRQ stubs and most exception stubs must maintain a uniform stack frame to allow a single `isr_common_stub` to handle all cases.\n\n**Solution:** For exceptions without an error code, the stub pushes a dummy zero before pushing the vector number. For exceptions with an error code, the stub pushes only the vector number (the CPU already pushed the error code).\n\n**Which exceptions push an error code:**\n\n| Push Error Code | Vectors |\n|----------------|---------|\n| Yes | 8 (double fault, always 0), 10 (invalid TSS), 11 (segment not present), 12 (stack fault), 13 (GPF), 14 (page fault), 17 (alignment check) |\n| No | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20–31 |\n\n**NASM macro definitions:**\n\n```nasm\n; isr_stubs.asm — exception stubs for vectors 0-31\n\n%macro ISR_NOERR 1\n    global isr%1\n    isr%1:\n        push dword 0        ; Dummy error code — maintains uniform frame layout\n        push dword %1       ; Vector number\n        jmp isr_common_stub\n%endmacro\n\n%macro ISR_ERR 1\n    global isr%1\n    isr%1:\n        ; CPU has already pushed error code onto the stack\n        push dword %1       ; Vector number (error code is below this on stack)\n        jmp isr_common_stub\n%endmacro\n```\n\n**Stub instantiation (must match the table above exactly):**\n\n```nasm\nISR_NOERR 0    ; Divide Error\nISR_NOERR 1    ; Debug / ICEBP\nISR_NOERR 2    ; Non-Maskable Interrupt\nISR_NOERR 3    ; Breakpoint\nISR_NOERR 4    ; INTO Overflow\nISR_NOERR 5    ; BOUND Range Exceeded\nISR_NOERR 6    ; Invalid Opcode (UD2)\nISR_NOERR 7    ; Device Not Available (FPU)\nISR_ERR   8    ; Double Fault (error code = 0, but CPU pushes it)\nISR_NOERR 9    ; Coprocessor Segment Overrun (legacy, 486-era)\nISR_ERR   10   ; Invalid TSS\nISR_ERR   11   ; Segment Not Present\nISR_ERR   12   ; Stack-Segment Fault\nISR_ERR   13   ; General Protection Fault\nISR_ERR   14   ; Page Fault\nISR_NOERR 15   ; Reserved (Intel-defined, do not use)\nISR_NOERR 16   ; x87 Floating-Point Error\nISR_ERR   17   ; Alignment Check\nISR_NOERR 18   ; Machine Check (abort; no recovery)\nISR_NOERR 19   ; SIMD Floating-Point Exception\nISR_NOERR 20   ; Virtualization Exception (VMX)\nISR_NOERR 21   ; Control Protection Exception (CET)\n; Vectors 22–31: Intel reserved; ISR_NOERR for all\nISR_NOERR 22\nISR_NOERR 23\nISR_NOERR 24\nISR_NOERR 25\nISR_NOERR 26\nISR_NOERR 27\nISR_NOERR 28\nISR_NOERR 29\nISR_NOERR 30\nISR_NOERR 31\n```\n\n**`isr_common_stub` — unified save, dispatch, restore:**\n\n```nasm\n; isr_common_stub\n; Stack on entry (top to bottom = low to high address):\n;   [esp+0]  vector number         (pushed by stub)\n;   [esp+4]  error code or 0       (pushed by stub or CPU)\n;   [esp+8]  EIP                   (CPU-pushed)\n;   [esp+12] CS                    (CPU-pushed)\n;   [esp+16] EFLAGS                (CPU-pushed)\n;   [esp+20] user_esp              (CPU-pushed ONLY if from ring 3)\n;   [esp+24] user_ss               (CPU-pushed ONLY if from ring 3)\n\nisr_common_stub:\n    pusha               ; Push EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP(pre-pusha), EBP, ESI, EDI\n                        ; Each is 4 bytes; total 32 bytes pushed\n\n    ; Save segment registers (push as 32-bit values for alignment)\n    mov eax, gs\n    push eax\n    mov eax, fs\n    push eax\n    mov eax, es\n    push eax\n    mov eax, ds\n    push eax\n\n    ; Load kernel data segment into all data registers\n    ; (In case we were interrupted in user mode with non-kernel selectors)\n    mov eax, 0x10\n    mov ds, eax\n    mov es, eax\n    mov fs, eax\n    mov gs, eax\n\n    ; Call the C exception handler, passing pointer to the frame\n    push esp            ; Argument: pointer to interrupt_frame_t on the stack\n    call exception_handler\n    add esp, 4          ; Pop the argument (cdecl caller cleanup)\n\n    ; Restore segment registers\n    pop eax\n    mov ds, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov es, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov fs, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov gs, eax\n\n    popa                ; Restore EDI, ESI, EBP, (ESP ignored), EBX, EDX, ECX, EAX\n\n    add esp, 8          ; Discard vector number and error code we pushed\n\n    iret                ; Restore EIP, CS, EFLAGS (and ESP, SS if ring-3 transition)\n```\n\n**Critical detail — `pusha` ordering:** `pusha` pushes registers in this exact hardware-defined order (each 4 bytes): `EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP (pre-pusha), EBP, ESI, EDI`. The stack pointer advances 32 bytes downward. `popa` reverses this order and explicitly **ignores the ESP field** (it does not modify ESP from the saved value; ESP advances by 32 bytes during `popa` itself). The `interrupt_frame_t` struct field ordering must match this push sequence in reverse (since the top of the stack is at the lowest address and the struct is accessed via a pointer to the top).\n\n\n![PIC 8259 ICW Initialization State Machine](./diagrams/tdd-diag-12.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.2 IRQ Assembly Stubs\n\nIRQ handlers follow the same save/restore pattern as exception stubs, but they go through `irq_dispatcher` (which sends EOI) rather than `exception_handler` (which halts).\n\n```nasm\n; irq_stubs.asm — hardware IRQ stubs for vectors 32-47\n\n%macro IRQ_STUB 1\n    global irq%1\n    irq%1:\n        push dword 0          ; No error code for hardware IRQs\n        push dword (%1 + 32)  ; Vector number (IRQ0 → 32, IRQ1 → 33, etc.)\n        jmp irq_common_stub\n%endmacro\n\nIRQ_STUB 0   ; IRQ0: Timer  → vector 32\nIRQ_STUB 1   ; IRQ1: KB     → vector 33\nIRQ_STUB 2   ; IRQ2: Cascade→ vector 34\nIRQ_STUB 3   ; IRQ3: COM2   → vector 35\nIRQ_STUB 4   ; IRQ4: COM1   → vector 36\nIRQ_STUB 5   ; IRQ5: LPT2   → vector 37\nIRQ_STUB 6   ; IRQ6: Floppy → vector 38\nIRQ_STUB 7   ; IRQ7: LPT1/Spur→ vector 39\nIRQ_STUB 8   ; IRQ8: RTC    → vector 40\nIRQ_STUB 9   ; IRQ9: Free   → vector 41\nIRQ_STUB 10  ; IRQ10: Free  → vector 42\nIRQ_STUB 11  ; IRQ11: Free  → vector 43\nIRQ_STUB 12  ; IRQ12: Mouse → vector 44\nIRQ_STUB 13  ; IRQ13: FPU   → vector 45\nIRQ_STUB 14  ; IRQ14: ATA   → vector 46\nIRQ_STUB 15  ; IRQ15: ATA/Spur→ vector 47\n```\n\n**`irq_common_stub`:**\n\n```nasm\nirq_common_stub:\n    pusha\n\n    mov eax, gs\n    push eax\n    mov eax, fs\n    push eax\n    mov eax, es\n    push eax\n    mov eax, ds\n    push eax\n\n    mov eax, 0x10\n    mov ds, eax\n    mov es, eax\n    mov fs, eax\n    mov gs, eax\n\n    push esp                ; Argument: pointer to interrupt_frame_t\n    call irq_dispatcher\n    add esp, 4\n\n    pop eax\n    mov ds, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov es, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov fs, eax\n    pop eax\n    mov gs, eax\n\n    popa\n    add esp, 8              ; Discard dummy error code and vector number\n    iret\n```\n\n**`default_isr` — handler for unregistered vectors:**\n\n```nasm\nglobal default_isr\ndefault_isr:\n    push dword 0\n    push dword 0xFF         ; Sentinel vector value (0xFF = \"unknown\")\n    jmp isr_common_stub     ; exception_handler will print \"unknown vector 255\" and halt\n```\n\n\n![ISR/IRQ Stub Assembly: Call Sequence from Hardware to C Handler](./diagrams/tdd-diag-13.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.3 PIC Remapping — ICW Sequence\n\n**Input:** CPU in protected mode, interrupts disabled.\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Save current interrupt masks (IMR) for both PICs\n  uint8_t master_mask = inb(0x21);\n  uint8_t slave_mask  = inb(0xA1);\n\nStep 2: Send ICW1 to both PICs simultaneously\n  outb(0x20, 0x11);  io_wait();   /* Master: init, ICW4 needed */\n  outb(0xA0, 0x11);  io_wait();   /* Slave:  init, ICW4 needed */\n\nStep 3: Send ICW2 — vector offsets\n  outb(0x21, master_offset);  io_wait();   /* Master: IRQ0 → master_offset */\n  outb(0xA1, slave_offset);   io_wait();   /* Slave:  IRQ8 → slave_offset  */\n\nStep 4: Send ICW3 — cascade configuration\n  outb(0x21, 0x04);  io_wait();   /* Master: slave on IRQ2 (bitmask bit2 = 0x04) */\n  outb(0xA1, 0x02);  io_wait();   /* Slave:  cascade identity = 2 (numeric)       */\n\nStep 5: Send ICW4 — 8086 mode\n  outb(0x21, 0x01);  io_wait();\n  outb(0xA1, 0x01);  io_wait();\n\nStep 6: Restore saved masks\n  outb(0x21, master_mask);\n  outb(0xA1, slave_mask);\n```\n\n**Invariant after Step 6:** PIC is fully operational with the new vector mapping. The saved masks are identical to the pre-remap masks — no IRQ line is newly masked or unmasked by the remapping operation.\n\n**Why `io_wait()` between every write:** The 8259 is an ISA-era device. Its internal state machine advances through the ICW sequence by receiving successive writes to the data port, but it requires settling time (typically 1–4µs) between writes. On real hardware, skipping `io_wait()` causes initialization failures on some chipsets. On QEMU, `io_wait()` is a no-op functionally but is retained for portability.\n\n\n![PIT 8254 Channel 0: Divisor Calculation and 100Hz Configuration](./diagrams/tdd-diag-14.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.4 PS/2 Keyboard Handler — Full Algorithm\n\n**Called from:** `irq_dispatcher` with `frame->vector == 33` (IRQ1). Interrupts disabled (interrupt gate). `kb_ring` is the single global circular buffer.\n\n**State (static variables in `keyboard.c`):**\n\n| Variable | Type | Purpose |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| `kb_ring` | `kb_ring_t` | Circular input buffer |\n| `kb_shift_held` | `uint8_t` | Non-zero if either Shift key is currently pressed |\n| `kb_expect_extended` | `uint8_t` | Non-zero if last byte was `0xE0` (extended key prefix) |\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Read scancode from PS/2 data port\n  uint8_t scancode = inb(0x60);\n\nStep 2: Handle extended key prefix (0xE0)\n  if (scancode == 0xE0) {\n      kb_expect_extended = 1;\n      return;   /* Wait for the actual code in the next interrupt */\n  }\n  if (kb_expect_extended) {\n      kb_expect_extended = 0;\n      return;   /* Discard the extended key code entirely (not supported) */\n  }\n\nStep 3: Classify make vs break code\n  int is_break = (scancode & 0x80) != 0;\n  uint8_t make_code = scancode & 0x7F;   /* Strip bit 7 to get make code */\n\nStep 4: Handle modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt detection)\n  if (make_code == 0x2A || make_code == 0x36) {   /* Left or right Shift */\n      kb_shift_held = is_break ? 0 : 1;\n      return;   /* Modifier key: no character to buffer */\n  }\n  if (make_code == 0x1D || make_code == 0x38) {   /* Ctrl or Alt */\n      return;   /* Detected but not tracked beyond make/break */\n  }\n  if (make_code == 0x3A) {   /* Caps Lock */\n      return;   /* Not tracked in this implementation */\n  }\n\nStep 5: Filter break codes for non-modifier keys\n  if (is_break) {\n      return;   /* Key release for non-modifier: discard */\n  }\n\nStep 6: Translate make code to ASCII\n  if (make_code >= 128) return;   /* Out of table range: discard */\n  char c = kb_shift_held\n           ? scancode_ascii_upper[make_code]\n           : scancode_ascii_lower[make_code];\n  if (c == 0) return;   /* Unmapped key (function keys, arrow keys with 0 in table): discard */\n\nStep 7: Write to circular buffer (drop on overflow)\n  uint8_t next_head = kb_ring.head + 1;   /* uint8_t: wraps at 256 automatically */\n  if (next_head == kb_ring.tail) {\n      return;   /* Buffer full: silently discard the character */\n  }\n  kb_ring.buf[kb_ring.head] = c;\n  kb_ring.head = next_head;\n```\n\n**Invariants after each step:**\n- After Step 1: `scancode` holds the raw byte from port `0x60`.\n- After Step 3: `is_break` is 1 iff bit 7 of `scancode` is set. `make_code` is the corresponding make code regardless of break/make.\n- After Step 6: `c` is a valid, printable (or control) ASCII character. `c != 0`.\n- After Step 7: If buffer was not full, `kb_ring.buf[(head - 1) & 0xFF] == c` and `head` has advanced by 1.\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- `scancode == 0x00`: Keyboard controller error (key detection error). `make_code = 0`, `scancode_ascii_lower[0] = 0` → discarded at Step 6.\n- `scancode == 0xFF`: Keyboard error. Same path as above via Step 6.\n- Rapid key repeat (key held down): PS/2 controller automatically re-sends the make code at the keyboard's typematic rate (default ~10 repeats/second). Each repeat fires IRQ1 and goes through the full handler. Since `is_break = 0`, the character is buffered on each repeat. This is correct terminal behavior.\n\n\n![PS/2 Keyboard Scancode Pipeline: Make/Break to ASCII](./diagrams/tdd-diag-15.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.5 Spurious IRQ Handling — IRQ7 and IRQ15\n\nWhen the PIC reports IRQ7 or IRQ15 due to electrical noise (a spurious interrupt), the ISR register bit for that IRQ is NOT set. The handler must check the ISR before deciding whether to act and whether to send EOI.\n\n**Spurious IRQ7 handler logic (installed via `irq_install_handler(7, spurious7_handler)`):**\n\n```c\nstatic void spurious7_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    (void)frame;\n    uint8_t isr = pic_get_isr(0);   /* Read master PIC ISR */\n    if (isr & (1 << 7)) {\n        /* Bit 7 set: genuine IRQ7 (LPT1 or similar). Send EOI normally. */\n        /* irq_dispatcher will send EOI after we return. */\n        return;\n    }\n    /* Bit 7 clear: spurious. Do NOT send EOI to master PIC.\n       Override the EOI that irq_dispatcher would normally send:\n       We set a per-invocation flag that irq_dispatcher checks.\n       Simpler: because irq_dispatcher ALWAYS sends EOI, and for spurious IRQ7\n       we must NOT send master EOI, we need a mechanism.\n\n       Implementation choice: install spurious7_handler to also suppress the EOI.\n       The cleanest approach is to send the EOI from within the handler if genuine,\n       and return a suppress flag to irq_dispatcher. Since irq_handler_t returns void,\n       we use a global suppress flag instead: */\n    pic_suppress_eoi = 1;   /* irq_dispatcher checks this before pic_send_eoi */\n}\n```\n\n**`irq_dispatcher` with EOI suppression:**\n\n```c\n/* Global flag — set by spurious handlers, cleared by irq_dispatcher */\nstatic volatile uint8_t pic_suppress_eoi = 0;\n\nvoid irq_dispatcher(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    uint8_t irq = (uint8_t)(frame->vector - 32);\n    pic_suppress_eoi = 0;\n\n    if (irq_handlers[irq]) {\n        irq_handlers[irq](frame);\n    }\n\n    if (!pic_suppress_eoi) {\n        pic_send_eoi(irq);\n    }\n    /* If pic_suppress_eoi was set: no EOI sent. The spurious handler already\n       decided the IRQ was spurious and suppression is appropriate. */\n}\n```\n\n**Spurious IRQ15 (slave) logic:** Spurious IRQ15 requires an EOI to the **master** (because the master did generate an IRQ2 cascade signal) but NOT to the slave (because the slave's ISR bit is clear). The `spurious15_handler` detects this case and manually sends master EOI while setting `pic_suppress_eoi`:\n\n```c\nstatic void spurious15_handler(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    (void)frame;\n    uint8_t isr = pic_get_isr(1);   /* Read slave PIC ISR */\n    if (isr & (1 << 7)) {\n        return;   /* Genuine IRQ15; irq_dispatcher sends both EOIs normally */\n    }\n    /* Spurious IRQ15: send only master EOI, suppress slave EOI */\n    outb(PIC1_CMD, PIC_EOI);   /* Master EOI only */\n    pic_suppress_eoi = 1;       /* Suppress irq_dispatcher's normal EOI */\n}\n```\n\n**Register both in `idt_setup_all()`:**\n\n```c\nirq_install_handler(7,  spurious7_handler);\nirq_install_handler(15, spurious15_handler);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5.6 Default ISR for Unregistered Vectors\n\nVectors 48–127 and 129–255 point to `default_isr`. When invoked:\n\n```c\n/* exception_handler for vector 0xFF (sentinel): */\n/* The default_isr stub pushes vector=0xFF; exception_handler prints: */\nkprintf(\"\\n=== UNEXPECTED INTERRUPT ===\\n\");\nkprintf(\"Vector: 0x%02x — no handler registered.\\n\", frame->vector);\nkprintf(\"EIP: 0x%08x  CS: 0x%04x\\n\", frame->eip, frame->cs);\nkprintf(\"System halted.\\n\");\nfor (;;) { __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\"); }\n```\n\nThe `default_isr` stub uses vector `0xFF` as the sentinel. When `exception_handler` sees `vector == 0xFF`, it prints the \"unexpected interrupt\" message instead of indexing `exception_names[]` (which only has entries 0–31).\n\n---\n\n### 5.7 `idt_setup_all()` — Complete Initialization Sequence\n\n```c\nvoid idt_setup_all(void) {\n    /* Step 1: Install all 256 entries with default_isr */\n    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {\n        idt_set_gate((uint8_t)i, (uint32_t)default_isr,\n                     0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    }\n\n    /* Step 2: Override vectors 0–31 with exception stubs (trap gates) */\n    idt_set_gate(0,  (uint32_t)isr0,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(1,  (uint32_t)isr1,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(2,  (uint32_t)isr2,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(3,  (uint32_t)isr3,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(4,  (uint32_t)isr4,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(5,  (uint32_t)isr5,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(6,  (uint32_t)isr6,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(7,  (uint32_t)isr7,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(8,  (uint32_t)isr8,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(9,  (uint32_t)isr9,  0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(10, (uint32_t)isr10, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(11, (uint32_t)isr11, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(12, (uint32_t)isr12, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(13, (uint32_t)isr13, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(14, (uint32_t)isr14, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(15, (uint32_t)isr15, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(16, (uint32_t)isr16, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(17, (uint32_t)isr17, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(18, (uint32_t)isr18, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(19, (uint32_t)isr19, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(20, (uint32_t)isr20, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(21, (uint32_t)isr21, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(22, (uint32_t)isr22, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(23, (uint32_t)isr23, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(24, (uint32_t)isr24, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(25, (uint32_t)isr25, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(26, (uint32_t)isr26, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(27, (uint32_t)isr27, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(28, (uint32_t)isr28, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(29, (uint32_t)isr29, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(30, (uint32_t)isr30, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(31, (uint32_t)isr31, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE);\n\n    /* Step 3: Override vectors 32–47 with IRQ stubs (interrupt gates) */\n    idt_set_gate(32, (uint32_t)irq0,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(33, (uint32_t)irq1,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(34, (uint32_t)irq2,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(35, (uint32_t)irq3,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(36, (uint32_t)irq4,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(37, (uint32_t)irq5,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(38, (uint32_t)irq6,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(39, (uint32_t)irq7,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(40, (uint32_t)irq8,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(41, (uint32_t)irq9,  0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(42, (uint32_t)irq10, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(43, (uint32_t)irq11, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(44, (uint32_t)irq12, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(45, (uint32_t)irq13, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(46, (uint32_t)irq14, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n    idt_set_gate(47, (uint32_t)irq15, 0x08, IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE);\n\n    /* Step 4: Install spurious IRQ handlers */\n    irq_install_handler(7,  spurious7_handler);\n    irq_install_handler(15, spurious15_handler);\n\n    /* Step 5: Load IDTR */\n    idt_install();\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling Matrix\n\n| Error | Detected By | Recovery | User-Visible? |\n|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|\n| **Triple fault: PIC not remapped before `sti`** | `pic_remap()` not called; IRQ0 fires at vector 8 (double fault handler = garbage or exception_handler which halts, causing another fault) | No recovery — QEMU reboots. Prevention: always call `pic_remap()` before `sti`. Detected by: `-d int` shows `v=08` (double fault) immediately after timer tick arrives. | QEMU reboot |\n| **Triple fault: IDT not loaded before `sti`** | `idt_install()` not called; IDTR points to BIOS IDT (real-mode IVT at 0x0) | No recovery — triple fault. Prevention: `idt_setup_all()` before `pic_remap()` before `sti`. | QEMU reboot |\n| **Silent hang: EOI not sent** | Verified by observing PIT tick count stops incrementing | No automated recovery. If detected: ensure `irq_dispatcher` calls `pic_send_eoi()` unconditionally. Check `pic_suppress_eoi` flag not stuck at 1. | System appears frozen; `pit_tick_count` static |\n| **Stack misalignment: NOERR/ERR macro applied to wrong exception** | `iret` restores wrong EIP (off by 4 bytes because error code was/wasn't consumed) | Triple fault when `iret` returns to garbage address. Detected by: `-d int` shows unexpected exception vector after the initial exception. | QEMU reboot |\n| **pusha/popa count mismatch in stubs** | Interrupted code resumes with wrong register values; behavior unpredictable | No crash guaranteed; may execute normally with wrong results for many instructions. Detected by: comparing `pusha` count (8 pushes × 4 bytes = 32 bytes) with `popa` placement; verify `add esp, 8` is present after `popa`. | Silent corruption; may never be detected without register inspection |\n| **Segment registers not restored in stubs** | After returning from ring-0 IRQ handler, DS/ES/FS/GS wrong if they were modified inside handler | GPF on first data access with wrong selector. Detected by: immediate GPF after first IRQ returns. | GPF (exception 13) printed and halted |\n| **Keyboard break codes not filtered** | Every key press generates two characters in the buffer | Doubled characters visible in echo demo. Detected by: typing 'A' produces 'AA'. | Doubled key output |\n| **`0xE0` extended key prefix not handled** | Arrow key press: `0xE0` consumed, next byte (e.g., `0x4B` for left arrow) interpreted as a printable key | Spurious characters in buffer when arrow/numpad keys pressed. Detected by: pressing arrow keys inserts unexpected characters. | Wrong characters on arrow keys |\n| **Circular buffer overflow** | Buffer full; new characters silently dropped | Oldest characters preserved; newest discarded. No crash. Detection: fast typing fills buffer; subsequent characters lost until `keyboard_getchar()` drains it. | Silent character loss |\n| **Circular buffer head/tail race** | Single-core only: IRQ handler cannot interrupt `keyboard_getchar()` because IRQ runs with IF=0, and `keyboard_getchar()` runs with IF=1 — the IRQ is the higher-priority context. No race exists on single-core. | N/A — not a race condition on single-core | N/A |\n| **Wrong gate type for exception (interrupt gate instead of trap gate)** | IF is cleared on exception entry; blocking `kprintf` + serial busy-wait would stall if any other IRQ was needed during the wait | Functional issue only: `kprintf` will complete via busy-wait without needing IRQs. Not a crash. | Subtle: no observable difference in this module |\n| **Wrong gate DPL for system call vector** | `IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE` (DPL=0) used for vector 0x80 instead of `IDT_SYSCALL_GATE` (DPL=3) | User `int 0x80` causes GPF (vector 13) immediately; syscall never works | GPF when user process calls `int 0x80` |\n| **`pic_get_isr()` not called for spurious IRQ detection** | Spurious IRQ7: EOI sent to master when no real interrupt occurred; master's priority may be disturbed | Not fatal. Some hardware generates garbage behavior. QEMU: typically harmless but non-compliant. | No visible error; may cause subtle IRQ priority issues |\n| **PIT divisor written in wrong byte order (high before low)** | Timer fires at wrong frequency (approximately 100× off) | No crash; `pit_tick_count` increments at wrong rate. Detected by: measuring wall time vs tick count. | Incorrect timing (all time-based operations wrong) |\n| **PIT command byte wrong mode** | Mode 0 (one-shot) instead of mode 2 (rate generator): timer fires once and stops | No IRQs after first tick; system timer freezes at `pit_tick_count == 1`. | System appears frozen |\n| **`volatile` missing from `pit_tick_count`** | Compiler caches `pit_tick_count` in a register; kernel code polling the variable never sees updates | No crash; polling loops spin forever. Detected by: busy-wait on `pit_tick_count` never exits. | Hangs in any timing loop |\n| **Double fault handler (exception 8) not robust** | Exception handler calls `kprintf`; if `kprintf` triggers another exception (e.g., page fault from bad string pointer) | Nested exception causes third fault → triple fault → reboot | QEMU reboot |\n| **IDTR limit wrong** | `sizeof(idt) - 1` computed incorrectly (e.g., using `sizeof(idt_gate_t)` instead of `sizeof(idt)`) | CPU ignores IDT entries beyond the declared limit; invoking those vectors causes GPF | GPF on any interrupt above the truncated limit |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Implementation Sequence with Checkpoints\n\n### Phase 1 — IDT Data Structures and `lidt` (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `include/idt.h` with `idt_gate_t`, `idtr_t`, the three `IDT_*` constants, and declarations for `idt_set_gate()`, `idt_install()`, `idt_setup_all()`.\n\nCreate `interrupts/idt.c`: declare `static idt_gate_t idt[256]` and `static idtr_t idtr` (both in `.bss`, zeroed by Milestone 1's BSS-zero code). Implement `idt_set_gate()` and `idt_install()`. Add a compile-time assertion:\n\n```c\n_Static_assert(sizeof(idt_gate_t) == 8, \"IDT gate descriptor must be 8 bytes\");\n_Static_assert(sizeof(idtr_t) == 6,     \"IDTR must be 6 bytes\");\n```\n\nDo **not** call `idt_install()` yet. Do **not** implement `idt_setup_all()` yet (it depends on stubs not yet written).\n\n**Checkpoint 1:** Compile `idt.c` with `i686-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdinc -c idt.c -o idt.o`. Should compile with zero warnings and zero errors. Verify struct sizes via the static asserts compiling cleanly. Run `objdump -t idt.o | grep idt` to confirm `idt` symbol is in `.bss` (size 2048 = 256 × 8).\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 — ISR Assembly Stubs, `isr_common_stub` (3–4 hours)\n\nCreate `interrupts/isr_stubs.asm`. Implement both `ISR_NOERR` and `ISR_ERR` macros, instantiate stubs for vectors 0–31, implement `isr_common_stub`, implement `default_isr`.\n\nCreate `include/interrupt.h` with `interrupt_frame_t` and `FRAME_FROM_RING3` macro.\n\nCreate stub `interrupts/interrupt.c` with a minimal `exception_handler()` that just calls `kprintf(\"Exception %d\\n\", frame->vector)` and halts — full implementation comes in Phase 3.\n\nAdd `extern void isr0(void);` through `extern void isr31(void);` and `extern void default_isr(void);` declarations to `idt.h`.\n\n**Verify stack frame layout:** Add a compile-time offset check in `interrupt.c`:\n\n```c\n#include <stddef.h>\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, gs)         ==  0, \"gs offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, ds)         == 12, \"ds offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, edi)        == 16, \"edi offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, eax)        == 44, \"eax offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, vector)     == 48, \"vector offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, error_code) == 52, \"error_code offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, eip)        == 56, \"eip offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, cs)         == 60, \"cs offset wrong\");\n_Static_assert(offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, eflags)     == 64, \"eflags offset wrong\");\n```\n\nImplement minimal `idt_setup_all()` in `idt.c`: just installs all 256 vectors with `default_isr` and the 32 exception vectors with their real stubs, then calls `idt_install()`. Do not add IRQ vectors yet.\n\nCall `idt_setup_all()` from `kmain()` (before the idle loop, with interrupts still disabled). Do not call `sti` yet.\n\n**Checkpoint 2:** Boot the kernel. It should function identically to Milestone 1 (no interrupts, no changes visible). Now add this test to `kmain()`:\n\n```c\n/* Trigger a divide-by-zero to test exception handler */\nvolatile int zero = 0;\nvolatile int x = 1 / zero;  /* Should invoke isr0 → exception_handler */\n(void)x;\n```\n\nExpected result: VGA and serial show `\"Exception 0\"` (or the full diagnostic if you implemented it already) and then the system halts. If QEMU reboots instead, the IDT was not loaded or `isr0` has an assembly error. Use `qemu-system-i386 ... -d int 2>int.log` and verify `v=00 e=0000` appears in the log.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3 — Full Exception Handler (2–3 hours)\n\nComplete `interrupts/interrupt.c` with the full `exception_handler()` implementation: `exception_names[]` table (32 entries, `\"Reserved\"` for gaps), full register dump via `kprintf`, CR2 read for page fault (vector 14), ring-3 detection. Add static array `irq_handlers[16]` and implement `irq_install_handler()` and `irq_dispatcher()` with the `pic_suppress_eoi` mechanism.\n\n**Checkpoint 3:** Test exception 13 (GPF) by attempting to load a null selector:\n\n```c\n/* In kmain, after idt_setup_all() but before sti: */\n__asm__ volatile (\"mov $0, %ax; mov %ax, %ds\");  /* GPF: null descriptor */\n```\n\nExpected output includes:\n```\n=== CPU EXCEPTION ===\nException: General Protection Fault (vector 13)\nError code: 0x00000000\nEIP=0x001XXXXX  CS=0x0008  EFLAGS=...\nEAX=... EBX=... ...\nSystem halted.\n```\n\nRemove the GPF test before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4 — 8259 PIC Remapping (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `include/pic.h` and `interrupts/pic.c`. Implement `pic_remap()`, `pic_send_eoi()`, `pic_get_isr()`, `pic_set_mask()`, `pic_clear_mask()`.\n\n**Do not call `sti` yet.** Add `pic_remap(0x20, 0x28)` to `kmain()` after `idt_setup_all()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 4:** Verify the PIC remapping happened without a triple fault. With `qemu-system-i386 ... -d int 2>int.log`, boot the kernel. The log should not show any interrupt vectors 0–15 firing after the PIC remap. If you temporarily enable `sti` for one instruction then immediately `cli`, you should see `v=20` (IRQ0 at vector 32) appear in the log — not `v=08` (double fault). This confirms the PIC remap succeeded.\n\n```c\n/* Temporary test — remove after verifying */\n__asm__ volatile (\"sti; nop; cli\");\n```\n\nCheck `int.log` for `v=20 e=0000 i=1` (i=1 means IRQ). If you see `v=08`, the remap failed.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5 — IRQ Assembly Stubs and Dispatcher (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `interrupts/irq_stubs.asm`. Implement `IRQ_STUB` macro, instantiate for IRQ0–15, implement `irq_common_stub`.\n\nAdd `extern void irq0(void);` through `extern void irq15(void);` to `irq.h`. Install IRQ vectors 32–47 in `idt_setup_all()`.\n\nAdd `irq_install_handler(7, spurious7_handler)` and `irq_install_handler(15, spurious15_handler)` calls at the bottom of `idt_setup_all()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 5:** Add a test IRQ handler and temporarily enable interrupts:\n\n```c\nstatic void test_handler(interrupt_frame_t *f) {\n    (void)f;\n    kprintf(\"IRQ0 fired!\\n\");\n}\nirq_install_handler(0, test_handler);\n__asm__ volatile (\"sti\");\n/* Spin for a bit — at 100Hz one tick arrives in <10ms */\nfor (volatile int i = 0; i < 10000000; i++);\n__asm__ volatile (\"cli\");\n```\n\nExpected: `\"IRQ0 fired!\"` appears on screen and serial. If it appears more than once during the spin, the timer is firing repeatedly (correct). If the system hangs or reboots, EOI is not being sent — verify `irq_dispatcher` calls `pic_send_eoi(irq)`.\n\nRemove the test handler after verifying.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6 — PIT Channel 0 at 100Hz (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `include/pit.h` and `interrupts/pit.c`. Implement `pit_set_frequency()`, `pit_init()`, `timer_handler()`. Declare `volatile uint64_t pit_tick_count` in `pit.c` (extern declaration in `pit.h`).\n\n**`uint64_t` and 32-bit:** A 64-bit variable on a 32-bit kernel requires two 32-bit registers. Increment via `pit_tick_count++` in C is safe — the compiler generates a 32-bit add with carry propagation. However, a reader that reads the high and low words non-atomically may observe a torn value if an interrupt fires between the two reads. For this module (single counter, no atomic reader needed), this is acceptable. A critical reader should disable interrupts around the 64-bit read.\n\n**Checkpoint 6:** Add to `kmain()` after `pit_init(100)` and `sti`:\n\n```c\nuint64_t t0 = pit_tick_count;\n/* Busy-wait approximately 100ms */\nfor (volatile int i = 0; i < 50000000; i++);\nuint64_t t1 = pit_tick_count;\nkprintf(\"Ticks in ~100ms: %u (expect ~10)\\n\", (uint32_t)(t1 - t0));\n```\n\nExpected output: `\"Ticks in ~100ms: 9\"` to `\"Ticks in ~100ms: 11\"` (within ±1 tick due to busy-wait calibration uncertainty on QEMU). If `0`: `volatile` missing from `pit_tick_count`, timer handler not calling increment, or EOI not sent (timer fires once only). If `>1000`: PIT divisor written in wrong byte order.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 7 — PS/2 Keyboard Driver (3–4 hours)\n\nCreate `include/keyboard.h` and `interrupts/keyboard.c`. Implement the scancode tables, `kb_ring_t` buffer, `keyboard_handler()`, `keyboard_init()`, `keyboard_getchar()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 7:** Add to `kmain()` after `keyboard_init()` and `sti`:\n\n```c\nkprintf(\"Type keys (echo test, ESC to stop):\\n\");\nwhile (1) {\n    char c = keyboard_getchar();\n    if (c) {\n        if (c == 27) break;   /* ESC = scancode 0x01 → ASCII 27 */\n        kprintf(\"%c\", c);\n    }\n}\nkprintf(\"\\nKeyboard test complete.\\n\");\n```\n\nVerify:\n- Typing lowercase letters: correct ASCII appears\n- Typing with Shift held: uppercase letters appear\n- Typing digits with Shift: `!@#$%^&*()` appear\n- Pressing and releasing keys: each key produces exactly one character (not two)\n- Pressing arrow keys: no character appears (extended keys silently ignored)\n- Pressing ESC: loop exits\n- Typing rapidly: no crash; characters may be lost if buffer fills, but no corruption\n\n---\n\n### Phase 8 — Integration and Full kmain Wiring (2–3 hours)\n\nUpdate `kmain()` to the final initialization sequence with correct ordering. Remove all temporary tests from previous phases.\n\n```c\nvoid kmain(void) {\n    /* Milestone 1 (already complete) */\n    serial_init();\n    vga_clear();\n    kprintf(\"=== Build-OS Kernel ===\\n\");\n\n    /* Milestone 2: interrupt infrastructure */\n    idt_setup_all();\n    kprintf(\"[IDT] 256 gates installed, IDTR loaded.\\n\");\n\n    pic_remap(0x20, 0x28);\n    kprintf(\"[PIC] Remapped: IRQ0-7 -> 32-39, IRQ8-15 -> 40-47.\\n\");\n\n    pit_init(100);\n    kprintf(\"[PIT] Timer at 100Hz (divisor=11932).\\n\");\n\n    keyboard_init();\n    kprintf(\"[KBD] PS/2 keyboard driver ready.\\n\");\n\n    __asm__ volatile (\"sti\");\n    kprintf(\"[INT] Interrupts enabled.\\n\");\n\n    /* Echo demo */\n    kprintf(\"Type keys (ESC to enter idle loop):\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        char c = keyboard_getchar();\n        if (c == 27) break;\n        if (c) kprintf(\"%c\", c);\n    }\n\n    kprintf(\"\\nIdle. Tick counter running.\\n\");\n    while (1) {\n        __asm__ volatile (\"hlt\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 8 (final acceptance):** Run:\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nVerify all of the following:\n1. Screen shows IDT/PIC/PIT/KBD initialization messages in order.\n2. `\"Interrupts enabled.\"` appears without a reboot (PIC remap successful).\n3. Key presses echo correctly with correct case.\n4. After pressing ESC, `\"Idle.\"` appears and the system continues running (hlt loop).\n5. Serial terminal shows identical output to VGA.\n6. QEMU does not reboot during the entire session.\n\nRun with `-d int 2>int.log` and verify:\n- No `v=00` through `v=1F` appear after initialization (no spurious exceptions).\n- `v=20` appears approximately every 10ms (100Hz timer).\n- `v=21` appears on each keypress (keyboard IRQ).\n- No `v=08` (double fault) ever appears.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Test Specification\n\n### 8.1 IDT Structure Tests\n\n**T-IDT-1: Gate descriptor byte layout**\n- Setup: Call `idt_set_gate(0x20, 0xDEADBEEF, 0x0008, 0x8E)`.\n- Verify via pointer arithmetic into `idt[0x20]`:\n  - `*((uint16_t*)&idt[0x20] + 0)` = `0xBEEF` (offset_low)\n  - `*((uint16_t*)&idt[0x20] + 1)` = `0x0008` (selector)\n  - `*((uint8_t*)&idt[0x20]  + 4)` = `0x00`   (zero byte)\n  - `*((uint8_t*)&idt[0x20]  + 5)` = `0x8E`   (type_attr)\n  - `*((uint16_t*)&idt[0x20] + 3)` = `0xDEAD` (offset_high)\n- Pass condition: All byte comparisons true.\n\n**T-IDT-2: IDTR loaded correctly**\n- After `idt_install()`: read IDTR via `sidt [buf]`.\n- Verify: `buf.limit == 2047`, `buf.base == (uint32_t)idt`.\n- Implementation: `__asm__ volatile (\"sidt %0\" : \"=m\"(idtr_verify))`.\n\n**T-IDT-3: All 256 entries present**\n- After `idt_setup_all()`: verify no entry has `type_attr == 0` (which would indicate an uninitialized gate without the present bit).\n- Implementation: Loop through `idt[0]` to `idt[255]`; assert `(idt[i].type_attr & 0x80) != 0` for all i.\n\n**T-IDT-4: Exception vectors use trap gates**\n- After `idt_setup_all()`: for vectors 0–31, assert `idt[i].type_attr == IDT_TRAP_GATE (0x8F)`.\n\n**T-IDT-5: IRQ vectors use interrupt gates**\n- After `idt_setup_all()`: for vectors 32–47, assert `idt[i].type_attr == IDT_INTERRUPT_GATE (0x8E)`.\n\n---\n\n### 8.2 Exception Handler Tests\n\n**T-EXC-1: Divide-by-zero handler (vector 0)**\n- Trigger: `volatile int z = 0; volatile int r = 1 / z;`\n- Expected: Screen shows `\"Exception: Divide Error (vector 0)\"` and `\"System halted.\"` — then halts.\n- QEMU: Does NOT reboot (triple fault would cause reboot); system halts at `cli; hlt`.\n- Verify via `-d int`: last vector before halt is `v=00`.\n\n**T-EXC-2: GPF handler (vector 13)**\n- Trigger: `__asm__ volatile (\"mov $0, %%ax; mov %%ax, %%ds\" ::: \"ax\")` — loads null selector into DS.\n- Expected: `\"Exception: General Protection Fault (vector 13)\"`. Error code = 0 (null selector: selector value 0 → error code 0).\n- Verify: EIP printed matches the address of the inline asm instruction (±4 bytes).\n\n**T-EXC-3: Page fault handler (vector 14) — prints CR2**\n- Trigger: `volatile int *p = (int*)0xDEAD0000; volatile int x = *p;` (unmapped address; works once paging is enabled in mod-3; for mod-2 without paging this test is skipped or deferred).\n- Expected: `\"Exception: Page Fault (vector 14)\"`, `\"CR2 (faulting addr): 0xdead0000\"`.\n\n**T-EXC-4: Double fault handler (vector 8) prints and halts — does NOT triple-fault**\n- Trigger: Cannot be directly triggered without a cascaded fault; verify via `qemu -d int` that the handler stub is correctly wired by checking vector 8's IDT entry points to `isr8`.\n- Static verify: `nm kernel.elf | grep isr8` shows the symbol exists at a valid address.\n\n**T-EXC-5: Unknown exception (vector 21) prints diagnostic**\n- Trigger: Software `int 21` (currently installed with default_isr or isr21).\n- Expected: Some diagnostic output and halt, without triple fault.\n\n**T-EXC-6: Register state preserved for non-halting handlers (future integration)**\n- Not applicable in this module (all exception handlers halt). This test applies in mod-4 when exception handlers may return.\n\n---\n\n### 8.3 PIC Tests\n\n**T-PIC-1: No double fault after `sti` (PIC remapped correctly)**\n- Setup: `idt_setup_all()`, `pic_remap(0x20, 0x28)`, then `sti` for 100ms, then `cli`.\n- Expected: No QEMU reboot. Timer fires at vector 32 (not vector 8).\n- Via `-d int`: `v=20` appears; `v=08` does NOT appear.\n\n**T-PIC-2: EOI re-enables IRQ line**\n- Setup: Install a counter handler on IRQ0. Enable interrupts. Wait 500ms.\n- Expected: Counter increments multiple times (>40 ticks in 500ms at 100Hz). If EOI were missing, counter would be ≤ 1.\n\n**T-PIC-3: Master-only EOI for IRQ0–7 (excluding IRQ2)**\n- Setup: Call `pic_send_eoi(5)` (IRQ5, master only).\n- Verify: Only one `outb(0x20, 0x20)` issued; `outb(0xA0, 0x20)` NOT issued.\n- Implementation: Instrument `pic_send_eoi` with a port-write counter or verify via code inspection.\n\n**T-PIC-4: Both EOIs for IRQ8–15**\n- Setup: Call `pic_send_eoi(12)` (IRQ12, mouse, slave).\n- Verify: `outb(0xA0, 0x20)` then `outb(0x20, 0x20)` both issued, in that order.\n\n**T-PIC-5: IMR preserved after remap**\n- Setup: Read master IMR before remap. Call `pic_remap()`. Read master IMR after remap.\n- Expected: Both reads return the same value (masks unchanged by remap).\n\n**T-PIC-6: Spurious IRQ7 does not send EOI**\n- Setup: Install `spurious7_handler`. Manually set `pic_suppress_eoi = 0`. Call `spurious7_handler` directly with a fake frame where master ISR bit 7 is clear (requires `pic_get_isr` to return 0).\n- Expected: After handler returns, `pic_suppress_eoi == 1`. No `outb(0x20, 0x20)` issued by `irq_dispatcher`.\n- Note: This test requires mocking `pic_get_isr()`; acceptable to test via code inspection if mocking is not implemented.\n\n---\n\n### 8.4 PIT Tests\n\n**T-PIT-1: Divisor bytes written in correct order**\n- Setup: Instrument `outb(0x40, ...)` to capture the two writes.\n- Expected: First write = `11932 & 0xFF = 0xDC`. Second write = `(11932 >> 8) & 0xFF = 0x2E`.\n- Via `objdump`: Verify the constant bytes 0xDC and 0x2E appear in the correct order in the compiled `pit_set_frequency` function.\n\n**T-PIT-2: Command byte is 0x36**\n- Setup: Instrument `outb(0x43, ...)`.\n- Expected: Single write with value `0x36`.\n\n**T-PIT-3: `pit_tick_count` increments at 100Hz**\n- Setup: Record `t0 = pit_tick_count`. Busy-wait exactly 100ms. Record `t1`.\n- Expected: `t1 - t0` in range [9, 11].\n- Calibration: On QEMU, a busy-wait loop of 50,000,000 iterations ≈ 100ms on a 2GHz host (adjust empirically via first boot).\n\n**T-PIT-4: `pit_tick_count` declared volatile**\n- Verify: `objdump -d pit.o | grep pit_tick_count` — the counter is accessed via a memory reference, not a register-cached load. Alternatively: compile with `-O2` and verify the increment is still present in the output.\n\n**T-PIT-5: Timer handler registered on IRQ0**\n- After `pit_init(100)`: `irq_handlers[0] == timer_handler` (verify by printing the pointer value and comparing to `nm kernel.elf | grep timer_handler`).\n\n---\n\n### 8.5 Keyboard Driver Tests\n\n**T-KB-1: Lowercase letter translation**\n- Setup: Keyboard handler called with scancode `0x1E` (`'a'` make code).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `'a'` (0x61).\n\n**T-KB-2: Uppercase letter with Shift**\n- Setup: Call handler with `0x2A` (left Shift make), then `0x1E` (`'a'` make).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `'A'` (0x41).\n\n**T-KB-3: Break code filtered (no character)**\n- Setup: Call handler with `0x9E` (break code for `'a'`: `0x1E | 0x80`).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `0` (nothing buffered).\n\n**T-KB-4: Shift released**\n- Setup: Call handler with `0x2A` (Shift make), `0x1E` (`'a'` make), `0xAA` (Shift break), `0x1E` (`'a'` make).\n- Expected: Two `getchar()` calls return `'A'` then `'a'`.\n\n**T-KB-5: Extended prefix ignored**\n- Setup: Call handler with `0xE0`, then `0x48` (numpad 8 / up arrow extended).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `0` (both bytes consumed; no character emitted).\n\n**T-KB-6: Buffer full — oldest preserved, newest dropped**\n- Setup: Call handler 258 times with scancode `0x1E` (`'a'`). (256 characters + 2 overflow attempts).\n- Expected: First 255 `keyboard_getchar()` calls return `'a'`. 256th returns `0` (buffer was full at 255, not 256 — full condition is when `(head+1) == tail`, so max capacity is 255 characters in a 256-byte buffer).\n\n**T-KB-7: Space bar**\n- Setup: Handler called with `0x39` (spacebar make code).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `' '` (0x20).\n\n**T-KB-8: Enter key**\n- Setup: Handler called with `0x1C` (Enter make code).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `'\\n'` (0x0A).\n\n**T-KB-9: Backspace**\n- Setup: Handler called with `0x0E` (Backspace make code).\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `'\\b'` (0x08).\n\n**T-KB-10: Unmapped key (e.g., F1 = `0x3B`)**\n- Setup: Handler called with `0x3B`.\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `0` (F1 has no ASCII mapping: `scancode_ascii_lower[0x3B] == 0`).\n\n**T-KB-11: ESC key**\n- Setup: Handler called with `0x01`.\n- Expected: `keyboard_getchar()` returns `'\\x1B'` (ESC = 27 = 0x1B).\n\n**T-KB-12: Integration echo test**\n- In QEMU: Type `\"Hello, World!\\n\"` with correct Shift usage.\n- Expected: Screen and serial show exactly `\"Hello, World!\"` followed by a newline (the `\\n` from Enter is echoed to VGA which advances the cursor).\n\n---\n\n### 8.6 Stack Frame Tests\n\n**T-FRAME-1: Stack symmetry — pusha count matches popa**\n- Via `objdump -d isr_stubs.o`: Count push instructions from `isr_common_stub` entry to `call exception_handler`. Count pop instructions from after `add esp, 4` to `iret`. The two counts must match (4 segment push/pop pairs + 1 pusha/popa pair + 1 esp argument push + cleanup).\n\n**T-FRAME-2: `add esp, 8` present after popa**\n- Via `objdump -d isr_stubs.o`: Verify `add esp, 0x8` (or `add $0x8,%esp`) appears between `popa` and `iret` in `isr_common_stub`.\n\n**T-FRAME-3: `interrupt_frame_t` offsets match assembly**\n- Compare `offsetof(interrupt_frame_t, vector)` (must be 48) against the stack state when `exception_handler` is called: 4 segment reg pushes (16 bytes) + 8 general-purpose register pushes from pusha (32 bytes) = 48 bytes above the frame pointer. Verified by static assert in §5.1.\n\n**T-FRAME-4: Register preservation across timer IRQ**\n- Setup: Set all general-purpose registers to known values via inline asm. Call `pit_init(100)`, `sti`. Spin for 50ms (several timer ticks fire). `cli`. Read all registers via inline asm.\n- Expected: All registers have their pre-interrupt values. If `pusha`/`popa` are correct, this holds.\n- Implementation: Achievable via a carefully crafted inline asm block that sets registers, executes a measured spin with `sti`/`cli`, then reads registers back.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Performance Targets\n\n| Operation | Target | How to Measure |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|\n| **IDT lookup + handler dispatch** | < 20 cycles (IDT fits in L1 cache: 2048 bytes; well within 32KB L1) | `rdtsc` before triggering a software `int N` and after handler returns; subtract overhead |\n| **Full IRQ round-trip (pusha → handler → popa → iret)** | < 150 cycles for timer handler (no output, just increment + EOI) | `rdtsc` immediately after `iret` via a dedicated measurement process; 100 iterations, average |\n| **Interrupt latency (IRQ assert → first handler instruction)** | < 50 cycles at 2GHz = < 25ns | Measure with hardware (logic analyzer on real hardware); QEMU: use `-d int` timestamp delta |\n| **Timer handler total (increment + EOI)** | < 60 cycles | `rdtsc` in timer_handler at start and end; kprintf overhead excluded (do not kprintf in production timer handler) |\n| **Keyboard handler (inb + table lookup + buffer write)** | < 200 cycles (dominated by 2× I/O port accesses at ~100 cycles each on QEMU) | `rdtsc` around keyboard_handler body; average over 20 keypresses |\n| **`keyboard_getchar()` — buffer read** | < 10 cycles (two integer comparisons + array read + increment) | `rdtsc` around 100 consecutive getchar calls; divide by 100 |\n| **PIC EOI write** | < 10 cycles (single outb to I/O port; fast on QEMU) | `rdtsc` around `pic_send_eoi(0)` |\n| **`pic_remap()` total (8 port writes + 8 io_wait calls)** | < 50µs (8 × io_wait ≈ 8 × ~2µs = 16µs + port write overhead) | `rdtsc` around `pic_remap()`; convert cycles to µs at host clock rate |\n| **`pit_init()` total** | < 10µs (3 port writes, no io_wait) | `rdtsc` around `pit_init(100)` |\n| **IRQ overhead at 100Hz (100 ticks/sec × 150 cycles)** | 0.0075% CPU at 2GHz (15,000 cycles/sec out of 2,000,000,000) | Theoretical calculation; verify: timer handler runs 100× per second at 150 cycles each = 15,000 cycles/sec / 2GHz = 0.00075% |\n| **IDT full population (256 × `idt_set_gate`)** | < 5µs total (256 × ~5 instructions each) | `rdtsc` around `idt_setup_all()`; this is a one-time boot cost |\n\n**QEMU timing note:** QEMU's virtual TSC does not precisely track wall-clock time. For cycle counting, use `rdtsc` and accept that the \"cycles\" are virtual. For timing accuracy (e.g., verifying 100Hz means 10ms/tick), use wall-clock measurement by counting ticks over a known time period (Checkpoint 6).\n\n---\n\n## 10. Hardware Soul Analysis\n\n### IDT Lookup Cache Behavior\n\nThe IDT array is 2048 bytes. A typical L1 data cache is 32KB with 64-byte cache lines. The IDT occupies exactly 32 cache lines. After the first access to any IDT entry, subsequent accesses to nearby entries are L1 hits. Since interrupt handling tends to invoke the same small set of vectors (timer at vector 32, keyboard at vector 33) repeatedly, those entries are perpetually hot in L1 cache. The L1 hit latency for the IDT lookup is 4–5 cycles — negligible compared to the pipeline flush cost of the interrupt itself.\n\nThe IDTR register is a CPU-internal register (not a cache-line in memory); the CPU does not \"cache\" the IDT entries themselves — it re-reads them from memory on each interrupt, but those reads hit L1 cache after the first invocation.\n\n### PIC Port I/O Latency\n\nEvery `inb`/`outb` to PIC ports `0x20`, `0x21`, `0xA0`, `0xA1` crosses the legacy ISA-emulated I/O bus. On real hardware, this costs 1–4µs per access (the I/O bus is slow relative to DRAM). The `io_wait()` call adds another ~1µs. Total cost of `pic_remap()`: 16 writes × ~3µs each = ~48µs — a one-time boot cost, irrelevant at runtime.\n\nAt runtime, `pic_send_eoi()` issues 1–2 `outb` calls. On QEMU, each I/O write is cheaper than real hardware (sub-microsecond), but blocking is still measurable. This is why production kernels with high IRQ rates (> 1M IRQs/sec) use MSI-X (Message Signaled Interrupts eXtended) — a mechanism that writes to a memory address rather than an I/O port, costing a single DRAM write (~60ns) instead of an ISA I/O transaction (~3µs), a 50× speedup.\n\n### `pusha`/`popa` Microarchitecture\n\nOn modern Intel CPUs (Skylake+), `pusha` is not a \"fast string\" operation — it is decoded as a sequence of 8 individual push micro-operations. Each push writes 4 bytes and decrements ESP. Total: 8 micro-ops. On a CPU with 4 execution ports for integer operations, the 8 pushes complete in approximately 2–4 cycles. `popa` is symmetric. The entire `pusha` + 4 segment pushes + `popa` + 4 segment pops costs approximately 30–40 cycles — measurable but small relative to the pipeline flush cost of the interrupt itself (~20–30 cycles for the branch misprediction from the far jump to the handler).\n\n### Circular Buffer Memory Access Pattern\n\n`kb_ring.buf` is a 256-byte array, fitting entirely within 4 cache lines (4 × 64 bytes = 256 bytes). After the first access warms the cache, all subsequent reads and writes are L1 hits. The `head` and `tail` fields follow the buffer in the same struct and are likely in the same or adjacent cache line as the buffer's first bytes. A keyboard interrupt that writes to the buffer and increments `head` therefore requires at most 2 L1 cache accesses — essentially free from a memory latency perspective.\n\n### Branch Predictability in Exception Dispatch\n\n`exception_handler`'s switch on `frame->vector` is compiled as a series of conditional branches or a jump table. For a kernel that almost never triggers exceptions during normal operation, these branches are almost always not-taken — the predictor learns quickly that exceptions are rare events. On the rare invocation (a real fault), the misprediction cost (~15 cycles) is irrelevant because the handler is about to halt the system.\n\nThe keyboard handler's branch on `is_break` is highly predictable: in a typical interactive session, half of all IRQ1 firings are make codes and half are break codes (each key generates exactly one of each). The predictor cannot predict this alternating pattern better than 50% accuracy — a 50% misprediction rate at 15 cycles each = ~7.5 cycles average branch cost per keyboard event. Completely negligible at human typing speeds (<20 characters/second).\n\n\n![Module Architecture: IDT, PIC, PIT, Keyboard, and IRQ Dispatch](./diagrams/tdd-diag-16.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Concurrency Specification\n\n**Model:** Single core. No threads. No SMP. The concurrency model is interrupt preemption only — IRQ handlers are the only entities that can preempt kernel code.\n\n**Critical section: `irq_handlers[]` array modification**\n- Writer: `irq_install_handler()` (called from kernel initialization code).\n- Readers: `irq_dispatcher()` (called from IRQ handler with IF=0).\n- Guarantee: All `irq_install_handler()` calls are made before `sti`. After `sti`, `irq_handlers[]` is read-only from the kernel's perspective. No lock needed.\n- If `irq_install_handler()` must be called after `sti` (not in this module): caller must execute `cli` around the write and `sti` afterward.\n\n**Critical section: `kb_ring` circular buffer**\n- Writer: `keyboard_handler()` — runs with IF=0 (interrupt gate). Cannot be interrupted.\n- Reader: `keyboard_getchar()` — runs with IF=1 (normal kernel code). Can be interrupted by timer or keyboard IRQ.\n- Race condition analysis: `keyboard_getchar()` reads `kb_ring.head` and `kb_ring.tail`. The writer advances `kb_ring.head`. On a single-core CPU:\n  - If a keyboard IRQ fires while `keyboard_getchar()` is between reading `head` and reading `tail`: the IRQ handler runs to completion (modifying `head`), then `keyboard_getchar()` resumes with the old `head` value. This is a transient stale read that causes one character to be missed for one `getchar()` call — not a corruption, and extremely unlikely given keyboard timing.\n  - Practically: single-byte reads and writes to `uint8_t` fields are atomic on x86 (aligned byte access). The only race would be if `keyboard_getchar()` read `head` and `tail` from different memory accesses that an IRQ interrupts in between. Since `head` and `tail` are separate bytes, this is a benign race: at worst `getchar()` returns `0` (empty) when one character exists, which it will read on the next call.\n- Decision: No lock needed for this single-core, single-writer, single-reader design.\n\n**Critical section: `pit_tick_count` increment**\n- Writer: `timer_handler()` — with IF=0.\n- Reader: Any kernel code that polls the counter — with IF=1.\n- `volatile uint64_t` ensures the compiler does not cache the value. On a 32-bit CPU, a 64-bit increment is not atomic (two 32-bit operations). A reader that reads both halves with IF=1 could read the low half after increment and the high half before carry propagation — a torn read. Maximum error: 1 tick (approximately 10ms). For this module's use cases (coarse timing), this is acceptable.\n- If atomic 64-bit reads are required: disable interrupts around the read with `cli`/`sti`.\n\n**`pic_suppress_eoi` flag:**\n- Set by spurious handlers; read by `irq_dispatcher`; both run with IF=0. No race.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Synced Criteria\n\n\n<!-- TDD_MOD_ID: mod-3 -->\n# Technical Design Specification: Physical and Virtual Memory Management\n\n**Module ID:** `mod-3` | **Milestone:** `build-os-m3` | **Estimated Hours:** 23–34\n\n---\n\n## 1. Module Charter\n\nThis module implements the complete memory subsystem for a 32-bit x86 kernel: it parses the multiboot-provided E820 memory map to enumerate physical RAM regions, manages physical 4KB frames via a 128KB bitmap allocator, constructs two-level x86 page tables (one page directory, two static page tables for identity and higher-half mapping), enables paging by loading CR3 and setting CR0.PG, enforces TLB coherence via `invlpg` and CR3 reload, handles page faults by decoding CR2 and the error code, and provides a variable-size kernel heap allocator (`kmalloc`/`kfree`) backed by on-demand physical frame allocation and virtual address mapping.\n\nThis module does **not** implement per-process page directories, demand paging, copy-on-write, swap, memory-mapped files, user-space `malloc`, SLUB or slab caching, multi-core TLB shootdowns, huge pages (4MB PSE), or any memory-protection features beyond the existing U/S and R/W page table flags. The TSS is configured in mod-4; this module does not touch it. ACPI table parsing beyond E820 type classification is out of scope.\n\n**Upstream dependencies:** Module `mod-1` (protected mode, VGA, serial, `kprintf`, linker symbols `__kernel_start_phys`/`__kernel_end_phys`, `__bss_start`/`__bss_end`); module `mod-2` (IDT with exception handler at vector 14 installable, `sti` already called — paging enablement must not break interrupt delivery).\n\n**Downstream dependencies:** Module `mod-4` (process management) calls `pmm_alloc_frame()` to allocate per-process page directories and kernel stacks, calls `vmm_map_page()` to map user-mode code and stack frames, and reads `boot_page_directory` to copy kernel PDE entries into per-process directories. The heap (`kmalloc`/`kfree`) is used by all subsequent kernel subsystems.\n\n**Invariants that must hold at module exit:**\n1. `frame_bitmap` correctly reflects physical RAM state: every usable, non-kernel, non-page-table frame has its bit clear (free); every kernel, page-table, reserved, and frame-below-1MB frame has its bit set (used).\n2. `CR3` holds the physical address of `boot_page_directory`. `CR0.PG = 1`. Paging is active.\n3. Virtual `0x00000000`–`0x003FFFFF` maps to physical `0x00000000`–`0x003FFFFF` (identity, covers VGA at `0xB8000` and kernel at `0x100000`).\n4. Virtual `0xC0000000`–`0xC03FFFFF` maps to physical `0x00000000`–`0x003FFFFF` (higher-half kernel).\n5. All page table structures (`boot_page_directory`, `identity_page_table`, `kernel_page_table`) are themselves marked used in `frame_bitmap`.\n6. `invlpg` or CR3 reload is called immediately after every PTE or PDE modification; no stale TLB entry persists beyond the modifying function's return.\n7. `kmalloc(n)` returns an 8-byte-aligned pointer to at least `n` usable bytes, or `NULL` only when physical frames are exhausted. `kfree(p)` returns the block to the free list and coalesces adjacent free blocks. A double-free on the same pointer is detected via the magic canary and reported via `kprintf` without crashing.\n\n---\n\n## 2. File Structure\n\nCreate files in this exact sequence.

All three `.c` files are independent of each other except for the call dependencies just described.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Complete Data Model\n\n### 3.1 `multiboot_info_t` and `mmap_entry_t` — Wire Format\n\nThe multiboot specification defines these structures. They arrive from GRUB via a pointer in `EBX` at kernel entry time. The pointer must be saved before BSS zeroing in `entry.asm` (or passed as argument to `kmain`).\n\n```c\n/* include/multiboot.h */\n#ifndef MULTIBOOT_H\n#define MULTIBOOT_H\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n/* Flags bits in multiboot_info_t.flags */\n#define MB_FLAG_MEM       (1 << 0)   /* mem_lower / mem_upper valid    */\n#define MB_FLAG_MMAP      (1 << 6)   /* mmap_addr / mmap_length valid  */\n\ntypedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {\n    uint32_t flags;         /* Offset  0: which fields below are valid */\n    uint32_t mem_lower;     /* Offset  4: KB below 1MB (typically 640) */\n    uint32_t mem_upper;     /* Offset  8: KB above 1MB                 */\n    uint32_t boot_device;   /* Offset 12: BIOS boot device             */\n    uint32_t cmdline;       /* Offset 16: physical addr of cmdline str  */\n    uint32_t mods_count;    /* Offset 20: boot modules count            */\n    uint32_t mods_addr;     /* Offset 24: physical addr of modules list */\n    uint32_t syms[4];       /* Offset 28: symbol table info (a.out/ELF) */\n    uint32_t mmap_length;   /* Offset 44: byte length of mmap buffer    */\n    uint32_t mmap_addr;     /* Offset 48: physical addr of mmap buffer  */\n    /* Many more fields exist (drives, config table, etc.) — omitted */\n} multiboot_info_t;         /* We only access offsets 0–51 */\n\n/* Each entry in the memory map buffer.\n   NOTE: entries are variable-length.

The parser then marks usable regions as free. This means any bug in the parser that misses a region results in that region being treated as reserved — preventing allocation, not corruption. The alternative (\"0 = used\") would cause uninitialized bitmap regions to appear free.\n\n**Bitmap struct fields:**\n\n```c\n/* pmm.c (static, not exposed in header) */\nstatic uint32_t frame_bitmap[BITMAP_WORDS];   /* 128KB in .bss; BSS-zeroed by entry.asm, then overwritten by pmm_init */\nstatic uint32_t pmm_total_frames = 0;         /* Total usable frames discovered in E820 */\nstatic uint32_t pmm_used_frames  = 0;         /* Current count of used frames           */\nstatic uint32_t pmm_search_hint  = 1;         /* Next-fit scan start position (frame 0 never allocated) */\n```\n\n**Cache line analysis:** `frame_bitmap` is a 128KB array of `uint32_t`. One 64-byte cache line holds 16 `uint32_t` words = 16 × 32 = 512 bits = 512 frames = 2MB of physical memory represented per cache line. Sequential allocation scans this array with hardware prefetch assistance. After the first full scan warms the L2 cache (128KB fits in any L2 ≥ 256KB), subsequent allocations hit L2 at ~5ns per cache line. The `search_hint` avoids rescanning already-allocated regions, keeping the common-case access to one or two cache lines.\n\n\n![Bitmap Physical Frame Allocator: Data Structure Layout and Bit Operations](./diagrams/tdd-diag-19.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 x86 Page Directory Entry and Page Table Entry — Bit Layout\n\nBoth PDEs and PTEs are `uint32_t`.

Without the alignment attribute, the linker places these arrays at their natural alignment (4 bytes), which is insufficient. The GCC `aligned` attribute guarantees placement at a 4KB boundary within the `.bss` section. The linker script must specify `.bss` section alignment ≥ `PAGE_SIZE`; add `.bss : ALIGN(4096) { ... }` if not already present.\n\n**Two-level address translation diagram:**\n\n```\nVirtual Address: 0xC0101234\n  ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┐\n  │  Dir [31:22] │  Tbl [21:12] │  Off [11:0]    │\n  │  0x300 = 768 │  0x101 = 257 │  0x234 = 564   │\n  └──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────┘\n         │                │                │\n         ▼                │                │\n  boot_page_directory[768] ──► physical addr of kernel_page_table\n                           │\n                           ▼\n                  kernel_page_table[257] ──► physical frame addr\n                                                      │\n                                                      ▼\n                                            physical frame + 0x234\n                                            = 0x00101234 (physical)\n```\n\n{{DIAGRAM:tdd-diag-20}}\n\n---\n\n### 3.5 `heap_block_t` — Kernel Heap Allocator Header\n\nEach allocation is preceded by a `heap_block_t` header.

Interface Contracts\n\n### 4.1 `pmm_parse_memory_map(multiboot_info_t *mbi) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** `mbi` is a valid pointer to the multiboot information structure, accessible at its physical address (identity map not yet required; this function is called before paging). `mbi->flags & MB_FLAG_MMAP` is nonzero (GRUB always sets this for a kernel with memory requirements).\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Verify `mbi->flags & MB_FLAG_MMAP`; if zero: `kprintf(\"[PMM] FATAL: No memory map from bootloader.\\n\"); for(;;);`.\n2. Cast `mbi->mmap_addr` to `mmap_entry_t *` (physical address, valid pre-paging).\n3. Iterate entries using `next = (mmap_entry_t*)((uint8_t*)entry + entry->size + 4)` until past `mbi->mmap_addr + mbi->mmap_length`.\n4. For each entry: print a line via `kprintf` showing base address (64-bit, printed as two 32-bit halves), end address, and type string.\n5. Count and sum total bytes in `E820_USABLE` entries; print summary.\n\n**Post-conditions:** Memory map printed to VGA and serial. No state modified (this is diagnostic only; `pmm_init()` does the actual initialization).\n\n**Errors:**\n- `MB_FLAG_MMAP` not set: fatal halt.\n- Entry with `addr > 0xFFFFFFFF` (above 32-bit range): silently skip — the physical frame allocator only manages up to 4GB.\n- Entry where `addr + len > 0xFFFFFFFF`: clamp `len` to `0xFFFFFFFF - addr + 1`.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 `pmm_init(multiboot_info_t *mbi) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Same as `pmm_parse_memory_map`. BSS has been zeroed (so `frame_bitmap` is all-zero). `kprintf` is functional.\n\n**Behavior (in exact order):**\n1. `memset(frame_bitmap, 0xFF, sizeof(frame_bitmap))` — mark all frames used.\n2. Set `pmm_used_frames = FRAME_COUNT; pmm_total_frames = 0;`.\n3. Iterate E820 map identically to `pmm_parse_memory_map`; for each `E820_USABLE` entry: call `pmm_mark_free(entry->addr, entry->len)`.\n4. Re-mark as used: call `pmm_mark_used(0, 0x100000)` — the first 1MB (real-mode IVT, BIOS data area, VGA, BIOS ROM). Physical frame 0 is never allocated; this guarantees NULL-pointer dereferences produce a page fault rather than reading physical RAM.\n5. Re-mark as used: the kernel binary. Requires linker symbols:\n   ```c\n   extern uint8_t __kernel_start_phys[];   /* Start of kernel in physical memory */\n   extern uint8_t __kernel_end_phys[];     /* End of kernel in physical memory   */\n   uint32_t k_start = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)__kernel_start_phys;\n   uint32_t k_end   = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)__kernel_end_phys;\n   pmm_mark_used(k_start, k_end - k_start);\n   ```\n   If linker symbols are not defined: use the conservative range `pmm_mark_used(0x100000, 0x400000)` (mark first 4MB used; this over-reserves but prevents accidental frame allocation).\n6. Re-mark as used: the `frame_bitmap` array itself.\n   ```c\n   pmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)frame_bitmap, sizeof(frame_bitmap));\n   ```\n   If `frame_bitmap` lives in `.bss` within the kernel range already marked in step 5, this is a no-op. If the bitmap is large enough to extend beyond the kernel's end, this step is essential.\n7. Re-mark as used: the three static page tables (`boot_page_directory`, `identity_page_table`, `kernel_page_table`). These are declared in `vmm.c`; their physical addresses must be passed to `pmm_init` or `pmm_mark_used` must be called from `vmm_init()` after `pmm_init()` returns.\n   - Implementation choice: `vmm_init()` calls `pmm_mark_used()` for its static page tables after `pmm_init()` returns. This avoids a circular dependency.\n8. Set `pmm_search_hint = ADDR_TO_FRAME(0x100000)` — start scanning above the first 1MB.\n9. Print `\"[PMM] Init: %u free frames, %u total frames (%u MB free)\\n\"`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `frame_bitmap` correctly marks kernel, bitmap, reserved, and low-memory frames as used. Usable frames above reserved regions are marked free. `pmm_alloc_frame()` is operational.\n\n**Errors:** Out-of-memory (no usable E820 region found): `kprintf(\"[PMM] FATAL: No usable memory!\\n\"); for(;;);`.\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 `pmm_mark_used(uint64_t addr, uint64_t length) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** For each 4KB-aligned frame in `[addr, addr+length)`:\n- Skip frames ≥ `FRAME_COUNT` (above 4GB).\n- If bit not already set: set it, increment `pmm_used_frames`, decrement `pmm_total_frames` (only if this frame was previously counted as free/total — careful bookkeeping required; see §5.1).\n\n**Alignment:** Align `addr` down to page boundary; extend `length` to cover the partial page. Equivalently: `frame_start = addr >> PAGE_SHIFT; frame_end = (addr + length + PAGE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT`.\n\n**Edge cases:**\n- `length == 0`: no-op.\n- `addr + length` overflows 64-bit: clamp to `0xFFFFFFFF`.\n- Marking an already-used frame: no-op (no double-increment of `pmm_used_frames`).\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 `pmm_mark_free(uint64_t addr, uint64_t length) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** For each 4KB-aligned frame in `[addr, addr+length)`:\n- Skip frame 0 (physical address 0 must never be allocatable — preserves NULL-pointer fault semantics).\n- Skip frames ≥ `FRAME_COUNT`.\n- Align both `addr` up (to avoid freeing a partial page at the start) and `addr+length` down (to avoid freeing a partial page at the end). Use: `base = PAGE_ALIGN_UP(addr); end = PAGE_ALIGN_DOWN(addr + length);`.\n- For each frame in `[base, end)`: if bit is set, clear it, increment `pmm_total_frames`, decrement `pmm_used_frames`.\n\n**Rationale for aligning up at start and down at end:** A partial page at the start might overlap with an in-use region; including it is dangerous. Aligning up is conservative. Same for the partial page at the end.\n\n---\n\n### 4.5 `pmm_alloc_frame(void) → void *`\n\n**Returns:** Physical address of a free 4KB frame, aligned to `PAGE_SIZE`. Returns `NULL` if no free frames remain.\n\n**Behavior:** See §5.1 (full next-fit algorithm).\n\n**Post-conditions:** The returned frame's bit is set in `frame_bitmap`. `pmm_used_frames` incremented by 1. The returned address is 4KB-aligned and nonzero. Calling `pmm_alloc_frame()` twice returns two different addresses.\n\n**Errors:** Returns `NULL` on out-of-memory. Callers that receive `NULL` must propagate the failure — typically halting with a fatal message.\n\n---\n\n### 4.6 `pmm_free_frame(void *addr) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `addr`: Physical address previously returned by `pmm_alloc_frame()`. Must be 4KB-aligned.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Compute `frame = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)addr >> PAGE_SHIFT`.\n2. Validate range: if `frame == 0 || frame >= FRAME_COUNT`: `kprintf(\"[PMM] WARNING: pmm_free_frame(0x%x) out of range\\n\", addr); return;`.\n3. Double-free detection: if `!bitmap_test(frame)`: `kprintf(\"[PMM] BUG: Double-free at frame %u (phys 0x%x)!\\n\", frame, addr); return;`.\n4. `bitmap_clear(frame); pmm_used_frames--;`.\n5. If `frame < pmm_search_hint`: `pmm_search_hint = frame` — update hint to enable earlier allocation next scan.\n\n**Errors:** Out-of-range or double-free: `kprintf` warning, then return without modifying state. No crash. Caller may continue after a free error (though the system is likely in an inconsistent state).\n\n---\n\n### 4.7 `vmm_init(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** `pmm_init()` has returned. BSS zeroed (so `boot_page_directory`, `identity_page_table`, `kernel_page_table` are all zero). Paging is NOT yet enabled.\n\n**Behavior (in exact order):**\n\n**Identity page table construction (PD index 0, virtual `0x0`–`0x3FFFFF`):**\n```c\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {\n    identity_page_table[i] = MAKE_PTE(i * PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n}\n```\nFrame 0 is mapped here (virtual `0x0` → physical `0x0`) to preserve the identity property. The page fault handler will catch any access to virtual `0x0` that should be a null pointer dereference only after paging is on and the kernel verifies that frame 0 is indeed an invalid access target (not mapped for user code; kernel should not access `0x0`).\n\n**Higher-half kernel page table construction (PD index 768, virtual `0xC0000000`–`0xC03FFFFF`):**\n```c\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {\n    kernel_page_table[i] = MAKE_PTE(i * PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n}\n```\nMaps the same physical frames `0x0`–`0x3FFFFF` at virtual `0xC0000000`–`0xC03FFFFF`.\n\n**Page directory construction:**\n```c\n/* Zero the entire page directory (should already be zero from BSS, but explicit for clarity) */\nmemset(boot_page_directory, 0, sizeof(boot_page_directory));\n\n/* PD index 0: identity map */\nboot_page_directory[0] = MAKE_PDE(\n    (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)identity_page_table,\n    PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n);\n\n/* PD index 768 (0xC0000000 >> 22 = 768): higher-half kernel */\nboot_page_directory[768] = MAKE_PDE(\n    (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)kernel_page_table,\n    PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n);\n/* All other PD entries remain 0 (not present) */\n```\n\n**Mark page table frames used in PMM:**\n```c\npmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory, PAGE_SIZE);\npmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)identity_page_table,  PAGE_SIZE);\npmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)kernel_page_table,    PAGE_SIZE);\n```\n\n**Post-conditions:** Page directory and both page tables are fully populated. Three frames marked used in PMM. Paging is still disabled — nothing has touched CR3 or CR0.\n\n**Errors:** None — all data structures are statically allocated and pre-validated by the linker.\n\n---\n\n### 4.8 `vmm_enable_paging(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** `vmm_init()` has returned. `pmm_init()` has returned. The identity page table maps the currently executing code (code at physical `0x100000` is mapped at virtual `0x100000` via identity map entry 256).\n\n**Behavior (assembly-level, three instructions in precise order):**\n\n```c\nvoid vmm_enable_paging(void) {\n    /* Step 1: Load CR3 with PHYSICAL address of boot_page_directory.\n       Pre-paging: physical == virtual for this address (identity map not yet on,\n       but the address is correct because we have not moved). */\n    uint32_t pd_phys = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %0, %%cr3\" : : \"r\"(pd_phys) : \"memory\");\n\n    /* Step 2: Set CR0.PG (bit 31) and CR0.WP (bit 16).\n       WP = Write Protect: prevents kernel (ring 0) from writing to read-only user pages.\n       Setting WP enables future copy-on-write protection.\n       PAGING IS ENABLED AFTER THIS WRITE. The next instruction fetch goes through\n       page tables. The identity map ensures this succeeds. */\n    uint32_t cr0;\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr0, %0\" : \"=r\"(cr0));\n    cr0 |= (1u << 31);   /* CR0.PG */\n    cr0 |= (1u << 16);   /* CR0.WP */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"mov %0, %%cr0\" : : \"r\"(cr0) : \"memory\");\n\n    /* Step 3: Serialize — ensure pipeline sees paging mode.\n       On x86, writing CR0 is a serializing operation (all prior instructions\n       complete; instruction cache is flushed). No explicit jmp needed on\n       identity-mapped code, but a jmp or cpuid may be added for strictness. */\n\n    kprintf(\"[VMM] Paging enabled. CR3=0x%08x CR0.PG=1\\n\", pd_phys);\n}\n```\n\n**Why CR3 before CR0.PG:** CR3 must contain a valid page directory before the paging enable bit is set. Setting CR0.PG with CR3=0 would cause the CPU to attempt a page table walk from physical address 0, which is the real-mode IVT — not a valid page directory. The immediate page fault from the bad walk, followed by the page fault handler's own bad walk, would produce a triple fault.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `CR0.PG = 1`. `CR3` = physical address of `boot_page_directory`. All subsequent memory accesses go through the two-level page table. The identity map makes this transparent for addresses ≤ `0x3FFFFF`. VGA at physical `0xB8000` is accessible at virtual `0xB8000` (within the identity-mapped first 4MB).\n\n**Errors:** If `boot_page_directory` is not 4KB-aligned (miscompiled kernel or wrong linker script): CR3 will have garbage in its low 12 bits. The CPU ignores the low 12 bits of CR3 (it masks them to zero for page directory lookup), so this is silently tolerated on x86 — but it is a latent bug. Assert alignment with a compile-time check: `_Static_assert(alignof(boot_page_directory) >= PAGE_SIZE, ...)` — not possible for static arrays; instead, verify in `vmm_init()` at runtime:\n```c\nif ((uint32_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory & (PAGE_SIZE - 1)) {\n    kprintf(\"[VMM] FATAL: boot_page_directory not 4KB aligned!\\n\");\n    for(;;);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.9 `vmm_map_page(pde_t *page_directory, uint32_t virt_addr, uint32_t phys_addr, uint32_t flags) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Paging is enabled. `page_directory` is accessible at its virtual address (either via identity map or recursive mapping — in this module, always via identity map since `boot_page_directory` is in the identity-mapped region).\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `page_directory`: Pointer to the page directory (1024 `pde_t` entries). Must be 4KB-aligned. For all kernel operations in this module: pass `boot_page_directory`.\n- `virt_addr`: Virtual address to map. Must be 4KB-aligned. If not aligned: align down silently (`virt_addr &= ~(PAGE_SIZE - 1)`).\n- `phys_addr`: Physical frame address. Must be 4KB-aligned. If not aligned: align down silently.\n- `flags`: Combination of `PAGE_*` constants. Must include `PAGE_PRESENT`. The `PAGE_PRESENT` bit is OR'd in unconditionally even if the caller omits it.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Compute `dir_idx = VA_DIR_IDX(virt_addr)`, `tbl_idx = VA_TBL_IDX(virt_addr)`.\n2. If `page_directory[dir_idx]` has `PAGE_PRESENT` clear: allocate a new page table frame via `pmm_alloc_frame()`. If `pmm_alloc_frame()` returns `NULL`: `kprintf(\"[VMM] FATAL: vmm_map_page OOM\\n\"); for(;;);`. Zero the new frame (it is physical RAM; must be zeroed before use as a page table). Install the new frame as `page_directory[dir_idx] = MAKE_PDE(new_frame, PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE | (flags & PAGE_USER))`. Flush TLB for the page directory entry: `tlb_flush_page((uint32_t)&page_directory[dir_idx])` — strictly, PDE entries are not in the TLB directly; flushing the virtual address covered by the new PDE is sufficient.\n3. Extract the page table physical address: `pte_t *page_table = (pte_t *)PDE_FRAME(page_directory[dir_idx])`. **Note:** this uses the physical address as a virtual address — valid only while the identity map is active or while a recursive mapping exists. For this module: identity map is always active for addresses below `0x400000`, and all dynamically allocated page tables are in frames above `0x100000` but below `0x400000` (the identity-mapped region), so this dereference is valid.\n4. `page_table[tbl_idx] = MAKE_PTE(phys_addr, flags | PAGE_PRESENT)`.\n5. `tlb_flush_page(virt_addr)` — invalidate the TLB entry for this virtual page.\n\n**Post-conditions:** Virtual `virt_addr` translates to physical `phys_addr` with the specified flags. Any access to `virt_addr` through any valid page succeeds (or faults as specified by flags).\n\n**Errors:** OOM on page table allocation: fatal halt (cannot continue without page tables).\n\n---\n\n### 4.10 `vmm_unmap_page(pde_t *page_directory, uint32_t virt_addr) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `page_directory`: Same as `vmm_map_page`.\n- `virt_addr`: Virtual address to unmap. Aligned down if not 4KB-aligned.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Compute `dir_idx`, `tbl_idx` from `virt_addr`.\n2. If `page_directory[dir_idx]` is not present: return (already unmapped; no-op).\n3. Extract page table pointer (same identity-map assumption as `vmm_map_page`).\n4. `page_table[tbl_idx] = 0` — clear the entire PTE (all flags cleared, including PRESENT).\n5. `tlb_flush_page(virt_addr)` — **MANDATORY**. If omitted, the old translation remains in TLB and future accesses use the stale (now-freed) physical frame.\n\n**Post-conditions:** Virtual `virt_addr` is not mapped. Next access causes page fault (vector 14, error code with P=0).\n\n**Errors:** Unmapping an already-unmapped page: no-op (idempotent).\n\n---\n\n### 4.11 `tlb_flush_page(uint32_t virt_addr) → void` (inline)\n\n```c\n/* include/vmm.h */\nstatic inline void tlb_flush_page(uint32_t virt_addr) {\n    /* invlpg: Invalidate TLB entry for the page containing virt_addr.\n       Operand is a memory address (register-indirect operand required). */\n    __asm__ volatile (\"invlpg (%0)\" : : \"r\"(virt_addr) : \"memory\");\n}\n```\n\n**Cost:** ~20 cycles on modern Intel CPUs. Does not flush global (PAGE_GLOBAL) entries.\n\n---\n\n### 4.12 `tlb_flush_all(void) → void` (inline)\n\n```c\nstatic inline void tlb_flush_all(void) {\n    /* Writing CR3 with its current value flushes all non-global TLB entries. */\n    uint32_t cr3;\n    __asm__ volatile (\n        \"mov %%cr3, %0\\n\\t\"\n        \"mov %0, %%cr3\"\n        : \"=r\"(cr3) : : \"memory\"\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**Cost:** ~30 cycles for the reload plus subsequent cold TLB misses. Use when multiple PTEs have been modified (heap expansion that maps many pages at once) to avoid calling `invlpg` N times.\n\n---\n\n### 4.13 Page Fault Handler — Integration with mod-2 IDT\n\nThe page fault handler in this module replaces the `default_isr` at vector 14 installed by `idt_setup_all()` in mod-2. It is registered via `idt_set_gate(14, (uint32_t)isr14, 0x08, IDT_TRAP_GATE)` — already done by `idt_setup_all()`. The C function `exception_handler()` in `interrupt.c` dispatches to the page fault logic when `frame->vector == 14`. This module does not require changes to the assembly stubs; only the C handler behavior needs to be specified.\n\nSee §5.3 for the full page fault handling algorithm. The relevant changes in `interrupt.c` for mod-3: replace the `frame->vector == 14` comment stub from mod-2 with the full CR2-read + decode + print behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 4.14 `heap_init(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Paging is enabled. `vmm_map_page()` is operational. `pmm_alloc_frame()` is operational.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Set `heap_start = HEAP_START; heap_end = HEAP_START;`.\n2. Call `heap_expand()` — maps the first physical frame to `HEAP_START`, advances `heap_end` to `HEAP_START + PAGE_SIZE`.\n3. Initialize the first `heap_block_t` at virtual address `HEAP_START`:\n   ```c\n   heap_block_t *first = (heap_block_t *)(uintptr_t)HEAP_START;\n   first->magic = HEAP_MAGIC;\n   first->size  = PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(heap_block_t);\n   first->free  = 1;\n   first->next  = NULL;\n   first->prev  = NULL;\n   heap_head = first;\n   ```\n4. `kprintf(\"[HEAP] Initialized at 0x%x, first page mapped, %u bytes usable.\\n\", HEAP_START, first->size)`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `heap_head` points to a single free block of `PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(heap_block_t)` bytes. `heap_end = HEAP_START + PAGE_SIZE`. One physical frame used for heap.\n\n---\n\n### 4.15 `kmalloc(size_t size) → void *`\n\n**Returns:** Pointer to at least `size` bytes of kernel memory, 8-byte aligned. Returns `NULL` only if physical frames are exhausted.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `size`: Requested allocation size in bytes. `size == 0`: returns `NULL` immediately (not a valid allocation).\n\n**Full behavior:** See §5.4.\n\n**Errors:** OOM (all physical frames exhausted and heap has reached `HEAP_MAX`): returns `NULL`. Callers must check for `NULL`.\n\n---\n\n### 4.16 `kfree(void *ptr) → void`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `ptr`: Pointer previously returned by `kmalloc()`. `ptr == NULL`: returns immediately (no-op).\n\n**Behavior:** See §5.5.\n\n**Errors:**\n- `ptr == NULL`: no-op.\n- Corrupted magic (`block->magic != HEAP_MAGIC`): `kprintf(\"[HEAP] BUG: kfree(0x%x) bad magic (got 0x%x)!\\n\", ptr, block->magic); return;` — does not crash.\n- Double-free (block already free): `kprintf(\"[HEAP] BUG: Double-free at 0x%x!\\n\", ptr); return;`.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Algorithm Specification\n\n### 5.1 `pmm_alloc_frame()` — Next-Fit Bitmap Scan\n\n**Input:** `frame_bitmap`, `pmm_search_hint` (frame number where scan starts), `pmm_used_frames`.\n\n**Output:** Physical address of an allocated frame, or `NULL`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Check total free count\n  If pmm_frames_free() == 0: return NULL.\n\nStep 2: Determine starting word in bitmap\n  start_word = pmm_search_hint / 32\n  If start_word >= BITMAP_WORDS: start_word = 0 (wrap to beginning)\n\nStep 3: Two-phase scan (scan from hint to end, then from beginning to hint)\n  scanned = 0\n  word = start_word\n  LOOP:\n    If frame_bitmap[word] == 0xFFFFFFFF:\n        word++; if word >= BITMAP_WORDS: word = 0;\n        scanned += 32;\n        if scanned >= FRAME_COUNT: return NULL;  (full scan, nothing free)\n        continue;\n\n    // At least one free bit in this word.

This is the key cache-efficiency optimization: on a typical boot with < 25% memory used, most bitmap words are `0x00000000` (all free), and even those are skipped in one comparison. Only words with a mix of 0 and 1 bits require the inner bit loop.\n\n**Invariants after execution:**\n- The returned frame's bit is 1 in `frame_bitmap`.\n- `pmm_used_frames` is incremented by exactly 1.\n- `pmm_search_hint` points to or near the allocated frame.\n- The returned address is never `0` (physical address 0 is never returned).\n\n\n![Higher-Half Kernel Memory Map: Boot Physical vs Runtime Virtual](./diagrams/tdd-diag-22.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.2 `vmm_init()` — Page Table Construction Sequence\n\n**Input:** Physical address of `boot_page_directory`, `identity_page_table`, `kernel_page_table` (all statically allocated in `.bss`, aligned to `PAGE_SIZE`).\n\n**Step-by-step with invariant checks:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Zero the page directory (defensive — BSS already zeroed, but explicit for clarity)\n  memset(boot_page_directory, 0, 1024 * sizeof(pde_t));\n\nStep 2: Populate identity_page_table[0..1023]\n  For i = 0 to 1023:\n    physical_frame = i * PAGE_SIZE   (frame i: 0x0, 0x1000, 0x2000, ..., 0x3FF000)\n    identity_page_table[i] = physical_frame | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n  // Covers virtual 0x00000000 – 0x003FFFFF (first 4MB)\n  // Includes: real-mode area (0x0), kernel stack, kernel code (0x100000), VGA (0xB8000)\n\nStep 3: Populate kernel_page_table[0..1023]\n  For i = 0 to 1023:\n    kernel_page_table[i] = (i * PAGE_SIZE) | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n  // Identical to identity_page_table in content — same physical frames,\n  // different virtual addresses after page directory installation\n\nStep 4: Install identity PDE at directory index 0\n  boot_page_directory[0] = (uint32_t)identity_page_table | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n  // Maps virtual 0x00000000–0x003FFFFF → identity_page_table (physical)\n\nStep 5: Install higher-half PDE at directory index 768\n  boot_page_directory[768] = (uint32_t)kernel_page_table | PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE\n  // Maps virtual 0xC0000000–0xC03FFFFF → kernel_page_table (physical)\n  // 768 = 0xC0000000 >> 22 (verified: 0xC0000000 / 0x400000 = 768)\n\nStep 6: Verify runtime alignment (defensive)\n  Assert (uint32_t)boot_page_directory & 0xFFF == 0\n  Assert (uint32_t)identity_page_table  & 0xFFF == 0\n  Assert (uint32_t)kernel_page_table    & 0xFFF == 0\n  If any assertion fails: kprintf fatal halt\n\nStep 7: Mark the three page-table frames as used in PMM\n  pmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory, PAGE_SIZE);\n  pmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)identity_page_table,  PAGE_SIZE);\n  pmm_mark_used((uint64_t)(uintptr_t)kernel_page_table,    PAGE_SIZE);\n```\n\n**Invariants after execution:**\n- `boot_page_directory[0]` is present and points to `identity_page_table`.\n- `boot_page_directory[768]` is present and points to `kernel_page_table`.\n- All other PD entries are 0 (not present).\n- Three frames accounted for in PMM.\n- Paging NOT yet enabled; this is pure data structure initialization.\n\n\n![Page Fault Handler: CR2 Decode and Error Code Decision Tree](./diagrams/tdd-diag-23.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.3 Page Fault Handler — CR2 Decode and Decision Tree\n\n**Trigger:** CPU exception vector 14 fires. Called via `exception_handler()` in `interrupt.c`.\n\n**Input:** `interrupt_frame_t *frame` with `frame->vector == 14`, `frame->error_code` = page fault error code, `frame->eip` = faulting instruction.\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Read CR2 IMMEDIATELY (first line of vector-14 branch)\n  uint32_t faulting_addr;\n  __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cr2, %0\" : \"=r\"(faulting_addr));\n  // CR2 is volatile: another page fault (from kprintf itself)\n  // would overwrite CR2.

If paging is active and `0xB8000` is mapped (it is, via identity map), this is safe. However, if `kprintf`'s own execution triggers a page fault (e.g., a bad format string pointer), the CPU overwrites CR2 with the new faulting address before invoking the fault handler again — producing a double fault. Saving `faulting_addr` to a local variable before any function call is the only safe pattern.\n\n\n![Kernel Heap: kmalloc Block Layout and Coalescing Algorithm](./diagrams/tdd-diag-24.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.4 `kmalloc()` — First-Fit with Split\n\n**Input:** `size` (requested bytes), `heap_head` (first block in linked list), `heap_end` (current end of mapped heap).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Input validation\n  If size == 0: return NULL\n  size = (size + HEAP_ALIGN - 1) & ~(HEAP_ALIGN - 1)  // Round up to 8-byte alignment\n\nStep 2: Walk the block list looking for a free block that fits\n  block = heap_head\n  LOOP while block != NULL:\n\n    Step 2a: Validate magic (detect corruption early)\n      If block->magic != HEAP_MAGIC:\n          kprintf(\"[HEAP] CORRUPTION at 0x%x: bad magic 0x%x\\n\", block, block->magic);\n          for(;;);   // Halt — heap is corrupt; continuing risks memory safety\n\n    Step 2b: Skip allocated blocks\n      If !block->free: block = block->next; continue\n\n    Step 2c: Check if block is large enough\n      If block->size < size: block = block->next; continue\n\n    Step 2d: Split the block if there is room for a header + minimum payload\n      min_split_size = sizeof(heap_block_t) + HEAP_ALIGN\n      If block->size >= size + min_split_size:\n          Create a new block immediately after the allocated region:\n          new_block = (heap_block_t*)((uint8_t*)block + sizeof(heap_block_t) + size)\n          new_block->magic = HEAP_MAGIC\n          new_block->size  = block->size - size - sizeof(heap_block_t)\n          new_block->free  = 1\n          new_block->next  = block->next\n          new_block->prev  = block\n          If block->next != NULL: block->next->prev = new_block\n          block->next = new_block\n          block->size = size\n\n    Step 2e: Mark block as allocated and return\n      block->free = 0\n      return (void*)((uint8_t*)block + sizeof(heap_block_t))\n\nStep 3: No suitable block found — expand the heap\n  If heap_end >= HEAP_MAX: return NULL   (virtual heap exhausted)\n  heap_expand()   // Maps one more physical frame at heap_end, advances heap_end\n  \n  Try to coalesce with the last block if it was free:\n  last_block = find last block in list (block->next == NULL)\n  If last_block->free:\n      last_block->size += PAGE_SIZE   // Extend the last free block into new page\n      goto Step 2 (retry with extended last block)\n  Else:\n      Create a new block in the newly mapped page:\n      new_block = (heap_block_t*)(uintptr_t)(heap_end - PAGE_SIZE)\n      new_block->magic = HEAP_MAGIC\n      new_block->size  = PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(heap_block_t)\n      new_block->free  = 1\n      new_block->next  = NULL\n      new_block->prev  = last_block\n      last_block->next = new_block\n      goto Step 2 (retry; will find new_block)\n```\n\n**Invariants after each split:**\n- `block->size + new_block->size + sizeof(heap_block_t) == original_block->size` (no bytes lost).\n- Both blocks have valid magic values.\n- The linked list is doubly-consistent: `block->next == new_block` and `new_block->prev == block`.\n\n**Why minimum split size is `sizeof(heap_block_t) + HEAP_ALIGN`:** If the remainder after splitting would be smaller than a header plus minimum payload, the split produces an unusable block that can never be allocated.

Coalescing next first keeps `block` valid through both steps.\n\n---\n\n### 5.6 `heap_expand()` — On-Demand Physical Frame Mapping\n\n**Called from:** `kmalloc()` when the block list has no suitable free block.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Check heap bounds\n  If heap_end > HEAP_MAX - PAGE_SIZE:\n      kprintf(\"[HEAP] FATAL: Heap virtual space exhausted at 0x%x\\n\", heap_end);\n      for(;;);\n\nStep 2: Allocate a physical frame\n  void *phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\n  If phys == NULL:\n      kprintf(\"[HEAP] FATAL: pmm_alloc_frame() returned NULL during heap expansion\\n\");\n      for(;;);\n      // Alternatively: return NULL and propagate to kmalloc → caller.\n      // For this module: halt, because OOM during heap expansion is unrecoverable.\n\nStep 3: Map the frame at heap_end\n  vmm_map_page(boot_page_directory, heap_end, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)phys,\n               PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\n  // TLB flush for this address is performed inside vmm_map_page.\n\nStep 4: Advance heap_end\n  heap_end += PAGE_SIZE;\n  // heap_end now points to the first byte past the newly mapped region.\n```\n\n**Invariants after execution:**\n- Virtual addresses `[old_heap_end, old_heap_end + PAGE_SIZE)` are mapped and writable.\n- One additional physical frame is marked used in PMM.\n- `heap_end` advanced by exactly `PAGE_SIZE`.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling Matrix\n\n| Error | Detected By | Recovery | User-Visible? |\n|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|\n| **Triple fault: CR0.PG set without identity map** | CPU triple-faults immediately (next fetch page-faults; page fault handler page-faults; double fault; triple fault) | No recovery. Prevention: identity_page_table must cover currently executing code before `vmm_enable_paging()`. Verify: code at `0x100000` is covered by `identity_page_table[256]` (frame 256 = physical `0x100000`). | QEMU reboots |\n| **Stale TLB: PTE modified without `invlpg`** | Silent wrong-physical-frame access; data corruption or wrong permissions enforced | No immediate crash; corruption discovered later (data read from wrong page, write goes to wrong frame). Prevention: call `tlb_flush_page()` in every PTE modification path. Detected by: adding test that writes to a freshly mapped page and reads back via a different path. | Silent corruption; may crash later |\n| **PMM allocates kernel frame** | Kernel code or data overwritten by heap allocation; crash at unpredictable time | No recovery once occurred. Prevention: `pmm_mark_used` for kernel range in `pmm_init()`. Detected by: boot-time print of \"used frames\" should show kernel size accounted for. | Eventually crashes |\n| **Page table frame not marked used in PMM** | PMM gives out the frame holding `identity_page_table`; subsequent write to that frame corrupts the page table; next memory access uses garbage translation; crash | No recovery. Prevention: `vmm_init()` calls `pmm_mark_used()` for all three page table frames. | QEMU reboot or silent corruption |\n| **CR2 overwritten before save** | kprintf inside page fault handler itself causes a page fault; CR2 updated to new address; handler prints wrong faulting address | Wrong address printed but halt still occurs. Prevention: save CR2 to local variable as the absolute first operation in the vector-14 branch. | Wrong diagnostic info |\n| **Double-free: `pmm_free_frame` called twice for same frame** | `bitmap_test(frame)` returns 0 (bit already clear) before `bitmap_clear`. Detected by the pre-clear check. | `kprintf` warning; return without modifying state. Frame remains free. Caller continues (may be in inconsistent state). | `kprintf` message |\n| **Double-free: `kfree` called twice for same pointer** | `block->free == 1` check in Step 4 of kfree algorithm. | `kprintf` bug message; return without modifying state. Heap remains usable. | `kprintf` message |\n| **Heap magic corruption** | `kmalloc` or `kfree` checks `block->magic != HEAP_MAGIC`. Caused by buffer overflow beyond an allocation writing into the next block's header. | `kmalloc`: halt (cannot safely allocate from corrupt heap). `kfree`: return without coalescing (safe; leaks memory, but avoids corrupting adjacent block pointers). | `kprintf` corruption message; possible halt |\n| **`pmm_parse_memory_map`: MB_FLAG_MMAP not set** | `!(mbi->flags & MB_FLAG_MMAP)` check at start of function. | Fatal halt with message. This should never happen when booting via GRUB. | `kprintf` fatal message |\n| **Multiboot iterator off-by-4 (size + 0 instead of size + 4)** | Iterator produces wrong addresses; reads garbage E820 entries; `type` field contains wrong value | May cause no usable frames to be found (all marked used) or may loop past the end of the mmap buffer. Detection: boot-time output shows 0 usable MB or QEMU segfault-equivalent. | Wrong memory availability or hang |\n| **`vmm_map_page` with non-4KB-aligned `virt_addr`** | Alignment masked down silently. The caller's intended virtual address may differ by up to 4095 bytes from what was actually mapped. | No crash; wrong virtual address mapped. Detected by: test that maps a specific address and verifies the translation. | Silent wrong mapping |\n| **`pmm_alloc_frame` returns frame 0** | The `frame == 0` guard in the inner bit-scan loop prevents frame 0 from being returned. | Never returned. Frame 0 always marked used in `pmm_init()`. | N/A |\n| **Page directory not 4KB aligned** | Runtime check in `vmm_init()` at Step 6: `assert (uint32_t)boot_page_directory & 0xFFF == 0`. | Fatal halt with alignment message. Prevention: `__attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)))`. | `kprintf` fatal message |\n| **Heap expansion at HEAP_MAX** | `if heap_end > HEAP_MAX - PAGE_SIZE` in `heap_expand()`. | Fatal halt (OOM — no virtual space left). | `kprintf` fatal message |\n| **`kfree` with pointer to non-heap address** | `block->magic != HEAP_MAGIC` (the magic value will be wrong for arbitrary memory). | `kprintf` message; return without modification. | `kprintf` message |\n| **`mmap_entry_t` with `addr > 0xFFFFFFFF`** | Check `entry->addr > 0xFFFFFFFFULL` before `ADDR_TO_FRAME` cast. | Skip the entry (can't manage > 4GB on 32-bit). | Silent skip; those frames not available |\n| **identity_page_table covers VGA but without PAGE_CACHE_DISABLE** | VGA writes may be cached by CPU; character updates may not appear immediately | Functionally: write-combining on modern hardware means updates usually appear. On strict hardware: VGA displays stale data. | Possible display artifacts |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Implementation Sequence with Checkpoints\n\n### Phase 1 — Multiboot Memory Map Parser (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `include/multiboot.h` with `multiboot_info_t`, `mmap_entry_t`, and E820 type constants (validate `__attribute__((packed))` with static size assertions). Modify `entry.asm` to save `EBX` (multiboot pointer) before BSS zeroing and pass it as an argument to `kmain`: push `EBX` before `call kmain`. Update `kmain` signature to `void kmain(multiboot_info_t *mbi)`.\n\nCreate `mm/pmm.c` and `include/pmm.h`. Implement `pmm_parse_memory_map()` only. Call it from `kmain()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 1:** Boot with GRUB (or update Makefile to produce a GRUB-compatible multiboot image). Expected output:\n\n```\n[PMM] Memory map (from GRUB):\n  [0x00000000 – 0x0009FFFF] Usable RAM\n  [0x000A0000 – 0x000BFFFF] Reserved\n  [0x000C0000 – 0x000FFFFF] Reserved\n  [0x00100000 – 0x07FFFFFF] Usable RAM   (varies by QEMU -m setting)\n  [0xFFFC0000 – 0xFFFFFFFF] Reserved\n[PMM] Total usable: 127 MB\n```\n\nVerify: entry iterator uses `entry->size + 4` for advancement. Verify: 64-bit base addresses printed as two 32-bit halves. If QEMU shows no memory map output: check `mbi->flags & MB_FLAG_MMAP` is nonzero; add `kprintf(\"flags=0x%08x\\n\", mbi->flags)` to diagnose.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 — Bitmap Physical Frame Allocator (4–6 hours)\n\nImplement `pmm_init()`, `pmm_mark_used()`, `pmm_mark_free()`, `pmm_alloc_frame()`, `pmm_free_frame()`, `pmm_frames_free()`, `pmm_frames_used()`, `pmm_frames_total()`.\n\nAdd `_Static_assert(sizeof(frame_bitmap) == 128 * 1024, \"Bitmap must be 128KB\");` to `pmm.c`.\n\nAdd to `kmain()` after `pmm_parse_memory_map()`:\n```c\npmm_init(mbi);\nkprintf(\"[PMM] Test: allocating 5 frames\\n\");\nvoid *f1 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f1=0x%08x\\n\", f1);\nvoid *f2 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f2=0x%08x\\n\", f2);\nvoid *f3 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f3=0x%08x\\n\", f3);\nvoid *f4 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f4=0x%08x\\n\", f4);\nvoid *f5 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f5=0x%08x\\n\", f5);\npmm_free_frame(f2);\nvoid *f6 = pmm_alloc_frame(); kprintf(\"  f6=0x%08x (expect ~f2)\\n\", f6);\npmm_free_frame(f2);  /* Double-free test — should print BUG message */\nkprintf(\"[PMM] Free: %u  Used: %u  Total: %u\\n\",\n        pmm_frames_free(), pmm_frames_used(), pmm_frames_total());\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 2:** Expected output shows:\n- `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`, `f5` are distinct 4KB-aligned addresses above `0x100000` (kernel frames reserved below).\n- `f6` equals `f2` (next-fit hint allows reuse).\n- Double-free on `f2` prints `\"[HEAP] BUG: Double-free at frame...\"`.\n- Frame counts are consistent: used + free = total.\n- No frame is `0x00000000` or `NULL`.\n\nRun `qemu-system-i386 ... -d int 2>int.log` and verify no exceptions in the log (no triple faults from the allocator).\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3 — Static Page Table Construction (3–4 hours)\n\nCreate `include/page.h` and `include/vmm.h`. Create `mm/vmm.c` with the three statically allocated, 4KB-aligned page tables. Implement `vmm_init()` (Steps 1–7 from §5.2, except the `vmm_enable_paging()` call). Do NOT call `vmm_enable_paging()` yet.\n\nAdd to `kmain()` after `pmm_init()`:\n```c\nvmm_init();\nkprintf(\"[VMM] Page directory built (paging NOT yet enabled).\\n\");\n/* Verify PDE entries */\nextern pde_t boot_page_directory[];\nkprintf(\"[VMM] PD[0]   = 0x%08x (identity)\\n\",   boot_page_directory[0]);\nkprintf(\"[VMM] PD[768] = 0x%08x (higher-half)\\n\", boot_page_directory[768]);\nkprintf(\"[VMM] PD[1]   = 0x%08x (expect 0)\\n\",   boot_page_directory[1]);\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 3:** Expected:\n- `PD[0]` nonzero, ends in `0x003` (`P | W` flags), upper bits = physical address of `identity_page_table`.\n- `PD[768]` nonzero, ends in `0x003`, upper bits = physical address of `kernel_page_table`.\n- `PD[1]` = `0x00000000` (not mapped).\n- Use `nm kernel.elf | grep \"identity_page_table\\|kernel_page_table\\|boot_page_directory\"` and verify all three addresses appear, are 4KB-aligned (low 12 bits = 0), and are within the expected kernel range (`>= 0x100000`).\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4 — Paging Enablement and Verification (2–3 hours)\n\nImplement `vmm_enable_paging()`. Add `tlb_flush_page()` and `tlb_flush_all()` as inline functions in `vmm.h`.\n\nAdd to `kmain()` after `vmm_init()`:\n```c\nvmm_enable_paging();\n/* If we reach here, paging is on and identity map is working */\nkprintf(\"[VMM] Paging active. Identity map verified (this kprintf proves it).\\n\");\n/* Test VGA is still accessible (identity map includes 0xB8000) */\nvolatile uint16_t *vga_test = (volatile uint16_t *)0xB8000;\nvga_test[0] = (uint16_t)'P' | (0x0A << 8);  /* Green 'P' at top-left */\nkprintf(\"[VMM] VGA MMIO accessible at 0xB8000 (identity mapped).\\n\");\n/* Test higher-half access is NOT needed yet (kernel linked at 0x100000) */\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 4:** The kernel boots with a green `P` visible at the top-left of the VGA screen, and `kprintf` output continues normally. If QEMU reboots: the identity map does not cover the code at `0x100000`. Verify that `identity_page_table[256]` (frame index 256 = physical `0x100000`) is set correctly. Run `qemu-system-i386 ... -d int 2>int.log` and check for `v=0e` (page fault) immediately after the CR0 write.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5 — TLB Management Policy (1–2 hours)\n\nAdd comments to `vmm_map_page()` and `vmm_unmap_page()` specifying exactly when each TLB flush type is used. Write a compile-time policy document as a comment block in `vmm.h`:\n\n```c\n/* TLB Flush Policy:\n * - After every PTE modification (vmm_map_page, vmm_unmap_page): use tlb_flush_page(virt_addr).\n * - After every PDE modification (new page table installed): use tlb_flush_page(virt_addr)\n *   for any address in the 4MB region covered by the new PDE.\n * - After bulk modifications (>4 PTEs changed in a loop): use tlb_flush_all() once after the loop.\n * - Never omit TLB flush after clearing PAGE_PRESENT from a PTE.\n * - tlb_flush_page is preferred over tlb_flush_all for single-page modifications\n *   (lower cost: ~20 cycles vs ~30 cycles + subsequent cold misses for tlb_flush_all).\n */\n```\n\nAdd a test: map a frame, write a known value, unmap it, remap to a different frame, verify the new frame's content is read (not the old cached content). If TLB flush is missing, the old physical frame's content would be returned.\n\n**Checkpoint 5:** The TLB test (map/write/unmap/remap/read) produces the correct result from the new mapping, not the old one. No assertion failure.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6 — Dynamic `vmm_map_page()` and `vmm_unmap_page()` (3–4 hours)\n\nImplement `vmm_map_page()` (full algorithm from §4.9) and `vmm_unmap_page()` (§4.10) in `mm/vmm.c`.\n\nTest: map a page outside the statically identity-mapped region (e.g., virtual `0x400000`, physical frame from `pmm_alloc_frame()`), write a pattern, read it back, unmap it, verify the next access causes a page fault.\n\n**Checkpoint 6:** Add to `kmain()` (temporarily, before heap test):\n```c\nvoid *test_phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\nvmm_map_page(boot_page_directory, 0x00500000, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)test_phys,\n             PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE);\nvolatile uint32_t *test_virt = (volatile uint32_t *)0x00500000;\n*test_virt = 0xCAFEBABE;\nuint32_t readback = *test_virt;\nkprintf(\"[VMM] Dynamic map test: wrote 0xCAFEBABE, read 0x%08x\\n\", readback);\n/* readback must equal 0xCAFEBABE */\nvmm_unmap_page(boot_page_directory, 0x00500000);\nkprintf(\"[VMM] Unmap complete. Next access to 0x00500000 would fault.\\n\");\n```\n\nExpected output: `\"read 0xCAFEBABE\"`. If read produces garbage: TLB flush missing from `vmm_map_page`, or page table frame zeroing was skipped.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 7 — Page Fault Handler (2–3 hours)\n\nIn `interrupt.c`, locate the `frame->vector == 14` branch in `exception_handler()`. Replace the comment stub with the full algorithm from §5.3: save CR2 first, decode error code bits, print diagnostic.\n\n**Checkpoint 7:** Test three page fault scenarios:\n\n**7a — Kernel null pointer:**\n```c\nvolatile int *null_ptr = (volatile int *)0x00000000;\nint x = *null_ptr;  /* Page fault: present=0, write=0, user=0 */\n(void)x;\n```\nExpected output: `\"Faulting address (CR2): 0x00000000\"`, `\"P=0\"` (not present), `\"W=0\"` (read), `\"U=0\"` (kernel), `\"Kernel null pointer dereference!\"`.\n\n**7b — Unmapped address:**\n```c\nvolatile int *bad = (volatile int *)0x50000000;  /* Not mapped */\nint y = *bad;\n(void)y;\n```\nExpected: `\"Faulting address: 0x50000000\"`, P=0, W=0, U=0.\n\n**7c — After each test:** QEMU halts at `cli; hlt` (not reboots). QEMU `-d int` log shows `v=0e e=0000` (or appropriate error code), confirming the exception was handled (not a triple fault).\n\nRemove these tests before Phase 8.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 8 — Kernel Heap: `heap_init()`, `kmalloc()`, `kfree()` (4–6 hours)\n\nCreate `include/heap.h` and `mm/heap.c`. Implement `heap_init()`, `heap_expand()`, `kmalloc()`, `kfree()`, `kheap_used()`.\n\nAdd static assert: `_Static_assert(sizeof(heap_block_t) == 20, \"heap_block_t must be 20 bytes\");`\n\n**Checkpoint 8:** Add to `kmain()` after `heap_init()`:\n```c\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] === Heap Tests ===\\n\");\n\n/* Basic alloc/free */\nvoid *p1 = kmalloc(64);\nvoid *p2 = kmalloc(128);\nvoid *p3 = kmalloc(32);\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] p1=0x%x p2=0x%x p3=0x%x\\n\", p1, p2, p3);\n/* All three must be distinct, 8-byte aligned, nonzero */\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] Aligned: p1%%8=%u p2%%8=%u p3%%8=%u\\n\",\n        (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)p1 % 8,\n        (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)p2 % 8,\n        (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)p3 % 8);\n\n/* Write and read back */\n*(uint32_t *)p1 = 0x11111111;\n*(uint32_t *)p2 = 0x22222222;\n*(uint32_t *)p3 = 0x33333333;\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] Values: 0x%x 0x%x 0x%x\\n\",\n        *(uint32_t*)p1, *(uint32_t*)p2, *(uint32_t*)p3);\n\n/* Free and reallocate */\nkfree(p2);\nvoid *p4 = kmalloc(64);   /* Should reuse p2's space (first fit; p2 was 128 bytes) */\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] p4=0x%x (expect near p2=0x%x)\\n\", p4, p2);\n\n/* Double-free test */\nkfree(p2);  /* Should print BUG message, not crash */\n\n/* Coalescing test */\nkfree(p1);\nkfree(p3);\nkfree(p4);  /* After freeing all three, heap should coalesce to one large free block */\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] kheap_used()=%u (expect 0 or low)\\n\", kheap_used());\n\n/* Large allocation triggering expansion */\nvoid *big = kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE * 2);\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] Large alloc (8192 bytes): 0x%x\\n\", big);\nkfree(big);\n\nkprintf(\"[HEAP] All heap tests passed.\\n\");\n```\n\nExpected: All pointers nonzero and 8-byte aligned. Value reads return written values. Double-free prints `\"BUG\"` message without crashing. `kheap_used()` near 0 after all frees. Large allocation succeeds.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 9 — Integration and Final kmain (2–3 hours)\n\nUpdate `kmain()` to the final initialization sequence. Remove all temporary tests. Add frame count reporting.\n\n**Checkpoint 9 (final acceptance test):**\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n=== Build-OS Kernel v0.3 ===\n[Milestones 1+2 init lines...]\n[PMM] Memory map (from GRUB):\n  [0x00000000 – 0x0009FFFF] Usable RAM\n  [0x000A0000 – 0x000FFFFF] Reserved\n  [0x00100000 – 0x07FFFFFF] Usable RAM\n  [0xFFFC0000 – 0xFFFFFFFF] Reserved\n[PMM] Total usable: 127 MB\n[PMM] Init: 31920 free frames, 256 used frames, 32176 total\n[VMM] Page directory built.\n[VMM] PD[0]=0x...

Test Specification\n\n### 8.1 Physical Frame Allocator Tests\n\n**T-PMM-1: Allocate returns nonzero, non-NULL**\n- `void *f = pmm_alloc_frame();`\n- Assert `f != NULL` and `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)f != 0`.\n\n**T-PMM-2: Allocate returns 4KB-aligned address**\n- `void *f = pmm_alloc_frame();`\n- Assert `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)f & (PAGE_SIZE - 1) == 0`.\n\n**T-PMM-3: Ten allocations return distinct addresses**\n- Allocate 10 frames. Compare all pairs. Assert all distinct.\n\n**T-PMM-4: Free and reallocate produces same address (next-fit)**\n- `f1 = pmm_alloc_frame(); pmm_free_frame(f1); f2 = pmm_alloc_frame();`\n- Assert `f1 == f2` (next-fit returns to the freed frame; hint points near it).\n\n**T-PMM-5: Frame 0 never returned**\n- Allocate until `pmm_frames_free() == 0`. Verify no allocation ever returned address `0x00000000`.\n\n**T-PMM-6: Double-free detected, no crash**\n- `f = pmm_alloc_frame(); pmm_free_frame(f); pmm_free_frame(f);` — second free prints `\"BUG: Double-free\"` and returns. Verify `pmm_frames_free()` is not inflated (not counted twice).\n\n**T-PMM-7: Kernel frames not allocatable**\n- Boot. Call `pmm_alloc_frame()` 1000 times. Verify no returned address falls in range `[0x100000, kernel_end_phys)`.\n\n**T-PMM-8: Reserved frames (first 1MB) not allocated**\n- Allocate 100 frames. Verify all returned addresses ≥ `0x100000`.\n\n**T-PMM-9: Frame count consistency**\n- After `pmm_init()`: `pmm_frames_used() + pmm_frames_free() == pmm_frames_total()`. Verify after 10 allocs: `pmm_frames_free()` decremented by 10. Verify after 5 frees: `pmm_frames_free()` incremented by 5.\n\n**T-PMM-10: `pmm_mark_used` idempotent**\n- Call `pmm_mark_used(0x200000, PAGE_SIZE)` twice. Verify `pmm_frames_used()` incremented by 1 (not 2).\n\n---\n\n### 8.2 Page Table Construction Tests\n\n**T-VMM-1: Page directory entries present at indices 0 and 768**\n- After `vmm_init()`: `boot_page_directory[0] & PAGE_PRESENT` is nonzero. `boot_page_directory[768] & PAGE_PRESENT` is nonzero.\n\n**T-VMM-2: All other PD entries are zero (not present)**\n- After `vmm_init()`: for all `i` except 0 and 768: `boot_page_directory[i] == 0`.\n\n**T-VMM-3: PDE frame addresses point to page tables**\n- `PDE_FRAME(boot_page_directory[0]) == (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)identity_page_table`.\n- `PDE_FRAME(boot_page_directory[768]) == (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)kernel_page_table`.\n\n**T-VMM-4: identity_page_table entry 256 maps physical `0x100000`**\n- `PTE_FRAME(identity_page_table[256]) == 0x100000`.\n- `identity_page_table[256] & PAGE_PRESENT` is nonzero.\n\n**T-VMM-5: VGA identity mapping**\n- `identity_page_table[0xB8]` (index = `0xB8000 / 0x1000 = 184` decimal = `0xB8` hex = 184): `PTE_FRAME(identity_page_table[184]) == 0x000B8000`.\n\n**T-VMM-6: Page tables are 4KB-aligned**\n- `(uint32_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory & 0xFFF == 0`.\n- Same for `identity_page_table` and `kernel_page_table`.\n\n**T-VMM-7: Page table frames marked used in PMM**\n- `bitmap_test(ADDR_TO_FRAME((uint32_t)boot_page_directory))` returns 1.\n- Same for the other two tables.\n\n---\n\n### 8.3 Paging Enablement Tests\n\n**T-PAGING-1: CR0.PG set after `vmm_enable_paging()`**\n- Read CR0 via inline asm: `mov %%cr0, %0`. Assert bit 31 is set.\n\n**T-PAGING-2: CR3 points to page directory**\n- Read CR3 via inline asm: `mov %%cr3, %0`. Assert value == `(uint32_t)boot_page_directory`.\n\n**T-PAGING-3: VGA still writable after paging enabled**\n- `((volatile uint16_t*)0xB8000)[79] = 'T' | (0x0F << 8);` — write to top-right corner. No page fault, character visible. Proves identity map is covering `0xB8000`.\n\n**T-PAGING-4: kprintf works after paging enabled**\n- `kprintf(\"Paging active.\\n\");` — appears on screen and serial. Proves code execution, stack access, and VGA access all work through page tables.\n\n**T-PAGING-5: Access to non-mapped address causes page fault (not triple fault)**\n- Access `0x50000000` (not mapped). Page fault handler fires, prints diagnostic, halts. QEMU does not reboot. Verified via `-d int` showing `v=0e`.\n\n---\n\n### 8.4 TLB Correctness Tests\n\n**T-TLB-1: `tlb_flush_page` compiled correctly**\n- `objdump -d vmm.o | grep invlpg` — must show `invlpg` instruction present.\n\n**T-TLB-2: Map, write, read — coherent (TLB not stale)**\n- Allocate frame, map to virtual `0x00600000`, write `0xDEADC0DE`, read back — must get `0xDEADC0DE`.\n\n**T-TLB-3: Unmap then remap to different frame — reads new frame content**\n- Map virtual `0x00700000` to frame A, write `0xAAAAAAAA`. Unmap. Map same virtual to frame B (write `0xBBBBBBBB` to frame B physically first via identity map). Read virtual `0x00700000` — must get `0xBBBBBBBB` (not `0xAAAAAAAA` from stale TLB).\n\n**T-TLB-4: `tlb_flush_all` invalidates old translations**\n- Call `tlb_flush_all()`. Access a previously mapped page. No stale fault.\n\n---\n\n### 8.5 Page Fault Handler Tests\n\n**T-PF-1: CR2 contains faulting address**\n- Trigger fault at `0xDEAD1000`. Handler output contains `\"0xdead1000\"`.\n\n**T-PF-2: P=0 for non-present page**\n- Access unmapped page. `\"P=0\"` and `\"page not-present\"` in output.\n\n**T-PF-3: W=1 for write fault**\n- Map page as read-only (`PAGE_PRESENT` only, no `PAGE_WRITABLE`). Write to it. `\"W=1\"` and `\"write\"` in output.\n\n**T-PF-4: U=0 for kernel fault**\n- All test faults above triggered from kernel code. Output shows `\"U=0\"` and `\"kernel-mode\"`.\n\n**T-PF-5: Halt, not triple fault**\n- After fault: QEMU does NOT reboot. System halts at `cli; hlt` (QEMU shows CPU halted state in monitor). `-d int` shows no `v=08` (double fault) after `v=0e`.\n\n**T-PF-6: Null pointer diagnostic**\n- Access virtual `0x0`. Output contains `\"null pointer dereference\"`.\n\n---\n\n### 8.6 Heap Allocator Tests\n\n**T-HEAP-1: `kmalloc(0)` returns NULL**\n- Assert `kmalloc(0) == NULL`.\n\n**T-HEAP-2: Single allocation returns non-NULL, 8-byte aligned**\n- `p = kmalloc(1);` — assert `p != NULL`, `(uint32_t)p % 8 == 0`.\n\n**T-HEAP-3: Write and read back for 1-byte, 4-byte, 64-byte, 4095-byte allocations**\n- For each size: write a pattern, read back, compare.\n\n**T-HEAP-4: Two allocations do not overlap**\n- `p1 = kmalloc(100); p2 = kmalloc(100);` — assert `(uint8_t*)p2 >= (uint8_t*)p1 + 100 + sizeof(heap_block_t)`.\n\n**T-HEAP-5: Free and reallocate produces same or earlier address (no fragmentation growth)**\n- `p1 = kmalloc(64); kfree(p1); p2 = kmalloc(64);` — assert `p2 == p1` (exact same block reused after split + free).\n\n**T-HEAP-6: Coalescing — two adjacent frees merge into one block**\n- `p1 = kmalloc(64); p2 = kmalloc(64); kfree(p1); kfree(p2);`\n- `p3 = kmalloc(128);` — must succeed without heap expansion (the two 64-byte blocks coalesced into 128+ bytes).\n\n**T-HEAP-7: Large allocation triggers heap expansion**\n- `p = kmalloc(PAGE_SIZE * 3);` — succeeds (heap expands three pages). `kfree(p)` succeeds. Frame count returns to pre-allocation level (physical frames freed when heap contracts — NOT implemented in this module; heap never shrinks, physical frames are not returned to PMM on free. Verify at least that heap_used decreases after kfree).\n\n**T-HEAP-8: Double-free detected, no crash, no inflated free count**\n- `p = kmalloc(64); kfree(p); kfree(p);` — second kfree prints `\"BUG: Double-free\"`. No crash. `kheap_used()` is not negative.\n\n**T-HEAP-9: Magic corruption detected in `kmalloc`**\n- `p = kmalloc(64); *(uint32_t*)((uint8_t*)p + 64) = 0x12345678;` — corrupt the next block's magic. Next `kmalloc()` call detects corruption. Output includes `\"CORRUPTION\"` or `\"bad magic\"`.\n\n**T-HEAP-10: `kheap_used()` tracks allocations**\n- After `heap_init()`: `kheap_used() == 0`. After `kmalloc(64)`: `kheap_used() >= 64`. After `kfree()`: `kheap_used() == 0`. (Implementation note: `kheap_used()` walks the block list summing `!free ? block->size : 0` for all blocks.)\n\n**T-HEAP-11: Heap memory is within HEAP_START–HEAP_MAX**\n- All pointers returned by `kmalloc()` satisfy `p >= HEAP_START + sizeof(heap_block_t)` and `p < HEAP_MAX`.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Performance Targets\n\n| Operation | Target | How to Measure |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|\n| `pmm_alloc_frame()` — warm cache, sequential allocation | < 100 cycles | `rdtsc` before/after; average 100 consecutive allocs; expect ~20–50 cycles (one cache line scan) |\n| `pmm_alloc_frame()` — cold cache, first call after boot | < 200µs | Single `rdtsc` measurement; 128KB bitmap = 2048 cache lines × ~100ns DRAM = max ~200µs |\n| `pmm_free_frame()` — single frame | < 20 cycles | `rdtsc` around single free; two bit ops + decrement + conditional hint update |\n| `tlb_flush_page()` — `invlpg` single page | ~20 cycles | `rdtsc` around 100 calls; divide by 100 |\n| `tlb_flush_all()` — CR3 reload | ~30 cycles + TLB cold miss cost | `rdtsc` around reload; note subsequent access latency |\n| `vmm_map_page()` — PDE already present (common case) | < 50 cycles | One PTE write + `invlpg` |\n| `vmm_map_page()` — PDE not present (new page table) | < 200 cycles | `pmm_alloc_frame()` + `memset` (4KB zero) + PDE write + `invlpg` |\n| TLB miss — full 2-level page table walk | 30–50 cycles (L2 cache hit for PDE+PTE) | Measure by mapping a cold page, accessing it, observing first-access latency via `rdtsc` |\n| TLB miss — DRAM walk | 150–200 cycles | Same as above with cold cache; L3 miss for PDE or PTE |\n| `kmalloc(64)` — block in L1 cache, no expansion | < 200 cycles | `rdtsc`; dominated by linked list traverse (1–3 blocks) |\n| `kmalloc(64)` — cold heap (first access after boot) | < 500 cycles | Heap block header in DRAM = 1 cache miss (~100ns) |\n| `kmalloc` with heap expansion | < 2µs | `pmm_alloc_frame()` + `vmm_map_page()` + heap_block_t init |\n| `kfree()` — no coalescing | < 50 cycles | Flag set + no block merge |\n| `kfree()` — with coalescing (both neighbors free) | < 100 cycles | Two neighbor magic checks + two pointer updates |\n| `pmm_init()` — full bitmap initialization | < 1ms | `memset(0xFF, 128KB)` + E820 iteration + mark_used calls |\n| `vmm_enable_paging()` — CR3 + CR0 write | < 50 cycles | One-time cost; dominated by CR0 write serialization |\n| Heap expansion (`heap_expand()`) | < 1µs | `pmm_alloc_frame()` + `vmm_map_page()` |\n\n**Measurement template:**\n\n```c\nuint64_t t0 = rdtsc();\nvoid *p = pmm_alloc_frame();\nuint64_t t1 = rdtsc();\nkprintf(\"[PERF] pmm_alloc_frame: %u cycles\\n\", (uint32_t)(t1 - t0));\n(void)p;\n```\n\n---\n\n## 10. Hardware Soul Analysis\n\n### Identity Map Bootstrapping — The Physics of Paging Enablement\n\nWhen `mov %0, %%cr0` (setting PG=1) executes, the CPU's fetch unit immediately begins translating the *next* instruction's address through the newly active page tables. The pipeline has already fetched and partially decoded the next 1–3 instructions (prefetch queue). On modern CPUs, writing CR0 is a serializing instruction — it flushes the pipeline, discards prefetched instructions, and restarts fetch from the instruction following the CR0 write. The restart uses the page tables.\n\n**The critical window:** The instruction at `current_eip + N` (the first instruction after the CR0 write) must be mapped. Since the kernel executes at physical `0x100000` and the identity map maps virtual `0x100000` → physical `0x100000`, the fetch succeeds. If the code were at physical `0x500000` without identity mapping virtual `0x500000`, the fetch would produce a page fault. No diagnostic possible. Triple fault.\n\n**Why CR0 write is serializing:** Intel SDM Volume 3, Section 8.3: \"Certain instructions cause the processor to serialize all pending memory accesses and wait for them to complete before continuing program execution.\" MOV to CR0, CR3, CR4 are serializing. This means no pipelining artifact can cause a prefetched instruction from \"before paging\" to execute \"after paging\" — the serialization guarantees a clean boundary.\n\n### Bitmap Cache Behavior — Why 512 Frames Per Cache Line Matters\n\nA 64-byte cache line holds 16 `uint32_t` words of the bitmap. Each word represents 32 frames. 16 × 32 = 512 frames per cache line = 512 × 4KB = 2MB of physical memory per cache line. The inner loop's word-skip optimization (`if (frame_bitmap[word] == 0xFFFFFFFF) continue`) skips 512 frames in a single comparison:\n\n```c\nif (frame_bitmap[word] == 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n    word++; continue;  // 512 frames checked, 1 comparison, 0 bit-level loops\n}\n```\n\nAfter `pmm_init()`, a 128MB system has ~32K usable frames (32K / 32 = 1024 bitmap words = 64 cache lines). A fully-unused heap allocation scan traverses 64 cache lines in L2 (after the first pass warms the cache). At 5ns per L2 hit: 64 × 5ns = 320ns worst case for finding a free frame anywhere in 128MB. With the search hint, the typical case is 1 cache line = 5ns.\n\n### Page Table Walk Latency — Why TLB Size Matters\n\nA TLB miss triggers a hardware page table walk: 2 memory reads (PDE from CR3-pointed directory, PTE from PDE-pointed table) plus the data access itself = 3 memory accesses minimum. If the page directory is hot in L1 (it's accessed on every TLB miss for any address in that directory entry's 4MB range): ~4 cycles for PDE read. If the page table is in L2 (4KB page table; accessed on every TLB miss within a 4MB region): ~12 cycles for PTE read. Data from L2: ~12 cycles. Total TLB miss cost: ~30 cycles. This is the \"30–50 cycles TLB miss\" target.\n\nThe heap at virtual `0xD0000000`: heap PD index = `0xD0000000 >> 22 = 832`. Each heap page table covers 4MB of heap virtual space. For a heap under 4MB, there is exactly one page table, and after the first access, it stays in L2 cache. All heap accesses within 4MB share this single warm page table.\n\n### Heap Block Pointer-Chasing — Cache Miss Profile\n\nEach `heap_block_t` header is 20 bytes. After a series of allocations and frees, block headers are at addresses like `0xD0000000`, `0xD0000054`, `0xD000009C`, ... (depending on split sizes). These are sequential addresses within the first heap page — all within one 4KB page, and likely within two 64-byte cache lines after the first few allocations. The \"pointer-chasing is cache-hostile\" concern applies mainly to mature heaps with many blocks scattered across multiple pages. For a kernel with dozens of allocations (not millions), the entire heap metadata fits in L1 cache.\n\nThe critical case is the first `kmalloc()` after boot: the heap block at `0xD0000000` was just mapped, so it is cold. First access = TLB miss (heap PDE was just installed) + page table walk + L3 or DRAM access = ~150–200 cycles. Subsequent accesses in the same session are L1 hits.\n\n### VGA MMIO — Uncacheable vs Write-Combining\n\nPhysical `0xB8000` is typically in the MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) region `0xA0000`–`0xBFFFF` classified as `Write Combining (WC)`. Write-combining allows the CPU to buffer several writes and send them to the device in a burst rather than one at a time. For VGA text mode (40 bytes/screen update), this distinction doesn't matter. For high-bandwidth framebuffer writes (modern GPU, 32MB/frame at 60fps), WC is essential — without it, each write is a separate uncacheable transaction saturating the PCIe bus.\n\nOur identity map sets `PAGE_CACHE_DISABLE` (PCD) for the VGA range if following the policy table in §3.3. In practice, the MTRR takes precedence over the page table PCD flag (MTRR \"wins\" for write-combined regions). Either way, VGA writes are not L1/L2 cached — each `uint16_t` write to `0xB8000` goes to the display adapter.\n\n\n![Module Architecture: PMM, VMM, and Heap Subsystems](./diagrams/tdd-diag-25.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Concurrency Specification\n\n**Model:** Single-core; no SMP; no threads (mod-4 introduces processes but keeps single CPU). All allocator operations are non-reentrant. The only concurrent entity is interrupt handlers.\n\n**PMM critical sections:** `pmm_alloc_frame()` and `pmm_free_frame()` modify `frame_bitmap`, `pmm_used_frames`, and `pmm_search_hint`. If an interrupt handler called `pmm_alloc_frame()` while `kmain` was mid-way through `pmm_alloc_frame()` (e.g., between `bitmap_test()` and `bitmap_set()`), the same frame could be allocated twice. **In this module, no interrupt handler calls `pmm_alloc_frame()`.** The timer handler (from mod-2) only increments `pit_tick_count`. The keyboard handler only writes to a ring buffer. **No locking is required** for mod-3. For production use: wrap `pmm_alloc_frame()` and `pmm_free_frame()` with `cli`/`sti`.\n\n**VMM critical sections:** `vmm_map_page()` modifies page directory and page table entries. A partially-written PTE (PDE installed, PTE not yet written) observed by an interrupt handler that accesses the partially-mapped virtual address would page-fault. Since no interrupt handler in mod-3 or mod-2 accesses heap virtual addresses, this race cannot occur. `vmm_unmap_page()` must call `tlb_flush_page()` before the function returns — this is not a concurrency issue (single-core) but a correctness requirement.\n\n**Heap critical sections:** `kmalloc()` and `kfree()` modify the heap linked list. Same analysis as PMM: no interrupt handler in mod-2 calls `kmalloc()`/`kfree()`. No locking required. **Future risk:** If mod-4 installs an interrupt handler that calls `kmalloc()`, a lock (or `cli`/`sti`) becomes mandatory around the linked list traversal and modification.\n\n**`volatile` requirements:**\n- `frame_bitmap`: not `volatile` — it is only accessed from non-interrupt kernel code in this module. If an interrupt handler is added that checks frame availability, add `volatile`.\n- `heap_head`, `heap_end`: not `volatile` — same reasoning.\n- `boot_page_directory`, page tables: not `volatile` — modified only by setup code, read by CPU MMU hardware (which bypasses cache via its own mechanisms). The `\"memory\"` clobber in `vmm_enable_paging()`'s inline asm ensures the compiler flushes all pending stores before the CR3 write.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Synced Criteria\n\n```\n\n```\n\n\n<!-- TDD_MOD_ID: mod-4 -->\n# Technical Design Specification: Processes and Preemptive Scheduling\n\n**Module ID:** `mod-4` | **Milestone:** `build-os-m4` | **Estimated Hours:** 29–43\n\n---\n\n## 1. Module Charter\n\nThis module implements the complete process lifecycle and preemptive multitasking layer on top of the interrupt infrastructure from mod-2 and the memory subsystem from mod-3. It owns: the `process_t` PCB structure capturing full CPU state per process, per-process 4KB kernel stacks isolated from each other, an assembly context switch routine that pivots the kernel stack pointer between PCBs within the existing IRQ stub framework (no separate register save/restore — it rides the `pusha`/`popa` already present in `irq_common_stub`), the Intel TSS configured with its GDT descriptor and per-switch `ESP0` updates so ring 3→ring 0 transitions find the correct kernel stack, a round-robin preemptive scheduler triggered by the 100Hz timer IRQ, fake initial stack frame construction that makes new processes look exactly like preempted ones to `iret`, user-mode process creation with per-process page directories and ring 3 segment selectors, and the INT 0x80 system call gate implementing `sys_write` and `sys_exit`.\n\nThis module does **not** implement blocking I/O primitives, `PROCESS_BLOCKED` waiting beyond the state flag, priority scheduling, signals, ELF binary loading, `fork`/`exec`, inter-process communication, memory-mapped files, demand paging for user processes, or SMP spinlocks. The only scheduling policy is round-robin with a fixed time slice. User processes are created with a hard-coded entry function pointer; no ELF parser exists. The TSS is a single shared structure (one per kernel, not one per process — software task switching only reads `ESP0` and `SS0` from the TSS; `ltr` is issued once at boot).\n\n**Upstream dependencies:** Module `mod-1` (GDT with 5 entries; GDT must be extended to 6 entries in this module to add the TSS descriptor; `gdt_flush()` must be callable after modification); module `mod-2` (`irq_common_stub` and `irq_return_trampoline` in `irq_stubs.asm`; `idt_set_gate()` for INT 0x80; `irq_install_handler(0, ...)` to replace the timer handler; `interrupt_frame_t` layout); module `mod-3` (`pmm_alloc_frame()` for user page directories and code/stack frames; `vmm_map_page()` for user address space construction; `boot_page_directory` for kernel PDE inheritance).\n\n**Downstream dependencies:** None — this is the final milestone. The system is self-contained after this module.\n\n**Invariants that must hold at module exit:**\n1. `current_process` always points to a valid `process_t` in `PROCESS_RUNNING` state while inside `sched_schedule()` and after it returns.\n2. `tss.esp0` equals `current_process->kernel_stack_top` at all times when user-mode code could be interrupted (i.e., after every `context_switch_asm()` and before the corresponding `iret`).\n3. Every process has a distinct `kernel_stack[]` array; no two process PCBs share any byte of kernel stack memory.\n4. The saved `cpu_state_t.esp` in a preempted process's PCB points into that process's own `kernel_stack[]` array, never into another process's stack.\n5. `EFLAGS.IF = 1` in every process's initial frame (`eflags = 0x00000202`); no process starts with interrupts disabled.\n6. User-mode processes execute at CPL=3 (verified via CS selector `0x1B`); kernel pages with U/S=0 trigger page fault on user access.\n7. `sys_write` validates that the user buffer pointer is below `0xC0000000` before dereferencing; `sys_exit` transitions the process to `PROCESS_ZOMBIE` and calls `sched_schedule()`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. File Structure\n\nCreate files in this exact sequence. The assembly file (`context_switch.asm`) references C symbols declared in headers; headers must exist first.\n\n```\nbuild-os/\n└── kernel/\n    ├── include/\n    │   ├── 01  process.h          # process_t, cpu_state_t, process_state_t, MAX_PROCESSES, KERNEL_STACK_SIZE\n    │   ├── 02  tss.h              # tss_t (104-byte packed), tss_init(), tss_set_kernel_stack()\n    │   ├── 03  sched.h            # sched_init(), sched_tick(), sched_schedule(), sched_yield(), SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE\n    │   ├── 04  syscall.h          # SYS_EXIT, SYS_WRITE constants; syscall_dispatch() declaration\n    │   └── 05  user_syscall.h     # sys_write(), sys_exit() inline asm wrappers for user-mode code\n    ├── proc/\n    │   ├── 01  context_switch.asm # context_switch_asm(), irq_return_trampoline label (NASM, 32-bit)\n    │   ├── 02  process.c          # process_table[], current_process, process_create_kernel(), process_create_user()\n    │   ├── 03  tss.c              # kernel_tss, tss_init(), tss_set_kernel_stack(), gdt_install_tss()\n    │   ├── 04  sched.c            # sched_init(), sched_tick(), sched_schedule(), sched_yield()\n    │   └── 05  syscall.c          # syscall_dispatch(), sys_write_impl(), sys_exit_impl()\n    ├── user/\n    │   └── 01  user_hello.c       # user_main(): uses sys_write + sys_exit; compiled separately\n    └── kmain.c                    # Updated: sched_init(), tss_init(), INT 0x80 gate, process_create_*, idle hlt loop\n```\n\n**Why this order:** `process.h` defines `cpu_state_t` and `process_t` used by `sched.h` and `process.c`. `tss.h` is independent but `tss.c` calls `gdt_install_tss()` which modifies the GDT defined in mod-1's `gdt.c` — include `gdt.h` from mod-1. `context_switch.asm` imports `irq_return_trampoline` (defined there) and exports `context_switch_asm` (declared as `extern` in `sched.h`). `sched.c` calls `context_switch_asm()` and `tss_set_kernel_stack()`. `process.c` uses `pmm_alloc_frame()` and `vmm_map_page()` from mod-3. `syscall.c` uses `current_process` from `process.c` and `sched_schedule()` from `sched.c`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Complete Data Model\n\n### 3.1 `cpu_state_t` — Saved CPU Register State\n\nThis struct maps **exactly** onto the kernel stack contents at the moment `context_switch_asm()` saves the stack pointer.

After `ltr 0x28`, the CPU reads `esp0`/`ss0` from the memory address pointed to by the cached TSS base on every ring transition — it does not re-read the GDT. Therefore `tss_set_kernel_stack()` writes directly to `kernel_tss.esp0` and the CPU sees the new value immediately.\n\n\n![TSS Structure: Hardware Ring 3→Ring 0 Transition Fields](./diagrams/tdd-diag-28.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 3.4 GDT Extension — Entry 5 for TSS\n\nModule mod-1 defined 5 GDT entries (indices 0–4). This module adds entry index 5. The GDT array in `gdt.c` must be expanded from 5 to 6 entries, and `gdt_flush()` (which reloads GDTR) must be called after the new entry is written.\n\nThe GDT structure used in mod-1 (`gdt_entry_t` or equivalent) must support writing index 5. If the GDT array was declared `static gdt_entry_t gdt[5]`, change it to `static gdt_entry_t gdt[6]` and re-export the symbol or add `gdt_install_tss()` as a function in `gdt.c`.\n\n```c\n/* In gdt.c (mod-1 file, extended for mod-4) */\n\n/* gdt_install_tss: install a 32-bit TSS descriptor at the given GDT index.\n   base:  physical address of the tss_t structure.\n   limit: sizeof(tss_t) - 1 = 103.\n   After installation, caller must call gdt_flush() and then ltr. */\nvoid gdt_install_tss(int index, uint32_t base, uint32_t limit) {\n    gdt[index].limit_low    = (uint16_t)(limit & 0xFFFF);\n    gdt[index].base_low     = (uint16_t)(base  & 0xFFFF);\n    gdt[index].base_middle  = (uint8_t)((base  >> 16) & 0xFF);\n    gdt[index].access       = 0x89;  /* P=1, DPL=0, S=0, Type=0x9 (TSS available) */\n    gdt[index].granularity  = (uint8_t)(((limit >> 16) & 0x0F)); /* G=0, DB=0, L=0 */\n    gdt[index].base_high    = (uint8_t)((base  >> 24) & 0xFF);\n    /* Do NOT set granularity bit (G=0): limit is in bytes, not 4KB pages */\n}\n```\n\n**Critical difference from code/data descriptors:** Code/data descriptors use `granularity = 0xCF` (G=1, DB=1, plus limit high nibble). The TSS descriptor uses `granularity = 0x00` (G=0; limit is byte-exact at 103). Using `0xCF` for the TSS descriptor multiplies the limit by 4096, creating a 404KB \"TSS\" — the CPU does not fault, but subsequent access to the IOMAP region may be misinterpreted.\n\n---\n\n### 3.5 `irq_return_trampoline` and Stack Frame at First Activation\n\nWhen a brand-new process is scheduled for the first time, `context_switch_asm` executes `ret` — this pops a return address from the (fake) kernel stack. That return address must land somewhere that continues the `irq_common_stub` exit sequence: pop segment registers, `popa`, `add esp, 8`, `iret`.\n\nThe trampoline is a label placed in `context_switch.asm` immediately before the segment register restoration sequence that `irq_common_stub` would normally execute after returning from `irq_dispatcher`. Since `irq_common_stub` is in `irq_stubs.asm` (mod-2), we cannot place a label there after the fact. Instead, we define `irq_return_trampoline` in `context_switch.asm` as a self-contained exit sequence:\n\n```nasm\n; In context_switch.asm\nglobal irq_return_trampoline\n\nirq_return_trampoline:\n    ; This code executes after context_switch_asm's 'ret' pops this address.\n    ; At this point ESP points to the saved state of the NEW process:\n    ;   [esp+0]  gs    (uint32_t)\n    ;   [esp+4]  fs\n    ;   [esp+8]  es\n    ;   [esp+12] ds\n    ;   [esp+16..44] pusha regs (EDI,ESI,EBP,ESP_PUSHA,EBX,EDX,ECX,EAX)\n    ;   [esp+48] vector (dummy)\n    ;   [esp+52] error_code (dummy)\n    ;   [esp+56] EIP   (process entry point)\n    ;   [esp+60] CS    (0x08 kernel or 0x1B user)\n    ;   [esp+64] EFLAGS (0x202, IF=1)\n    ;   [esp+68] user_esp (only if ring-3 process)\n    ;   [esp+72] user_ss  (only if ring-3 process)\n\n    ; Restore segment registers\n    pop eax\n    mov ds, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov es, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov fs, ax\n    pop eax\n    mov gs, ax\n\n    popa            ; Restore EDI,ESI,EBP,(ESP ignored),EBX,EDX,ECX,EAX\n\n    add esp, 8      ; Discard vector + error_code\n\n    iret            ; Restore EIP, CS, EFLAGS [, user_esp, user_ss if ring-3]\n    ; The process now runs at its entry point with IF=1.\n```\n\n> **Why not reuse `irq_common_stub`'s exit path directly?** `irq_common_stub` calls `irq_dispatcher` and then has its exit sequence. We cannot jump into the middle of it safely (the `call irq_dispatcher` / `add esp, 4` pair would be skipped, but so would the segment register state at that point). Duplicating the exit sequence in `irq_return_trampoline` is cleaner and self-contained.

Loading `[esp+4]`, `[esp+8]`, `[esp+12]` after `mov esp, new_esp` would read from the **new** stack — which contains the next process's state, not the call arguments. The solution: load all three into registers before touching `esp`.\n\n```nasm\nglobal context_switch_asm\ncontext_switch_asm:\n    ; Step 1: Load ALL arguments into registers BEFORE modifying ESP\n    mov eax, [esp + 4]    ; EAX = old_esp_ptr (address of current proc->saved_esp)\n    mov ecx, [esp + 8]    ; ECX = new_esp     (next process's saved stack pointer)\n    mov edx, [esp + 12]   ; EDX = new_cr3     (next process's page directory physical addr)\n\n    ; Step 2: Save current kernel stack pointer into current process's PCB\n    ; ESP currently points to the return address of this call.\n    ; The full IRQ frame (pusha + segments + CPU interrupt frame) lies above on the stack.\n    ; Saving ESP here records the complete saved state's location.\n    mov [eax], esp         ; *old_esp_ptr = current esp\n\n    ; Step 3: Switch to next process's kernel stack\n    mov esp, ecx           ; ESP now points into the NEXT process's kernel stack.\n                           ; From this point: the current process is suspended.\n                           ; All subsequent stack operations affect the next process's state.\n\n    ; Step 4: Conditionally reload CR3 (only if address space changes)\n    ; Comparing prevents flushing TLB when two kernel processes share boot_page_directory.\n    mov eax, cr3\n    cmp eax, edx\n    je  .same_cr3\n    mov cr3, edx           ; Load new page directory — flushes all non-global TLB entries\n.same_cr3:\n\n    ; Step 5: Return to the next process's continuation\n    ; 'ret' pops the return address that was pushed when this function was called\n    ; FROM THE NEXT PROCESS'S PERSPECTIVE. For a process that was previously preempted,\n    ; this return address is the address inside sched_schedule() after 'call context_switch_asm'.\n    ; For a brand-new process, this is irq_return_trampoline (pushed in fake initial frame).\n    ret\n    ; After ret: execution is in sched_schedule() (for old processes) or irq_return_trampoline\n    ; (for new processes). Either path eventually executes popa + iret to resume the process.\n```\n\n**Hardware soul — the ESP pivot:** `mov esp, ecx` is a single instruction that atomically changes the CPU's active stack. No interrupt can fire between this instruction and the `ret` — the interrupt gate keeps IF=0 throughout the IRQ handler chain. Even if it could, the `ret` immediately follows: the next process's continuation is restored before any problematic state exists.\n\n\n![Round-Robin Scheduler: sched_tick() and sched_schedule() Flow](./diagrams/tdd-diag-31.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 3.8 Scheduler Data Structures\n\n```c\n/* sched.c internal state */\nstatic int sched_initialized = 0;\n\n/* Round-robin position: last index scheduled.\n   Next search starts from (last_index + 1) % MAX_PROCESSES. */\nstatic int sched_last_index = 0;\n\n/* Ticks-per-slice constant defined in process.h:\n   #define SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE 5   (5 × 10ms = 50ms) */\n```\n\n**Round-robin selection invariant:** The scheduler always searches forward from `(current_index + 1) % MAX_PROCESSES`, wrapping around. It skips slots with `state != PROCESS_READY`. If no ready process is found after a full scan (all processes blocked or zombie), it keeps `current_process` running (if it is still `PROCESS_RUNNING`). If `current_process` is zombie or blocked and no other ready process exists: fatal halt (degenerate case not reached in this module since the idle process always exists in `PROCESS_RUNNING` or `PROCESS_READY`).\n\n---\n\n### 3.9 System Call Numbers and Dispatch Table\n\n```c\n/* include/syscall.h */\n#define SYS_EXIT    1\n#define SYS_WRITE   4\n\n/* Syscall frame is the same interrupt_frame_t from mod-2.\n   EAX = syscall number; EBX = arg1; ECX = arg2; EDX = arg3.\n   Return value written to frame->eax before returning from syscall_dispatch. */\nvoid syscall_dispatch(interrupt_frame_t *frame);\n```\n\n**Argument register convention (Linux-compatible INT 0x80 ABI):**\n\n| Register | Role |\n|----------|------|\n| EAX | Syscall number |\n| EBX | First argument (fd, exit code) |\n| ECX | Second argument (buffer virtual address) |\n| EDX | Third argument (byte count) |\n| Return | EAX (written to frame->eax; restored by iret) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Interface Contracts\n\n### 4.1 `tss_init(void) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** GDT array has at least 6 slots. Protected mode active. `ldt` can be issued from ring 0.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Zero `kernel_tss` entirely: `memset(&kernel_tss, 0, sizeof(tss_t))`.\n2. Set `kernel_tss.ss0 = 0x10` (kernel data segment selector).\n3. Set `kernel_tss.esp0 = 0` — will be updated on first context switch before any ring-3 interrupt fires.\n4. Set `kernel_tss.iomap_base = sizeof(tss_t)` — sets the I/O permission bitmap to begin immediately after the TSS, which combined with the TSS limit of `sizeof(tss_t) - 1` means all I/O ports are restricted for ring-3 code. (Ring-0 code ignores IOPL when it is 0 if IOPL ≥ CPL; kernel code can always execute `in`/`out` because CPL=0.)\n5. Call `gdt_install_tss(5, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)&kernel_tss, sizeof(tss_t) - 1)`.\n6. Call `gdt_flush()` — reloads GDTR so CPU sees the new GDT entry 5.\n7. Execute `ltr 0x28` via inline assembly: `__asm__ volatile (\"ltr %0\" : : \"r\"((uint16_t)0x28))`.\n8. `kprintf(\"[TSS] Initialized. TSS at 0x%08x, selector 0x28.\\n\", &kernel_tss)`.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `TR` register contains selector `0x28`. CPU will read `kernel_tss.esp0` on every ring-3→ring-0 transition. `kernel_tss.ss0 = 0x10`.\n\n**Errors:**\n- `gdt_install_tss` with index 5 on a GDT array of size 5: out-of-bounds write. Prevention: verify GDT array size ≥ 6 before calling (static assertion or runtime check).\n- `ltr` with non-present TSS selector: `#GP`. Prevention: `gdt_flush()` before `ltr` guarantees the CPU's GDT cache is current.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 `tss_set_kernel_stack(uint32_t esp0) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** `tss_init()` has been called. `ltr` has been executed.\n\n**Behavior:** `kernel_tss.esp0 = esp0`. That is the entire function body. One 32-bit memory write.\n\n**Why only one write:** After `ltr`, the CPU caches the TSS descriptor internally. When an interrupt/exception fires while in ring 3, the CPU reads `esp0` from the physical address of `kernel_tss.esp0` directly — it uses the cached TSS base address but fetches the `esp0` field fresh from memory on each ring transition. Therefore a simple store to `kernel_tss.esp0` is sufficient and takes effect on the very next ring transition.\n\n**Timing constraint:** `tss_set_kernel_stack()` must be called BEFORE `context_switch_asm()` pivots to the new process, not after. Sequence in `sched_schedule()`:\n1. Select next process.\n2. `tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top)`.  ← BEFORE the switch\n3. `context_switch_asm(...)`.\n\n**Errors:** None. A write to a known valid address in the kernel BSS section cannot fail.\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 `process_create_kernel(const char *name, void (*entry)(void)) → process_t *`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name`: Null-terminated string ≤ 31 chars. NULL: behavior undefined (caller must not pass NULL).\n- `entry`: Function pointer to the process's entry point. Must be a valid kernel code address. NULL: process will page-fault or execute at address 0 on first activation.\n\n**Returns:** Pointer to the initialized `process_t` in `PROCESS_READY` state, or `NULL` if `process_table` is full.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Find the first slot where `process_table[i].state == PROCESS_UNUSED`. If none: return `NULL`.\n2. `memset(proc, 0, sizeof(process_t))`.\n3. `proc->pid = next_pid++` (static `uint32_t next_pid = 1`).\n4. Copy name: `for (i = 0; i < 31 && name[i]; i++) proc->name[i] = name[i]; proc->name[31] = '\\0'`.\n5. `proc->state = PROCESS_READY`.\n6. `proc->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE`.\n7. `proc->page_directory = boot_page_directory` (shared kernel page directory; extern from `vmm.c`).\n8. `proc->kernel_stack_top = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)proc->kernel_stack + KERNEL_STACK_SIZE`.\n9. Build fake initial stack frame (§3.6 kernel variant) — pushes 19 values totaling 76 bytes below `kernel_stack_top`.\n10. `proc->saved_esp = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)sp` where `sp` is the final stack pointer after all pushes.\n\n**Post-conditions:** `proc->state == PROCESS_READY`. `proc->saved_esp` points to the `gs` field of the fake frame. `proc->kernel_stack_top` is 16-byte aligned (guaranteed by `__attribute__((aligned(16)))` on `kernel_stack[]`). The scheduler's next call to `sched_schedule()` may pick this process.\n\n**Errors:** `process_table` full: return `NULL`. Caller must check for `NULL` and print a fatal message.\n\n---\n\n### 4.4 `process_create_user(const char *name, void (*entry)(void)) → process_t *`\n\n**Parameters:** Same as `process_create_kernel`. `entry` is the address of a **kernel-resident function** that will be mapped into the user address space (the function's code is copied to a user-accessible physical frame).\n\n**Returns:** Pointer to the initialized `process_t` in `PROCESS_READY` state, or `NULL` on failure.\n\n**Behavior:**\n1. Allocate a PCB slot (same as `process_create_kernel` steps 1–8, but ring-3 initial frame in step 9).\n2. **Allocate a new page directory:**\n   ```c\n   pde_t *user_pd = (pde_t *)pmm_alloc_frame();\n   if (!user_pd) { proc->state = PROCESS_UNUSED; return NULL; }\n   memset(user_pd, 0, PAGE_SIZE);\n   ```\n3. **Copy kernel PDE entries (indices 768–1023):**\n   ```c\n   extern pde_t boot_page_directory[];\n   for (int i = 768; i < 1024; i++) {\n       user_pd[i] = boot_page_directory[i];\n   }\n   ```\n   These entries point to kernel page tables with U/S=0 — user-mode access to any of these addresses triggers a page fault (protection violation, error code P=1, U=1).\n4. **Allocate and map user code frame at virtual `0x00400000`:**\n   ```c\n   void *user_code_phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\n   if (!user_code_phys) { pmm_free_frame(user_pd); proc->state = PROCESS_UNUSED; return NULL; }\n   memcpy(user_code_phys, (void *)entry, PAGE_SIZE);\n   vmm_map_page(user_pd, 0x00400000, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)user_code_phys,\n                PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_USER);\n   /* Read-only: no PAGE_WRITABLE on code page */\n   ```\n5. **Allocate and map user stack frame at virtual `0x00BFF000`:**\n   ```c\n   void *user_stack_phys = pmm_alloc_frame();\n   if (!user_stack_phys) { /* free all, return NULL */ }\n   memset(user_stack_phys, 0, PAGE_SIZE);\n   vmm_map_page(user_pd, 0x00BFF000, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)user_stack_phys,\n                PAGE_PRESENT | PAGE_WRITABLE | PAGE_USER);\n   ```\n6. `proc->page_directory = user_pd`.\n7. Build **ring-3 fake initial stack frame** (§3.6 user-mode variant):\n   - Push `user_ss = 0x23` and `user_esp = 0x00C00000` (top of the mapped stack page + 1 page).\n   - Then push `eflags = 0x202`, `cs = 0x1B`, `eip = 0x00400000`.\n   - Then the standard dummy fields, pusha fields, segment fields, trampoline address.\n8. `proc->saved_esp = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)sp`.\n\n**User address space layout:**\n\n```\nVirtual Address   Mapping             Flags          Notes\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n0x00000000 – 0x003FFFFF   (unmapped)   —             Null-pointer trap; no PDE present\n0x00400000 – 0x00400FFF   User code    P|U           Copy of 'entry' function's 4KB page\n0x00401000 – 0x00BFEFFF   (unmapped)   —             No mapping\n0x00BFF000 – 0x00BFFFFF   User stack   P|W|U         4KB stack; grows down from 0xC00000\n0x00C00000 – 0xBFFFFFFF   (unmapped)   —\n0xC0000000 – 0xC03FFFFF   Kernel code  P|W (U/S=0)   Inherited from boot_page_directory[768]\n```\n\n**Why `user_esp = 0x00C00000` (one page above the stack frame)?** The stack grows downward. `0x00C00000` is the first byte **above** the mapped stack page at `0x00BFF000`. A push from user code will first decrement ESP to `0x00BFFFFC` and then write — within the mapped page. If we set `user_esp = 0x00BFFFFF` (top of the page), the first push would write to `0x00BFFFFB` — also valid, but the conventional boundary is the address one past the allocation end.\n\n**Errors:** Any `pmm_alloc_frame()` failure: free all previously allocated frames, set `proc->state = PROCESS_UNUSED`, return `NULL`.

Called with IF=0 (either from timer IRQ handler or from `sched_yield()` which must first call `cli`).\n\n**Behavior:**\n\n```\nStep 1: Determine current process index\n  current_idx = (int)(current_process - process_table)\n\nStep 2: Transition current process state\n  If current_process->state == PROCESS_RUNNING:\n      current_process->state = PROCESS_READY\n\nStep 3: Find next ready process (round-robin)\n  next = NULL\n  For i = 1 to MAX_PROCESSES (inclusive):\n      idx = (current_idx + i) % MAX_PROCESSES\n      If process_table[idx].state == PROCESS_READY:\n          next = &process_table[idx]\n          break\n\nStep 4: If no ready process found\n  If next == NULL:\n      If current_process->state == PROCESS_READY (we just set it):\n          current_process->state = PROCESS_RUNNING  (keep running)\n          current_process->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE\n          return  (no switch; no TSS update needed)\n      Else (current is zombie or blocked):\n          kprintf(\"[SCHED] FATAL: No runnable process!\\n\"); for(;;);\n\nStep 5: Transition next process state\n  next->state = PROCESS_RUNNING\n  next->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE\n\nStep 6: Update TSS.ESP0 BEFORE context switch\n  tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top)\n\nStep 7: Perform context switch\n  context_switch_asm(\n      &current_process->saved_esp,    /* Where to save old kernel ESP */\n      next->saved_esp,                /* New kernel ESP to load        */\n      (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)next->page_directory  /* New CR3           */\n  )\n\nStep 8: Update current_process AFTER switch (executes when THIS process resumes)\n  current_process = next\n  [Actually: current_process must be updated BEFORE the context switch so that\n   the next process's timer handler finds the right current_process.\n   See note below.]\n```\n\n> **`current_process` update timing — the critical subtlety:** `context_switch_asm` suspends the current process and resumes the next. When the next process later gets preempted and `sched_timer_irq` fires, it reads `current_process` to find the currently-running process. If `current_process` still points to the **old** process at the time the **new** process runs, `sched_schedule()` would compute the wrong `current_idx` and the wrong next-process search. Therefore `current_process = next` must be set **before** `context_switch_asm()`. The correct sequence:\n\n```c\nprocess_t *old = current_process;\ncurrent_process = next;              /* Update BEFORE switch */\ntss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top);\ncontext_switch_asm(&old->saved_esp, next->saved_esp,\n                   (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)next->page_directory);\n/* When we return here: the old process is running again.\n   current_process now correctly points to 'old' — but wait,\n   we set current_process = next before switching. When this\n   process resumes, current_process should be 'old', not 'next'.\n   The fix: set current_process = old after the switch returns. */\ncurrent_process = old;               /* Restore after we resume */\n```\n\nThe correct complete pattern:\n\n```c\nvoid sched_schedule(void) {\n    process_t *old = current_process;\n    int current_idx = (int)(old - process_table);\n\n    if (old->state == PROCESS_RUNNING) old->state = PROCESS_READY;\n\n    process_t *next = NULL;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_PROCESSES; i++) {\n        int idx = (current_idx + i) % MAX_PROCESSES;\n        if (process_table[idx].state == PROCESS_READY) {\n            next = &process_table[idx];\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!next) {\n        if (old->state == PROCESS_READY) {\n            old->state = PROCESS_RUNNING;\n            old->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE;\n            return;\n        }\n        kprintf(\"[SCHED] FATAL: No runnable process!\\n\"); for(;;);\n    }\n\n    next->state = PROCESS_RUNNING;\n    next->ticks_remaining = SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE;\n\n    /* Order: current_process → tss_set_kernel_stack → context_switch_asm */\n    current_process = next;\n    tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top);\n    context_switch_asm(&old->saved_esp, next->saved_esp,\n                       (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)next->page_directory);\n    /* Resumes here when 'old' is rescheduled */\n    current_process = old;\n    old->state = PROCESS_RUNNING;\n}\n```\n\n**Why this two-assignment pattern?** When the scheduler runs process A and switches to B, it sets `current_process = B` before the switch. While B runs (for 50ms or more), `current_process == B` correctly. When B's timer fires, `sched_schedule()` picks C, sets `current_process = C`, switches. Eventually A's saved `context_switch_asm` return point executes: `current_process = old (A); A->state = RUNNING`. This correctly restores A's identity as the currently running process.\n\n---\n\n### 4.8 `sched_yield(void) → void`\n\n**Behavior:** Force an immediate context switch without waiting for the timer slice to expire. Called by voluntary cooperators (e.g., idle process, blocking wait).\n\n```c\nvoid sched_yield(void) {\n    __asm__ volatile (\"cli\");     /* Disable interrupts — sched_schedule requires IF=0 */\n    current_process->ticks_remaining = 0;\n    sched_schedule();\n    __asm__ volatile (\"sti\");     /* Re-enable; or rely on iret restoring IF from EFLAGS */\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** `sti` after `sched_schedule()` may be redundant — `iret` inside the context switch restores `EFLAGS` which includes `IF=1`. The explicit `sti` is a defensive measure.\n\n---\n\n### 4.9 `syscall_dispatch(interrupt_frame_t *frame) → void`\n\n**Pre-conditions:** Called from the INT 0x80 ISR stub via `isr_common_stub`. `frame` is a valid interrupt frame. `current_process` is not NULL. `CS` in the frame has DPL=3 (user-mode call) or DPL=0 (kernel testing). Ring-3 code reached this via the IDT_SYSCALL_GATE (DPL=3 trap gate at vector 0x80).\n\n**Behavior:**\n\n```c\nvoid syscall_dispatch(interrupt_frame_t *frame) {\n    uint32_t num  = frame->eax;\n    uint32_t arg1 = frame->ebx;\n    uint32_t arg2 = frame->ecx;\n    uint32_t arg3 = frame->edx;\n\n    switch (num) {\n    case SYS_WRITE:\n        frame->eax = sys_write_impl(arg1, (const char *)(uintptr_t)arg2, arg3);\n        break;\n    case SYS_EXIT:\n        sys_exit_impl((int)arg1);\n        /* sys_exit_impl never returns */\n        break;\n    default:\n        kprintf(\"[SYSCALL] PID %u: unknown syscall %u\\n\", current_process->pid, num);\n        frame->eax = (uint32_t)-1;   /* -ENOSYS */\n        break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Return value convention:** Written to `frame->eax`. When `isr_common_stub` executes `popa` on the way back, it restores EAX from the frame — which now contains the return value. The user code sees this in EAX after the `int 0x80` instruction.\n\n---\n\n### 4.10 `sys_write_impl(uint32_t fd, const char *buf, uint32_t count) → int32_t`\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `fd`: File descriptor. `1` = stdout (VGA), `2` = stderr (serial). Other values: return `-1` (EBADF).\n- `buf`: Virtual address in the user process's address space. May be any value.\n- `count`: Byte count.\n\n**Security validation — mandatory before any dereference:**\n\n```c\nstatic int32_t sys_write_impl(uint32_t fd, const char *buf, uint32_t count) {\n    /* Validate: buf must be in user address space (below kernel region) */\n    if ((uint32_t)(uintptr_t)buf >= 0xC0000000) {\n        kprintf(\"[SYSCALL] sys_write: buf 0x%x in kernel space — denied\\n\", buf);\n        return -1;  /* -EFAULT */\n    }\n    if (count > 0 && (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)buf + count > 0xC0000000) {\n        /* Buffer spans kernel boundary */\n        count = (uint32_t)(0xC0000000 - (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)buf);\n    }\n    if (count == 0) return 0;\n    if (fd != 1 && fd != 2) return -1;\n\n    /* At this point buf is in user space. The user's page directory is loaded\n       in CR3 (we are running in the user process's context), so the pointer\n       is accessible at its virtual address. */\n    uint32_t written = 0;\n    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n        char c = buf[i];   /* Reads from user virtual address */\n        if (fd == 1) vga_putchar(c, VGA_COLOR_WHITE, VGA_COLOR_BLACK);\n        if (fd == 2 || fd == 1) serial_putchar(c);\n        if (fd == 1 && c == '\\n') serial_putchar('\\r');\n        written++;\n    }\n    return (int32_t)written;\n}\n```\n\n**Why the range check is sufficient for this module:** The user process's page directory has U/S=0 on all kernel PTEs (inherited from `boot_page_directory` but the PTEs themselves have U/S=0). If `buf` is below `0xC0000000` and points to an unmapped user page, the `buf[i]` dereference triggers a page fault — caught by the mod-3 page fault handler, which currently halts. A production kernel would use `copy_from_user()` with fixup tables; this module uses a simple range check.\n\n---\n\n### 4.11 `sys_exit_impl(int exit_code) → void` (never returns)\n\n```c\nstatic void sys_exit_impl(int exit_code) {\n    kprintf(\"[SYSCALL] PID %u '%s' exited with code %d.\\n\",\n            current_process->pid, current_process->name, exit_code);\n\n    current_process->state = PROCESS_ZOMBIE;\n    /* Zombie processes are never scheduled again.\n       Their PCB slot remains occupied until a parent collects the exit code\n       (wait() — not implemented in this module).\n       For this module: zombie slots are leaked (finite number of processes anyway). */\n\n    sched_schedule();  /* Switch to another process; never returns to this context */\n\n    /* Unreachable: if somehow reached, halt */\n    kprintf(\"[SYSCALL] BUG: sys_exit returned!\\n\");\n    for (;;) __asm__ volatile (\"cli; hlt\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.12 INT 0x80 Gate Registration\n\nCalled from `kmain()` **after** `idt_setup_all()` (mod-2) and **after** `sched_init()`:\n\n```c\n/* In kmain.c, after idt_setup_all() and sched_init() */\n\n/* Register INT 0x80 as a user-callable trap gate */\nextern void isr128(void);   /* Defined in isr_stubs.asm (mod-2 file, needs isr128 stub added) */\nidt_set_gate(0x80, (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)isr128, 0x08, IDT_SYSCALL_GATE);\n/* IDT_SYSCALL_GATE = 0xEF: P=1, DPL=3, trap gate (IF preserved)\n   DPL=3 allows ring-3 code to invoke via 'int 0x80' without GPF.\n   Trap gate preserves IF — other interrupts can fire during syscall execution. */\n```\n\nThe `isr128` stub must be added to `isr_stubs.asm` (mod-2 file):\n\n```nasm\n; Add to isr_stubs.asm (or create a new file proc/syscall_stub.asm)\nglobal isr128\nisr128:\n    ; Trap gate: IF is NOT cleared on entry (other interrupts can fire during syscall).\n    ; No cli needed here.\n    push dword 0       ; Dummy error code\n    push dword 128     ; Vector 0x80\n    jmp isr_common_stub\n    ; isr_common_stub calls exception_handler() which dispatches to syscall_dispatch()\n    ; when frame->vector == 128.\n```\n\n**Integration with `exception_handler`:** Add to `interrupt.c`'s `exception_handler()`:\n\n```c\n/* In exception_handler(), before the \"vector < 32\" check */\nif (frame->vector == 128) {\n    syscall_dispatch(frame);\n    return;   /* Normal return; isr_common_stub restores all regs and iret */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.13 `process_exit(int exit_code) → void` (never returns)\n\nThin wrapper callable from kernel process code (not via syscall):\n\n```c\nvoid process_exit(int exit_code) {\n    sys_exit_impl(exit_code);\n    /* Never returns */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Algorithm Specification\n\n### 5.1 Idle Process Initialization — Making `kmain` Process 0\n\nThe kernel's `kmain` execution context becomes the idle process (PID 0).

The `volatile` qualifier prevents the compiler from eliminating MMIO writes as \"dead stores\" with optimization enabled.\n\n```c\n/* In process.c or kmain.c */\n\nstatic void proc_a_entry(void) {\n    uint32_t count = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        volatile uint16_t *vga = (volatile uint16_t *)0x000B8000;\n        /* Row 2, columns 0–39 */\n        const char prefix[] = \"ProcA: \";\n        for (int i = 0; prefix[i]; i++) {\n            vga[2 * 80 + i] = (uint16_t)prefix[i] | (0x0A << 8);  /* Light green */\n        }\n        /* Print count as decimal in-place (no kprintf — avoids locking issues) */\n        char num_buf[12];\n        int n = count; int pos = 0;\n        if (n == 0) { num_buf[pos++] = '0'; }\n        else { while (n > 0) { num_buf[pos++] = '0' + n % 10; n /= 10; } }\n        /* Write digits in reverse */\n        int col = 7;\n        for (int j = pos - 1; j >= 0; j--) {\n            vga[2 * 80 + col++] = (uint16_t)num_buf[j] | (0x0A << 8);\n        }\n        vga[2 * 80 + col] = (uint16_t)' ' | (0x0A << 8);\n        count++;\n        for (volatile int d = 0; d < 500000; d++);  /* Visible delay between updates */\n    }\n}\n\nstatic void proc_b_entry(void) {\n    /* Row 12, columns 0–39, cyan text (0x0B) */\n    /* Identical structure to proc_a_entry with different row and color */\n}\n\nstatic void proc_c_entry(void) {\n    /* Row 22, columns 0–39, yellow text (0x0E) */\n}\n```\n\n> **No `kprintf` inside concurrent processes:** `kprintf` writes to both VGA (shared global cursor) and serial (single UART). Concurrent writes from multiple processes with no lock produce interleaved output. The demo processes write directly to fixed VGA cell offsets — no cursor movement, no shared mutable state. This is safe for concurrent access because each process writes to a non-overlapping region of VGA memory.\n\n> **Visible delay loop:** `for (volatile int d = 0; d < 500000; d++)` burns approximately 2.5M cycles at 2GHz = ~1.25ms per iteration. With a 50ms time slice, the process does approximately 40 iterations per slice before being preempted. The counter increments are visible to a human observer: each process's counter advances at roughly 40 increments per 50ms = ~800 increments/second, making the three counters visibly independent.\n\n\n![Multi-Process VGA Demo: Concurrent Output Without Cooperation](./diagrams/tdd-diag-34.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n### 5.3 User-Mode Process Code — INT 0x80 Inline Assembly\n\nThe user-mode process code is compiled separately and its binary is copied into a user physical frame.

Order is: `idt_setup_all()` → `idt_set_gate(0x80, ...)`.\n- Idle process registration before `process_create_kernel()`: `current_process` must be non-NULL before the scheduler's timer handler fires, which happens after `sti`. We set it before `sti`.\n- `tss_set_kernel_stack()` for idle process before `sti`: the first ring-3 interrupt (if any) after `sti` must find a valid `esp0`.\n- `sti` last: nothing fires until all data structures are ready.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling Matrix\n\n| Error | Detected By | Recovery | User-Visible? |\n|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|\n| **Triple fault: TSS not initialized before first ring-3 interrupt** | CPU reads TR = 0 (or garbage); `esp0` comes from physical address 0 (IVT); interrupt frame pushed to address 0; immediate page fault; triple fault | No recovery. Prevention: `tss_init()` and `tss_set_kernel_stack()` called before `sti` and before any ring-3 process runs. Detection: `-d int` shows triple fault immediately after first user-mode interrupt. | QEMU reboot |\n| **TSS ESP0 updated AFTER context_switch_asm (wrong order)** | An interrupt fires between the stack pivot (`mov esp, ecx` in context_switch_asm) and the TSS update. The interrupt uses the old `esp0` — the old process's kernel stack. Interrupt frame pushed there. IRQ handler runs on old stack. `saved_esp` of old process is corrupted. | Silent stack corruption; manifests as wrong register values in old process on next resume. Prevention: `tss_set_kernel_stack()` BEFORE `context_switch_asm()`. Since IF=0 during this code, no interrupt can actually fire — but the invariant must still hold. | Silent corruption; eventual crash |\n| **Context switch in C (missing assembly)** | Compiler saves only callee-saved registers (EBX, ESI, EDI, EBP). EAX, ECX, EDX, EFLAGS are trashed. On resume, interrupted code has wrong values in caller-saved registers. | Silent corruption; crash when trashed register is used. Detection: test code that sets EAX to a known value before a timer tick and checks it after — EAX will be wrong. | Silent corruption |\n| **ESP pivot before argument loading in context_switch_asm** | `[esp+8]` reads from next process's stack, not current call frame. `new_esp` and `new_cr3` get garbage values. Context switch corrupts both processes. | Triple fault or wild branch. Detection: any boot with multiple processes crashes immediately. | QEMU reboot or silent corruption |\n| **`current_process` not updated before context_switch_asm** | Timer fires in new process; `sched_schedule()` reads `current_process` → still points to old process; round-robin starts from wrong index; wrong process scheduled. | Incorrect scheduling (processes run in wrong order or one process never runs). Detection: VGA counters update at uneven rates; one counter freezes. | Visible scheduling anomaly |\n| **Missing `IF=1` in initial EFLAGS (used 0x200 instead of 0x202)** | New process starts with IF=1 (bit 9 of `0x202` is correct). If EFLAGS=0x200 (no IF), IF is still set — bit 9 of 0x200 is 0. Wait: 0x200 = binary 001000000000 — bit 9 IS set. 0x00000200 = IF=1. 0x00000202 = IF=1 + reserved bit 1 (always 1 per Intel spec). Using 0x200 is functionally correct; 0x202 is pedantically correct. If 0 is used: new process runs with interrupts disabled; timer never preempts it; system freezes with one runaway process. | System freezes on first new process activation. Detection: VGA shows only one counter updating. | System freeze |\n| **User process CS = 0x08 (ring-0 selector) instead of 0x1B** | `iret` with CS=0x08 transitions to ring 0 — no privilege crossing, no SS/ESP pop. Process runs in ring 0 with user code. A write to kernel memory succeeds — no isolation. | Security hole; no crash unless user code deliberately corrupts kernel. Detection: user code can read kernel memory without page fault. | Security violation; no visible error |\n| **User process CS = 0x1B but SS = 0x10 (kernel data)** | `iret` pops the ring-3 SS/ESP pair — but SS=0x10 has DPL=0, not DPL=3. CPU checks SS.DPL matches CS.DPL on ring change — mismatch causes GPF. | GPF on first activation of user process. Detection: `v=0d e=0010` in `-d int` log (error code `0x0010` = selector `0x10` caused the fault). | GPF printed by exception handler |\n| **Shared kernel stack: process B's syscall corrupts process A** | Both A and B use the same physical stack memory. B's IRQ frame overwrites A's saved state. | Silent corruption of A's registers; crash when A resumes. Prevention: each `process_t` has its own `kernel_stack[]` array embedded in the PCB (4096 bytes per PCB). | Silent corruption; eventual crash |\n| **TLB not flushed on CR3 change (skipping conditional in context_switch_asm)** | Old process's address translations cached in TLB. New process accesses a virtual address that maps to a different physical frame in its page directory — but TLB serves the old mapping. New process reads/writes old process's data. | Silent security violation and data corruption. Prevention: `cmp eax, edx; je .same_cr3; mov cr3, edx` in context_switch_asm. If two processes share `boot_page_directory`, the comparison correctly skips the unnecessary flush. | Silent cross-process data corruption |\n| **User buffer validated by range check only; buf points to unmapped user page** | `buf[i]` dereference in `sys_write_impl` triggers page fault. Current page fault handler halts the kernel. | System halt — entire kernel stops. For this module: acceptable (no demand paging). Production: use `copy_from_user` with fixup. | Kernel halt (all processes stop) |\n| **`irq_return_trampoline` segment register pop order wrong** | Trampoline pops gs, fs, es, ds in that order, but fake frame was built with ds at lowest address. CPU loads wrong values into each segment register. GPF on next segment-register-qualified access. | GPF immediately after first trampoline execution. Detection: `-d int` shows `v=0d` after first context switch. | GPF |\n| **`ltr` before `gdt_flush()`** | CPU's cached GDT still has 5 entries; entry 5 is not yet visible. `ltr 0x28` either faults (selector beyond limit) or reads stale data. | GPF (`#GP`) on `ltr` instruction. Detection: `-d int` shows `v=0d e=0028` (selector 0x28 caused fault). | GPF |\n| **`process_create_user` does not mark user_pd frame used in PMM** | PMM allocates the same frame again later. Code writes to the frame, corrupting the page directory. | Address translation goes to wrong physical addresses; data corruption or page fault. Prevention: `vmm_map_page` internally does NOT mark the page directory frame used (that frame was allocated by `pmm_alloc_frame` which marks it used automatically). This error cannot occur if `pmm_alloc_frame` is used correctly. | Silent corruption |\n| **proc_a/b/c use `kprintf` concurrently** | VGA cursor state corrupted by concurrent writes; serial output interleaved. | Garbled VGA text; no crash. Prevention: demo processes write to fixed VGA cell offsets, never call `kprintf`. | Garbled output |\n| **`sys_exit` calls `sched_schedule` with zombie state, no ready process** | If all processes exited, `sched_schedule` finds no ready process and calls fatal halt. | Fatal halt — intended behavior when all work is done. The idle process (PID 0) is always READY or RUNNING, so this halt should never occur in the demo. | `kprintf` fatal message |\n| **`add esp, 8` missing after `popa` in `irq_return_trampoline`** | ESP points 8 bytes too low when `iret` executes. `iret` pops wrong values for EIP, CS, EFLAGS. | Triple fault or branch to random address. | QEMU reboot |\n| **Double-free: `process_create_user` fails mid-way, partial cleanup** | First `pmm_alloc_frame()` succeeds, second fails, first frame is freed. If first frame was frame F, freeing it decrements the used count. Later `pmm_alloc_frame()` may return F again. | Potential double-use of frame F. Prevention: full cleanup path in error handling frees exactly the frames that were successfully allocated. | Silent frame reuse |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Implementation Sequence with Checkpoints\n\n### Phase 1 — PCB and `cpu_state_t` Structs (2–3 hours)\n\nCreate `include/process.h` with `cpu_state_t`, `process_state_t`, `process_t`, `MAX_PROCESSES`, `KERNEL_STACK_SIZE`, `SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE`. Add all static assertions from §3.1.\n\nCreate a stub `proc/process.c` that declares `process_t process_table[MAX_PROCESSES]` and `process_t *current_process = NULL` in BSS/data. Stub out `process_create_kernel` and `process_create_user` as `return NULL`.\n\n**Checkpoint 1:** `i686-elf-gcc -m32 -ffreestanding -nostdinc -c proc/process.c -o process.o`. Zero errors and zero warnings. All static assertions in `process.c` compile cleanly (none trigger — verifying field offsets). Run `objdump -t process.o | grep process_table` — symbol in BSS, size = `16 * 4152 = 66432`. Verify: `size = 16 * sizeof(process_t)`. Use `sizeof(process_t)` from a test program to confirm it matches expectations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 — TSS, GDT Extension, `ltr` (3–4 hours)\n\nExtend `gdt.c` (mod-1 file) to support 6 entries. Add `gdt_install_tss(int index, uint32_t base, uint32_t limit)`. Verify `gdt_flush()` is callable (not static).\n\nCreate `include/tss.h` and `proc/tss.c`. Implement `tss_init()` (Steps 1–8 from §4.1) and `tss_set_kernel_stack()`.\n\nAdd `tss_init()` call in `kmain()` (temporarily, with `sti` still not present). Add `kprintf(\"[TSS] TR=0x28, esp0=0x%x, ss0=0x%x\\n\", kernel_tss.esp0, kernel_tss.ss0)` immediately after `tss_init()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 2:** Boot. Expected output includes `\"[TSS] Initialized. TSS at 0x...\"` and `\"TR=0x28, esp0=0x00000000, ss0=0x00000010\"`. Use QEMU monitor (`Ctrl+Alt+2`): `info registers` — verify TR = `0x0028`. Also verify: `str 0x28` in the monitor output. If GPF from `ltr`: GDTR limit was too small (GDT had only 5 entries); check that `gdt_flush()` was called after `gdt_install_tss()`. Use `-d int` to see `v=0d e=0028` for this failure.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3 — `context_switch_asm` and `irq_return_trampoline` (4–6 hours)\n\nCreate `proc/context_switch.asm`. Implement `context_switch_asm` (§3.7 exact code) and `irq_return_trampoline` (§3.5 exact code). Export both with `global`.\n\nAdd the `isr128` stub to `interrupts/isr_stubs.asm` (or a new `proc/syscall_stub.asm`).\n\n**Unit test without scheduler:** Manually construct a fake stack frame in `kmain()` and call `context_switch_asm` to jump to a simple function:\n\n```c\n/* Test in kmain() — temporary, remove after verification */\nstatic uint8_t test_stack[4096] __attribute__((aligned(16)));\nuint32_t test_stack_top = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)test_stack + 4096;\n\nstatic void test_func(void) {\n    kprintf(\"[CTX] test_func reached! Context switch works.\\n\");\n    /* Infinite loop — do not return */\n    while(1) __asm__ volatile (\"hlt\");\n}\n\n/* Build fake frame */\nuint32_t *sp = (uint32_t *)(uintptr_t)test_stack_top;\nextern pde_t boot_page_directory[];\nextern void irq_return_trampoline(void);\n*--sp = 0x00000202;   /* eflags */\n*--sp = 0x00000008;   /* cs */\n*--sp = (uint32_t)test_func;  /* eip */\n*--sp = 0; *--sp = 0;  /* error_code, vector */\n*--sp = 0; *--sp = 0; *--sp = 0; *--sp = 0;  /* eax..edx */\n*--sp = 0; *--sp = 0; *--sp = 0; *--sp = 0;  /* esp_pusha, ebp, esi, edi */\n*--sp = 0x10; *--sp = 0x10; *--sp = 0x10; *--sp = 0x10;  /* ds,es,fs,gs */\n*--sp = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)irq_return_trampoline;\nuint32_t test_esp = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)sp;\n\nuint32_t dummy_saved_esp;\ncontext_switch_asm(&dummy_saved_esp, test_esp,\n                   (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)boot_page_directory);\n/* Never returns */\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 3:** Boot. Expected output: `\"[CTX] test_func reached! Context switch works.\"`. Then system halts at the `hlt`. If QEMU reboots: wrong fake frame layout — check field order against §3.6. Use `-d int 2>log`: look for `v=0d` (GPF from bad segment) or `v=0e` (page fault from wrong EIP). If `\"test_func reached\"` appears but then immediately triple-faults: `test_func` itself has a bug (check function pointer cast).\n\nRemove the test before Phase 4.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4 — Fake Initial Stack Frame Construction (3–5 hours)\n\nImplement `process_create_kernel()` fully (§4.3) including the fake initial frame construction from §3.6.\n\nAdd compile-time assertions for frame layout into `process.c`:\n\n```c\n/* Verify that the fake frame construction pushes exactly the right number of bytes */\n/* A kernel process frame: 1 (trampoline) + 4 (segs) + 8 (pusha) + 2 (stub) + 3 (cpu-pushed) = 18 words = 72 bytes */\n/* saved_esp = kernel_stack_top - 72 */\n/* This is architecture-verified by the trampoline working correctly in Phase 3. */\n```\n\n**Checkpoint 4:** Create two kernel processes and the idle process. Enable `sti` temporarily (no `tss_set_kernel_stack` update yet — keep TSS pointing to idle's stack for now). Verify that when the first timer tick fires, `sched_tick` increments the counter (stub out `sched_schedule` to just return). Later, implement a minimal `sched_schedule` that does one unconditional switch to `process_table[1]`. Verify that `test_func` (from process_table[1]) runs.\n\n**Checkpoint 4 exact test:**\n\n```c\n/* Minimal sched_schedule stub */\nvoid sched_schedule(void) {\n    static int switched = 0;\n    if (switched) return;\n    switched = 1;\n    process_t *next = &process_table[1];  /* Process A */\n    next->state = PROCESS_RUNNING;\n    tss_set_kernel_stack(next->kernel_stack_top);\n    process_t *old = current_process;\n    current_process = next;\n    context_switch_asm(&old->saved_esp, next->saved_esp,\n                       (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)next->page_directory);\n    current_process = old;\n}\n```\n\nProcess A's entry function: `kprintf(\"Process A activated!\\n\"); while(1) __asm__ volatile (\"hlt\");`\n\nExpected: After `sti`, timer fires, `sched_schedule` switches to process A, `\"Process A activated!\"` appears. System then halts (process A's `hlt` loop) — subsequent timer ticks have `switched=1` so no further switches.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5 — `process_create_kernel()` Finalized (2–3 hours)\n\nNo new implementation needed — Phase 4 completed this. This phase focuses on testing all three kernel processes simultaneously with the partial scheduler.\n\nAdd `proc_a_entry`, `proc_b_entry`, `proc_c_entry` functions. Verify that each writes to a distinct VGA row. Test with a scheduler that cycles: idle → A → B → C → idle → ...\n\n**Checkpoint 5:** Three VGA rows (2, 12, 22) show independent counters, each in a different color. The idle row shows nothing (or a static message). Counters update at approximately equal rates (equal time slices). The system runs stably for ≥ 30 seconds without crash.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6 — Full Round-Robin Scheduler (3–4 hours)\n\nImplement `sched_init()`, `sched_tick()` (`sched_timer_irq`), and the complete `sched_schedule()` from §4.7 with the two-assignment `current_process` pattern.\n\nReplace the stub scheduler from Phase 4 with the real implementation. Remove all test stubs.\n\n**Checkpoint 6:** The complete scheduler runs. Verify:\n- Counter at row 2 (Process A) updates approximately every 50ms (one time slice).\n- Counter at row 12 (Process B) and row 22 (Process C) update at the same rate.\n- No VGA corruption (each process writes only to its own row).\n- System runs stably for ≥ 5 minutes without crash, reboot, or display corruption.\n- `kprintf` output from initialization still visible at the top of the screen (rows 0–1).\n\nRun: `qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio -d int 2>int.log`. Verify in `int.log`: `v=20` (IRQ0) appears at ~10ms intervals; no `v=00`–`v=1F` (exceptions) appear after initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 7 — Three-Process VGA Demo Validation (2–3 hours)\n\nThis phase polishes the demo: ensure all VGA writes use `volatile`, clear unused columns after each number write, add visual separators, and ensure the output is human-readable.\n\n**Checkpoint 7:** Record 60 seconds of serial output. Verify:\n- `\"[M4] Preemptive scheduling active.\"` visible.\n- No exception messages in serial output.\n- Timer count (can be printed occasionally from idle process) advances at ~100/sec.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 8 — `process_create_user()` and Ring-3 Isolation (4–6 hours)\n\nImplement `process_create_user()` fully (§4.4). Embed `user_hello.bin` in the kernel image (Makefile rule in §5.3). Compile `user/user_hello.c` as a separate binary.\n\n**Checkpoint 8a — Ring-3 activation:** Add `process_create_user()` call in `kmain()`. Verify that the user process runs (serial shows `\"Hello from ring 3!\"` five times). Verify `sys_exit` works (process becomes zombie after 5 iterations, no crash).\n\n**Checkpoint 8b — Ring-3 isolation:** Temporarily add this to `user_main()` before `u_exit()`:\n\n```c\n/* Attempt to read kernel memory — should trigger page fault */\nvolatile uint32_t *kernel_ptr = (volatile uint32_t *)0xC0000000;\nuint32_t val = *kernel_ptr;   /* Must trigger page fault */\n(void)val;\n```\n\nExpected: Page fault handler fires with `\"U=1\"` (user mode) and `\"CR2: 0xc0000000\"`. Kernel halts. QEMU does NOT proceed with the read; the user process cannot access kernel memory.\n\nRemove the isolation test code from `user_hello.c` after verification.\n\n**Checkpoint 8c — CS selector verification:** Add to `kmain()` after `process_create_user()`:\n\n```c\n/* Read CS value from user process's fake initial frame */\nuint32_t *fake_frame = (uint32_t *)(uintptr_t)pu->saved_esp;\nuint32_t frame_cs = fake_frame[60 / 4];  /* cs field at offset 60 from top */\nkprintf(\"[M4] User process initial CS = 0x%04x (expect 0x001B)\\n\", frame_cs);\n```\n\nExpected: `\"CS = 0x001b\"`. If `0x0008`: ring-3 selector not set correctly in fake frame.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 9 — INT 0x80 Syscall Gate and `sys_write`/`sys_exit` (3–4 hours)\n\nCreate `include/syscall.h`, `proc/syscall.c`. Add `isr128` stub to `interrupts/isr_stubs.asm`. Register gate in `kmain()`. Add dispatch in `exception_handler()`.\n\nImplement `syscall_dispatch()`, `sys_write_impl()`, `sys_exit_impl()`.\n\n**Checkpoint 9a — Syscall from kernel:** Test `int 0x80` from kernel-mode code (CPL=0):\n\n```c\n/* Temporary test in kmain() */\n__asm__ volatile (\n    \"mov $4, %%eax\\n\"\n    \"mov $1, %%ebx\\n\"\n    \"mov %0, %%ecx\\n\"\n    \"mov $13, %%edx\\n\"\n    \"int $0x80\"\n    :\n    : \"r\"((uint32_t)(uintptr_t)\"syscall test\\n\")\n    : \"eax\", \"ebx\", \"ecx\", \"edx\"\n);\n```\n\nExpected: `\"syscall test\"` appears on VGA and serial. No GPF.\n\n**Checkpoint 9b — `sys_write` from user process:** `user_hello.c` already calls `u_write(1, msg, 19)`. After INT 0x80 from ring 3: `\"Hello from ring 3!\"` appears 5 times. After `u_exit(0)`: `\"[SYSCALL] PID X 'user_hello' exited with code 0.\"` appears.\n\n**Checkpoint 9c — `sys_write` kernel pointer rejection:** Test with `buf = 0xC0001234`:\n\n```c\n/* Temporarily in user_hello.c or as a direct syscall test */\nu_write(1, (const char *)0xC0001234, 10);\n/* Expected return value: -1 (kernel prints denial message) */\n```\n\nExpected: `\"sys_write: buf 0xc0001234 in kernel space — denied\"` on serial. Return value -1. No kernel memory access.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 10 — Integration and Final Acceptance (3–5 hours)\n\nWire all components together in final `kmain()` (§5.4). Remove all temporary test code. Verify the complete system.\n\n**Checkpoint 10 (Final Acceptance Test):**\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nAll of the following must be verified simultaneously:\n\n1. VGA rows 2, 12, 22 show three independent counters in different colors, incrementing at approximately equal rates.\n2. Serial output shows `\"Hello from ring 3!\"` five times from the user process (within the first 2 seconds).\n3. Serial output shows `\"PID X 'user_hello' exited with code 0.\"`.\n4. After user process exit, the three kernel counters continue running uninterrupted.\n5. System runs stably for 5 minutes with no crash.\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio -d int 2>int.log\ngrep \"v=0[0-9a-f] \" int.log | grep -v \"v=20 \" | head -20\n```\n\nExpected: Only `v=20` (IRQ0 timer) appears in the first 20 interrupt-related entries after initialization. No `v=00`–`v=1F` (CPU exceptions). No `v=08` (double fault).\n\n```bash\nqemu-system-i386 -s -S -drive format=raw,file=os.img -serial stdio &\ngdb kernel.elf -ex \"target remote :1234\" -ex \"break sched_schedule\" -ex \"continue\"\n# At breakpoint: inspect current_process, next process's saved_esp, TSS esp0\n(gdb) print *current_process\n(gdb) print kernel_tss.esp0\n(gdb) print next->saved_esp\n(gdb) x/20x next->saved_esp\n```\n\nVerify GDB output: `kernel_tss.esp0` matches `next->kernel_stack_top` (set by `tss_set_kernel_stack` just before the breakpoint). The 20 words at `next->saved_esp` show: trampoline address at lowest, then `gs=0x10`, `fs=0x10`, `es=0x10`, `ds=0x10`, zero-filled GPRs, vector=0, error_code=0, `eip=entry_func`, `cs=0x08 or 0x1B`, `eflags=0x202`.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Test Specification\n\n### 8.1 Process Control Block Tests\n\n**T-PCB-1: `cpu_state_t` field offsets (static assertions)**\n- All offsets from §3.1 verified at compile time by `_Static_assert`. Build failure = wrong layout.\n\n**T-PCB-2: `process_t` size and PCB table size**\n- `_Static_assert(sizeof(process_t) >= 4096 + 56, \"PCB must include full kernel stack\")`.\n- `_Static_assert(sizeof(process_table) == MAX_PROCESSES * sizeof(process_t), ...)`.\n\n**T-PCB-3: `kernel_stack_top` alignment**\n- After `process_create_kernel()`: `proc->kernel_stack_top % 16 == 0` (16-byte aligned per ABI).\n- Verified by: `kprintf(\"stack_top %% 16 = %u\\n\", proc->kernel_stack_top % 16)`. Must print `0`.\n\n**T-PCB-4: `kernel_stack_top` = `kernel_stack` + `KERNEL_STACK_SIZE`**\n- After creation: `proc->kernel_stack_top == (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)proc->kernel_stack + 4096`.\n\n**T-PCB-5: Distinct kernel stacks for each process**\n- Create 4 processes. Verify no two `kernel_stack[]` arrays overlap: for all pairs (i, j): `process_table[i].kernel_stack + 4096 <= process_table[j].kernel_stack` or vice versa. Since they are embedded in an array with no aliasing, this holds automatically — but verify by comparing addresses.\n\n**T-PCB-6: `saved_esp` within kernel stack bounds**\n- After `process_create_kernel()`: `proc->saved_esp >= (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)proc->kernel_stack` and `proc->saved_esp < proc->kernel_stack_top`. Print both values to verify.\n\n---\n\n### 8.2 TSS Tests\n\n**T-TSS-1: TSS size exactly 104 bytes**\n- `_Static_assert(sizeof(tss_t) == 104, ...)` — compile-time verified.\n\n**T-TSS-2: TSS `ss0` = `0x10` after `tss_init()`**\n- `kprintf(\"ss0=0x%x\\n\", kernel_tss.ss0)` → `\"ss0=0x10\"`.\n\n**T-TSS-3: TSS `iomap_base` = `sizeof(tss_t)` = 104**\n- `kprintf(\"iomap=0x%x\\n\", kernel_tss.iomap_base)` → `\"iomap=0x68\"` (104 = 0x68).\n\n**T-TSS-4: TR register contains `0x28` after `tss_init()`**\n- Read TR: `uint16_t tr; __asm__ volatile (\"str %0\" : \"=r\"(tr)); kprintf(\"TR=0x%04x\\n\", tr)` → `\"TR=0x0028\"`.\n\n**T-TSS-5: GDT entry 5 has access byte `0x89`**\n- Read GDT entry 5 byte 5: `uint8_t access = ((uint8_t*)gdt)[5*8+5]; kprintf(\"GDT[5] access=0x%02x\\n\", access)` → `\"GDT[5] access=0x89\"`.\n\n**T-TSS-6: `tss_set_kernel_stack()` updates `esp0` immediately**\n- `tss_set_kernel_stack(0xDEAD1000); kprintf(\"esp0=0x%x\\n\", kernel_tss.esp0)` → `\"esp0=0xdead1000\"`. Then restore: `tss_set_kernel_stack(current_process->kernel_stack_top)`.\n\n**T-TSS-7: `esp0` contains correct value before ring-3 process runs**\n- After `process_create_user()` and before `sti`: read `kernel_tss.esp0`. Must equal `current_process->kernel_stack_top` (idle process's stack top, since TSS was set for idle). After first context switch to user process: `kernel_tss.esp0` must equal `pu->kernel_stack_top`.\n\n---\n\n### 8.3 Context Switch Tests\n\n**T-CTX-1: `context_switch_asm` saves old ESP**\n- Create process A. Before switch: record `process_table[0].saved_esp` (should be 0, BSS-init). After switch to A and A running for one slice: during next switch back to idle, `process_table[0].saved_esp` must be a valid address in `process_table[0].kernel_stack`.\n\n**T-CTX-2: `context_switch_asm` loads new ESP**\n- Before switch to process A: record `pa->saved_esp`. Verify (via GDB breakpoint in context_switch_asm) that `mov esp, ecx` loads exactly this value.\n\n**T-CTX-3: CR3 reloaded on address space change**\n- Create a user process with a different page directory. Set breakpoint at `.same_cr3` label in context_switch_asm. When switching idle (boot_pd) → user process (user_pd): verify `jne` is taken (CR3 is different). When switching kernel A → kernel B (same boot_pd): verify `je` is taken.\n\n**T-CTX-4: All registers preserved across context switch**\n- In `proc_a_entry()`: set EBX, ESI, EDI to known values via inline asm: `__asm__ volatile (\"mov $0xAAAA0001, %%ebx; mov $0xBBBB0001, %%esi\" ::: \"ebx\",\"esi\")`. Busy-loop for 2 seconds (several context switches). Read EBX and ESI: must still be `0xAAAA0001` and `0xBBBB0001`. Failure = register clobbering.\n\n**T-CTX-5: EFLAGS IF bit preserved after context switch**\n- After several context switches: `uint32_t flags; __asm__ volatile (\"pushf; pop %0\" : \"=r\"(flags)); kprintf(\"IF=%d\\n\", (flags >> 9) & 1)` from a process function. Must print `\"IF=1\"`.\n\n**T-CTX-6: `irq_return_trampoline` segment register restoration**\n- After first activation of a new process: the process function reads DS, ES, FS, GS and verifies they are all `0x10` (kernel data). `uint16_t ds; __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%ds, %0\" : \"=r\"(ds)); kprintf(\"DS=0x%04x\\n\", ds)` → `\"DS=0x0010\"`.\n\n---\n\n### 8.4 Scheduler Tests\n\n**T-SCHED-1: Round-robin cycles through all READY processes**\n- Create 3 processes. Log which process runs in each timer tick for 20 ticks. Expected pattern: approximately `A, B, C, A, B, C, ...` (with 5-tick slices: `A×5, B×5, C×5, A×5, ...`).\n\n**T-SCHED-2: ZOMBIE processes skipped**\n- Call `sys_exit_impl(0)` from process B. Verify subsequent scheduling cycles never invoke B's entry function.\n\n**T-SCHED-3: No-ready-process: keep current running**\n- Mark all processes except current as ZOMBIE or BLOCKED. `sched_schedule()` must return without switching (current keeps running, slice reset).\n\n**T-SCHED-4: Time slice respected**\n- Record `pit_tick_count` when a process starts running. Record when it is preempted. Difference must equal `SCHEDULER_TICKS_PER_SLICE` (= 5, ±1 for interrupt timing).\n\n**T-SCHED-5: `current_process` correct after switch**\n- In process A's function: print `current_process->pid`. Must print A's PID. In process B: must print B's PID. Never prints the other process's PID.\n\n**T-SCHED-6: TSS `esp0` updated before each context switch**\n- GDB breakpoint in `tss_set_kernel_stack()`. At each breakpoint: verify the argument equals `next->kernel_stack_top` where `next` is the process about to be scheduled.\n\n---\n\n### 8.5 User-Mode Process Tests\n\n**T-USER-1: User process executes at CPL=3**\n- In `user_main()`, read CS: `uint16_t cs; __asm__ volatile (\"mov %%cs, %0\" : \"=r\"(cs)); u_write(1, \"CS=?\\n\", 5)` (manually encode the CS value as a digit). CS must have bits [1:0] = `11` (RPL=3). CS = `0x1B` = `00011011` binary: bits [1:0] = `11`. ✓\n\n**T-USER-2: User stack is accessible**\n- In `user_main()`, allocate a local variable (`int x = 42`), read it back, verify via `u_write`. The stack read succeeds — proves user stack is mapped.\n\n**T-USER-3: Kernel memory access triggers page fault**\n- Access `0xC0000000` from user code. Page fault fires with U=1. System halts (as per mod-3 page fault handler). `-d int` shows `v=0e e=0005` (P=1, U=1, W=0 → error code = `0b101 = 5`). Wait: `0xC0000000` kernel PDE has U/S=0; error code P=1 (page present, protection violation), W=0 (read), U=1 (user) = `0b101 = 5`. Correct.\n\n**T-USER-4: User code page is read-only**\n- From `user_main()`, attempt to write to `0x00400000` (its own code page): `*(volatile uint32_t *)0x00400000 = 0xDEAD`. Page fault fires with W=1 (write violation). Error code: P=1, W=1, U=1 = `0b111 = 7`.\n\n**T-USER-5: User page directory kernel PDEs are supervisor-only**\n- Inspect `user_pd[768]` (kernel higher-half PDE) after `process_create_user()`: `user_pd[768] & PAGE_USER == 0` (U/S flag clear). Verify: `kprintf(\"user_pd[768] U/S = %d\\n\", (user_pd[768] >> 2) & 1)` → `\"0\"`.\n\n**T-USER-6: Multiple user processes can run concurrently**\n- Create 2 user processes. Both run independently, both print `\"Hello from ring 3!\"`, both call `sys_exit`. No interference.\n\n---\n\n### 8.6 System Call Tests\n\n**T-SYSCALL-1: `int 0x80` from ring-0 does not GPF**\n- Execute `int 0x80` with EAX=4 (sys_write), EBX=1, ECX=string address, EDX=count from kernel code. Verify no GPF (DPL=3 trap gate allows lower-privilege invocation — ring-0 can always invoke DPL-3 gates since CPL ≤ DPL is checked only for DPL < CPL scenarios). Actually: for software interrupts via `int`, the check is CPL ≤ gate.DPL. CPL=0 ≤ DPL=3 — this holds. `int 0x80` from ring-0 is allowed and does not cause a privilege transition (no SS/ESP push since CS.DPL == IDT gate.DPL is not what the CPU checks — it checks whether CPL ≤ gate.DPL).\n\n**T-SYSCALL-2: `sys_write(1, buf, n)` writes to VGA and serial**\n- Call via `int 0x80` from user process with `fd=1`, valid buf, count=5. VGA and serial show the 5 bytes. Return value in EAX = 5.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-3: `sys_write(2, buf, n)` writes to serial only**\n- `fd=2`: serial shows bytes; VGA cursor does not advance. Return value = count.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-4: `sys_write` with invalid fd returns -1**\n- `fd=99`: return value in EAX = `0xFFFFFFFF` (-1 in two's complement). No write occurs.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-5: `sys_write` with kernel buffer pointer denied**\n- `buf = 0xC0001234`: return value = -1. `\"denied\"` message on serial. No kernel memory read via user-provided pointer.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-6: `sys_write` buffer spanning kernel boundary clamped**\n- `buf = 0xBFFFFFFC`, `count = 10`: only `0xBFFFFFFC` to `0xBFFFFFFF` (4 bytes) are written (clamped to `0xC0000000 - 0xBFFFFFFC = 4`). Return value = 4.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-7: `sys_exit` transitions to ZOMBIE**\n- After `sys_exit(42)`: `current_process->state == PROCESS_ZOMBIE` (check from a GDB breakpoint or by observing the `\"exited with code 42\"` message). The process is never scheduled again.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-8: Unknown syscall number returns -ENOSYS**\n- `EAX = 999` (invalid): return value = `0xFFFFFFFF`. `\"unknown syscall 999\"` on serial.\n\n**T-SYSCALL-9: Return value accessible in EAX after `int 0x80`**\n- `u_write(1, msg, 5)` stores the return value in EAX per inline asm `\"=a\"(ret)`. Verify `ret == 5` by printing it.\n\n---\n\n### 8.7 Integration Tests\n\n**T-INT-1: Three kernel processes + one user process run concurrently**\n- System runs with all 4 processes for 60 seconds. No crash, reboot, or freeze. VGA rows 2, 12, 22 show incrementing counters. Serial shows \"Hello from ring 3!\" 5 times. System continues after user process exits.\n\n**T-INT-2: Interrupt frequency preserved under scheduling load**\n- `pit_tick_count` after 10 seconds must be within ±1% of 1000 (100Hz × 10s). Context switching does not add extra timer ticks or lose ticks.\n\n**T-INT-3: No exception vectors 0-31 fire during steady-state operation**\n- Run for 60 seconds with `-d int`. Filter `int.log` for `v=0` through `v=1f`. Only `v=20` (IRQ0) and `v=21` (IRQ1, keyboard) should appear. Zero CPU exceptions.\n\n**T-INT-4: Serial output after 60 seconds of operation**\n- `qemu-system-i386 ... -serial stdio | tee output.txt`. After 60s: `grep \"Exception\" output.txt` — zero matches. `grep \"BUG\" output.txt` — zero matches. `grep \"FATAL\" output.txt` — zero matches.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Performance Targets\n\n| Operation | Target | How to Measure |\n|-----------|--------|----------------|\n| **Full context switch latency (IRQ assert → resumed process first instruction)** | 700–1000 cycles (~350–500ns at 2GHz) | `rdtsc` at end of resumed process's entry; subtract `rdtsc` captured just before `iret` in trampoline |\n| **`context_switch_asm()` body execution (EAX load through `ret`)** | < 15 cycles | `rdtsc` before and after the 7 instructions in the function body |\n| **`sched_tick()` common path (no switch, slice not expired)** | < 20 cycles | `rdtsc` in `sched_timer_irq` around the fast path (decrement + compare + return) |\n| **`sched_schedule()` full path including switch** | < 200 cycles (excludes memory latency for cold stacks) | `rdtsc` at entry and immediately after `context_switch_asm` returns (in old process's resumed execution) |\n| **`tss_set_kernel_stack()` single write** | < 5 cycles (L1 cache hit — TSS is hot) | `rdtsc` around `kernel_tss.esp0 = esp0` |\n| **CR3 reload (new address space)** | < 40 cycles + cold TLB miss cost | `rdtsc` around `mov cr3, edx` in context_switch_asm; note first TLB miss adds ~30–50 cycles |\n| **Per-process kernel stack cold read (popa + iret after first activation)** | 200–400 ns | Implicit in context switch latency; dominated by DRAM access for cold stack |\n| **INT 0x80 round-trip (user `int 0x80` → kernel handler → `iret` back)** | ~500 cycles | `rdtsc` in user code before `int 0x80`; `rdtsc` after; account for 5 CPU-pushed values × ~5 cycles each |\n| **`sys_write` for 20 bytes to VGA** | < 5µs (20 × VGA MMIO write ~200ns each) | `rdtsc` around `sys_write_impl` body |\n| **`sys_exit` (state change + `sched_schedule()`)** | < 500 cycles | `rdtsc` at entry of `sys_exit_impl`; not measured after because process never resumes |\n| **`process_create_kernel()` including fake frame construction** | < 1000 cycles | `rdtsc` around complete function; dominated by stack push loop |\n| **`process_create_user()` including page directory setup** | < 10µs (3× `pmm_alloc_frame` + 2× `vmm_map_page` + `memcpy` 4KB) | `rdtsc` around function; DRAM accesses dominate |\n| **Round-robin search across 16 processes** | < 100 cycles (16 state comparisons in cache) | `rdtsc` around the for-loop in `sched_schedule()` |\n\n**Measurement infrastructure:**\n\n```c\n/* Add to kmain temporarily to benchmark context switch */\nstatic uint64_t switch_t0 = 0;\n\n/* In sched_schedule(), just before context_switch_asm(): */\nswitch_t0 = rdtsc();\n\n/* In the first line of proc_a_entry(): */\nuint64_t t1 = rdtsc();\nkprintf(\"[PERF] Context switch: %u cycles\\n\", (uint32_t)(t1 - switch_t0));\n```\n\n---\n\n## 10. Hardware Soul Analysis\n\n### The Stack Pivot — One Instruction That Changes Everything\n\n`mov esp, ecx` in `context_switch_asm` is the single instruction that transitions between processes. Before it: every stack operation goes to the current process's kernel stack. After it: every stack operation goes to the next process's kernel stack. The instruction is not atomic in the OS sense — it is a single memory write (ESP is a register; the write is to the register file, not RAM). But the x86 pipeline sees it as a register write that takes effect immediately for all subsequent `[esp+N]` addressing.\n\n**TLB implications of the stack pivot:** The new ESP points into a different physical page (the next process's `kernel_stack[]`). If that page's translation is not in the TLB, the first stack access after the pivot (the `ret` instruction, which pops `[esp+0]`) generates a TLB miss → page table walk (~30–50 cycles). Since kernel stacks are in the identity-mapped first 4MB region (physical `0x100000`–`0x1FFFFF`), their PTEs are in `identity_page_table` which is hot in L2 cache (it is accessed frequently for all kernel code accesses). TLB miss latency for kernel stack pages: ~10–15 cycles (L2 hit for page table walk), not 50–100 cycles (DRAM).\n\n### TSS.ESP0 Read Timing — Hardware-Imposed Ordering\n\nWhen the CPU processes an interrupt while in ring 3, it reads `esp0` from the TSS before pushing any values onto the kernel stack. The sequence:\n\n1. CPU finishes current instruction (ring 3 code).\n2. CPU detects `INTR` high.\n3. CPU checks DPL, privilege transition needed (CPL=3 → IDT gate DPL=0).\n4. CPU **reads `esp0` from TSS** (physical address of `kernel_tss.esp0`).\n5. CPU switches to kernel stack: `SS:ESP = SS0:ESP0` from TSS.\n6. CPU pushes `SS_user, ESP_user, EFLAGS, CS_user, EIP_user` onto kernel stack.\n7. CPU jumps to IDT handler.\n\nStep 4 reads `kernel_tss.esp0` from main memory (or cache). This means `tss_set_kernel_stack()` must complete its write to `kernel_tss.esp0` **before** any ring-3 code runs on the new process. The write is a simple store; on x86 with Total Store Order, stores are visible to all subsequent loads in program order. Since `tss_set_kernel_stack()` is called with IF=0 (we are in the scheduler, which runs with IF=0 from the timer IRQ), no interrupt can fire between the write and the context switch. The ordering is guaranteed.\n\n### Cache Behavior of the Process Table\n\n`process_table[16]` is 66,432 bytes ≈ 64.875 KB. A typical L1 data cache is 32KB; L2 is 256KB–512KB. The entire process table fits in L2. After the first few scheduling cycles, the L2 is warm:\n\n- The scheduler reads `process_table[i].state` for each slot in the round-robin loop — 16 reads of 1 byte each, from 16 different cache lines (each PCB is 4152 bytes, spanning ~65 cache lines; but the `state` field is in the first cache line at offset 36). After warming: 16 L2 hits at ~5ns each = 80ns for the full round-robin search. Cold (DRAM): 16 × 60ns = 960ns.\n\n- The kernel stack for each process is 4KB. On a context switch, the `popa` instruction reads 32 bytes from the new stack. If the stack is cold (last used 50ms ago — 100M cycles at 2GHz), the 32 bytes span at most 2 cache lines, triggering 2 DRAM accesses at 60ns each = 120ns. Plus `iret` reads 12–20 bytes (1 cache line), potentially from an adjacent cold cache line: 60ns more. Total cold-stack activation cost: ~180–300ns ≈ 360–600 cycles at 2GHz.\n\nThis is the \"cold-start penalty\" for context switching and explains why the 700–1000 cycle target includes a significant memory latency component.\n\n### INT 0x80 Software Interrupt Path — Why It Costs 500 Cycles\n\n`int 0x80` from ring-3 involves:\n1. `int 0x80` instruction fetch: 1 cycle (in instruction cache).\n2. DPL check (CPL=3 ≤ gate.DPL=3): ~2 cycles.\n3. Read TSS.esp0 (TSS is hot — accessed recently for timer IRQs): 1 cache line read, ~5 cycles L1 hit.\n4. Switch to kernel stack (SS:ESP from TSS): register writes, ~1 cycle.\n5. Push SS_user, ESP_user, EFLAGS, CS_user, EIP_user: 5 stores to kernel stack (cold first time). If kernel stack is cold: 1 DRAM write burst ~30ns = ~60 cycles.\n6. IDT lookup for vector 0x80 (IDT fits in L1/L2): ~5 cycles.\n7. Jump to `isr128` stub: pipeline flush ~20 cycles.\n8. `push 0; push 128; jmp isr_common_stub`: ~3 cycles.\n9. `pusha`: ~8 cycles.\n10. Segment register saves: ~8 cycles.\n11. Segment register loads (kernel DS etc.): ~4 cycles.\n12. `push esp; call exception_handler`: ~5 cycles.\n13. `syscall_dispatch()` + `sys_write_impl()` execution: variable (dominated by VGA MMIO writes for sys_write).\n14. Return path (pop segment, popa, add esp 8, iret): ~25 cycles.\n15. `iret` to ring-3: ~20 cycles (privilege transition, restore SS+ESP).\n\nSum: ~170 cycles for the interrupt mechanism + ~30ns cold stack = ~230 cycles minimum. The 500-cycle target includes the `sys_write_impl` loop for typical 20-byte strings (~3 VGA MMIO writes to kprintf's buffer, then 20 VGA direct writes).\n\n### Branch Predictability in Round-Robin Search\n\nThe round-robin loop `for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_PROCESSES; i++)` with `state == PROCESS_READY` check has a highly predictable branch pattern: in the steady state (4 active processes, 12 unused), the branch is not-taken for 12 consecutive iterations then taken — a 12-cycle pattern. The branch predictor learns this pattern and predicts correctly after the first few scheduling cycles. Misprediction rate approaches 0%, cost approaches 0 misprediction cycles after warm-up.\n\n\n![Privilege Ring Model: Hardware Enforcement of Kernel-User Boundary](./diagrams/tdd-diag-36.svg)\n\n\n---\n\n## 11.

All other non-zombie, non-blocked processes have `state == PROCESS_READY`. The scheduler enforces this by transitioning `old` to `READY` and `next` to `RUNNING` atomically within the IF=0 critical section.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Concurrency Specification\n\n**Model:** Single-core. Preemptive interrupts only (no threads, no SMP). The timer IRQ (IF=0, interrupt gate) is the only concurrency mechanism.\n\n**Critical section analysis:**\n\n**`sched_schedule()` — called with IF=0:**\n- The timer IRQ handler runs with IF=0 (interrupt gate). Therefore `sched_timer_irq()` and everything it calls (including `sched_schedule()` and `context_switch_asm()`) runs with IF=0. No reentrant interrupt can fire.\n- `sched_yield()` explicitly calls `cli` before `sched_schedule()`. The `sti` after is optional since `iret` restores EFLAGS anyway.\n- **Invariant:** `current_process`, `process_table[i].state`, `kernel_tss.esp0` — all modified only while IF=0. Consistent view guaranteed.\n\n**`process_create_kernel/user()` — called with IF=1 (from `kmain` before `sti`):**\n- All process creation happens before `sti` in `kmain`. After `sti`, no new process is created in this module. **If** `process_create_*` were called after `sti`, a timer IRQ could fire during process table modification. The critical window: between finding an UNUSED slot and setting `state = PROCESS_READY`. If IRQ fires mid-creation with the slot partially initialized, `sched_schedule()` might try to schedule it. Prevention: set `state = PROCESS_READY` as the **last** write, after all other fields are initialized.\n\n**`current_process` visibility:**\n- Written by `sched_schedule()` (IF=0).\n- Read by `sched_timer_irq()`, `sys_exit_impl()`, `sys_write_impl()`, all process functions that call `kprintf(\"[PID %u]\", current_process->pid)`.\n- On a single-core with IF=0 during scheduler, reads by kernel handlers are always from the correct value (no race). Reads by process functions (IF=1) see the value set by the last context switch — always correct since single-core.\n- **No locking required** for `current_process` reads in this module.\n\n**`pit_tick_count` — retained from mod-2:**\n- Written by `sched_timer_irq()` (IF=0).\n- Read by `kmain` idle loop (IF=1).\n- Same analysis as mod-2: `volatile` prevents compiler caching; single-core guarantees no torn read of 64-bit value matters (reads are rare and for informational display only).\n\n**`kernel_tss.esp0` — write ordering:**\n- Written by `tss_set_kernel_stack()` (IF=0, within `sched_schedule()`).\n- Read by CPU hardware on ring-3→ring-0 transition.\n- x86 TSO (Total Store Order) guarantees: the store to `esp0` completes (becomes globally visible) before the CPU processes any subsequent interrupt. Since `tss_set_kernel_stack()` runs with IF=0, no ring-3 interrupt can occur before the store completes. The next ring-3 interrupt (after `iret` restores EFLAGS with IF=1) will always see the updated `esp0`.\n\n**VGA concurrent access from multiple processes:**\n- Three demo processes write to non-overlapping VGA rows (row 2, 12, 22). No shared state.\n- They share the physical `0xB8000` MMIO region, but writes to non-overlapping addresses produce correct results even without synchronization (x86 MMIO writes are ordered per address).\n- The `vga_putchar()` function maintains a cursor (shared mutable state). Demo processes do **not** use `vga_putchar()`; they write directly to `VGA_BASE[row * 80 + col]` via computed indices. This avoids the shared cursor.\n\n**User process isolation — hardware-enforced:**\n- Each user process has its own page directory (loaded as CR3 on switch). Kernel pages in user page directories have U/S=0. A user process cannot read or write kernel memory: the MMU enforces this at the hardware level, independent of software locking.\n\n---\n\n## 13.

Free PDF. The only book that derives the access byte bit by bit with worked examples, rather than presenting the magic hex value.\n\n**Why:** Blundell's derivation is the clearest treatment of why `0x9A` means what it means; reading it once eliminates the need to ever look up access bytes again.\n\n---\n\n## Protected Mode Transition (CR0, far jump, pipeline flush)\n\n**Spec:** *Intel SDM Volume 3A*, §9.9 \"Switching to Protected Mode\" — the Intel-specified four-step procedure your code must follow exactly.\n\n**Code:** GRUB 2 — `grub-core/kern/i386/realmode.S`, `grub_real_to_prot` function — the production real-to-protected transition used by every GRUB-booted OS.\n\n**Best Explanation:** *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*, Remzi & Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau — Appendix on x86 architecture.

Archived at [lkml.org](https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/18/218).\n\n**Code:** Linux kernel — `arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.c` — the vDSO implementation of `clock_gettime` that bypasses the kernel entirely, directly readable as a ~200-line C file. Also `arch/x86/entry/entry_32.S`, `ENTRY(system_call)` for the INT 0x80 path.\n\n**Best Explanation:** *Brendan Gregg's blog* — \"vDSO\" entry at [brendangregg.com](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2014-05-11/strace-wow-much-syscall.html).
