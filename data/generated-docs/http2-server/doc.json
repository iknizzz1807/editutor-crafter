Think of HTTP/1.1 as a narrow bridge where cars must cross single-file, with each car waiting for the previous one to completely cross before starting its journey. HTTP/2, in contrast, is like a modern multi-lane highway where multiple vehicles can travel simultaneously, with sophisticated traffic management systems optimizing flow and reducing overall travel time.</p>\n<p>Understanding why HTTP/2 exists and what problems it solves is crucial for implementing it correctly. This protocol wasn&#39;t created in isolation—it emerged from real-world performance bottlenecks that plagued web applications as they grew more complex and resource-intensive. The transition from text-based HTTP/1.1 to binary HTTP/2 also introduces significant implementation complexity that we must carefully navigate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"http11-limitations\">HTTP/1.1 Limitations</h3>\n<p>HTTP/1.1 served the web admirably for over two decades, but its design assumptions became increasingly problematic as web applications evolved from simple document retrieval to complex, resource-heavy applications. The protocol&#39;s fundamental architecture creates three critical bottlenecks that severely impact modern web performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Head-of-Line Blocking: The Traffic Jam Problem</strong></p>\n<p>The most severe limitation of HTTP/1.1 is head-of-line blocking, which occurs because the protocol processes requests sequentially over each TCP connection. Imagine a drive-through restaurant where customers must place their entire order, wait for it to be completely prepared and delivered, before the next customer can even begin ordering. This serialization creates devastating performance impacts when any single request experiences delays.</p>\n<p>Consider a typical web page requiring an HTML document, three CSS files, five JavaScript files, and ten images. In HTTP/1.1, if the second CSS file takes 2 seconds to generate on the server (perhaps due to complex preprocessing), every subsequent request must wait those full 2 seconds before even beginning to process, despite other resources being immediately available. This blocking effect compounds across the entire page load, turning minor delays into major performance degradations.</p>\n<p>The mathematical impact is severe: if a page requires 20 resources and the 3rd resource is delayed by D seconds, the total additional delay becomes (20-2) × D seconds for that connection. This creates unpredictable and often catastrophic loading behavior where a single slow resource can effectively halt the entire page rendering process.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Blocking Scenario</th>\n<th>Resources Affected</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Slow database query for one CSS file</td>\n<td>All subsequent resources on connection</td>\n<td>Linear delay multiplication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large image processing delay</td>\n<td>All resources queued behind it</td>\n<td>Complete rendering stall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Third-party API timeout</td>\n<td>Entire connection frozen</td>\n<td>Cascading failure to other resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CDN routing issue for one asset</td>\n<td>All remaining assets on connection</td>\n<td>Unpredictable load times</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Connection Overhead: The Infrastructure Tax</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/1.1&#39;s head-of-line blocking problem led to a common workaround: opening multiple parallel TCP connections to the same server. Browsers typically open 6-8 connections per domain, attempting to work around the serialization bottleneck. However, this approach introduces its own set of problems that often make performance worse rather than better.</p>\n<p>Each TCP connection requires a full three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), taking at minimum one full round-trip time (RTT) to establish. For HTTPS connections, an additional TLS handshake adds 1-2 more RTTs depending on TLS version and session resumption. With typical internet latencies of 50-200ms, establishing a single connection can cost 150-600ms before any application data flows. Multiplying this by 6-8 connections creates substantial overhead that often exceeds the time needed to actually transfer the resources.</p>\n<p>The connection management overhead extends beyond initial establishment. Each connection consumes memory on both client and server for TCP buffers, connection state, and TLS session information. Servers must maintain separate socket handles, buffer space, and processing threads for each connection. For high-traffic sites, this resource consumption becomes a significant scaling bottleneck, limiting the number of concurrent clients the server can handle effectively.</p>\n<p>Connection proliferation also creates network inefficiency through poor congestion control behavior. TCP&#39;s congestion control algorithms are designed to fairly share bandwidth between connections, but multiple connections from the same client to the same server subvert this fairness mechanism. Six connections effectively get six times their &quot;fair share&quot; of bandwidth compared to other network users, creating a tragedy-of-the-commons scenario that degrades overall network performance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Connection Issue</th>\n<th>Technical Impact</th>\n<th>Resource Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>TCP handshake overhead</td>\n<td>1 RTT per connection minimum</td>\n<td>150-600ms delay per connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLS handshake overhead</td>\n<td>1-2 additional RTTs per connection</td>\n<td>300-1200ms additional delay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory consumption</td>\n<td>~64KB buffers per connection</td>\n<td>384KB-512KB per domain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server file descriptor limits</td>\n<td>One FD per connection</td>\n<td>Reduced concurrent client capacity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Congestion control gaming</td>\n<td>Unfair bandwidth allocation</td>\n<td>Network-wide performance degradation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Header Redundancy: The Repetition Problem</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/1.1 sends headers as plain text with every request and response, creating massive redundancy that becomes increasingly problematic as applications use more sophisticated client-side technologies. Modern web applications typically send 20-40 headers per request, including lengthy values like User-Agent strings (often 200+ characters), detailed Accept headers, authentication tokens, and various tracking cookies.</p>\n<p>The redundancy problem is particularly severe because most headers remain identical across requests within the same browsing session. The User-Agent header, for example, never changes throughout an entire session but gets transmitted with every single request. Cookie headers often contain session tokens, user preferences, and tracking data that remain static for hours or days but are retransmitted thousands of times. Authorization headers like JWT tokens can be several kilobytes in size but remain unchanged across hundreds of API calls.</p>\n<p>This redundancy has a multiplicative effect on bandwidth consumption and latency. A typical modern web application might send 2-4KB of headers per request. For a page requiring 50 resources, this represents 100-200KB of redundant header data—often exceeding the actual content size. On mobile networks with limited bandwidth and high per-byte costs, this redundancy directly translates to slower loading times and increased user costs.</p>\n<p>The textual format of HTTP/1.1 headers also prevents any optimization opportunities. Headers must be parsed character by character, creating processing overhead on both client and server. There&#39;s no mechanism for header compression, caching of common values, or elimination of redundant information across requests.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Redundancy Issue</th>\n<th>Typical Size</th>\n<th>Impact per 50-Resource Page</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>User-Agent header</td>\n<td>200-300 bytes</td>\n<td>10-15KB redundant data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cookie headers</td>\n<td>500-2000 bytes</td>\n<td>25-100KB redundant data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accept-* headers</td>\n<td>300-500 bytes</td>\n<td>15-25KB redundant data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization tokens</td>\n<td>1000-4000 bytes</td>\n<td>50-200KB redundant data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total header overhead</strong></td>\n<td><strong>2-4KB per request</strong></td>\n<td><strong>100-200KB redundant transmission</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The combination of these three limitations—head-of-line blocking, connection overhead, and header redundancy—creates a perfect storm of performance problems that compound each other. Attempting to solve head-of-line blocking with more connections exacerbates connection overhead, while the additional connections multiply header redundancy across more parallel streams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"http2-benefits\">HTTP/2 Benefits</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 addresses each of HTTP/1.1&#39;s fundamental limitations through a comprehensive protocol redesign built around four core innovations: multiplexing, binary framing, header compression, and flow control. Rather than applying incremental patches to HTTP/1.1&#39;s text-based design, HTTP/2 represents a ground-up rethinking of how HTTP semantics can be efficiently transported over modern networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplexing: The Multi-Lane Highway</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s multiplexing capability transforms the single-file bridge of HTTP/1.1 into a sophisticated multi-lane highway with dynamic lane allocation. Think of it as a modern airport terminal where multiple flights can board simultaneously at different gates, with passengers flowing efficiently through shared infrastructure without blocking each other. This analogy captures the essence of HTTP/2&#39;s stream-based architecture.</p>\n<p>Multiplexing works by introducing the concept of <strong>streams</strong>—independent, bidirectional sequences of frames that carry a single request-response exchange. Multiple streams can operate concurrently over a single TCP connection, with frames from different streams interleaved at the binary framing layer. When stream 3 is waiting for a slow database query, streams 5, 7, and 11 can continue transmitting their responses without any blocking. This eliminates head-of-line blocking at the HTTP layer entirely.</p>\n<p>The technical implementation uses stream IDs to multiplex frames over the shared connection. Each frame carries a 31-bit stream identifier that allows the receiving endpoint to reconstruct multiple concurrent conversations from the interleaved frame sequence. Client-initiated streams use odd-numbered IDs (1, 3, 5, ...) while server-initiated streams (for server push) use even-numbered IDs (2, 4, 6, ...). This simple scheme allows for over 2 billion concurrent streams per connection direction.</p>\n<p>Priority handling adds sophisticated traffic management to the multiplexing system. Streams can be assigned weights (1-256) and dependencies, creating a priority tree that guides frame transmission order. Critical resources like CSS files can be marked as high priority, ensuring they&#39;re transmitted before less critical resources like analytics tracking pixels. This priority system allows applications to optimize perceived performance by ensuring render-blocking resources arrive first.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Multiplexing Feature</th>\n<th>HTTP/1.1 Limitation</th>\n<th>HTTP/2 Solution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Concurrent requests</td>\n<td>Sequential processing</td>\n<td>Unlimited concurrent streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Head-of-line blocking</td>\n<td>One slow request blocks all others</td>\n<td>Stream independence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource prioritization</td>\n<td>No priority mechanism</td>\n<td>Weight-based priority tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection utilization</td>\n<td>Multiple connections needed</td>\n<td>Single connection handles all traffic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request interleaving</td>\n<td>Impossible</td>\n<td>Frame-level interleaving</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Binary Framing: The Efficient Transport Layer</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s binary framing layer represents a fundamental shift from HTTP/1.1&#39;s text-based approach to a carefully designed binary protocol optimized for machine processing. Think of this as the difference between sending a handwritten letter (which requires human interpretation) versus a structured database record (which can be processed algorithmically). The binary approach enables significant performance and reliability improvements.</p>\n<p>The framing layer introduces a universal frame format with a fixed 9-byte header containing length (24 bits), type (8 bits), flags (8 bits), and stream ID (31 bits). This structured approach eliminates the parsing ambiguities inherent in text-based protocols. HTTP/1.1 parsers must handle numerous edge cases around header folding, whitespace handling, and line ending variations. Binary frames have precisely defined boundaries and unambiguous field meanings.</p>\n<p>Frame types provide specialized containers for different kinds of HTTP/2 communication. DATA frames carry request and response payloads, HEADERS frames contain compressed header information, SETTINGS frames negotiate connection parameters, WINDOW_UPDATE frames manage flow control, and PING frames enable connection health monitoring. Each frame type has optimized encoding for its specific purpose, eliminating the one-size-fits-all approach of HTTP/1.1&#39;s text format.</p>\n<p>The binary format enables powerful optimizations impossible with text protocols. Frames can be processed with simple memory copies and bit operations rather than complex string parsing. Field extraction becomes a matter of reading fixed offsets rather than scanning for delimiter characters. Frame validation can be performed with simple integer comparisons rather than complex regular expressions.</p>\n<p>Error handling becomes more robust with binary framing. Malformed frames can be detected immediately through length and type field validation, rather than requiring complex protocol state machines to detect text parsing errors. The binary format also enables precise error reporting—specific fields can be identified as invalid rather than reporting vague &quot;malformed request&quot; errors.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Binary Framing Advantage</th>\n<th>Technical Benefit</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Fixed frame header format</td>\n<td>Eliminates parsing ambiguity</td>\n<td>10-100x faster frame processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type-specific frame encoding</td>\n<td>Optimized encoding per use case</td>\n<td>Reduced bandwidth consumption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unambiguous field boundaries</td>\n<td>No delimiter scanning needed</td>\n<td>Constant-time field extraction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Built-in length prefixing</td>\n<td>No buffer overrun vulnerabilities</td>\n<td>Improved security and reliability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Machine-optimized format</td>\n<td>Bit operations vs. string parsing</td>\n<td>Lower CPU overhead</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Header Compression: The Smart Caching System</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s HPACK header compression system solves the redundancy problem through a sophisticated caching and compression scheme that can achieve 85-95% header size reductions in typical scenarios. Think of HPACK as a smart filing system that remembers what documents you&#39;ve sent before and references them by index number rather than retransmitting the full content. This analogy captures both the efficiency gains and the stateful nature of the compression system.</p>\n<p>HPACK operates using two complementary mechanisms: a static table of common header name-value pairs defined in the specification, and a dynamic table that builds up common patterns specific to each connection. The static table contains 61 predefined entries covering the most common headers like <code>:method: GET</code>, <code>:status: 200</code>, and <code>content-type: text/html</code>. These can be referenced by a single byte index rather than transmitting the full header text.</p>\n<p>The dynamic table learns connection-specific patterns and builds a cache of frequently used header combinations. When a new header like <code>authorization: Bearer xyz123token</code> is first sent, it&#39;s transmitted in full but also added to the dynamic table. Subsequent requests can reference this header by its dynamic table index, reducing a potentially multi-kilobyte authorization header to a single byte reference.</p>\n<p>Huffman encoding provides additional compression for header values that can&#39;t be completely eliminated through table references. HPACK uses a custom Huffman table optimized for typical HTTP header content, achieving significant compression ratios for header values while maintaining fast decode performance. The Huffman encoding is particularly effective for headers containing common English words, URLs, and typical header values.</p>\n<p>The compression system includes sophisticated table management to prevent memory exhaustion. The dynamic table has a configurable size limit (typically 4KB) and uses FIFO eviction when the limit is reached. This ensures bounded memory usage while maintaining high hit rates for recently used headers. Connection-specific optimization means that each client-server pair develops its own optimized header vocabulary over time.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>HPACK Component</th>\n<th>Compression Mechanism</th>\n<th>Typical Size Reduction</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Static table references</td>\n<td>Index lookup for common headers</td>\n<td>95-99% reduction for common headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic table references</td>\n<td>Connection-specific header caching</td>\n<td>90-95% reduction for repeated headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huffman encoding</td>\n<td>Optimized compression for header values</td>\n<td>20-40% reduction for textual content</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal header encoding</td>\n<td>Efficient encoding for new headers</td>\n<td>10-20% overhead for initial transmission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Combined effect</strong></td>\n<td><strong>All mechanisms together</strong></td>\n<td><strong>85-95% total header reduction</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Server Push: Proactive Resource Delivery</strong></p>\n<p>Server push represents HTTP/2&#39;s most revolutionary feature, enabling servers to proactively send resources to clients before they&#39;re explicitly requested. Imagine a restaurant that starts preparing your usual appetizer as soon as you sit down, based on your ordering history—by the time you&#39;re ready for it, it&#39;s already available. Server push applies this same proactive approach to web resource delivery.</p>\n<p>The push mechanism works through PUSH_PROMISE frames that inform the client about resources the server intends to push. When serving an HTML page, the server can analyze embedded references to CSS, JavaScript, and image files, then immediately begin pushing these resources while the client is still processing the HTML. By the time the client&#39;s HTML parser discovers a <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;</code> tag, the CSS file may already be fully received and cached.</p>\n<p>Push promises prevent duplicate requests through a promise caching mechanism. When the server sends a PUSH_PROMISE for <code>/styles.css</code>, the client marks this resource as &quot;promised&quot; in its cache. If the HTML parser later encounters a reference to <code>/styles.css</code>, the client can immediately use the pushed resource rather than initiating a new request. This eliminates the traditional waterfall loading pattern where resource dependencies are discovered sequentially.</p>\n<p>However, server push introduces complexity around cache validation and client state prediction. The server must avoid pushing resources the client already has cached, as this wastes bandwidth and can actually harm performance. Effective push implementations require sophisticated algorithms to predict what resources the client needs and doesn&#39;t already possess.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: While server push is powerful, it&#39;s also the most complex HTTP/2 feature to implement correctly and can easily harm performance if used inappropriately. Many production implementations start with multiplexing and header compression, adding push capabilities only after mastering the foundational features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-challenges\">Implementation Challenges</h3>\n<p>Implementing HTTP/2 correctly presents several interconnected technical challenges that are significantly more complex than typical HTTP/1.1 server implementation. The protocol&#39;s sophisticated features create a web of dependencies between binary parsing, state management, concurrent processing, and resource control that must be carefully orchestrated to achieve correct and performant behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Binary Protocol Parsing: The Precision Engineering Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Binary protocol parsing represents a fundamental shift from the forgiving, text-based parsing traditionally used for HTTP/1.1. Think of this as the difference between assembling furniture from IKEA instructions (where small mistakes are recoverable) versus performing precision surgery (where exact technique is critical for success). Binary protocols demand precise handling of every bit and byte, with no room for the flexible interpretation that text protocols traditionally allow.</p>\n<p>The HTTP/2 frame format requires careful attention to byte ordering, bit field extraction, and length validation. The 24-bit length field spans three bytes and must be converted from network byte order (big-endian) to host byte order on little-endian systems. The 8-bit flags field contains bit-packed flags whose meaning varies by frame type—the END_STREAM flag in DATA frames has different implications than in HEADERS frames. The 31-bit stream ID field includes a reserved bit that must always be zero, requiring proper masking during extraction.</p>\n<p>Frame parsing must handle partial receives and buffer management complexities absent from text protocols. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where line-based parsing can process partial headers gracefully, binary frames must be received completely before processing. This requires implementing buffering state machines that can accumulate frame data across multiple TCP receive operations, while properly handling the transition between frame header and payload regions.</p>\n<p>Payload processing varies significantly by frame type, requiring specialized parsing logic for each frame variant. HEADERS frames contain HPACK-compressed header blocks that require stateful decompression. SETTINGS frames contain key-value pairs with specific validation rules—the SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE parameter must not exceed 2^31-1, while SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE must be between 16,384 and 16,777,215. DATA frames are simpler but must respect flow control constraints.</p>\n<p>Error detection and recovery in binary protocols requires more sophisticated approaches than text protocol parsing. Malformed frames can&#39;t be &quot;skipped&quot; like malformed HTTP/1.1 headers—a single byte offset error can make the entire connection unusable. This necessitates robust validation at every parsing stage and careful error propagation to prevent cascading failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parsing Challenge</th>\n<th>Complexity Factor</th>\n<th>Error Consequences</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Multi-byte integer extraction</td>\n<td>Endianness handling, bit masking</td>\n<td>Connection corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame type dispatch</td>\n<td>Type-specific validation logic</td>\n<td>Protocol violation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial frame buffering</td>\n<td>State machine complexity</td>\n<td>Memory leak potential</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK integration</td>\n<td>Stateful decompression coupling</td>\n<td>Compression context corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow control integration</td>\n<td>Per-frame window accounting</td>\n<td>Resource exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>State Machine Complexity: The Orchestration Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s state management complexity far exceeds HTTP/1.1 due to the interaction between connection-level state, per-stream state machines, and shared resources like HPACK compression contexts. Think of this as conducting a symphony orchestra where each musician (stream) has their own piece of music (state machine), but they all must coordinate timing (flow control) and share limited resources (connection settings) while the conductor (connection handler) ensures overall coherence.</p>\n<p>Stream state machines follow the HTTP/2 specification&#39;s defined states: idle, reserved (local/remote), open, half-closed (local/remote), and closed. Each state has specific rules about what frames can be sent or received, what transitions are valid, and what actions must be taken. A stream in the &quot;half-closed (remote)&quot; state can send frames but cannot receive them—attempting to process a received DATA frame in this state constitutes a protocol error requiring stream reset.</p>\n<p>Connection-level state management coordinates global settings, flow control windows, and HPACK compression contexts that are shared across all streams. The connection maintains a settings registry where parameters like SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE affect HPACK operation for all streams, while SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limits how many streams can be active simultaneously. Changes to these settings can have cascading effects across the entire connection.</p>\n<p>The interaction between stream and connection state creates complex edge cases that must be handled correctly. When the connection&#39;s SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS is reduced, existing streams may need to be queued or reset. When a stream transitions to closed state, its flow control window allocation must be returned to the connection-level pool. HPACK table size changes must be synchronized across all active streams using the same compression context.</p>\n<p>Concurrency adds another layer of complexity, as multiple goroutines or threads may be operating on different streams simultaneously while sharing connection-level resources. This requires careful synchronization to prevent race conditions in settings updates, HPACK table modifications, and flow control window management. The synchronization must be fine-grained enough to allow high concurrency while preventing the deadlocks that can occur when multiple streams compete for limited resources.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State Management Challenge</th>\n<th>Synchronization Requirement</th>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Per-stream state machines</td>\n<td>Stream-local locking</td>\n<td>Invalid state transitions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection-level settings</td>\n<td>Global coordination</td>\n<td>Settings race conditions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK table sharing</td>\n<td>Compression context locking</td>\n<td>Table corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow control coordination</td>\n<td>Window update synchronization</td>\n<td>Deadlock or window leaks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream lifecycle management</td>\n<td>Creation/destruction coordination</td>\n<td>Resource leaks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Concurrency Management: The Resource Coordination Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s multiplexing capabilities create unprecedented concurrency management challenges compared to HTTP/1.1&#39;s simple request-response model. The protocol enables potentially thousands of concurrent streams over a single connection, each with independent lifecycle, flow control, and priority requirements. Think of this as managing a busy airport where thousands of passengers (streams) are simultaneously moving through shared infrastructure (connection) with different destinations (responses), priorities (business vs. economy), and timing requirements (connecting flights), all while ensuring no resource conflicts or safety violations.</p>\n<p>Flow control presents the most complex concurrency challenge, operating simultaneously at connection and stream levels with interdependent constraints. Each stream has its own send window that must be decremented atomically when sending DATA frames, while the connection-level send window must also be decremented for the same frames. WINDOW_UPDATE frames can arrive asynchronously for either stream or connection windows, requiring careful coordination to wake up blocked streams when window space becomes available.</p>\n<p>Resource sharing creates potential contention points that must be carefully managed to prevent performance degradation. The HPACK compression context is shared across all streams but requires exclusive access during header processing to prevent table corruption. Connection settings affect all streams but can be updated asynchronously through SETTINGS frames. Priority tree management requires atomic updates to prevent inconsistent stream dependencies.</p>\n<p>Backpressure handling becomes critical when the server cannot keep up with incoming stream creation or when flow control windows become exhausted. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where backpressure naturally occurs through TCP&#39;s window mechanism, HTTP/2 requires application-level backpressure management. Streams may need to be queued when concurrent stream limits are reached, or data transmission may need to be suspended when flow control windows are exhausted.</p>\n<p>The interaction between HTTP/2&#39;s flow control and TCP&#39;s flow control creates a multi-layered backpressure system that must be coordinated carefully. HTTP/2 flow control can create artificial backpressure even when TCP has available window space, while TCP backpressure can cause HTTP/2 flow control windows to appear available when they&#39;re actually blocked at the transport layer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Concurrency Model</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 multiplexing requires handling hundreds or thousands of concurrent streams over a single TCP connection, with shared resources and complex inter-dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Thread-per-stream model with shared connection state</li>\n<li>Single-threaded event loop with async/await patterns  </li>\n<li>Hybrid model with connection-level thread and stream worker pools</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid model with dedicated connection thread for frame I/O and worker pool for stream processing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Connection thread provides serialized access to shared resources (HPACK, settings) while worker pool enables parallel stream processing.

Language-Specific Hints:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Binary Parsing</strong>: Use <code>encoding/binary</code> package for endianness-safe integer extraction. <code>binary.BigEndian.Uint32(buf[:4])</code> handles 32-bit big-endian conversion automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Buffered I/O</strong>: Use <code>bufio.Reader</code> and <code>bufio.Writer</code> for efficient frame I/O. The <code>ReadFull()</code> function ensures exact byte counts are read, which is critical for binary protocols.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Concurrency</strong>: Use <code>sync.RWMutex</code> for stream maps that have many readers but few writers. Use <code>sync.Mutex</code> for simpler cases or when write frequency is high.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Create custom error types that implement the <code>error</code> interface for protocol-specific errors. This enables type assertions for different error handling strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Use <code>sync.Pool</code> for frequently allocated/deallocated buffers like frame headers to reduce GC pressure in high-throughput scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>F. Milestone Checkpoint:</strong></p>\n<p>After implementing the foundation described in this section, verify the setup with these checkpoints:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Project Structure Verification</strong>: Run <code>find . -name &quot;*.go&quot; | head -20</code> and verify the file organization matches the recommended structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Basic Compilation</strong>: Run <code>go build ./...</code> to ensure all packages compile without errors.

Our goal is to demonstrate mastery of HTTP/2&#39;s core technical challenges—binary framing, multiplexing, and header compression—rather than creating a production-ready server with all the bells and whistles. Just as a Formula 1 car strips away air conditioning and cup holders to focus on speed and handling, we&#39;ll implement the essential HTTP/2 mechanisms while deliberately excluding production concerns like advanced security, monitoring, and performance optimizations.</p>\n<p>This focused approach serves the learning objectives better than attempting to build everything. By the end of this project, you&#39;ll have a deep understanding of how HTTP/2&#39;s revolutionary features work under the hood, but you won&#39;t have spent time on ancillary concerns that don&#39;t teach the core protocols.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-goals\">Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>Our HTTP/2 server implementation targets four primary functional capabilities that demonstrate mastery of the protocol&#39;s most important innovations. These goals directly correspond to the milestone structure and ensure comprehensive coverage of HTTP/2&#39;s technical foundations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Core Protocol Implementation Over Feature Completeness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 specification includes numerous features ranging from essential (binary framing) to optional (server push) to implementation-specific (performance optimizations)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Implement minimal subset (frames only)</li>\n<li>Implement core features (framing + multiplexing + compression + flow control)</li>\n<li>Implement full specification including optional features</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Focus on core features that demonstrate the protocol&#39;s key innovations</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Core features represent the fundamental paradigm shifts from HTTP/1.1 and provide the most educational value. Optional features can be learned later once the foundation is solid.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Results in a server that can handle real HTTP/2 clients but lacks production deployment features. Provides deep understanding of protocol mechanics without feature creep.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"binary-framing-layer-implementation\">Binary Framing Layer Implementation</h4>\n<p>The server must implement complete binary framing capabilities as defined in RFC 7540 Section 4. This includes parsing incoming frames from the wire format, validating frame structure and constraints, and serializing outgoing frames back to binary format.</p>\n<p>Frame parsing functionality encompasses reading the 9-byte frame header containing length, type, flags, and stream ID fields, along with extracting the variable-length payload based on the length field. The implementation must handle endianness correctly, validate frame length constraints (maximum <code>MaxFrameSize</code> of 16,777,215 bytes), and properly interpret reserved bits according to the specification.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Required Fields</th>\n<th>Validation Rules</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeDATA</code></td>\n<td>Carries request/response payload</td>\n<td>Stream ID, optional padding</td>\n<td>Stream ID must be non-zero, payload respects flow control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeHEADERS</code></td>\n<td>Contains request/response headers</td>\n<td>Stream ID, compressed header block</td>\n<td>Stream ID must be non-zero, header block must be HPACK-compressed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeSETTINGS</code></td>\n<td>Communicates connection parameters</td>\n<td>Settings identifier and value pairs</td>\n<td>Stream ID must be zero for connection-level settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypePING</code></td>\n<td>Connection keepalive mechanism</td>\n<td>8-byte opaque data</td>\n<td>Stream ID must be zero, payload exactly 8 bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeGOAWAY</code></td>\n<td>Graceful connection termination</td>\n<td>Last stream ID, error code, debug data</td>\n<td>Stream ID must be zero, last stream ID valid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeWINDOW_UPDATE</code></td>\n<td>Flow control window adjustments</td>\n<td>Window size increment</td>\n<td>Non-zero increment, valid stream ID</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The frame validation system must enforce protocol compliance including frame size limits, appropriate stream ID usage (zero for connection-level frames, non-zero for stream-specific frames), and flag interpretation based on frame type. Frame serialization reverses this process, converting internal frame representations back to the binary wire format with proper byte ordering and length calculation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"http2-multiplexing-and-stream-management\">HTTP/2 Multiplexing and Stream Management</h4>\n<p>The server implements full multiplexing capabilities allowing multiple concurrent request-response streams over a single TCP connection. This eliminates HTTP/1.1&#39;s head-of-line blocking problem by interleaving frames from different streams based on availability rather than processing requests sequentially.</p>\n<p>Stream management includes implementing the complete HTTP/2 stream state machine with states idle, reserved (local), reserved (remote), open, half-closed (local), half-closed (remote), and closed. State transitions occur based on frame reception and transmission, with strict validation to prevent protocol violations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Triggering Event</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>idle</td>\n<td>Receive HEADERS frame</td>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Create stream, begin header processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>idle</td>\n<td>Send PUSH_PROMISE frame</td>\n<td>reserved (local)</td>\n<td>Reserve stream for server push</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Send frame with END_STREAM flag</td>\n<td>half-closed (local)</td>\n<td>Mark local endpoint finished</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Receive frame with END_STREAM flag</td>\n<td>half-closed (remote)</td>\n<td>Mark remote endpoint finished</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>half-closed (local)</td>\n<td>Receive frame with END_STREAM flag</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Complete stream lifecycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>half-closed (remote)</td>\n<td>Send frame with END_STREAM flag</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Complete stream lifecycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any state</td>\n<td>Send/Receive RST_STREAM frame</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Immediate stream termination</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Stream ID allocation follows HTTP/2 conventions with client-initiated streams using odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) and server-initiated streams using even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). The implementation tracks the highest stream ID seen to prevent stream ID reuse and detect protocol violations.</p>\n<p>Concurrent stream limits enforce the <code>SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</code> setting, rejecting new streams when the limit is exceeded and properly handling stream closure to allow new streams. Stream prioritization provides basic weight-based scheduling, though advanced dependency tree features are excluded from our scope.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hpack-header-compression-engine\">HPACK Header Compression Engine</h4>\n<p>The server implements RFC 7541 HPACK compression providing efficient header compression through static table lookups, dynamic table management, and Huffman encoding. This addresses HTTP/1.1&#39;s header redundancy problem where identical headers are transmitted repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Static table implementation includes the predefined 61-entry table containing common HTTP headers like <code>:method</code>, <code>:path</code>, <code>:status</code>, and frequently used header-value pairs. The static table provides immediate compression benefits for standard HTTP semantics without connection-specific state.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Index</th>\n<th>Header Name</th>\n<th>Header Value</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>:authority</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>Common for all requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>:method</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Most frequent HTTP method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>:method</td>\n<td>POST</td>\n<td>Second most frequent method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>:path</td>\n<td>/</td>\n<td>Default path</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>Successful response</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>404</td>\n<td>Not found error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>Server error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Dynamic table management maintains a connection-specific FIFO table that grows and shrinks based on header frequency and size constraints. The dynamic table uses configurable size limits (typically 4,096 bytes) with automatic eviction of oldest entries when space is needed for new entries.</p>\n<p>Header encoding supports three representation types: indexed header field (reference to static or dynamic table), literal header field with incremental indexing (add to dynamic table), and literal header field never indexed (sensitive headers). The implementation must correctly calculate table indices, manage table size updates, and handle integer encoding with 5-bit, 6-bit, and 7-bit prefixes.</p>\n<p>Huffman decoding decompresses header values encoded with HTTP/2&#39;s predefined Huffman table optimized for HTTP header patterns. The decoder must handle bit-aligned input, padding validation, and error recovery for malformed Huffman sequences.</p>\n<h4 id=\"flow-control-and-backpressure-management\">Flow Control and Backpressure Management</h4>\n<p>The server implements HTTP/2&#39;s credit-based flow control at both connection and individual stream levels. This prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers and provides fairness across multiplexed streams sharing the same connection.</p>\n<p>Connection-level flow control tracks a single window size that limits the total bytes of <code>DATA</code> frame payloads across all streams on the connection. The initial connection window defaults to <code>InitialWindowSize</code> (65,535 bytes) and can be adjusted via <code>SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</code>.</p>\n<p>Stream-level flow control maintains independent window sizes for each stream, initialized to the connection&#39;s initial window size setting. Each stream consumes from both its individual window and the connection&#39;s aggregate window when sending <code>DATA</code> frames.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Window Type</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Initial Size</th>\n<th>Update Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Window</td>\n<td>All streams combined</td>\n<td>65,535 bytes</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE frame with stream ID 0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Window</td>\n<td>Individual stream</td>\n<td>65,535 bytes</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE frame with specific stream ID</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Window management processes <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frames to increment available send capacity, validates window size calculations to prevent overflow conditions, and implements backpressure by queueing data when send windows are exhausted.</p>\n<p>The implementation must handle edge cases including window underflow (sending more than window allows), window overflow (increment causes size to exceed maximum), and deadlock prevention when both endpoints have exhausted windows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-functional-goals\">Non-Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>Beyond the functional protocol implementation, our HTTP/2 server targets specific non-functional characteristics that demonstrate production-readiness concepts while maintaining educational focus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Reasonable Performance Over Maximum Optimization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 implementations can range from naive (functional but slow) to highly optimized (complex but fast)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Naive implementation prioritizing simplicity</li>\n<li>Reasonable performance with standard optimizations</li>\n<li>High-performance implementation with advanced optimizations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Target reasonable performance using standard library features and straightforward algorithms</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Demonstrates awareness of performance concerns without requiring advanced optimization knowledge. Provides foundation for later optimization while keeping code readable.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Server will handle moderate load but won&#39;t compete with production implementations like nginx or Apache. Code remains understandable for learning purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"performance-characteristics\">Performance Characteristics</h4>\n<p>The server targets handling at least 100 concurrent connections with 10 streams per connection under normal conditions. This demonstrates scalability concepts without requiring advanced performance engineering. Frame processing should achieve at least 10,000 frames per second on modern hardware, showing efficient binary protocol handling.</p>\n<p>Memory usage should remain bounded with configurable limits on connection count, stream count per connection, and HPACK dynamic table sizes. The implementation uses connection pooling and reasonable buffer sizes rather than advanced memory management techniques.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Metric</th>\n<th>Target Value</th>\n<th>Measurement Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Concurrent Connections</td>\n<td>100+</td>\n<td>Load testing with multiple clients</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Streams per Connection</td>\n<td>10+</td>\n<td>Multiplexing test with concurrent requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Processing Rate</td>\n<td>10,000+ frames/sec</td>\n<td>Synthetic frame generation benchmark</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory per Connection</td>\n<td>&lt;1 MB</td>\n<td>Memory profiling during operation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Latency</td>\n<td>&lt;10ms overhead</td>\n<td>Comparison with HTTP/1.1 baseline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"resource-usage-and-limits\">Resource Usage and Limits</h4>\n<p>The implementation incorporates configurable resource limits preventing resource exhaustion attacks while demonstrating defensive programming practices. Connection limits prevent file descriptor exhaustion, stream limits prevent memory consumption attacks, and flow control windows prevent bandwidth abuse.</p>\n<p>Buffer management uses reasonable defaults (64KB read buffers, 1MB write buffers) with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. Dynamic table size limits prevent HPACK decompression bombs, and frame size limits prevent oversized frame attacks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reliability-and-error-recovery\">Reliability and Error Recovery</h4>\n<p>Error handling follows HTTP/2 specification guidelines distinguishing between connection errors (requiring <code>GOAWAY</code>) and stream errors (requiring <code>RST_STREAM</code>). The implementation provides graceful degradation when possible and clear error reporting for debugging.</p>\n<p>Connection recovery handles network interruptions, malformed frames, and protocol violations with appropriate error codes. Stream isolation ensures that errors in one stream don&#39;t affect other streams on the same connection unless the error is connection-level.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n<th>Client Notification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Malformed Frame</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n<td>Connection error with specific code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Protocol Violation</td>\n<td>Send RST_STREAM for affected stream</td>\n<td>Stream error, other streams unaffected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control Violation</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY or RST_STREAM based on scope</td>\n<td>Appropriate error code indicating violation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Compression Error</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY (affects connection state)</td>\n<td>Connection error, HPACK state corrupted</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>To maintain focus on core learning objectives, several HTTP/2 features and production concerns are explicitly excluded from our implementation scope. These exclusions prevent scope creep and ensure depth over breadth in understanding protocol fundamentals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Educational Depth Over Production Completeness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 specification and production implementations include numerous features beyond core protocol mechanics</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Implement subset focusing on core innovations</li>\n<li>Implement most features for production-like completeness</li>\n<li>Implement minimal viable HTTP/2 server</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Exclude advanced features that don&#39;t contribute to understanding core protocol innovations</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Advanced features often involve significant complexity that obscures fundamental concepts. Better to master fundamentals first, then add features incrementally.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Server won&#39;t be production-ready but will provide deep understanding of HTTP/2&#39;s key innovations. Clear path for future enhancement.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"server-push-implementation\">Server Push Implementation</h4>\n<p>HTTP/2 server push allows servers to proactively send resources to clients before they&#39;re requested, potentially improving page load times. However, server push involves significant complexity including resource prioritization, cache awareness, client preference handling, and push promise management.</p>\n<p>Server push implementation would require <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> frame handling, managing server-initiated streams with even-numbered stream IDs, coordinating pushed resources with client requests, and handling push cancellation via <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames. The feature also involves application-level decisions about which resources to push and when.</p>\n<p>While valuable for production deployments, server push doesn&#39;t demonstrate additional protocol fundamentals beyond what we learn from client-initiated streams. The complexity would distract from mastering binary framing, multiplexing, and compression mechanisms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-priority-and-dependency-features\">Advanced Priority and Dependency Features</h4>\n<p>HTTP/2 includes sophisticated stream prioritization with dependency trees, weight inheritance, and dynamic priority updates. Production implementations often include complex scheduling algorithms, priority propagation mechanisms, and fairness guarantees across priority levels.</p>\n<p>Advanced priority features involve dependency tree manipulation, exclusive dependencies, weight-based scheduling with inheritance, and priority frame processing. These mechanisms can significantly impact performance but require substantial algorithm complexity and careful testing.</p>\n<p>Our implementation includes basic weight-based scheduling to demonstrate priority concepts without implementing full dependency tree management. This provides foundation understanding while avoiding algorithmic complexity that doesn&#39;t teach additional protocol mechanisms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"http3-and-quic-integration\">HTTP/3 and QUIC Integration</h4>\n<p>HTTP/3 represents the next evolution of HTTP over QUIC transport, addressing some of HTTP/2&#39;s limitations like head-of-line blocking at the TCP level. However, HTTP/3 involves entirely different transport protocols, encryption integration, and connection migration concepts.</p>\n<p>HTTP/3 implementation would require QUIC protocol implementation, UDP-based transport, built-in encryption, connection migration, and different multiplexing approaches. While intellectually interesting, this represents a completely separate learning track from HTTP/2 over TCP.</p>\n<p>Understanding HTTP/2 thoroughly provides better foundation for later learning HTTP/3 than attempting both simultaneously. The concepts build progressively from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 to HTTP/3.</p>\n<h4 id=\"production-deployment-features\">Production Deployment Features</h4>\n<p>Production HTTP/2 servers require numerous operational features including comprehensive logging, metrics collection, health monitoring, graceful shutdown, configuration reloading, and integration with load balancers and reverse proxies.</p>\n<p>Security hardening involves TLS configuration, certificate management, security header handling, rate limiting, and protection against various attacks. Performance optimization includes connection pooling, buffer tuning, CPU profiling, and memory optimization.</p>\n<p>Administrative features like runtime configuration updates, connection draining, debug endpoints, and operational metrics add significant implementation complexity without teaching HTTP/2 protocol concepts.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Excluded Feature Category</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Rationale for Exclusion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Security Hardening</td>\n<td>TLS cipher selection, rate limiting, DDoS protection</td>\n<td>Focus on protocol mechanics, not security implementation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operational Monitoring</td>\n<td>Metrics collection, health checks, alerting</td>\n<td>Infrastructure concerns separate from protocol learning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Optimization</td>\n<td>Zero-copy I/O, custom memory allocators, CPU optimization</td>\n<td>Advanced engineering beyond protocol understanding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Production Integration</td>\n<td>Load balancer integration, service discovery, container orchestration</td>\n<td>Deployment concerns unrelated to HTTP/2 specification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-error-recovery-and-edge-cases\">Advanced Error Recovery and Edge Cases</h4>\n<p>Production implementations handle numerous edge cases including network partition recovery, connection migration, complex timeout scenarios, and compatibility with misbehaving clients. These scenarios often involve intricate state management and recovery logic.</p>\n<p>Advanced error recovery might include connection backup strategies, automatic retry mechanisms, client capability detection, and fallback to HTTP/1.1. While important for production use, these features don&#39;t teach additional HTTP/2 concepts beyond basic error handling.</p>\n<p>Our implementation focuses on correct error detection and standard recovery procedures as specified in RFC 7540, providing solid foundation for understanding error semantics without extensive edge case handling.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Scope Creep Through Feature Addition</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake in educational implementations is gradually adding &quot;just one more feature&quot; until the project becomes unwieldy. This typically happens when encountering real-world clients that expect certain features or when discovering interesting extensions to the base protocol.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s problematic</strong>: Each additional feature multiplies testing complexity, increases debugging difficulty, and dilutes focus from core learning objectives. Features often have subtle interactions that can mask fundamental bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Maintain a strict feature freeze after initial scope definition. Document feature requests for future implementation phases but resist adding them to the current scope. Focus on making the defined scope work perfectly rather than expanding functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Recognition</strong>: You&#39;re experiencing scope creep if you find yourself saying &quot;this should be easy to add&quot; or &quot;real clients expect this feature.&quot; These are valid observations but belong in separate learning phases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides practical direction for implementing the goals and maintaining the scope boundaries defined above.

Architecture</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section establishes the architectural foundation for all milestones (1-4) by defining the core components, their interactions, and the concurrency model that enables binary framing, HPACK compression, stream management, and flow control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of an HTTP/2 server as a sophisticated air traffic control system. Just as air traffic control manages multiple aircraft simultaneously over shared airspace with complex routing, priority scheduling, and safety protocols, our HTTP/2 server manages multiple concurrent streams over a single TCP connection with binary framing, header compression, and flow control. The connection is like the airspace - a shared resource that must be carefully coordinated. Each stream is like an individual aircraft with its own flight plan, priority level, and fuel constraints (flow control windows). The various server components work together like different control tower systems: radar (frame parser) identifies incoming traffic, flight control (stream manager) tracks each aircraft&#39;s state and route, communications (HPACK engine) compresses radio chatter to reduce bandwidth, and traffic control (flow controller) prevents congestion by managing spacing between aircraft.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps us understand why HTTP/2&#39;s architecture is more complex than HTTP/1.1 - we&#39;re not just handling one request at a time sequentially, but orchestrating a complex dance of multiplexed interactions that must be carefully coordinated to prevent conflicts, ensure fairness, and maintain performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fcomponent-architecture.svg\" alt=\"HTTP/2 Server Component Architecture\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview\">Component Overview</h3>\n<p>The HTTP/2 server architecture consists of five primary components that work in concert to handle multiplexed binary protocol communication. Each component has distinct responsibilities and interfaces that enable clean separation of concerns while supporting the complex interactions required by the HTTP/2 specification.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Handler</strong> serves as the entry point and orchestrator for all HTTP/2 communication over a single TCP connection. Think of it as the main switchboard operator who receives all incoming calls and routes them to the appropriate departments. This component owns the TCP socket, manages the connection lifecycle, and coordinates between all other components. It maintains connection-level state including settings negotiated during the connection preface, connection-level flow control windows, and the mapping of active streams to their respective handlers.</p>\n<p>The Connection Handler implements the HTTP/2 connection state machine, handling the initial connection preface where the client sends the magic string &quot;PRI * HTTP/2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nSM\\r\\n\\r\\n&quot; followed by a SETTINGS frame. It manages connection-level settings such as maximum frame size, header table size, and maximum concurrent streams. When frames arrive, it performs initial validation and routes them to appropriate components based on frame type and stream ID. For stream-specific frames (DATA, HEADERS), it delegates to the Stream Manager. For connection-level frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY), it handles them directly or coordinates with other components as needed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Interfaces With</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Lifecycle</td>\n<td>Manages TCP connection, connection preface, and graceful shutdown</td>\n<td>Frame Parser, Stream Manager</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settings Management</td>\n<td>Handles SETTINGS frames and maintains connection parameters</td>\n<td>All components for configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Routing</td>\n<td>Routes incoming frames to appropriate handlers based on type and stream ID</td>\n<td>Frame Parser, Stream Manager</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Flow Control</td>\n<td>Manages connection-level flow control window</td>\n<td>Flow Controller</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Recovery</td>\n<td>Handles connection-level errors and sends GOAWAY frames</td>\n<td>All components for error propagation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Frame Parser</strong> acts as the binary protocol interpreter, converting between the HTTP/2 wire format and structured frame objects that other components can work with. Imagine it as a translator who speaks both binary HTTP/2 and the internal language of our server components. This component encapsulates all the complexity of binary protocol parsing, endianness handling, and frame validation.</p>\n<p>The Frame Parser implements the core binary framing logic defined in RFC 7540 Section 4. It reads the 9-byte frame header to extract frame length, type, flags, and stream ID, then reads the appropriate number of payload bytes. It handles frame type-specific parsing for DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, WINDOW_UPDATE, and other frame types. The parser validates frame structure including length limits (frames cannot exceed the negotiated maximum frame size), reserved bit constraints, and frame type-specific validation rules.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Parse Logic</th>\n<th>Validation Rules</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>DATA</td>\n<td>Read payload bytes directly</td>\n<td>Must have non-zero stream ID, respect flow control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HEADERS</td>\n<td>Extract header block fragment</td>\n<td>May have padding, END_HEADERS flag handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SETTINGS</td>\n<td>Parse key-value setting pairs</td>\n<td>Must have stream ID zero, ACK flag handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PING</td>\n<td>Read 8-byte opaque data</td>\n<td>Must have stream ID zero, exactly 8 bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GOAWAY</td>\n<td>Extract last stream ID and error code</td>\n<td>Must have stream ID zero, includes debug data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Extract window size increment</td>\n<td>Must be positive, validate against current window</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Stream Manager</strong> orchestrates the multiplexed stream lifecycle and implements the complex state machines that govern stream behavior. Think of it as a project manager who tracks multiple concurrent projects (streams), each with their own lifecycle, dependencies, and resource requirements. This component maintains the mapping between stream IDs and stream objects, enforces stream state transitions, and implements priority-based scheduling.</p>\n<p>The Stream Manager implements the stream state machine defined in RFC 7540 Section 5.1, tracking each stream through states: idle, reserved (local/remote), open, half-closed (local/remote), and closed. It enforces state transition rules, such as preventing DATA frames from being sent on streams in half-closed-local state. The component manages stream ID allocation, ensuring clients use odd-numbered IDs and the server uses even-numbered IDs for server-initiated streams like server push.</p>\n<p>Priority handling is one of the Stream Manager&#39;s most complex responsibilities. It maintains a dependency tree where streams can depend on other streams with associated weights. When multiple streams have data to send, the Stream Manager uses this priority information to determine scheduling order. The default priority scheme gives equal weight to all streams, but clients can send PRIORITY frames to establish dependencies and adjust weights.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stream State</th>\n<th>Allowed Frame Types</th>\n<th>Transition Triggers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Idle</td>\n<td>HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE</td>\n<td>Receiving HEADERS → open/half-closed-remote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Open</td>\n<td>DATA, HEADERS, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>END_STREAM flag → half-closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Half-Closed-Local</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>Receiving END_STREAM → closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Half-Closed-Remote</td>\n<td>DATA, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>Sending END_STREAM → closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Closed</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>Stream cleanup after timeout</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>HPACK Engine</strong> implements the sophisticated header compression algorithm defined in RFC 7541. Think of it as a specialized librarian who maintains both a reference collection (static table) and a personalized collection (dynamic table) of commonly used headers, plus a shorthand notation system (Huffman coding) to compress header values. This component significantly reduces bandwidth usage by eliminating redundant header transmission.</p>\n<p>The HPACK Engine maintains two tables: a static table with 61 predefined entries for common HTTP headers like <code>:method GET</code> and <code>:status 200</code>, and a dynamic table that grows during the connection as new headers are encountered. When encoding headers, it first checks if the header name-value pair exists in either table and can reference it by index. If only the name exists, it can use literal representation with incremental indexing to add the new name-value pair to the dynamic table for future reference.</p>\n<p>The engine implements Huffman coding for compressing header values using the static Huffman table defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B. This provides additional compression for header values that don&#39;t benefit from table-based compression. The combination of table-based indexing and Huffman coding typically achieves 85-95% header compression ratios compared to plain text HTTP/1.1 headers.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Compression Technique</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Compression Ratio</th>\n<th>Processing Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Indexed Header Field</td>\n<td>Exact name-value match in tables</td>\n<td>~95% reduction</td>\n<td>Very low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal with Incremental Indexing</td>\n<td>New header to add to dynamic table</td>\n<td>~60% reduction</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal Never Indexed</td>\n<td>Sensitive headers (cookies, auth)</td>\n<td>~40% reduction</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huffman Encoding</td>\n<td>String compression for header values</td>\n<td>~40% reduction</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Flow Controller</strong> manages backpressure and prevents overwhelming receivers with more data than they can process. Think of it as a sophisticated water valve system where each stream has its own valve (stream-level flow control) and there&#39;s also a main valve for the entire connection (connection-level flow control). This prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers and ensures fair resource allocation among concurrent streams.</p>\n<p>Flow control in HTTP/2 operates on two levels simultaneously. Connection-level flow control limits the total amount of DATA frame payload bytes that can be sent across all streams combined. Stream-level flow control limits DATA frames for individual streams. Both the sender and receiver maintain flow control windows - the sender tracks how much data it&#39;s allowed to send, and the receiver tracks how much buffer space it has available.</p>\n<p>The Flow Controller tracks these windows and processes WINDOW_UPDATE frames that increase the available send window. When a stream or connection window reaches zero, the Flow Controller queues additional DATA frames until window space becomes available. This queuing mechanism implements backpressure - if the receiver is slow to process data and send WINDOW_UPDATE frames, the sender naturally slows down its transmission rate.</p>\n<p>| Window Type | Scope | Initial Size | Update Mechanism | Backpressure Behavior |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Connection Window | All streams combined | 65535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE with stream ID 0 | Queue data across all streams |\n| Stream Window | Individual stream | 65535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE with specific stream ID | Queue data for that stream only |</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Component Communication Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Components need to coordinate complex interactions like frame processing, stream state updates, and flow control without creating tight coupling or circular dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Direct method calls between components</li>\n<li>Event-driven architecture with message passing</li>\n<li>Layered architecture with defined interfaces</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Layered architecture with defined interfaces and minimal direct coupling</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Layered architecture provides clear separation of concerns, makes testing easier by allowing component isolation, and follows the natural data flow from binary frames to application-level HTTP semantics.

Think of this structure like a building where each floor has a specific purpose: the foundation handles raw TCP connections, the mechanical floor handles binary protocol details, the office floors handle business logic (streams and compression), and the penthouse provides the clean HTTP API to applications.</p>\n<p>This organization enables developers to understand and modify individual layers without needing deep knowledge of all layers. A developer working on HPACK compression doesn&#39;t need to understand TCP socket management, and someone optimizing stream prioritization doesn&#39;t need to know binary frame parsing details.</p>\n<p><strong>Package Organization</strong> follows Go&#39;s standard project layout with clear separation between executable code, internal implementation, and public APIs.

Think of this threading model like a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush: there&#39;s a host (connection acceptor) seating customers, dedicated line cooks (connection handlers) for each table section, prep cooks (frame processors) handling specialized tasks, and an expediter (stream coordinator) ensuring orders are completed in the right priority order and nothing gets backed up.</p>\n<p>This analogy helps explain why we can&#39;t simply use one thread per request like HTTP/1.1 - in HTTP/2, multiple requests share a single connection, so we need coordination between requests and careful resource management to prevent one slow request from blocking others.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection-Level Concurrency</strong> forms the foundation of the threading model. Each TCP connection runs in its own goroutine, providing natural isolation between different clients while enabling full multiplexing within each connection. This design choice eliminates most synchronization overhead between connections while focusing thread safety concerns on the more complex intra-connection coordination.</p>\n<p>When a new TCP connection arrives, the server spawns a dedicated Connection Handler goroutine that owns that connection for its entire lifecycle. This goroutine manages the connection preface, settings negotiation, and coordinates all frame processing for that connection. It maintains a continuous read loop that parses incoming frames and routes them to appropriate handlers based on frame type and stream ID.</p>\n<p>The Connection Handler implements a hybrid push-pull model for frame processing. Control frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY) are processed immediately in the connection goroutine to minimize latency for connection-level coordination. Stream-specific frames (DATA, HEADERS) are dispatched to stream-specific goroutines or queued for batch processing depending on current load and stream state.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Concurrency Pattern</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Synchronization</th>\n<th>Resource Sharing</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>One goroutine per connection</td>\n<td>Connection lifecycle, frame routing</td>\n<td>Minimal (connection-scoped)</td>\n<td>TCP socket, connection state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goroutine pool for stream processing</td>\n<td>DATA and HEADERS frame handling</td>\n<td>Channel-based work queues</td>\n<td>Stream state, HPACK tables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dedicated compression goroutine</td>\n<td>HPACK encoding/decoding</td>\n<td>Mutex on dynamic table</td>\n<td>Dynamic table, Huffman decoder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Background maintenance goroutine</td>\n<td>Stream cleanup, window updates</td>\n<td>Periodic synchronization</td>\n<td>Connection-wide state</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Stream Processing Architecture</strong> handles the complex challenge of processing multiple concurrent streams over a single connection while maintaining proper ordering guarantees and flow control constraints. Each active stream is associated with a lightweight stream processor that maintains stream state and handles stream-specific frame processing.</p>\n<p>Stream processors are not full goroutines - creating thousands of goroutines for thousands of potential streams would create excessive overhead. Instead, the system uses a bounded goroutine pool where stream processing work is queued and executed by available worker goroutines. This provides parallelism for independent stream operations while controlling resource usage.</p>\n<p>The critical insight is that while HTTP/2 allows frame interleaving, certain operations must maintain ordering guarantees. HEADERS frames that contain the END_HEADERS flag must be processed in order to maintain proper HPACK dynamic table state. DATA frames can be processed out of order as long as flow control windows are updated atomically.</p>\n<p>Stream processing implements a two-phase approach: parse phase and execute phase. The parse phase extracts frame data and updates protocol state (stream state machine, flow control windows, HPACK tables). The execute phase performs application-level processing like invoking HTTP handlers. The parse phase requires serialization to maintain protocol correctness, while the execute phase can be fully parallelized across streams.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stream Processing Phase</th>\n<th>Concurrency Level</th>\n<th>Synchronization Requirements</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frame parsing</td>\n<td>Sequential per connection</td>\n<td>Connection-level mutex</td>\n<td>Low (binary parsing is fast)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK decompression</td>\n<td>Sequential per connection</td>\n<td>Dynamic table mutex</td>\n<td>Medium (Huffman decoding)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream state updates</td>\n<td>Sequential per stream</td>\n<td>Stream-level mutex</td>\n<td>Low (state machine updates)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Application processing</td>\n<td>Parallel across streams</td>\n<td>No synchronization needed</td>\n<td>High (HTTP handler execution)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Synchronization Strategy</strong> minimizes lock contention while ensuring protocol correctness through a combination of lock ordering, fine-grained locking, and lock-free data structures where appropriate. The primary challenge is coordinating access to shared state like HPACK dynamic tables, connection-level flow control windows, and the stream registry.</p>\n<p>HPACK dynamic table access requires the most careful synchronization because header compression and decompression operations modify shared table state. The system uses a single reader-writer mutex for each connection&#39;s HPACK context, allowing concurrent read operations (header decompression) while serializing write operations (table updates during header processing).</p>\n<p>Flow control synchronization operates at two levels: connection-level windows that affect all streams, and stream-level windows that are independent. Connection-level window updates use atomic operations to avoid lock overhead for the common case of window consumption. Stream-level windows use fine-grained locks per stream to enable parallel processing of different streams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Goroutine-per-Connection vs Shared Thread Pool</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 server needs to handle many concurrent connections efficiently while managing complex per-connection state</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>One goroutine per connection with internal stream multiplexing</li>\n<li>Shared thread pool processing frames from all connections</li>\n<li>Hybrid model with connection goroutines plus worker pools</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: One goroutine per connection with internal stream multiplexing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Connection-scoped goroutines provide natural isolation for connection state (HPACK tables, settings, flow control windows) without complex synchronization.

The system implements a lock-free approach for the common case of window consumption combined with synchronized updates for window increments.</p>\n<p>Each stream maintains its flow control state using atomic integers for current window size and pending data queue length. When DATA frames arrive, the system atomically decrements the appropriate windows (both connection-level and stream-level) and queues the data for processing.

This operation requires coordination between the frame processing goroutine and any goroutines with queued data. The system uses a combination of atomic operations for window updates and channel signaling to wake up blocked senders.</p>\n<p>The critical insight is that flow control must never drop or reorder data, even under high concurrency. The system maintains strict ordering guarantees by processing WINDOW_UPDATE frames in the connection goroutine and using atomic operations for all window state changes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Flow Control Operation</th>\n<th>Threading Model</th>\n<th>Synchronization</th>\n<th>Performance Characteristics</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Window consumption (sending DATA)</td>\n<td>Per-connection goroutine</td>\n<td>Atomic decrement</td>\n<td>High throughput, lock-free</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window updates (WINDOW_UPDATE)</td>\n<td>Per-connection goroutine</td>\n<td>Atomic increment + signaling</td>\n<td>Medium latency for blocked senders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backpressure queue management</td>\n<td>Dedicated flow control goroutine</td>\n<td>Channel-based coordination</td>\n<td>Bounded memory usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-stream window coordination</td>\n<td>Connection goroutine coordination</td>\n<td>Connection-level atomic state</td>\n<td>Prevents connection-level deadlock</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: HPACK Dynamic Table Race Conditions</strong>\nA common mistake is allowing concurrent access to HPACK dynamic tables during header compression and decompression. Since the dynamic table is modified during header processing (entries are added with incremental indexing), concurrent header operations on the same connection can corrupt table state or produce incorrect compression results. Always serialize HPACK operations per connection using a mutex or by processing all headers in the connection goroutine.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Flow Control Window Underflow</strong>\nAnother frequent error is failing to check flow control windows atomically before sending DATA frames. If one goroutine checks that window space is available, but another goroutine consumes that space before the first goroutine sends its data, the window can go negative, violating the HTTP/2 specification. Use atomic compare-and-swap operations or process all DATA frame sending in a single goroutine per connection.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream State Machine Race Conditions</strong>\nStream state transitions must be atomic with respect to frame processing. If one goroutine is processing a DATA frame while another processes a RST_STREAM frame for the same stream, the stream can end up in an inconsistent state. Either serialize all frame processing for each stream or use fine-grained locking with careful attention to lock ordering to prevent deadlocks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This subsection provides concrete implementation direction for building the HTTP/2 server architecture described above.

Where HTTP/1.1 was like a simple post office with one counter processing letters sequentially, HTTP/2 is like a modern logistics hub with binary-encoded packages, compressed addressing labels, multiple conveyor belts (streams) running simultaneously, and smart routing systems. Each component—frames, streams, connections, and compression tables—serves a specific role in this complex but efficient system.</p>\n<p>The data model forms the foundation upon which all HTTP/2 operations are built. Unlike HTTP/1.1&#39;s text-based approach where messages are parsed character by character, HTTP/2 operates on structured <strong>binary framing</strong> where every piece of information has a precisely defined format. This binary approach enables features like <strong>multiplexing</strong> (multiple concurrent streams), <strong>HPACK</strong> header compression, and sophisticated <strong>flow control</strong> that would be impossible or inefficient with text-based protocols.</p>\n<p>Understanding these data structures is crucial because HTTP/2&#39;s complexity emerges from their interactions. Frames carry data between endpoints, streams provide the abstraction for individual request-response pairs, connections manage the overall communication channel, and HPACK tables enable efficient header compression. Each structure contains not just data but also metadata that drives the protocol&#39;s advanced features.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that HTTP/2 inverts the traditional model: instead of thinking about HTTP requests and responses, we think about frames flowing through streams over a connection. The HTTP semantics are reconstructed from these lower-level primitives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"frame-types\">Frame Types</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 frames are the atomic units of communication, analogous to packets in a network protocol. Think of frames as standardized shipping containers—each has the same 9-byte header format regardless of contents, making them easy to route and process, while the payload varies based on the frame type and purpose.</p>\n<p>Every frame begins with a common header structure that provides essential routing and processing information. This header acts like a shipping label, telling the receiver how much data to expect, what type of processing to perform, any special handling instructions (flags), and which stream the frame belongs to.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame Structure Overview</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Length</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>3 bytes</td>\n<td>Payload length (0-16,777,215 bytes), stored as 24-bit big-endian</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>1 byte</td>\n<td>Frame type identifier (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flags</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>1 byte</td>\n<td>Type-specific boolean flags for frame processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserved</td>\n<td>bit</td>\n<td>1 bit</td>\n<td>Reserved bit, must be unset (0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream ID</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>31 bits</td>\n<td>Stream identifier (0 for connection-level frames)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payload</td>\n<td>[]byte</td>\n<td>0-16MB</td>\n<td>Frame-specific data based on type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The length field uses a 24-bit representation, allowing payloads up to 16,777,215 bytes (approximately 16MB). However, the default maximum frame size is much smaller (16,384 bytes) for practical reasons—smaller frames enable better multiplexing fairness and reduce memory usage. The reserved bit in the stream ID field must always be zero; recipients should treat frames with this bit set as a connection error.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Fixed 9-Byte Header Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need consistent frame parsing regardless of frame type and content</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Variable-length headers, type-specific headers, fixed-length headers</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Fixed 9-byte header for all frame types</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Enables efficient parsing with known header size, simplifies frame routing logic, and provides sufficient space for essential metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Some frame types may have unused header space, but parsing efficiency and implementation simplicity outweigh this minor overhead</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>DATA Frame Structure</strong></p>\n<p>DATA frames carry the actual HTTP request and response payloads—the body content that applications care about. Think of DATA frames as the cargo containers in our shipping analogy, carrying the actual goods while the frame header provides the shipping information.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Padding Length</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>Optional field present only if PADDED flag is set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data</td>\n<td>[]byte</td>\n<td>Actual HTTP payload data for the stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Padding</td>\n<td>[]byte</td>\n<td>Optional random bytes for traffic analysis protection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>DATA frames support optional padding for security purposes. When the <code>PADDED</code> flag is set, the first byte of the payload indicates how many padding bytes follow the actual data. This padding helps prevent traffic analysis attacks by obscuring the actual payload size, though it comes at the cost of bandwidth overhead.</p>\n<p>The <code>END_STREAM</code> flag on DATA frames indicates that this is the final frame for the stream in this direction. This flag is crucial for stream lifecycle management—when a server sends a DATA frame with <code>END_STREAM</code> set, it signals that the response is complete and the stream transitions to a half-closed state.</p>\n<p><strong>HEADERS Frame Structure</strong></p>\n<p>HEADERS frames contain HTTP header fields compressed using HPACK encoding. These frames are analogous to address labels on our shipping containers, but using a sophisticated compression scheme that references previously seen addresses to save space.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Padding Length</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>Optional field present only if PADDED flag is set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exclusive</td>\n<td>bit</td>\n<td>Stream dependency exclusivity flag (if PRIORITY flag set)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Dependency</td>\n<td>uint31</td>\n<td>Dependent stream ID (if PRIORITY flag set)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>Stream priority weight 1-256 (if PRIORITY flag set)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Header Block Fragment</td>\n<td>[]byte</td>\n<td>HPACK-compressed header fields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Padding</td>\n<td>[]byte</td>\n<td>Optional random padding bytes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>HEADERS frames can include priority information when the <code>PRIORITY</code> flag is set. The priority fields establish a dependency tree that helps servers decide how to allocate resources among concurrent streams. A stream can depend on another stream (creating a parent-child relationship) and have a weight indicating its relative priority among siblings.</p>\n<p>The <code>END_HEADERS</code> flag indicates whether this frame contains the complete header block or if additional CONTINUATION frames will follow. The <code>END_STREAM</code> flag serves the same purpose as in DATA frames—marking the final frame in one direction of the stream.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The header block fragment contains HPACK-compressed data that must be processed sequentially to maintain the compression context. Frames cannot be reordered or processed independently when they contain header data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>SETTINGS Frame Structure</strong></p>\n<p>SETTINGS frames configure connection-level parameters and capabilities between endpoints. Think of these as the initial handshake in our postal facility where both sides agree on operating procedures, maximum package sizes, and processing capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Identifier</td>\n<td>uint16</td>\n<td>Setting identifier (predefined constants)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Value</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>32-bit setting value</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>SETTINGS frames contain zero or more setting parameter pairs, each consisting of a 16-bit identifier and 32-bit value. These frames always have stream ID 0, indicating they apply to the entire connection rather than individual streams.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Settings Parameters</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Setting</th>\n<th>Identifier</th>\n<th>Default Value</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HEADER_TABLE_SIZE</td>\n<td>0x1</td>\n<td>4096</td>\n<td>Maximum HPACK dynamic table size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ENABLE_PUSH</td>\n<td>0x2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Server push capability (1=enabled, 0=disabled)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</td>\n<td>0x3</td>\n<td>unlimited</td>\n<td>Maximum concurrent streams allowed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</td>\n<td>0x4</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>Initial flow control window size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MAX_FRAME_SIZE</td>\n<td>0x5</td>\n<td>16384</td>\n<td>Maximum frame payload size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE</td>\n<td>0x6</td>\n<td>unlimited</td>\n<td>Maximum header list size in bytes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ACK</code> flag in SETTINGS frames creates a request-response pattern. When an endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame without the <code>ACK</code> flag, it must apply the settings and send a SETTINGS frame with the <code>ACK</code> flag set to confirm receipt. This ensures both sides agree on the connection parameters before proceeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Control Frame Types</strong></p>\n<p>Several frame types handle connection and stream management rather than carrying application data. These frames are like the control signals in our postal facility that coordinate operations, report problems, and manage traffic flow.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Stream ID</th>\n<th>Key Fields</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PING</td>\n<td>Connection liveness testing</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>8-byte opaque data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GOAWAY</td>\n<td>Graceful connection termination</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Last stream ID, error code, debug data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Flow control window adjustment</td>\n<td>0 or stream</td>\n<td>31-bit window size increment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>Immediate stream termination</td>\n<td>stream</td>\n<td>32-bit error code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CONTINUATION</td>\n<td>Header block continuation</td>\n<td>stream</td>\n<td>Header block fragment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>PING frames enable connection liveness testing and round-trip time measurement. They contain 8 bytes of opaque data that the recipient must echo back in a PING frame with the <code>ACK</code> flag set. This mechanism helps detect network partitions and measure connection latency.</p>\n<p>GOAWAY frames initiate graceful connection shutdown by indicating the highest stream ID that will be processed. Streams with IDs higher than this value should be retried on a new connection. The frame includes an error code explaining the shutdown reason and optional debug data for troubleshooting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-state\">Stream State</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 streams represent individual request-response exchanges within the multiplexed connection. Think of streams as independent conveyor belts in our postal facility—each carries one conversation between client and server, but many can operate simultaneously over the same physical infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Stream state management is one of HTTP/2&#39;s most complex aspects because streams have their own lifecycle independent of the underlying connection. Understanding stream states is crucial for implementing correct multiplexing behavior, resource management, and error handling.</p>\n<p><strong>Stream State Machine</strong></p>\n<p>The stream state machine governs how streams transition through their lifecycle based on frame types and directions. Each state represents a different phase of the request-response exchange and determines what operations are valid.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>idle</td>\n<td>Send/receive HEADERS</td>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Create stream context, allocate resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>idle</td>\n<td>Receive PUSH_PROMISE</td>\n<td>reserved (remote)</td>\n<td>Reserve stream for server push</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>idle</td>\n<td>Send PUSH_PROMISE</td>\n<td>reserved (local)</td>\n<td>Reserve stream for outgoing push</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Send END_STREAM</td>\n<td>half-closed (local)</td>\n<td>No more outbound frames allowed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>open</td>\n<td>Receive END_STREAM</td>\n<td>half-closed (remote)</td>\n<td>No more inbound frames expected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>half-closed (local)</td>\n<td>Receive END_STREAM</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Stream complete, cleanup resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>half-closed (remote)</td>\n<td>Send END_STREAM</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Stream complete, cleanup resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>any</td>\n<td>Send/receive RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td>Immediate termination, cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reserved (local)</td>\n<td>Send HEADERS</td>\n<td>half-closed (remote)</td>\n<td>Begin push promise fulfillment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reserved (remote)</td>\n<td>Receive HEADERS</td>\n<td>half-closed (local)</td>\n<td>Server beginning push delivery</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The state machine prevents protocol violations and resource leaks. For example, attempting to send DATA frames on a stream in the <code>half-closed (local)</code> state is a protocol error because the local endpoint has already signaled completion with <code>END_STREAM</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Explicit State Machine Implementation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to track stream lifecycle and prevent invalid frame sequences</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Implicit state tracking, explicit state machine, stateless frame processing</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Explicit state machine with transition validation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides clear error detection, prevents protocol violations, and simplifies debugging by making state transitions visible</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Additional complexity in implementation but much better error handling and protocol compliance</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Stream Metadata Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Each stream maintains metadata beyond just its state to support features like priority scheduling, flow control, and error handling.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ID</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Unique stream identifier within connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State</td>\n<td>StreamState</td>\n<td>Current lifecycle state (idle, open, closed, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LocalEndStream</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether local endpoint sent END_STREAM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RemoteEndStream</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether remote endpoint sent END_STREAM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Priority</td>\n<td>StreamPriority</td>\n<td>Priority weight and dependency information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SendWindow</td>\n<td>int32</td>\n<td>Available bytes for outbound DATA frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RecvWindow</td>\n<td>int32</td>\n<td>Available bytes for inbound DATA frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Headers</td>\n<td>HeaderFields</td>\n<td>Accumulated header fields from HEADERS/CONTINUATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TrailerFields</td>\n<td>HeaderFields</td>\n<td>Trailing headers received after body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Stream creation timestamp for diagnostics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastActivity</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Last frame received/sent timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorCode</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Error code if stream terminated abnormally</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>LocalEndStream</code> and <code>RemoteEndStream</code> flags track completion status in each direction independently. This supports HTTP/2&#39;s bidirectional nature where request and response completion can happen at different times. For example, a client might send a complete POST request (setting <code>LocalEndStream</code>) while the server is still sending a large response.</p>\n<p>Priority information includes both dependency relationships and weight values that influence resource allocation. The dependency field can reference another stream, creating a tree structure that guides scheduling decisions. Weight values range from 1-256 and determine relative priority among sibling streams.</p>\n<p>Flow control windows track how many bytes each endpoint can send without overwhelming the receiver. These windows operate independently in each direction and are updated through WINDOW_UPDATE frames. The initial window size comes from the connection SETTINGS, but each stream can adjust its windows independently.</p>\n<p><strong>Stream Identifier Allocation</strong></p>\n<p>Stream IDs follow specific allocation rules that prevent collisions and enable efficient lookup. Think of stream IDs as tracking numbers in our postal facility—they must be unique, predictable, and meaningful to both sender and receiver.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Initiator</th>\n<th>ID Range</th>\n<th>Usage Pattern</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client</td>\n<td>1, 3, 5, ... (odd)</td>\n<td>Client-initiated requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server</td>\n<td>2, 4, 6, ... (even)</td>\n<td>Server push streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Connection-level frames only</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Client-initiated streams use odd-numbered IDs starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 for each new stream. Server push streams use even-numbered IDs following the same incrementing pattern. Stream ID 0 is reserved for connection-level frames that don&#39;t belong to any specific stream.</p>\n<p>The incrementing requirement means stream IDs must be allocated in order—a client cannot create stream 5 before stream 3. This ordering simplifies connection state management and helps detect protocol violations. However, streams can complete out of order; stream 5 might finish before stream 3.</p>\n<p>Stream ID exhaustion (reaching the maximum 31-bit value) requires opening a new connection. In practice, this limit (over 2 billion streams) is rarely reached, but implementations should handle this gracefully by refusing new stream creation and potentially initiating connection migration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream ID Reuse</strong>\nA common implementation mistake is attempting to reuse stream IDs after streams close. HTTP/2 explicitly forbids this—once a stream ID is used, it cannot be reused on the same connection. Attempting to create a stream with a previously used ID must trigger a connection error. This restriction prevents confusion and simplifies state management.</p>\n<p><strong>Stream Priority and Dependencies</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 supports prioritization through a dependency tree system where streams can depend on other streams and specify relative weights. This system helps servers decide resource allocation when handling multiple concurrent requests.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>StreamDependency</td>\n<td>uint31</td>\n<td>0-2^31-1</td>\n<td>ID of stream this stream depends on</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exclusive</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>true/false</td>\n<td>Whether dependency is exclusive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>1-256</td>\n<td>Relative priority weight</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Stream dependencies create parent-child relationships where child streams should be prioritized only after their parent completes. The exclusive flag determines whether a new dependency replaces existing children (exclusive=true) or joins them as siblings (exclusive=false).</p>\n<p>Weight values provide relative prioritization among sibling streams. A stream with weight 200 should receive roughly twice the resources of a stream with weight 100, assuming all other factors are equal. However, priority is advisory—servers can use this information to guide scheduling but are not required to implement any specific algorithm.</p>\n<p>The dependency tree can change dynamically as streams open and close. When a parent stream closes, its children typically become children of the parent&#39;s parent, maintaining the relative priority relationships. Implementations must handle circular dependencies by breaking cycles, usually by making the dependent stream a child of the dependency target&#39;s parent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-state\">Connection State</h3>\n<p>The HTTP/2 connection represents the overall communication channel between client and server, managing multiple concurrent streams and connection-level settings. Think of the connection as the central control system for our postal facility—it coordinates all the conveyor belts (streams), manages facility-wide policies, and handles communication with the other facility.</p>\n<p>Connection state is more complex than individual stream state because it must coordinate multiple streams while maintaining its own configuration, flow control windows, and error handling. The connection acts as both a container for streams and an active participant in the protocol with its own frame types and state transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>Connection-level settings affect all streams and overall behavior.

When the local endpoint sends a SETTINGS frame, it&#39;s declaring the values the remote endpoint should use when sending to the local endpoint. This asymmetry allows each side to declare its own capabilities and constraints.</p>\n<p>Settings changes take effect immediately upon acknowledgment (SETTINGS frame with ACK flag). However, some settings like <code>InitialWindowSize</code> only affect new streams, while others like <code>MaxFrameSize</code> affect all subsequent frames. Implementation must carefully handle the timing of settings application to avoid protocol violations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate Local and Remote Settings</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Settings are directional—each endpoint declares constraints for the other</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single settings object, bidirectional settings, separate local/remote tracking</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Track local and remote settings separately</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Prevents confusion about which constraints apply in which direction, enables asymmetric configurations, and simplifies validation logic</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly more complex state management but much clearer semantics and fewer bugs</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection Flow Control</strong></p>\n<p>Connection-level flow control operates independently of stream-level flow control, providing an additional layer of backpressure management. This dual-level system ensures that individual streams cannot monopolize connection resources while still allowing fine-grained per-stream control.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Window Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Initial Size</th>\n<th>Update Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Send</td>\n<td>Bytes we can send to remote</td>\n<td>InitialWindowSize × 1</td>\n<td>Remote WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Recv</td>\n<td>Bytes remote can send to us</td>\n<td>InitialWindowSize × 1</td>\n<td>Our WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Send</td>\n<td>Per-stream send allowance</td>\n<td>InitialWindowSize</td>\n<td>Remote WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Recv</td>\n<td>Per-stream recv allowance</td>\n<td>InitialWindowSize</td>\n<td>Our WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Every DATA frame payload consumes both connection-level and stream-level send window. Before sending a DATA frame, the implementation must verify that both windows have sufficient space. If either window is exhausted, the frame cannot be sent until the appropriate WINDOW_UPDATE frame arrives.</p>\n<p>Window updates can target either the connection (stream ID 0) or specific streams (stream ID &gt; 0). Connection window updates affect the overall connection allowance, while stream window updates affect only that stream. Both types of updates are cumulative—receiving multiple WINDOW_UPDATE frames adds their values to the current window size.</p>\n<p>Window size management requires careful accounting to prevent underflow (sending more than allowed) and overflow (accumulating windows larger than 2^31-1). Underflow is a protocol error requiring connection termination, while overflow should be treated as the maximum window size.</p>\n<p><strong>Active Streams Management</strong></p>\n<p>The connection maintains a registry of all active streams along with their states and metadata. This registry enables frame routing, resource management, and cleanup operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Registry Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>StreamMap</td>\n<td>map[uint32]*Stream</td>\n<td>Active stream lookup by ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastStreamID</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Highest stream ID seen from remote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NextStreamID</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Next stream ID to allocate locally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StreamCount</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Current number of open streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxStreams</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Maximum concurrent streams allowed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ClosedStreams</td>\n<td>LRU cache</td>\n<td>Recently closed streams for late frame detection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The stream map provides O(1) lookup for routing incoming frames to their destination streams. Frame processing involves extracting the stream ID from the frame header and looking up the corresponding stream object. Frames for unknown streams may indicate protocol errors or late arrivals after stream cleanup.</p>\n<p>Stream counting enforces the <code>MaxConcurrentStreams</code> setting by rejecting new stream creation when the limit is reached. The count includes all streams in active states (open, half-closed) but excludes idle and closed streams. This enforcement prevents resource exhaustion attacks where one endpoint creates excessive streams.</p>\n<p>The closed streams cache handles the common case of frames arriving after stream cleanup. When a stream closes, its full state is discarded to save memory, but a lightweight entry remains in the cache to detect and properly handle late-arriving frames. This cache typically uses LRU eviction with a modest size limit.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream Cleanup Timing</strong>\nA subtle but critical issue is determining when to clean up closed streams. Cleaning up too aggressively can cause protocol errors if late frames arrive, but keeping streams too long wastes memory. The recommended approach is immediate lightweight cleanup (remove from active map but keep in closed cache) followed by eventual full cleanup after a timeout period or cache pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Error Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Connection errors affect the entire connection and typically result in connection termination through GOAWAY frames. These errors indicate protocol violations, resource exhaustion, or other conditions that make continued operation impossible or unsafe.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Type</th>\n<th>Error Code</th>\n<th>Typical Causes</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Protocol Error</td>\n<td>0x1</td>\n<td>Malformed frames, invalid state transitions</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Internal Error</td>\n<td>0x2</td>\n<td>Implementation bugs, resource allocation failures</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control Error</td>\n<td>0x3</td>\n<td>Window violations, invalid WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settings Timeout</td>\n<td>0x4</td>\n<td>No SETTINGS ACK received</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Closed</td>\n<td>0x5</td>\n<td>Frames on closed streams</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Size Error</td>\n<td>0x6</td>\n<td>Frames exceeding size limits</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refused Stream</td>\n<td>0x7</td>\n<td>Cannot create requested stream</td>\n<td>Send RST_STREAM, continue connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cancel</td>\n<td>0x8</td>\n<td>Processing cancelled</td>\n<td>Context-dependent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Compression Error</td>\n<td>0x9</td>\n<td>HPACK decompression failure</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connect Error</td>\n<td>0xa</td>\n<td>TCP connection problems</td>\n<td>Close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enhance Calm</td>\n<td>0xb</td>\n<td>Excessive resource usage</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inadequate Security</td>\n<td>0xc</td>\n<td>TLS configuration insufficient</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP/1.1 Required</td>\n<td>0xd</td>\n<td>Must downgrade to HTTP/1.1</td>\n<td>Send GOAWAY, close connection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Most connection errors require immediate termination because they indicate fundamental protocol violations that cannot be recovered. The GOAWAY frame provides graceful termination by indicating which streams completed successfully and can be safely retried on a new connection.</p>\n<p>Some errors like <code>Refused Stream</code> are stream-specific and can be handled with RST_STREAM frames without affecting the connection. However, repeated stream errors might indicate systematic problems that warrant connection termination.</p>\n<p>The error handling implementation should distinguish between recoverable and fatal conditions, provide clear error messages for debugging, and ensure proper resource cleanup during connection termination. Logging error details helps diagnose implementation bugs and protocol violations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hpack-tables\">HPACK Tables</h3>\n<p>HPACK (HTTP/2 Header Compression) uses a sophisticated table-based compression scheme that maintains both static and dynamic tables to achieve significant header size reduction. Think of HPACK tables as a sophisticated address book system in our postal facility—frequently used addresses are stored in numbered slots so future packages can reference them by number instead of writing the full address.</p>\n<p>The compression effectiveness comes from HTTP&#39;s repetitive nature: most requests contain many identical or similar headers (User-Agent, Accept, Authorization, etc.). Instead of transmitting these headers repeatedly, HPACK assigns them indices and transmits only the index references along with any new or changed headers.</p>\n<p>HPACK operates at the connection level with separate compression contexts for each direction. This means client-to-server headers and server-to-client headers have independent compression state, allowing each endpoint to optimize for its typical header patterns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that HPACK provides stateful compression—the compression context evolves as headers are processed, creating better compression ratios but requiring careful synchronization between endpoints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Static Table Structure</strong></p>\n<p>The static table contains 61 predefined entries covering the most common HTTP headers. This table is defined by RFC 7541 and is identical for all HTTP/2 connections, providing immediate compression benefits without any setup overhead.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Index</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>:authority</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>:method</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>:method</td>\n<td>POST</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>:path</td>\n<td>/</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>:path</td>\n<td>/index.html</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>:scheme</td>\n<td>http</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>:scheme</td>\n<td>https</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>204</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>206</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>304</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>404</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>:status</td>\n<td>500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>accept-charset</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>accept-encoding</td>\n<td>gzip, deflate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>accept-language</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>accept-ranges</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>accept</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>access-control-allow-origin</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>age</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>allow</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>authorization</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>cache-control</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>content-disposition</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>content-encoding</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>content-language</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>content-length</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>content-location</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>content-range</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>content-type</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>cookie</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>date</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>etag</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>expect</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>expires</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>from</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>host</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>if-match</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>if-modified-since</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41</td>\n<td>if-none-match</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>if-range</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>43</td>\n<td>if-unmodified-since</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>last-modified</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>link</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>location</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>47</td>\n<td>max-forwards</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>48</td>\n<td>proxy-authenticate</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>49</td>\n<td>proxy-authorization</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>range</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51</td>\n<td>referer</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>52</td>\n<td>refresh</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>retry-after</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>server</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>55</td>\n<td>set-cookie</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>strict-transport-security</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>transfer-encoding</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>user-agent</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>59</td>\n<td>vary</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>via</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>www-authenticate</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The static table includes HTTP/2 pseudo-headers (prefixed with <code>:</code>) that replace the HTTP/1.1 request line and status line. These pseudo-headers must appear before regular headers and have specific ordering requirements.</p>\n<p>Entries with empty values represent name-only matches. For example, index 1 (<code>:authority</code>) matches any header with that name regardless of value. This allows partial compression where the name is indexed but the value is transmitted literally.</p>\n<p>The static table provides immediate benefits: a simple <code>GET /</code> request can reference indices 2 and 4 instead of transmitting the full <code>:method: GET</code> and <code>:path: /</code> headers. More complex requests benefit even more as they reference additional static entries.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Table Structure</strong></p>\n<p>The dynamic table maintains connection-specific header entries that accumulate during the connection lifetime. This table starts empty and grows as headers are processed, creating increasingly effective compression for connection-specific patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Entries</td>\n<td>[]HeaderEntry</td>\n<td>Ordered list of header name-value pairs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Current table size in bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxSize</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Maximum table size from SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>InsertionPoint</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Index where next entry will be inserted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EvictionCount</td>\n<td>uint32</td>\n<td>Number of entries evicted due to size constraints</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Dynamic table entries are indexed starting from 62 (after the static table) and use a FIFO eviction strategy.

This decision balances compression benefits against table memory usage. Headers likely to repeat (like Authorization tokens) benefit from indexing, while unique headers (like timestamps) do not.</p>\n<p>Index lookup involves checking both static and dynamic tables. Indices 1-61 reference the static table directly, while indices 62 and above reference dynamic table entries. The implementation must handle the index offset correctly to avoid off-by-one errors.</p>\n<p>Eviction maintains the FIFO property—oldest entries are removed first regardless of their usage frequency. This simplicity prevents complex cache management but may evict useful entries. Some implementations use smarter eviction policies as optimizations, but basic FIFO is required for interoperability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: FIFO Eviction Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need deterministic eviction behavior for interoperability between implementations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: LRU eviction, frequency-based eviction, FIFO eviction</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: FIFO eviction as specified in RFC 7541</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Ensures identical table state between encoder and decoder, simplifies implementation, and avoids complex cache management algorithms</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: May evict useful entries that could provide better compression, but guarantees correctness and interoperability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Header Encoding Representations</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK supports multiple encoding representations for headers based on caching strategy and compression requirements. These representations provide flexibility in balancing compression ratio, table management, and processing overhead.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Representation</th>\n<th>Pattern</th>\n<th>Indexing</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Indexed Header</td>\n<td>1xxxxxxx</td>\n<td>Reference only</td>\n<td>Exact name-value match in table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal with Incremental Indexing</td>\n<td>01xxxxxx</td>\n<td>Add to dynamic table</td>\n<td>Likely to repeat in future</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal without Indexing</td>\n<td>0000xxxx</td>\n<td>No table modification</td>\n<td>Unique or security-sensitive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Literal Never Indexed</td>\n<td>0001xxxx</td>\n<td>No indexing, no proxy caching</td>\n<td>Security-sensitive values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic Table Size Update</td>\n<td>001xxxxx</td>\n<td>Table management</td>\n<td>Change table size limit</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Indexed headers provide maximum compression by referencing table entries with a single byte (for indices 1-127). This representation handles the common case where headers exactly match previous values.</p>\n<p>Literal representations handle new or modified headers by transmitting the name (indexed or literal) and value (literal or Huffman-encoded). The indexing behavior determines whether the header is added to the dynamic table for future reference.</p>\n<p>The &quot;never indexed&quot; representation provides security for sensitive headers like Authorization or Set-Cookie values. These headers are transmitted literally but marked to prevent caching by intermediaries that might expose the values.</p>\n<p><strong>Huffman Encoding Integration</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK optionally applies Huffman encoding to literal string values (header names and values) to achieve additional compression. The Huffman codes are optimized for typical HTTP header content and can provide 20-30% additional compression.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>String Type</th>\n<th>Huffman Flag</th>\n<th>Encoding Options</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Header Name</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Literal or Huffman-encoded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Header Value</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Literal or Huffman-encoded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indexed Reference</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Index number only</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Huffman table is defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B and includes optimized codes for all 256 possible byte values. Common characters in HTTP headers (letters, digits, common punctuation) receive shorter codes, while rare characters receive longer codes.</p>\n<p>Huffman encoding operates at the byte level and requires careful handling of padding bits in the final symbol. The decoder must validate that padding bits are all 1&#39;s as specified, preventing certain types of compression attacks.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Huffman Decoding Boundary Errors</strong>\nA common implementation error occurs when handling Huffman-encoded strings that don&#39;t align on byte boundaries. The final byte may contain padding bits that must be validated. Incorrect padding validation can lead to security vulnerabilities or interoperability problems. Always verify that padding bits are set to 1 and that the padding doesn&#39;t form a valid symbol prefix.</p>\n<p><strong>Table Synchronization and Error Handling</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK requires perfect synchronization between encoder and decoder tables. Any mismatch in table state causes subsequent compression/decompression failures, requiring connection termination.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Invalid Index</td>\n<td>Index exceeds table size</td>\n<td>Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Table Size Violation</td>\n<td>Entry addition exceeds limit</td>\n<td>Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Huffman Sequence</td>\n<td>Decoding failure</td>\n<td>Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String Length Mismatch</td>\n<td>Decoded length doesn&#39;t match declared</td>\n<td>Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserved Bits Set</td>\n<td>Non-zero reserved bits in patterns</td>\n<td>Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Table synchronization failures are connection-fatal because the compression context cannot be recovered. Unlike stream errors that affect only one stream, HPACK errors affect all subsequent header processing and require starting a new connection.</p>\n<p>The implementation must validate all HPACK input carefully to detect corruption or malicious input early. This includes bounds checking on indices, validating string lengths, and verifying Huffman decoding results.</p>\n<p>Proper error handling includes detailed logging for debugging while avoiding information leakage that might help attackers. HPACK errors often indicate implementation bugs rather than network issues, making good diagnostics essential for development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation

In HTTP/1.1, we send human-readable text messages that require careful parsing to understand where headers end and bodies begin. HTTP/2&#39;s binary framing is like having a standardized telegram format with a precise header that tells you exactly what type of message follows and how long it is. This structured approach eliminates ambiguity and makes parsing dramatically more efficient.</p>\n<p>The <strong>binary framing engine</strong> serves as the foundation layer of our HTTP/2 server, responsible for converting between the raw bytes on the wire and structured frame objects that higher-level components can work with. This engine must handle the intricate details of binary protocol parsing while providing a clean abstraction for the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fframe-structure.svg\" alt=\"HTTP/2 Frame Structure\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"frame-parsing\">Frame Parsing</h3>\n<p>The core challenge in HTTP/2 frame parsing lies in correctly interpreting the 9-byte frame header followed by a variable-length payload. Unlike HTTP/1.1&#39;s text-based format where parsing involves string manipulation and delimiter searching, HTTP/2 parsing requires precise binary operations with careful attention to endianness and bit manipulation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Fixed 9-Byte Header Design</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 needed a way to prefix each frame with metadata about its contents, type, and destination stream</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Variable-length headers with length prefixes, fixed-size headers, or embedded metadata within payloads</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use a fixed 9-byte header with specific bit layouts for each field</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fixed headers enable efficient parsing without lookahead, eliminate parsing ambiguity, and provide sufficient space for all necessary metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Every frame has exactly 9 bytes of overhead, but parsing becomes predictable and fast</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The frame header contains four distinct fields packed into exactly 9 bytes:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Length</td>\n<td>3 bytes</td>\n<td>uint24</td>\n<td>Size of frame payload in bytes (0 to 16,777,215)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td>1 byte</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>Frame type identifier (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flags</td>\n<td>1 byte</td>\n<td>uint8</td>\n<td>Type-specific flags (END_STREAM, END_HEADERS, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream ID</td>\n<td>4 bytes</td>\n<td>uint31</td>\n<td>Target stream identifier (31 bits, with reserved bit)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The parsing algorithm follows these precise steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Read exactly 9 bytes</strong> from the connection&#39;s input stream, handling potential partial reads due to TCP fragmentation</li>\n<li><strong>Extract the 24-bit length field</strong> by combining the first three bytes in network byte order (big-endian)</li>\n<li><strong>Validate the length field</strong> against the maximum frame size setting and connection limits</li>\n<li><strong>Extract the 8-bit type field</strong> directly from the fourth byte</li>\n<li><strong>Extract the 8-bit flags field</strong> directly from the fifth byte  </li>\n<li><strong>Extract the 31-bit stream ID</strong> from bytes 6-9, masking off the reserved bit in the most significant position</li>\n<li><strong>Validate the stream ID</strong> for proper odd/even assignment and range constraints</li>\n<li><strong>Read the payload bytes</strong> based on the length field, handling partial reads and EOF conditions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most critical aspect of frame parsing is handling the endianness correctly. HTTP/2 uses network byte order (big-endian) for all multi-byte fields, which means the most significant byte comes first on the wire. The length field requires special handling since it spans three bytes rather than a standard 2, 4, or 8-byte integer size.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reserved bit in the stream ID field must always be zero on the wire. Frames with the reserved bit set to 1 constitute a protocol violation that requires connection termination with a <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Partial Read Handling</strong>: TCP connections provide no guarantee that a single read operation will return the requested number of bytes. The frame parser must accumulate bytes until it has collected the complete header or payload, while detecting connection closures that occur mid-frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame Boundary Synchronization</strong>: If the parser ever gets out of sync with frame boundaries (due to implementation bugs or corrupted data), the entire connection becomes unusable. The parser must validate that frame headers make sense and that payload lengths align with frame boundaries.</p>\n<p>The parsing operation yields a structured <code>Frame</code> object that encapsulates all header fields plus the raw payload bytes. Higher-level components work exclusively with these structured frames rather than raw byte streams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"frame-type-implementation\">Frame Type Implementation</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 defines multiple frame types, each with specific payload formats and semantic meanings. Our implementation focuses on the core frame types essential for basic HTTP/2 functionality: DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, and WINDOW_UPDATE frames.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Frame Type Abstraction Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Different frame types have completely different payload structures and processing requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single monolithic parser, type-specific parser classes, or generic frame structure with typed payload interpretation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Generic Frame structure with type-specific payload parsing methods</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maintains parsing efficiency while allowing specialized handling of each frame type&#39;s unique requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Frame parsing and payload interpretation are separated, enabling easier testing and frame type extension</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"data-frames\">DATA Frames</h4>\n<p>DATA frames carry the actual HTTP request or response body content. They represent the payload data that applications ultimately consume, making them the most straightforward frame type from a parsing perspective.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Pad Length</td>\n<td>0-1 bytes</td>\n<td>Optional padding length (present if PADDED flag set)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td>Application data bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Padding</td>\n<td>0-255 bytes</td>\n<td>Optional zero-valued padding bytes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>DATA frame parsing involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check the PADDED flag</strong> to determine if padding length field is present</li>\n<li><strong>Extract pad length</strong> from first payload byte if PADDED flag is set</li>\n<li><strong>Validate padding length</strong> against total payload size to prevent underflow</li>\n<li><strong>Extract data portion</strong> by skipping pad length byte and trailing padding</li>\n<li><strong>Verify padding bytes</strong> are zero-valued (optional but recommended for security)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The END_STREAM flag on DATA frames indicates that no more frames will be sent on this stream from the sender, making it a critical signal for stream lifecycle management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"headers-frames\">HEADERS Frames</h4>\n<p>HEADERS frames contain HTTP header name-value pairs compressed using HPACK encoding.

Frame validation serves as the first line of defense against malformed data, protocol violations, and potential security attacks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Validation Timing Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Frame validation could occur during parsing, after parsing, or lazily when frames are processed</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Inline validation during parsing, separate validation pass, or deferred validation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate validation step immediately after successful parsing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Separates parsing complexity from validation logic, enables reusable validation for serialized frames, and provides clear error attribution</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Additional function call overhead but clearer separation of concerns and better testability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The validation process encompasses multiple categories of checks:</p>\n<h4 id=\"length-validation\">Length Validation</h4>\n<p>Frame length validation prevents buffer overflow attacks and ensures frames conform to negotiated size limits:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation</th>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Maximum frame size</td>\n<td>Length ≤ MAX_FRAME_SIZE

id=\"stream-id-validation\">Stream ID Validation</h4>\n<p>Stream ID validation ensures proper stream lifecycle and prevents protocol confusion:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation</th>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Reserved bit</td>\n<td>Most significant bit of stream ID is

are appropriate for each frame type and combination:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Valid Flags</th>\n<th>Invalid Combinations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>DATA</td>\n<td>END_STREAM, PADDED</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HEADERS</td>\n<td>END_STREAM, END_HEADERS, PADDED,

id=\"payload-structure-validation\">Payload Structure Validation</h4>\n<p>Each frame type requires specific payload structure validation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DATA frames</strong>: If PADDED flag is set, validate that padding length is less than payload length</li>\n<li><strong>HEADERS frames</strong>: Validate that priority information (if present) doesn&#39;t create circular dependencies</li>\n<li><strong>SETTINGS frames</strong>: Validate that unknown setting IDs use appropriate ranges and known settings have valid values</li>\n<li><strong>PING frames</strong>: Validate payload is exactly 8 bytes regardless of flags</li>\n<li><strong>GOAWAY frames</strong>: Validate that last stream ID is within reasonable bounds</li>\n<li><strong>WINDOW_UPDATE frames</strong>: Validate that increment is non-zero and doesn&#39;t cause window overflow</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"connection-state-validation\">Connection State Validation</h4>\n<p>Frame validation must consider the current connection state:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State Check</th>\n<th>Validation</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection preface</td>\n<td>First frame after connection must be SETTINGS</td>\n<td>PROTOCOL_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GOAWAY sent</td>\n<td>No new streams after GOAWAY</td>\n<td>PROTOCOL_ERROR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settings

state</td>\n<td>STREAM_CLOSED</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"error-response-strategy\">Error Response Strategy</h4>\n<p>When validation fails, the response depends on the error scope:</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Errors</strong> (affect entire connection):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send GOAWAY frame with appropriate error code</li>\n<li>Close the underlying TCP connection</li>\n<li>Clean up all associated streams and resources</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Stream Errors</strong> (affect single stream):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send RST_STREAM frame with appropriate error code</li>\n<li>Transition stream to closed state</li>\n<li>Continue processing other streams normally</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect Endianness Handling</strong>\nMany implementations incorrectly handle the 24-bit length field by treating it as a little-endian value instead of big-endian. This causes frame parsing to completely fail when communicating with standard HTTP/2 implementations. Always use network byte order (big-endian) conversion functions and test with known good HTTP/2 clients.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Reserved Bit Ignorance</strong>\nIgnoring the reserved bit in the stream ID field creates a subtle but serious protocol violation. Implementations that fail to mask off this bit may interpret stream IDs incorrectly, leading to frames being routed to wrong streams. Always apply a bitwise AND with <code>0x7FFFFFFF</code> to clear the reserved bit.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Partial Read Assumptions</strong>\nAssuming that socket read operations always return the requested number of bytes leads to frame corruption and parsing failures. TCP provides no such guarantee, especially under high load or with slow connections. Always check return values and accumulate bytes until the complete frame is received.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Frame Size Attack Vulnerability</strong>\nAccepting frames with extremely large length values without validation enables memory exhaustion attacks. An attacker can send a frame claiming to be 16MB but only provide a few bytes, causing the parser to allocate huge buffers. Always validate frame length against negotiated limits and read payload incrementally.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Flag Combination Blindness</strong>\nProcessing frames without validating flag combinations can lead to undefined behavior. For example, a SETTINGS frame with the ACK flag must have zero payload length, but implementations often skip this check. Invalid flag combinations indicate either implementation bugs or protocol attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4

(HPACK Compression) by implementing RFC 7541 header compression with static/dynamic tables, Huffman coding, and integer encoding capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The HPACK compression engine serves as HTTP/2&#39;s sophisticated header compression system, fundamentally transforming how headers are transmitted over the wire. Think of HPACK as an intelligent librarian system for HTTP headers. Instead of repeatedly writing out the full title of every book (header name-value pair), the librarian maintains a catalog system with shortcuts. Popular books get permanent catalog numbers (static table), frequently accessed books in the current session get temporary numbers (dynamic table), and book titles are written in a compressed shorthand notation (Huffman coding). This systematic approach dramatically reduces the overhead of header transmission while maintaining complete fidelity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fhpack-compression-flow.svg\" alt=\"HPACK Header Compression Process\"></p>\n<p>The HPACK engine operates through four interconnected mechanisms: static table lookups for predefined common headers, dynamic table management for connection-specific patterns, Huffman decoding for compressed string values, and variable-length integer encoding for efficient numeric representation. Each mechanism addresses specific inefficiencies in raw header transmission while working together to achieve optimal compression ratios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"static-table\">Static Table</h3>\n<p>The static table represents HPACK&#39;s foundation - a predefined catalog of 61 common HTTP header name-value pairs that every HTTP/2 implementation must recognize. Think of this as a universal dictionary shared between all HTTP/2 endpoints, similar to how postal abbreviations (like &quot;CA&quot; for California) are universally understood and save space on addresses.</p>\n<p>The static table contains entries ranging from index 1 to 61, with each entry representing either a complete name-value pair or just a header name. For example, index 2 represents the complete pair <code>:method GET</code>, while index 1 represents just the name <code>:authority</code> without a predetermined value. This dual approach maximizes compression opportunities - common complete pairs like <code>GET</code> methods can be represented with a single index, while common header names with variable values can leverage the name portion while encoding only the value separately.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Index</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Usage Pattern</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><code>:authority</code></td>\n<td>(empty)</td>\n<td>Host header equivalent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><code>:method</code></td>\n<td><code>GET</code></td>\n<td>Most common HTTP method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td><code>:method</code></td>\n<td><code>POST</code></td>\n<td>Second most common method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td><code>:path</code></td>\n<td><code>/</code></td>\n<td>Root path requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td><code>:status</code></td>\n<td><code>200</code></td>\n<td>Successful responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td><code>accept-encoding</code></td>\n<td><code>gzip, deflate</code></td>\n<td>Common compression preferences</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>31</td>\n<td><code>user-agent</code></td>\n<td>(empty)</td>\n<td>Browser identification header</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The static table lookup mechanism operates through direct index resolution. When the HPACK decoder encounters an indexed header field representation (identified by the first bit being 1), it extracts the index value and performs a direct array lookup. Static table entries occupy indices 1-61, making the lookup operation extremely efficient with O(1) complexity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The static table&#39;s contents were carefully chosen based on analysis of real-world HTTP traffic patterns.

Unlike the static table&#39;s universal constants, the dynamic table captures connection-specific patterns, storing recently used header name-value pairs that don&#39;t appear in the static table or have connection-specific values.</p>\n<p>Think of the dynamic table as a smart cache with a twist - it&#39;s not just a typical LRU cache, but rather a FIFO queue with size-based eviction. Imagine a conveyor belt with limited capacity measured in bytes rather than number of items. New items (header entries) are added to one end, and when the belt becomes too full, items fall off the other end regardless of how frequently they were accessed. This FIFO approach ensures deterministic behavior between encoder and decoder, as both maintain identical table state without complex frequency tracking.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Table Structure:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Constraints</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>entries</code></td>\n<td><code>[]HeaderEntry</code></td>\n<td>Ordered list of header entries</td>\n<td>FIFO ordering, newest first</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>size</code></td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>Current total size in octets</td>\n<td>Sum of all entry sizes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>maxSize</code></td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>Maximum allowed size</td>\n<td>Configurable via SETTINGS frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>insertionPoint</code></td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>Index where next entry will be inserted</td>\n<td>Always at position 0 (newest)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Each header entry in the dynamic table carries overhead beyond its name and value strings. The HPACK specification defines that each entry consumes 32 additional octets beyond the UTF-8 byte length of its name and value. This overhead accounts for implementation data structures and ensures consistent size calculations across different HTTP/2 implementations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: FIFO Eviction Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Dynamic table needs predictable eviction behavior that both encoder and decoder can maintain synchronously</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction based on access patterns</li>\n<li>FIFO (First In, First Out) eviction based on insertion order</li>\n<li>Size-based priority eviction based on entry sizes</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: FIFO eviction with size-based capacity management</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: FIFO ensures deterministic behavior without complex state synchronization.

When adding a new entry, the dynamic table first calculates the total size including the 32-octet overhead. If this addition would exceed the maximum table size, it performs preemptive eviction of the oldest entries until sufficient space exists. The new entry is then inserted at index 0 (the &quot;newest&quot; position), and all existing entries shift to higher indices.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Table Insertion Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculate new entry size: <code>len(name) + len(value) + 32</code></li>\n<li>Check if entry size exceeds maximum table size - if so, reject insertion</li>\n<li>While <code>currentSize + newEntrySize &gt; maxSize</code>, evict oldest entry (highest index)</li>\n<li>Create new <code>HeaderEntry</code> with provided name, value, and calculated size</li>\n<li>Insert entry at index 0, shifting all existing entries to higher indices</li>\n<li>Update total table size by adding new entry size</li>\n<li>Update internal bookkeeping (entry count, insertion statistics)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The dynamic table indexing scheme requires careful coordination with static table indices. Dynamic table entries occupy indices starting at 62 (immediately after the static table&#39;s highest index of 61). The dynamic table&#39;s internal index 0 (newest entry) maps to HPACK index 62, internal index 1 maps to HPACK index 63, and so forth.

UTF-8 strings must be measured in bytes (octets), not Unicode code points or characters. Always use <code>len([]byte(string))</code> in Go or equivalent byte-length functions in other languages. The total size is <code>len(nameBytes) + len(valueBytes) + 32</code>, and this exact calculation must match between encoder and decoder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"huffman-coding\">Huffman Coding</h3>\n<p>Huffman coding in HPACK provides the final layer of compression by encoding string values using variable-length bit sequences optimized for typical HTTP header content. Think of Huffman coding as a telegraph operator&#39;s shorthand system - frequently used letters get short codes (like &quot;E&quot; encoded as a single dot), while rare letters get longer codes. This approach can reduce header string sizes by 15-50% depending on content patterns.</p>\n<p>The HPACK specification defines a static Huffman table optimized for HTTP header values, based on analysis of real-world web traffic. This table assigns shorter bit sequences to characters that appear frequently in HTTP headers (like lowercase letters, digits, and common punctuation) while assigning longer sequences to rarely used characters. The encoding table is bidirectional - the same table supports both encoding strings into compressed bit sequences and decoding compressed sequences back to original strings.</p>\n<p><strong>HPACK Huffman Table Characteristics:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Character Category</th>\n<th>Code Length Range</th>\n<th>Example Characters</th>\n<th>Optimization Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Common lowercase</td>\n<td>5-6 bits</td>\n<td>a, e, i, o, s, t</td>\n<td>High frequency in header values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Digits</td>\n<td>5-6 bits</td>\n<td>0, 1, 2, 3, 4-9</td>\n<td>Common in content-length, status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Common symbols</td>\n<td>6-8 bits</td>\n<td>-, _, ., /</td>\n<td>Frequent in URLs, header names</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uppercase letters</td>\n<td>6-8 bits</td>\n<td>A, C, G, M, P</td>\n<td>Less common but still significant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Special characters</td>\n<td>10-30 bits</td>\n<td>Unicode, control chars</td>\n<td>Rare, acceptable longer encoding</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Huffman decoding process operates on a bit-by-bit basis, using the compressed byte stream to traverse a decoding tree or lookup table.

Think of this encoding as a expandable numeric notation system similar to scientific notation, but optimized for binary representation rather than human readability. Small numbers use minimal space, while larger numbers automatically extend into additional bytes as needed.</p>\n<p>The encoding scheme uses a prefix of N bits within the first byte to represent small integers directly, with the remaining (8-N) bits available for other purposes like flags or type indicators.

The single TCP connection is like the airport runway - there&#39;s only one physical runway, but multiple aircraft (streams) can be managed simultaneously through careful orchestration. Each aircraft has a unique flight number (stream ID), follows a specific flight plan (state machine), and has priority levels (weight and dependencies) that determine landing order. The air traffic controller (stream manager) tracks each aircraft&#39;s status, manages the queue when the runway is busy (flow control), and can cancel flights when necessary (RST_STREAM). Just as airports handle dozens of aircraft concurrently over a single runway through sophisticated scheduling, HTTP/2 handles multiple request-response pairs over a single TCP connection through multiplexing.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that while HTTP/1.1 was like a single-lane road where cars must wait in line, HTTP/2 is like a multi-lane highway where traffic flows independently in parallel lanes, all sharing the same underlying infrastructure but managed through intelligent routing and priority systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-state-machine\">Stream State Machine</h3>\n<p>The <strong>stream state machine</strong> forms the heart of HTTP/2&#39;s multiplexing capability, defining how individual streams transition through their lifecycle from creation to completion.

For example, if the client sends a DATA frame with END_STREAM while the server sends RST_STREAM, both frames might be in flight. The implementation must define a consistent ordering: RST_STREAM always wins and immediately transitions to closed, regardless of other pending frames. Without this rule, streams can get stuck in inconsistent states where each endpoint believes different state information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-id-allocation\">Stream ID Allocation</h3>\n<p>Stream ID allocation in HTTP/2 follows a carefully designed numbering scheme that prevents collisions, enables concurrent stream creation, and provides implicit metadata about stream ownership and directionality.

Always reset stream ID allocation to initial values (1 for client, 2 for server) when establishing a new connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"priority-scheduling\">Priority Scheduling</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s <strong>priority scheduling</strong> system enables intelligent bandwidth allocation among concurrent streams through a sophisticated weight and dependency model. Unlike simple round-robin scheduling, HTTP/2 priority allows clients to express the relative importance of resources and create dependency relationships that optimize page load performance.</p>\n<p>The priority system operates on two fundamental concepts: <strong>stream weights</strong> and <strong>dependency relationships</strong>. Stream weights range from 1 to 256 and determine the relative share of available bandwidth each stream should receive. Dependencies create parent-child relationships where child streams should only receive bandwidth after their parent stream completes or reaches certain milestones.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Priority Concept</th>\n<th>Range/Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Default Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stream Weight</td>\n<td>1-256</td>\n<td>Relative bandwidth allocation within same priority level</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dependency Stream ID</td>\n<td>0 or valid stream ID</td>\n<td>Parent stream that should be prioritized first</td>\n<td>0 (no dependency)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exclusive Flag</td>\n<td>Boolean</td>\n<td>Whether this stream should be the sole child of its parent</td>\n<td>false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Priority Tree Depth</td>\n<td>Unlimited (implementation limited)</td>\n<td>Maximum dependency chain length</td>\n<td>Typically limited to 32 levels</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The priority tree structure enables complex resource relationships common in web applications.

This creates priority inversion where less important streams consume bandwidth while critical streams wait for window updates. The solution requires integrating priority scheduling with flow control management - when high-priority streams are window-limited, the scheduler should pause lower-priority streams and send WINDOW_UPDATE frames to unblock the critical path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-limits\">Stream Limits</h3>\n<p><strong>Stream limits</strong> provide essential resource management and DoS protection for HTTP/2 servers by controlling the number of concurrent streams, enforcing creation rate limits, and providing mechanisms for immediate stream termination when necessary.

Incomplete cleanup leads to memory leaks that accumulate over connection lifetime, eventually causing server instability.

Just as traffic lights, on-ramps, and merge lanes prevent congestion by controlling how many cars enter different road segments, HTTP/2 flow control prevents network congestion by managing how much data can be sent over connection and stream channels. Unlike a simple traffic light that&#39;s either red or green, HTTP/2 flow control uses dynamic &quot;credit systems&quot; where senders receive permission tokens (window updates) that specify exactly how many bytes they&#39;re allowed to transmit before waiting for more tokens.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fflow-control-windows.svg\" alt=\"Flow Control Window Management\"></p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in HTTP/2 flow control stems from the <strong>multiplexing paradigm</strong> - multiple independent streams share a single TCP connection, creating a two-level resource management problem. At the connection level, we must prevent the aggregate data from all streams from overwhelming the receiver&#39;s network buffers. At the stream level, we must ensure that a fast-producing stream doesn&#39;t monopolize bandwidth and starve other streams. This dual-layer approach requires careful coordination between connection-wide and per-stream flow control windows, with complex interactions during window updates and backpressure scenarios.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: HTTP/2 flow control operates on a credit-based system where receivers explicitly grant permission for data transmission. This inverts the traditional TCP model where senders transmit optimistically and react to backpressure signals. The receiver-driven approach provides fine-grained control but introduces complexity around window exhaustion, update timing, and deadlock prevention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"window-management\">Window Management</h3>\n<p><strong>Window management</strong> in HTTP/2 implements a hierarchical credit system where both connections and individual streams maintain separate flow control windows. Think of this as a two-tier banking system: the connection window represents the total credit limit across all accounts (streams), while each stream window represents an individual account balance. Every DATA frame transmission requires &quot;payment&quot; from both the stream&#39;s account and the connection&#39;s master account. If either account lacks sufficient funds, the transaction (DATA frame) must wait until credit becomes available.</p>\n<p>The window management system tracks four distinct window states for each active component:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Window Type</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Initial Size</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Update Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Send Window</td>\n<td>Per-Connection</td>\n<td><code>InitialWindowSize</code> (65535)</td>\n<td>Limits total outbound DATA bytes across all streams</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE frames with StreamID=0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Send Window</td>\n<td>Per-Stream</td>\n<td><code>InitialWindowSize</code> (65535)</td>\n<td>Limits outbound DATA bytes for specific stream</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE frames with specific StreamID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Receive Window</td>\n<td>Per-Connection</td>\n<td><code>InitialWindowSize</code> (65535)</td>\n<td>Limits total inbound DATA bytes across all streams</td>\n<td>Local WINDOW_UPDATE generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Receive Window</td>\n<td>Per-Stream</td>\n<td><code>InitialWindowSize</code> (65535)</td>\n<td>Limits inbound DATA bytes for specific stream</td>\n<td>Local WINDOW_UPDATE generation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Each window operates as a signed 32-bit integer that decrements when DATA frames are transmitted and increments when WINDOW_UPDATE frames are received (for send windows) or generated (for receive windows). The critical invariant is that <strong>both the connection and stream send windows must have sufficient credit</strong> before any DATA frame transmission can proceed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hierarchical Window Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 requires flow control at both connection and stream levels, but the interaction between these levels wasn&#39;t clearly specified in early implementations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Independent windows (stream and connection windows operate separately)</li>\n<li>Hierarchical windows (DATA frames consume credit from both levels)</li>\n<li>Stream-only windows (ignore connection-level flow control)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hierarchical windows where DATA transmission requires credit from both stream and connection windows</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach provides maximum flexibility for receiver-driven flow control while preventing any single stream from overwhelming the connection&#39;s aggregate capacity</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Increases implementation complexity but provides robust protection against resource exhaustion and enables sophisticated traffic shaping</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The window tracking implementation maintains these values within the existing data structures:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sendWindow</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td><code>Stream</code> struct</td>\n<td>Current send window for this stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>recvWindow</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td><code>Stream</code> struct</td>\n<td>Current receive window for this stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>connectionSendWindow</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td>Connection state</td>\n<td>Aggregate send window across all streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>connectionRecvWindow</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td>Connection state</td>\n<td>Aggregate receive window across all streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pendingWindowUpdates</code></td>\n<td><code>map[uint32]int64</code></td>\n<td>Connection state</td>\n<td>Queued WINDOW_UPDATE frames awaiting transmission</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Window update processing follows a precise protocol when WINDOW_UPDATE frames arrive:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frame Validation</strong>: Verify the WINDOW_UPDATE frame contains a non-zero window size increment and targets a valid stream (or connection with StreamID=0)</li>\n<li><strong>Overflow Protection</strong>: Check that adding the increment to the current window wouldn&#39;t exceed the maximum window size (2^31 - 1)</li>\n<li><strong>Window Application</strong>: Add the increment to the appropriate window (connection if StreamID=0, specific stream otherwise)</li>\n<li><strong>Pending Data Processing</strong>: Scan queued DATA frames and resume transmission for any frames that now have sufficient window credit</li>\n<li><strong>Cascade Updates</strong>: If connection window increased, check all streams for newly transmittable data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The window update generation logic operates continuously in the background, monitoring receive windows and generating WINDOW_UPDATE frames when windows fall below threshold levels:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>Window Update Size</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stream receive window &lt; 25% of initial</td>\n<td>Generate stream WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Restore to initial size</td>\n<td>Prevent receive window exhaustion on active streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection receive window &lt; 50% of initial</td>\n<td>Generate connection WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Restore to 75% of initial</td>\n<td>Maintain aggregate receive capacity across all streams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream closed with positive receive window</td>\n<td>No action</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Avoid unnecessary protocol overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SETTINGS frame changes initial window size</td>\n<td>Adjust all existing stream windows</td>\n<td>Difference between old and new initial size</td>\n<td>Maintain consistent window semantics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"backpressure-handling\">Backpressure Handling</h3>\n<p><strong>Backpressure handling</strong> manages the queueing and resumption of DATA frames when flow control windows become exhausted. Think of this as a sophisticated traffic management system at a busy intersection: when the main road (connection window) or specific lanes (stream windows) become congested, incoming traffic (DATA frames) must queue in organized waiting areas until capacity becomes available. The system maintains separate queues for different priority levels and implements fair scheduling to prevent high-priority streams from completely starving lower-priority ones.</p>\n<p>The

that arise in HTTP/2 flow control systems. Think of these as the emergency protocols for unusual traffic situations: what happens when the credit system breaks down due to arithmetic overflow, when streams deadlock waiting for each other&#39;s windows, or when network partitions cause window updates to be lost. These edge cases often represent the most challenging debugging scenarios because they involve subtle timing interactions between multiple components.</p>\n<p>The most critical edge cases involve <strong>window arithmetic overflow and underflow</strong> conditions that can occur during normal operation:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Detection</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n<th>Prevention</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Window overflow (&gt; 2^31-1)</td>\n<td>Check addition result before applying</td>\n<td>Send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR and close connection</td>\n<td>Validate WINDOW_UPDATE increments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window underflow (&lt; 0)</td>\n<td>Check subtraction result before applying</td>\n<td>Send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR for stream/connection</td>\n<td>Track pending DATA frame sizes accurately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Negative WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Frame validation during parsing</td>\n<td>Send PROTOCOL_ERROR and close connection</td>\n<td>Validate increment field is positive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zero-byte WINDOW_UPDATE</td>\n<td>Frame validation during parsing</td>\n<td>Send PROTOCOL_ERROR and close connection</td>\n<td>Reject WINDOW_UPDATE frames with zero increment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Deadlock scenarios</strong> represent particularly dangerous edge cases where circular dependencies between stream and connection windows create unresolvable blocking conditions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Deadlock Pattern</strong>: Stream A and Stream B both have exhausted connection window credit but positive stream window credit. Each stream&#39;s application layer continues generating data, filling their respective queues. However, neither can make progress because the connection window remains at zero, and no WINDOW_UPDATE can be sent because the streams themselves are blocked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The deadlock prevention system implements several protective mechanisms:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Deadlock Type</th>\n<th>Detection Signal</th>\n<th>Prevention Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection window starvation</td>\n<td>All streams blocked on connection window</td>\n<td>Reserve connection window credit for WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n<td>Force-send WINDOW_UPDATE even with zero connection window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream priority inversion</td>\n<td>High-priority stream blocked while low-priority streams consume window</td>\n<td>Priority-based preemption of low-priority queued frames</td>\n<td>Redistribute queued frame priority ordering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circular stream dependencies</td>\n<td>Stream dependency graph contains cycles</td>\n<td>Dependency graph validation during PRIORITY frame processing</td>\n<td>Break cycles by resetting problematic dependency links</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window update loss</td>\n<td>Stream remains blocked despite peer claiming to send updates</td>\n<td>Timeout-based window refresh requests</td>\n<td>Send explicit WINDOW_UPDATE request frames</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Memory exhaustion</strong> during backpressure handling creates another class of critical edge cases:</p>\n<p>The system implements aggressive memory management when approaching queue size limits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Early Warning Thresholds</strong>: When total queued bytes exceed 75% of maximum, begin selective frame dropping for lowest-priority streams</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Shedding</strong>: When approaching 90% of maximum, implement tail-drop for new frames on already-queued streams  </li>\n<li><strong>Priority-Based Eviction</strong>: When at 100% capacity, evict lowest-priority queued frames to make room for higher-priority ones</li>\n<li><strong>Connection Termination</strong>: If memory pressure continues despite aggressive shedding, send GOAWAY and terminate connection</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Clock skew and timing issues</strong> can cause subtle flow control misbehavior in distributed deployments:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Timing Issue</th>\n<th>Symptoms</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Mitigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Delayed WINDOW_UPDATE processing</td>\n<td>Streams remain blocked despite sufficient window</td>\n<td>WINDOW_UPDATE frames queued behind large DATA frames</td>\n<td>Prioritize WINDOW_UPDATE frames in transmission queue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premature timeout</td>\n<td>Streams reset before WINDOW_UPDATE arrives</td>\n<td>Network latency exceeds configured timeout</td>\n<td>Implement adaptive timeout based on measured RTT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window update storms</td>\n<td>Rapid bursts of WINDOW_UPDATE frames</td>\n<td>Receiver generating updates faster than sender can process</td>\n<td>Rate-limit WINDOW_UPDATE generation and batch updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stale window state</td>\n<td>Window tracking becomes inconsistent</td>\n<td>Lost or reordered frames cause accounting errors</td>\n<td>Implement periodic window state synchronization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Single-Level Window Accounting</strong>\nMany developers implement only stream-level flow control and ignore connection-level windows, assuming that controlling individual streams provides sufficient protection. This creates a classic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; scenario where each stream appears well-behaved individually, but their aggregate behavior overwhelms the connection&#39;s capacity. The result is receiver buffer exhaustion, TCP-level backpressure, and cascading performance degradation across all streams. <strong>Fix</strong>: Always implement dual-level accounting where DATA frame transmission requires credit from both stream and connection windows.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Arithmetic Overflow Ignored</strong>\nWindow update arithmetic can easily overflow the 32-bit signed integer range, especially in high-throughput scenarios or when malicious peers send large WINDOW_UPDATE increments. Unchecked overflow can wrap the window size to negative values, causing immediate flow control violations and connection termination. <strong>Fix</strong>: Validate that current_window + update_increment ≤ 2^31-1 before applying any WINDOW_UPDATE, and send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if the check fails.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: WINDOW_UPDATE Frame Blocking</strong>\nA subtle deadlock occurs when WINDOW_UPDATE frames themselves become blocked by flow control windows. Since WINDOW_UPDATE frames are not subject to flow control, they must be transmitted even when DATA frame transmission is blocked. Some implementations incorrectly queue WINDOW_UPDATE frames behind DATA frames, creating unresolvable deadlocks. <strong>Fix</strong>: Always prioritize WINDOW_UPDATE frame transmission and send them immediately regardless of connection window state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Unbounded Queuing</strong>\nWhen implementing backpressure queuing, developers often create unbounded queues that grow without limit during sustained window exhaustion. This can cause memory exhaustion and process crashes under load. <strong>Fix</strong>: Implement strict memory limits for queued frames and use priority-based eviction when approaching limits.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream Closure Window Handling</strong>\nWhen streams close, their unused window credit should be made available to other streams, but many implementations simply discard this credit. This wastes connection-level window capacity and reduces overall throughput. <strong>Fix</strong>: When a stream transitions to closed state, redistribute its unused window credit proportionally among remaining active streams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The flow control implementation requires sophisticated coordination between multiple components while

Flow</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section synthesizes concepts from all milestones (1-4) by demonstrating how the Binary Framing Engine (Milestone 1), HPACK Compression Engine (Milestone 2), Stream Management (Milestone 3), and Flow Control (Milestone 4) work together during actual HTTP/2 request processing, frame routing, and header decompression operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of an HTTP/2 server as a sophisticated air traffic control system managing multiple concurrent flights (streams) over a single runway (TCP connection). Just as air traffic control receives flight plans, coordinates takeoffs and landings, and manages airspace capacity, our HTTP/2 server receives binary frames, coordinates stream multiplexing, and manages flow control windows. The key insight is that unlike HTTP/1.1&#39;s sequential processing (one plane at a time), HTTP/2 enables true multiplexing where multiple conversations happen simultaneously without head-of-line blocking.</p>\n<p>This section explores the intricate dance between our four core engines as they collaborate to process HTTP/2 requests. We&#39;ll trace the journey of a frame from its arrival as raw bytes through binary parsing, stream routing, header decompression, and response generation. Understanding these interactions is crucial because HTTP/2&#39;s power comes not from individual components but from their seamless orchestration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Frequest-processing-flow.svg\" alt=\"Request Processing Sequence\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"request-processing-flow\">Request Processing Flow</h3>\n<p>The request processing flow represents the end-to-end journey from frame reception to HTTP response generation. Think of this as a factory assembly line where each station (component) performs specialized work before passing the product to the next station. However, unlike a traditional assembly line, our HTTP/2 factory processes multiple product lines (streams) simultaneously, with sophisticated routing and quality control at each stage.</p>\n<p>The complexity lies in maintaining state consistency across components while handling the inherent asynchrony of multiplexed streams. Each frame arriving on the connection could belong to any active stream, carry different types of data (headers, payload, control information), and trigger cascading effects throughout the system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"frame-reception-and-initial-processing\">Frame Reception and Initial Processing</h4>\n<p>The journey begins when raw bytes arrive on the TCP connection. The Connection Handler acts as the factory&#39;s receiving dock, accepting delivery trucks (TCP segments) and sorting their contents into the appropriate processing queues. This initial stage must be extremely efficient because it directly impacts the server&#39;s ability to handle high connection counts.</p>\n<p>The Connection Handler maintains a persistent read loop that continuously monitors the TCP socket for incoming data. When bytes arrive, the handler immediately invokes the Binary Framing Engine&#39;s <code>ParseFrame</code> method. This creates our first critical interaction point where transport-layer concerns meet protocol-layer parsing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>State Changes</th>\n<th>Error Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Connection Handler</td>\n<td>Read bytes from TCP socket</td>\n<td>Update connection read buffer</td>\n<td>Network errors, connection closure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Binary Framing Engine</td>\n<td>Parse 9-byte frame header</td>\n<td>Extract length, type, flags, stream ID</td>\n<td>Malformed header, oversized frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Binary Framing Engine</td>\n<td>Validate frame structure</td>\n<td>Check reserved bits, length limits</td>\n<td>Protocol violations, invalid frame types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Binary Framing Engine</td>\n<td>Read frame payload</td>\n<td>Extract payload bytes based on length</td>\n<td>Incomplete reads, payload corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Frame Router</td>\n<td>Determine destination component</td>\n<td>Route based on frame type and stream ID</td>\n<td>Invalid stream ID, closed streams</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> Frame parsing must be atomic and non-blocking. If the Binary Framing Engine encounters an incomplete frame (not enough bytes available), it must preserve the partial state and resume parsing when more data arrives, without blocking other streams on the connection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Binary Framing Engine performs immediate validation of the parsed frame, checking that reserved bits are zero, the frame length doesn&#39;t exceed <code>MaxFrameSize</code>, and the frame type is recognized. This validation acts as a firewall protecting downstream components from malformed data that could cause crashes or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stream-identification-and-routing\">Stream Identification and Routing</h4>\n<p>Once a valid frame is parsed, the Frame Router must determine which component should handle it. This routing decision depends on both the frame type and the stream ID. Think of the Frame Router as a sophisticated mail sorting facility that must deliver each piece of mail to the correct department based on both the address and the type of correspondence.</p>\n<p>The routing logic follows a hierarchical decision tree. Connection-level frames (stream ID 0) such as <code>SETTINGS</code>, <code>PING</code>, and <code>GOAWAY</code> are handled directly by the Connection Handler. Stream-specific frames are routed to the appropriate stream handler within the Stream Manager. However, this seemingly simple routing masks significant complexity in edge case handling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Stream ID Validation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Invalid or closed stream IDs require different error responses than valid streams</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Validate before routing 2) Let stream handlers validate 3) Hybrid validation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid validation with router checking basic validity and stream handlers checking state-specific rules</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances performance (early rejection of obviously invalid frames) with flexibility (stream handlers understand their own state)</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful coordination between router and stream managers to avoid duplicate validation overhead</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Stream ID</th>\n<th>Routing Destination</th>\n<th>Validation Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SETTINGS</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Connection Handler</td>\n<td>Must be connection-level, ACK flag validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code></td>\n<td>&gt; 0</td>\n<td>Stream Manager</td>\n<td>Stream must exist or be creatable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DATA</code></td>\n<td>&gt; 0</td>\n<td>Stream Manager</td>\n<td>Stream must be in open or half-closed-remote state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code></td>\n<td>0 or &gt; 0</td>\n<td>Flow Controller</td>\n<td>Window increment must be non-zero</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code></td>\n<td>&gt; 0</td>\n<td>Stream Manager</td>\n<td>Stream must exist (may be in any state)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>PING</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Connection Handler</td>\n<td>Payload must be exactly 8 bytes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Stream Manager maintains a registry of active streams using a map from stream ID to <code>Stream</code> objects. When a frame arrives for a specific stream, the router performs a lookup in this registry. If the stream exists, the frame is dispatched to the stream&#39;s handler. If the stream doesn&#39;t exist but the frame type is <code>HEADERS</code> with appropriate flags, a new stream may be created.</p>\n<h4 id=\"header-processing-and-hpack-decompression\">Header Processing and HPACK Decompression</h4>\n<p>When <code>HEADERS</code> frames arrive at the Stream Manager, they trigger one of the most complex interaction sequences in the entire system. Header frames don&#39;t just carry HTTP headers—they carry HPACK-compressed header blocks that must be decompressed using connection-shared state in the HPACK Compression Engine.</p>\n<p>Think of HPACK decompression as a conversation between old friends who share inside jokes and shorthand references. The HPACK tables act as this shared context, allowing headers to be referenced by index numbers rather than spelling out full header names and values. However, this shared state creates a critical dependency: header frames for different streams must be processed sequentially to maintain table consistency, even though the streams themselves are independent.</p>\n<p>The Stream Manager coordinates this by maintaining a header decompression queue. When <code>HEADERS</code> frames arrive (including potential <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames), they&#39;re queued for sequential processing by the HPACK Compression Engine. This ensures that dynamic table updates from one stream&#39;s headers are visible to subsequent streams while preventing race conditions that could corrupt the shared tables.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Decompression Step</th>\n<th>Component Interaction</th>\n<th>State Updates</th>\n<th>Error Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1.

In reality, large header blocks may span multiple frames, with intermediate <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames carrying additional compressed data. The Stream Manager must buffer these fragments and only invoke HPACK decompression once the complete header block (indicated by the <code>FlagEndHeaders</code> flag) is received. Attempting to decompress partial header blocks will corrupt the HPACK dynamic table state.</p>\n<h4 id=\"request-assembly-and-http-semantics\">Request Assembly and HTTP Semantics</h4>\n<p>After successful header decompression, the Stream Manager must assemble the HTTP request from the decoded headers and any associated <code>DATA</code> frames. This step bridges the gap between HTTP/2&#39;s binary framing layer and traditional HTTP semantics that application handlers expect.</p>\n<p>The assembly process involves reconstructing pseudo-headers (<code>:method</code>, <code>:path</code>, <code>:scheme</code>, <code>:authority</code>) into their HTTP/1.1 equivalents and validating that the request conforms to HTTP semantics. For example, <code>GET</code> requests should not have request bodies, while <code>POST</code> requests often do.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>HTTP/2 Headers:              Assembled HTTP Request:\n:method: GET                 GET /api/users HTTP/1.1\n:path: /api/users           Host: example.com\n:scheme: https              Authorization: Bearer token123\n:authority: example.com\nauthorization: Bearer token123</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The Stream Manager creates an internal HTTP request representation that can be passed to application-level handlers. This abstraction allows existing HTTP/1.1 applications to work with HTTP/2 with minimal modification, since they receive familiar HTTP request objects rather than raw frames and headers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"response-generation-and-framing\">Response Generation and Framing</h4>\n<p>Response generation reverses the inbound processing pipeline. Application handlers generate HTTP responses using familiar APIs, which the Stream Manager must convert back into HTTP/2 frames. This involves header compression, frame serialization, and coordination with flow control mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The response processing pipeline demonstrates the bidirectional nature of component interactions. While inbound processing flows from Connection Handler through Frame Router to Stream Manager to application, outbound processing must coordinate between application, Stream Manager, HPACK Engine, Flow Controller, and Binary Framing Engine.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Step</th>\n<th>Component Flow</th>\n<th>Data Transformation</th>\n<th>Synchronization Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1.

The Stream Manager cannot simply generate all response frames immediately—it must check both stream-level and connection-level send windows before creating <code>DATA</code> frames. If windows are exhausted, the response data must be queued until <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frames provide additional send capacity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fcomponent-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Component Architecture\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"frame-routing\">Frame Routing</h3>\n<p>Frame routing represents the nervous system of our HTTP/2 server, directing incoming frames to appropriate handlers based on type, stream ID, and current connection state. Think of the Frame Router as a sophisticated dispatcher in an emergency response system—it must instantly categorize incoming calls (frames) and route them to the correct department (component) while handling edge cases like wrong numbers, prank calls, and emergencies.</p>\n<p>The routing challenge stems from HTTP/2&#39;s multiplexed nature. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where each connection carries a single request-response sequence, HTTP/2 connections interleave frames from multiple streams with control frames that affect the entire connection. The router must maintain awareness of connection state, stream lifecycle, and protocol constraints while making routing decisions at high speed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"routing-decision-tree\">Routing Decision Tree</h4>\n<p>The Frame Router implements a hierarchical decision process that prioritizes correctness over raw performance. Each routing decision involves multiple validation steps that can result in different error responses depending on the specific violation detected.</p>\n<p>The primary routing decision depends on the stream ID field in the frame header. Stream ID zero indicates connection-level frames that affect the entire connection&#39;s state or configuration. Non-zero stream IDs indicate frames belonging to specific request-response streams. However, this simple distinction masks considerable complexity in validation and error handling.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stream ID</th>\n<th>Frame Types</th>\n<th>Routing Destination</th>\n<th>Validation Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td><code>SETTINGS</code>, <code>PING</code>, <code>GOAWAY</code>, <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code></td>\n<td>Connection Handler</td>\n<td>Connection-level frame validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&gt; 0</td>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code>, <code>DATA</code>, <code>RST_STREAM</code>, <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code>, <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code></td>\n<td>Stream Manager</td>\n<td>Stream existence and state validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid</td>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Error Handler</td>\n<td>Protocol error response generation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Routing Table vs. Switch Statement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Frame routing needs to be both fast and maintainable as new frame types are added</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Map-based routing table 2) Switch statement 3) Interface-based polymorphism</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Switch statement with validation helper functions</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Go&#39;s switch statements compile to efficient jump tables, validation logic can be shared, and adding new frame types is straightforward</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly more verbose than a map but significantly faster, with better compile-time error detection</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The router must also validate frame type compatibility with stream ID constraints. For example, <code>SETTINGS</code> frames are only valid with stream ID 0, while <code>DATA</code> frames are only valid with non-zero stream IDs. Violating these constraints results in connection-level <code>ProtocolError</code>s that should terminate the connection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stream-state-awareness\">Stream State Awareness</h4>\n<p>Stream routing requires awareness of stream lifecycle state because the same frame type may be valid or invalid depending on the current stream state. The Frame Router maintains a lightweight view of stream states to enable early validation without duplicating the full state machine logic present in individual stream handlers.</p>\n<p>Think of this as a bouncer at an exclusive club who knows the membership list and current occupancy but doesn&#39;t need to know everyone&#39;s personal details. The router knows whether stream 42 exists and its basic state (open, closed, etc.) but delegates detailed state transitions to the Stream Manager.</p>\n<p>The router&#39;s stream state cache must be kept synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by the Stream Manager. This synchronization happens through event notifications when streams change state, ensuring the router&#39;s cache remains consistent without requiring expensive lookups on every frame.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stream State</th>\n<th>Valid Frame Types</th>\n<th>Router Actions</th>\n<th>Invalid Frame Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>StateIdle</code></td>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code> (creates stream)</td>\n<td>Route to Stream Manager for creation</td>\n<td>Send <code>RST_STREAM</code> for other types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateOpen</code></td>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code>, <code>DATA</code>, <code>RST_STREAM</code>, <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code></td>\n<td>Route to existing stream handler</td>\n<td>Validate flags and dependencies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateClosed</code></td>\n<td><code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code>, <code>RST_STREAM</code> (in some cases)</td>\n<td>Limited routing or ignore</td>\n<td>Most frames should be ignored</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nonexistent</td>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code> (if stream creation allowed)</td>\n<td>Route for potential stream creation</td>\n<td><code>ProtocolError</code> for most frame types</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream State Synchronization</strong>\nA subtle bug occurs when the router&#39;s stream state cache becomes inconsistent with the Stream Manager&#39;s authoritative state. This typically happens during rapid stream state transitions where the router continues routing frames to a stream that has just transitioned to closed state. The fix involves using atomic updates and ensuring that state change notifications are processed before routing additional frames for the affected stream.</p>\n<h4 id=\"priority-and-dependency-routing\">Priority and Dependency Routing</h4>\n<p>Stream priority and dependency information affects routing decisions for <code>HEADERS</code> and <code>DATA</code> frames. While the router doesn&#39;t implement the full priority scheduling algorithm (that&#39;s the Flow Controller&#39;s responsibility), it must validate priority information and route frames to the appropriate priority queue.</p>\n<p>Priority routing introduces ordering constraints that can create head-of-line blocking if not handled carefully. The router must balance respecting priority relationships with avoiding deadlocks where high-priority streams block the processing of control frames needed to make progress.</p>\n<p>The router implements priority-aware routing by maintaining separate queues for different priority levels and ensuring that control frames (like <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code>) are always processed promptly regardless of data frame backlog in priority queues.</p>\n<h4 id=\"error-frame-generation\">Error Frame Generation</h4>\n<p>When the router detects protocol violations or invalid frame combinations, it must generate appropriate error responses. The error response type depends on whether the violation affects a specific stream or the entire connection.</p>\n<p>Stream-level errors result in <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames that terminate the offending stream while allowing other streams on the connection to continue. Connection-level errors result in <code>GOAWAY</code> frames that initiate connection shutdown, preventing new streams while allowing existing streams to complete gracefully.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Type</th>\n<th>Detection Point</th>\n<th>Response Frame</th>\n<th>Affected Scope</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Invalid stream ID</td>\n<td>Stream ID validation</td>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code></td>\n<td>Single stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame size exceeded</td>\n<td>Frame length validation</td>\n<td><code>GOAWAY</code></td>\n<td>Entire connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid frame type</td>\n<td>Frame type validation</td>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code> or <code>GOAWAY</code></td>\n<td>Depends on severity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State machine violation</td>\n<td>Stream state check</td>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code></td>\n<td>Single stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow control violation</td>\n<td>Window validation</td>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code> or <code>GOAWAY</code></td>\n<td>Depends on window type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The router must generate these error frames promptly to maintain protocol compliance, but it must also coordinate with the Flow Controller to ensure error frames don&#39;t violate flow control windows. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where flow control violations prevent sending flow control error notifications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fmultiplexing-visualization.svg\" alt=\"Multiplexing Visualization\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"header-decompression-flow\">Header Decompression Flow</h3>\n<p>Header decompression represents one of the most intricate interaction patterns in the HTTP/2 server because it requires coordination between frame-level processing, connection-shared state, and stream-specific request assembly. Think of HPACK decompression as a sophisticated library system where books (headers) can be referenced by catalog numbers (indices) instead of full titles, but the catalog is shared among all library patrons (streams) and must be updated consistently.</p>\n<p>The complexity stems from HPACK&#39;s stateful nature. Unlike simple compression schemes where each block can be decompressed independently, HPACK maintains dynamic tables that evolve as headers are processed. This creates a critical constraint: header blocks from different streams must be decompressed sequentially to maintain table consistency, even though the streams themselves operate independently.</p>\n<h4 id=\"header-block-assembly\">Header Block Assembly</h4>\n<p>Before decompression can begin, the Stream Manager must assemble complete header blocks from potentially fragmented frames. HTTP/2 allows large header sets to span multiple frames using <code>HEADERS</code> followed by <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames. The assembly process must handle partial receives, frame ordering, and error recovery while maintaining the sequential processing constraint.</p>\n<p>Think of this assembly process as reconstructing a jigsaw puzzle where pieces (frames) arrive out of order, and you can&#39;t start working on the next puzzle until the current one is complete. The Stream Manager maintains assembly buffers for each stream that&#39;s currently receiving headers, tracking which streams have complete header blocks ready for decompression.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Assembly Step</th>\n<th>Stream Manager Action</th>\n<th>Buffer Management</th>\n<th>Error Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1.

The Stream Manager enforces this by tracking the &quot;continuation expected&quot; state and rejecting non-continuation frames when a header block is incomplete.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The assembly process must also handle error recovery when header blocks are malformed or incomplete. If a stream fails to send the expected <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames, the assembly buffer eventually times out and the incomplete header block is discarded, generating a stream error.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Exhaustion in Assembly Buffers</strong>\nA malicious client can attempt denial-of-service attacks by starting many header blocks but never completing them with <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames. This causes assembly buffers to accumulate indefinitely. The mitigation involves setting strict limits on the number of concurrent incomplete header blocks and the maximum size of any individual assembly buffer, with timeout-based cleanup of abandoned header blocks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sequential-decompression-processing\">Sequential Decompression Processing</h4>\n<p>Once header blocks are assembled, they enter a strict sequential processing queue maintained by the HPACK Compression Engine. This queue ensures that dynamic table updates occur in the correct order, maintaining the shared decompression context required for subsequent header blocks.</p>\n<p>The sequential processing creates a potential bottleneck in highly multiplexed scenarios where many streams are sending headers simultaneously. However, this constraint is fundamental to HPACK&#39;s design and cannot be eliminated without violating the compression algorithm&#39;s requirements.</p>\n<p>The HPACK Compression Engine processes the queue using a single-threaded worker that decompresses header blocks one at a time. Each decompression operation may modify the dynamic table by adding new entries or triggering evictions, so these operations cannot be parallelized without sophisticated synchronization mechanisms that would likely eliminate any performance benefits.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Queue Operation</th>\n<th>HPACK Engine State</th>\n<th>Dynamic Table Changes</th>\n<th>Completion Notification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Dequeue header block</td>\n<td>Lock decompression context</td>\n<td>Potential table modifications</td>\n<td>Signal to originating stream</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process HPACK instructions</td>\n<td>Update table indices</td>\n<td>Add entries, evict old ones</td>\n<td>Update compression statistics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decode Huffman strings</td>\n<td>Access Huffman decoder</td>\n<td>No table changes</td>\n<td>String reconstruction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Validate header semantics</td>\n<td>Check HTTP/2 requirements</td>\n<td>No table changes</td>\n<td>Validation error or success</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return decoded headers</td>\n<td>Unlock decompression context</td>\n<td>Finalize table state</td>\n<td>Stream can proceed with request</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Decompression Queue Implementation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Sequential processing requirement conflicts with high concurrency goals</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Single-threaded queue 2) Connection-specific queues 3) Lock-free algorithms</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Single-threaded queue with backpressure signals</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simplest correct implementation, matches HPACK&#39;s inherent sequential requirement, backpressure prevents queue overflow</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Potential bottleneck under high header load, but guaranteed correctness and simpler debugging</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"dynamic-table-management-during-decompression\">Dynamic Table Management During Decompression</h4>\n<p>Each header block decompression potentially modifies the dynamic table through literal header insertions.

During decompression, new entries are added to the beginning of the table, and existing entries are shifted to higher indices. If the table becomes full, entries at the highest indices are evicted to make room.</p>\n<p>This table management must be atomic with respect to the decompression operation.

id=\"error-handling-and-edge-cases\">Error Handling and Edge Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section addresses error handling concerns across all milestones: frame validation errors (Milestone 1), HPACK decompression errors (Milestone 2), stream state machine violations (Milestone 3), and flow control window errors (Milestone 4). It establishes comprehensive error detection, classification, and recovery strategies essential for a production-grade HTTP/2 server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of error handling in HTTP/2 as a sophisticated immune system for the protocol. Just like a biological immune system must distinguish between harmless variations and genuine threats, our HTTP/2 server must differentiate between recoverable stream-level errors and fatal connection-level errors. The protocol provides specific mechanisms—like antibodies in the form of <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames for targeted stream termination and <code>GOAWAY</code> frames for graceful connection shutdown. Understanding when to apply localized treatment versus systemic intervention determines whether our server gracefully handles edge cases or crashes under pressure.</p>\n<p>The complexity of HTTP/2 error handling stems from the protocol&#39;s multiplexed nature. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where each connection serves a single request-response pair, HTTP/2 connections simultaneously manage dozens of independent streams. A single malformed frame could indicate a bug in one client request (requiring only stream-level recovery) or a fundamental protocol violation that corrupts the entire connection state (requiring connection-level shutdown). The server must make these classification decisions in real-time while maintaining the integrity of unaffected streams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/http2-server/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling and Recovery Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"protocol-errors\">Protocol Errors</h3>\n<p><strong>Protocol errors</strong> represent violations of the HTTP/2 specification that require immediate detection and appropriate response. These errors range from malformed binary frames that cannot be parsed to logical violations like sending a <code>DATA</code> frame on a closed stream. The server&#39;s response must be proportional—isolating the damage to the affected stream when possible, or protecting the entire connection when the violation threatens overall protocol integrity.</p>\n<p>The foundation of protocol error handling lies in comprehensive <strong>validation layers</strong> that examine frames at multiple levels. Frame-level validation ensures binary format compliance, while semantic validation checks protocol state consistency. This multi-layered approach prevents malformed data from propagating through the system and corrupting internal state machines.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Detection Point</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frame Format Violations</td>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>Frame parsing</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Frame Type</td>\n<td>Stream</td>\n<td>Frame routing</td>\n<td>Send <code>RST_STREAM</code> with <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Machine Violations</td>\n<td>Stream</td>\n<td>Stream manager</td>\n<td>Send <code>RST_STREAM</code> with appropriate code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control Violations</td>\n<td>Stream/Connection</td>\n<td>Window validation</td>\n<td>Send <code>RST_STREAM</code> or <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK Decompression Failures</td>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>Header decompression</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Limit Exceeded</td>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>Resource tracking</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Error Scope Classification Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP/2 errors can affect individual streams or entire connections, requiring different recovery mechanisms</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Always terminate connection on any error (simple but wasteful)</li>\n<li>Always attempt stream-level recovery (complex, risk of connection corruption)</li>\n<li>Classify errors by impact scope and respond appropriately (balanced approach)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement error classification that maps violations to minimum necessary scope</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maximizes connection reuse while preventing error propagation; follows RFC 7540 guidance on error handling proportionality</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires sophisticated error detection logic but improves server resilience and client experience</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>ProtocolError</code> type encapsulates all HTTP/2 specification violations with precise error codes that map to the standard error codes defined in RFC 7540.

The parser must validate every aspect of the 9-byte frame header before attempting to process the payload. Length field validation prevents buffer overflows, while reserved bit checking ensures future protocol compatibility.</p>\n<p>The frame validation algorithm follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Header Structure Validation</strong>: Verify the 9-byte header contains valid length, type, and flags combinations according to the frame type specification</li>\n<li><strong>Length Boundary Checking</strong>: Ensure frame length does not exceed negotiated maximum frame size and fits within available buffer space</li>\n<li><strong>Reserved Bit Validation</strong>: Check that all reserved bits in flags and stream ID fields are set to zero as required by the specification</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Type Recognition</strong>: Verify the frame type is known and supported, rejecting unknown types with appropriate error codes</li>\n<li><strong>Flag Consistency Checking</strong>: Validate that flags are appropriate for the frame type and current stream state</li>\n<li><strong>Stream ID Validation</strong>: Ensure stream ID follows odd/even allocation rules and does not exceed the maximum stream ID space</li>\n<li><strong>Payload Length Verification</strong>: For frame types with fixed payload sizes, verify the length field matches expected payload size</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for frame validation is that <strong>fail-fast detection</strong> at the parsing boundary prevents corrupted data from entering the system&#39;s state machines. Once a frame passes validation, downstream components can assume structural integrity and focus on semantic processing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>HPACK decompression errors</strong> require special consideration because header compression failures affect the entire connection&#39;s header compression context. Unlike other stream-level errors, HPACK failures corrupt the dynamic table state that all subsequent header blocks depend on. The server must immediately terminate the connection to prevent header decompression cascading failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>HPACK Error Type</th>\n<th>Cause</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Invalid Static Table Index</td>\n<td>Index &gt; 61</td>\n<td>Bounds checking during lookup</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic Table Overflow</td>\n<td>Entry size exceeds table capacity</td>\n<td>Size calculation during insertion</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huffman Decoding Failure</td>\n<td>Invalid symbol sequence or padding</td>\n<td>Symbol validation during decode</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integer Encoding Violation</td>\n<td>Too many continuation bytes</td>\n<td>Byte count during variable decode</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String Length Mismatch</td>\n<td>Declared length != actual bytes</td>\n<td>Length tracking during string decode</td>\n<td>Send <code>GOAWAY</code> with <code>COMPRESSION_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Stream state machine violations</strong> occur when frames arrive that are invalid for the current stream state. For example, receiving a <code>HEADERS</code> frame on a stream already in the closed state violates the protocol specification. These errors typically indicate client bugs or race conditions in stream lifecycle management.</p>\n<p>The validation process for stream state transitions involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Current State Lookup</strong>: Retrieve the stream&#39;s current state from the stream manager&#39;s state cache</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Type Compatibility</strong>: Check if the incoming frame type is valid for the current stream state according to RFC 7540 state transition rules</li>\n<li><strong>Flag Validation</strong>: Verify frame flags are appropriate for both the frame type and current stream state (e.g., <code>END_STREAM</code> flag validity)</li>\n<li><strong>Transition Atomicity</strong>: Ensure state transitions complete atomically to prevent race conditions between concurrent frame processing</li>\n<li><strong>Error Code Selection</strong>: Choose the most specific error code that describes the violation (e.g., <code>STREAM_CLOSED</code> vs. <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Condition in Stream State Validation</strong>\nA common bug occurs when stream state validation and state transitions are not properly synchronized. If one goroutine checks that a stream is open and begins processing a frame, while another goroutine concurrently closes that stream, the first goroutine may update an already-closed stream. This leads to inconsistent state and potential crashes. Always use proper locking or atomic operations when checking and updating stream state, and re-validate state after acquiring locks but before making changes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-errors\">Connection Errors</h3>\n<p><strong>Connection errors</strong> represent failures that compromise the integrity of the entire HTTP/2 connection and require termination of all multiplexed streams. These errors typically stem from fundamental protocol violations, resource exhaustion, or implementation bugs that corrupt shared connection state. The server handles connection errors through the <code>GOAWAY</code> frame mechanism, which provides graceful connection termination while allowing in-flight requests to complete.</p>\n<p>Think of connection error handling as performing emergency surgery on a complex system. When a critical component fails, the surgeon must quickly assess whether the problem can be isolated (stream-level error) or whether it threatens the entire patient&#39;s stability (connection-level error). The <code>GOAWAY</code> frame serves as the anesthesia—gracefully shutting down the system while ensuring no ongoing operations are left in an undefined state.</p>\n<p>The <code>GOAWAY</code> frame provides a standardized mechanism for connection termination that includes diagnostic information to help clients understand the failure cause. Unlike abrupt connection closure, <code>GOAWAY</code> allows proper cleanup of resources and provides clear error signaling to the peer.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>GOAWAY Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Last Stream ID</td>\n<td>Highest stream ID server processed</td>\n<td>Even numbers for server errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Code</td>\n<td>Specific failure reason</td>\n<td><code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code>, <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debug Data</td>\n<td>Additional diagnostic information</td>\n<td>UTF-8 error description</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Connection-level resource exhaustion</strong> represents one of the most common categories of connection errors. When clients exceed negotiated limits for concurrent streams, frame sizes, or header table sizes, the server must protect itself through connection termination. The <code>ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM</code> error code specifically addresses aggressive client behavior.</p>\n<p>The resource exhaustion detection algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Concurrent Stream Monitoring</strong>: Track active stream count against the <code>MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</code> setting, rejecting new streams when the limit is reached</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Size Validation</strong>: Verify every incoming frame does not exceed the negotiated <code>MAX_FRAME_SIZE</code> setting before attempting to read the payload</li>\n<li><strong>Header List Size Checking</strong>: Monitor accumulated header block size during CONTINUATION frame assembly to prevent memory exhaustion attacks</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Table Size Enforcement</strong>: Ensure HPACK dynamic table size updates do not exceed the <code>HEADER_TABLE_SIZE</code> setting</li>\n<li><strong>Connection Window Monitoring</strong>: Track connection-level flow control window to detect aggressive sending patterns that ignore flow control</li>\n<li><strong>Rate Limiting Assessment</strong>: Monitor frame arrival rates to detect denial-of-service attempts through frame flooding</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Graceful vs Immediate Connection Termination</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When connection errors occur, the server can either close the TCP connection immediately or send GOAWAY first</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Immediate TCP close (fast but provides no diagnostic info)</li>\n<li>GOAWAY then wait for client closure (proper but may delay recovery)</li>\n<li>GOAWAY with timeout fallback (balanced approach)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Send GOAWAY frame with 5-second timeout before forcing TCP connection closure</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides diagnostic information to well-behaved clients while preventing resource leaks from misbehaving clients</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires connection timeout management but improves debuggability and client experience</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>GOAWAY frame generation</strong> must include sufficient diagnostic information to help clients identify and fix the underlying problem.

Each connection may have dozens of active streams, each with buffers, timers, and state machines. Ensure error cleanup code traverses all active streams and releases their resources. Use defer statements or finally blocks to guarantee cleanup even if the error handling code itself panics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-errors\">Stream Errors</h3>\n<p><strong>Stream errors</strong> represent failures that affect individual streams while leaving the overall connection intact. These errors typically result from application-level problems, client bugs, or resource constraints that can be isolated to specific request-response sequences. The server handles stream errors through <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames, which immediately terminate the affected stream without disrupting other multiplexed streams on the same connection.</p>\n<p>The beauty of stream-level error handling lies in its <strong>fault isolation</strong>. When one client request contains malformed data or violates stream-specific constraints, the server can terminate just that stream while allowing dozens of other concurrent requests to proceed normally. This isolation property makes HTTP/2 servers far more resilient than HTTP/1.1 servers, where connection errors terminate all pending requests.</p>\n<p>Stream error detection occurs at multiple points in the request processing pipeline. The frame router validates stream state consistency, the flow control system detects window violations, and application handlers identify semantic errors in request content.</p>\n<p>| Error Detection Point | Error Types Detected | Recovery Mechanism |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Frame routing | Invalid frame for stream state | <code>RST_STREAM</code> with state-specific error |\n| Flow control validation | Window underflow/overflow | <code>RST_STREAM</code> with <code>FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR</code> |\n| Header validation | Malformed HTTP semantics | <code>RST_STREAM</code> with <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code> |\n| Application processing | Request timeout, resource limits | <code>RST_STREAM</code> with <code>CANCEL</code> or <code>REFUSED_STREAM</code> |\n| Stream lifecycle | Premature stream closure | <code>RST_STREAM</code> with <code>STREAM_CLOSED</code> |</p>\n<p><strong>RST_STREAM frame generation</strong> requires careful selection of the error code to provide meaningful diagnostic information.

Each milestone requires both isolated unit testing and integrated system validation to ensure protocol compliance and robustness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of testing an HTTP/2 server like quality assurance for a complex air traffic control system. Just as air traffic control must safely coordinate hundreds of simultaneous aircraft arrivals and departures, your HTTP/2 server must manage dozens of concurrent streams over a single connection while maintaining perfect protocol compliance. The testing strategy mirrors this complexity: you need to test individual components in isolation (like testing a single radar unit), validate component interactions (like testing handoff procedures between controllers), and verify the entire system under realistic load (like testing the airport during peak traffic). Each layer of testing catches different classes of bugs, from basic parsing errors to subtle race conditions that only emerge under concurrent load.</p>\n<p>The HTTP/2 protocol&#39;s binary nature and complex state machines create unique testing challenges compared to text-based HTTP/1.1. Binary framing requires bit-level accuracy, HPACK compression involves stateful table management, stream multiplexing creates intricate concurrency scenarios, and flow control introduces credit-based backpressure handling. A comprehensive testing strategy must address each of these complexities systematically, building confidence layer by layer from individual frame parsing up to full client integration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-testing\">Unit Testing</h3>\n<p>Unit testing forms the foundation of HTTP/2 server validation by isolating each component and verifying its behavior under controlled conditions. Unlike integration testing, unit tests provide immediate feedback during development, precise failure localization, and comprehensive edge case coverage. Each major component—Binary Framing Engine, HPACK Compression Engine, Stream Management, and Flow Control—requires specialized testing approaches that address their unique characteristics and failure modes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"binary-framing-engine-unit-tests\">Binary Framing Engine Unit Tests</h4>\n<p>The Binary Framing Engine requires exhaustive testing of frame parsing, serialization, and validation logic. Think of frame parsing like a document scanner that must correctly interpret various document formats—it needs to handle perfect documents flawlessly, detect corruption in damaged documents, and gracefully reject invalid formats. The binary nature of HTTP/2 frames means that single-bit errors can cause catastrophic parsing failures, making comprehensive test coverage essential.</p>\n<p>Frame parsing tests must validate every aspect of the 9-byte frame header structure. The <code>ParseFrame</code> function processes the header fields in network byte order, extracting the 24-bit length, 8-bit type, 8-bit flags, and 32-bit stream ID. Test cases should cover the full range of valid values, boundary conditions, and invalid combinations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Validation Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Header Parsing</td>\n<td>Valid frames with all frame types</td>\n<td>Successful parsing with correct field extraction</td>\n<td>Length, type, flags, stream ID accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boundary Conditions</td>\n<td>Maximum frame size (16777215 bytes)</td>\n<td>Successful parsing without overflow</td>\n<td>Payload length validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Lengths</td>\n<td>Frame length exceeding maximum</td>\n<td>Parse error with <code>ErrorCodeFrameSizeError</code></td>\n<td>Early validation before payload read</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserved Bits</td>\n<td>Stream ID with reserved bit set</td>\n<td>Parse error with <code>ErrorCodeProtocolError</code></td>\n<td>Bit masking validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Endianness</td>\n<td>Multi-byte fields in network order</td>\n<td>Correct value interpretation</td>\n<td>Big-endian conversion verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Frame type-specific parsing requires dedicated test suites for each frame type. <code>FrameTypeDATA</code> frames need testing with various payload sizes and flag combinations, particularly the <code>FlagEndStream</code> flag. <code>FrameTypeHEADERS</code> frames require validation of header block fragments and the <code>FlagEndHeaders</code> flag. <code>FrameTypeSETTINGS</code> frames must handle parameter parsing and the ACK flag correctly.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Test: DATA Frame Parsing\nInput: 9-byte header (length=1024, type=0x0, flags=0x1, stream=5) + 1024-byte payload\nExpected: Frame{Length: 1024, Type: FrameTypeDATA, Flags: FlagEndStream, StreamID: 5, Payload: [1024]byte}\nValidation: len(frame.Payload) == frame.Length, frame.Flags&amp;FlagEndStream != 0</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Frame serialization testing ensures that <code>SerializeFrame</code> produces valid wire format output that can be parsed by other HTTP/2 implementations. The serialization process must convert internal frame structures back to network byte order while preserving all header fields and payload data. Round-trip tests verify that parsing followed by serialization produces identical output.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Serialization Test</th>\n<th>Input Frame</th>\n<th>Expected Wire Format</th>\n<th>Validation Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>DATA Frame</td>\n<td>Frame with 512-byte payload</td>\n<td>9-byte header + 512 payload bytes</td>\n<td>Byte-by-byte comparison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty SETTINGS</td>\n<td>Settings frame with no parameters</td>\n<td>9-byte header with zero length</td>\n<td>Length field verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HEADERS Frame</td>\n<td>Headers with END_HEADERS flag</td>\n<td>Correct flag encoding in byte 4</td>\n<td>Bit pattern validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large Frame</td>\n<td>Frame at maximum size limit</td>\n<td>Complete serialization without truncation</td>\n<td>Total size verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Frame validation testing ensures the <code>ValidateFrame</code> function correctly identifies protocol violations and implementation limits. Validation occurs after parsing but before frame processing, catching malformed frames that could compromise server stability. The validation logic must check frame type constraints, flag combinations, and stream ID restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Validation Error Test Cases:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frame Size Violations</strong>: Frames exceeding <code>MaxFrameSize</code> should trigger <code>ErrorCodeFrameSizeError</code></li>\n<li><strong>Invalid Frame Types</strong>: Unknown frame types should be ignored per RFC 7540</li>\n<li><strong>Stream ID Constraints</strong>: Control frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY) on non-zero streams should fail</li>\n<li><strong>Flag Misuse</strong>: Invalid flag combinations like <code>FlagEndHeaders</code> on DATA frames should be rejected</li>\n<li><strong>Payload Size Mismatches</strong>: SETTINGS frames with incorrect parameter counts should fail validation</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"hpack-compression-engine-unit-tests\">HPACK Compression Engine Unit Tests</h4>\n<p>HPACK compression testing requires validation of the complex stateful compression algorithm defined in RFC 7541. Think of HPACK like a shared dictionary that both client and server update simultaneously—any inconsistency in table management breaks the entire compression scheme. The testing strategy must verify static table lookups, dynamic table management, Huffman decoding, and integer encoding under all possible conditions.</p>\n<p>Static table testing validates correct implementation of the predefined 61-entry table specified in RFC 7541 Appendix B. Every HPACK implementation must provide identical static table behavior, making this testing straightforward but critical. The <code>Lookup</code> function must return correct header entries for indices 1-61 and handle invalid indices gracefully.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Static Table Test</th>\n<th>Index</th>\n<th>Expected Name</th>\n<th>Expected Value</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authority Header</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>&quot;:authority&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;&quot;</td>\n<td>Index 0 should fail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Method GET</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>&quot;:method&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;GET&quot;</td>\n<td>Standard method lookup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Status 200</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>&quot;:status&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;200&quot;</td>\n<td>Common status code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last Entry</td>\n<td>61</td>\n<td>&quot;www-authenticate&quot;</td>\n<td>&quot;&quot;</td>\n<td>Boundary condition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Index</td>\n<td>62</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Should return error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Dynamic table testing requires comprehensive validation of the FIFO eviction system and size management. The <code>DynamicTable</code> maintains connection-specific header entries with automatic eviction when size limits are exceeded. Each entry&#39;s size calculation follows the formula: <code>name_length + value_length + 32</code> bytes of overhead.</p>\n<p>The <code>Add</code> method must correctly insert new entries while maintaining the size constraint through eviction. When adding an entry would exceed <code>maxSize</code>, the implementation must remove the oldest entries until sufficient space is available. Edge cases include adding an entry larger than the maximum table size (which should empty the table) and adding to a zero-size table (which should be ignored).</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Test Scenario: Dynamic Table Eviction\nInitial State: Table with 3 entries totaling 4000 bytes, maxSize=4096\nAction: Add entry requiring 200 bytes\nExpected: Oldest entry evicted, new entry added, total size ≤ 4096\nValidation: Entry count, size calculation, FIFO order preservation</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Integer encoding testing validates the variable-length encoding scheme used throughout HPACK for table indices and string lengths. The <code>DecodeInteger</code> function must handle 5-bit, 6-bit, and 7-bit prefix encodings with proper continuation byte processing. Test cases must cover small values that fit in the prefix, large values requiring continuation bytes, and invalid encodings that exceed implementation limits.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integer Test</th>\n<th>Prefix Bits</th>\n<th>Encoded Bytes</th>\n<th>Expected Value</th>\n<th>Edge Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Small Value</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>[0x0A]</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Fits in prefix</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large Value</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>[0x1F, 0xE8, 0x07]</td>\n<td>1337</td>\n<td>Multi-byte encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum Prefix</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>[0x3F, 0x00]</td>\n<td>63</td>\n<td>Boundary condition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Overflow</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>[0x7F, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x7F]</td>\n<td>Error</td>\n<td>Implementation limit</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Huffman decoding testing ensures correct implementation of the static Huffman table defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B. The <code>DecodeHuffman</code> function processes variable-length bit sequences, requiring careful boundary handling and padding validation. The decoder must detect the <code>EOS_SYMBOL</code> and reject invalid padding patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Huffman Test Cases:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Common Characters</strong>: ASCII letters and digits with short codes</li>\n<li><strong>Rare Characters</strong>: Extended ASCII with longer codes  </li>\n<li><strong>Boundary Conditions</strong>: Strings ending at byte boundaries vs. requiring padding</li>\n<li><strong>Invalid Padding</strong>: Padding bits that don&#39;t match EOS prefix</li>\n<li><strong>Truncated Input</strong>: Incomplete bit sequences that can&#39;t form valid symbols</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"stream-management-unit-tests\">Stream Management Unit Tests</h4>\n<p>Stream management testing validates the complex state machine and concurrent stream handling that forms the core of HTTP/2 multiplexing. Think of stream management like managing multiple phone conversations on a single line—each conversation has its own state (dialing, talking, hanging up) but they all share the same physical connection. The testing strategy must verify state transitions, stream ID allocation, priority scheduling, and concurrent access patterns.</p>\n<p>Stream state machine testing requires comprehensive validation of the state transitions defined in RFC 7540 Section 5.1. Each stream progresses through states from <code>StateIdle</code> to <code>StateClosed</code>, with frame types and flags triggering specific transitions. Invalid transitions must be detected and result in stream errors or connection errors as appropriate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Flags</th>\n<th>Expected Next State</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>StateIdle</td>\n<td>HEADERS</td>\n<td>0x0</td>\n<td>StateOpen</td>\n<td>Normal request start</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StateOpen</td>\n<td>DATA</td>\n<td>FlagEndStream</td>\n<td>StateHalfClosedRemote</td>\n<td>Client completes request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StateHalfClosedRemote</td>\n<td>HEADERS</td>\n<td>0x0</td>\n<td>StateHalfClosedRemote</td>\n<td>Response headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StateHalfClosedRemote</td>\n<td>DATA</td>\n<td>FlagEndStream</td>\n<td>StateClosed</td>\n<td>Response complete</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StateClosed</td>\n<td>DATA</td>\n<td>0x0</td>\n<td>Error</td>\n<td>Invalid frame on closed stream</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>TransitionState</code> function must validate each transition against the current state and frame type. Invalid transitions should generate <code>RST_STREAM</code> frames with appropriate error codes. The implementation must handle concurrent state changes from multiple goroutines processing frames simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Stream ID allocation testing validates the odd/even assignment scheme and monotonic ordering requirements. Client-initiated streams use odd IDs (1, 3, 5...) while server-initiated streams use even IDs (2, 4, 6...). The <code>AllocateStreamID</code> function must track the highest allocated ID and prevent reuse of stream IDs within a connection.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Test: Concurrent Stream ID Allocation\nScenario: 10 goroutines simultaneously allocate client stream IDs\nExpected: Unique odd IDs in monotonic order (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)\nValidation: No duplicates, all odd, strictly increasing sequence</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Priority scheduling testing validates the weight-based bandwidth allocation specified in RFC 7540 Section 5.3. The <code>ScheduleStreams</code> function must distribute available transmission windows among active streams based on their configured weights. The deficit round-robin algorithm ensures fair scheduling while respecting priority relationships.</p>\n<p>Priority testing requires careful setup of stream hierarchies and measurement of bandwidth allocation over multiple scheduling rounds. Test scenarios should include equal-weight streams (uniform distribution), varied weights (proportional distribution), and priority inversions (higher-weight streams blocked by flow control).</p>\n<h4 id=\"flow-control-unit-tests\">Flow Control Unit Tests</h4>\n<p>Flow control testing validates the credit-based window management that prevents buffer overflow in HTTP/2 implementations. Think of flow control like water pressure regulation—each stream and the overall connection have pressure gauges (windows) that prevent pipes from bursting due to excessive flow. The testing strategy must verify window calculations, <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> processing, and backpressure queue management under various conditions.</p>\n<p>Window management testing focuses on the <code>WindowManager</code> component that tracks both connection-level and stream-level send windows. Each DATA frame transmission reduces both windows, while <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frames increment the appropriate window. The implementation must prevent window underflow and handle window overflow conditions gracefully.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Window Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Initial Connection Window</th>\n<th>Initial Stream Window</th>\n<th>Data Size</th>\n<th>Expected Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Normal Transmission</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>1024</td>\n<td>Windows reduced by 1024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Window Exhaustion</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>1024</td>\n<td>Transmission blocked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Window Exhaustion</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>1024</td>\n<td>Transmission blocked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Both Windows Exhausted</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>1024</td>\n<td>Transmission blocked</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>CanSendData</code> function must check both connection and stream windows before allowing DATA frame transmission. The <code>ConsumeWindows</code> function atomically decrements both windows to maintain consistency. Window update processing must handle concurrent updates and detect overflow conditions.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Test: Concurrent Window Updates\nSetup: Stream window = 1000, multiple WINDOW_UPDATE frames with increment = 5000\nAction: Process 10 concurrent WINDOW_UPDATE frames\nExpected: Window increases by 50000, no overflow, atomic updates\nValidation: Final window value, no race conditions, consistent state</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Backpressure queue testing validates the queuing mechanism used when transmission windows are exhausted. The <code>BackpressureQueue</code> buffers DATA frames until windows become available, maintaining transmission order and priority relationships. Queue management must prevent unbounded growth while preserving frame ordering.</p>\n<p><strong>Backpressure Test Scenarios:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Single Stream Blocking</strong>: One stream exhausts its window while others continue transmission</li>\n<li><strong>Connection Blocking</strong>: All streams blocked by connection window exhaustion  </li>\n<li><strong>Priority Ordering</strong>: Higher-priority streams drain first when windows become available</li>\n<li><strong>Queue Overflow</strong>: Queue size limits prevent memory exhaustion</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Timeout</strong>: Old queued frames are discarded to prevent unbounded buffering</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing\">Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>Integration testing validates the complete HTTP/2 server implementation by testing component interactions and end-to-end protocol compliance. While unit tests verify isolated component behavior, integration tests catch bugs that emerge from component interactions, concurrent execution, and real network conditions. The integration testing strategy employs multiple client implementations and testing tools to ensure broad compatibility and protocol adherence.</p>\n<p>Integration testing serves as the bridge between unit-level validation and production deployment. Think of it like testing a complete symphony orchestra after rehearsing individual sections—while each musician might play perfectly in isolation, the full performance requires coordination, timing, and seamless interaction between all parts. HTTP/2&#39;s complexity demands similar holistic validation where frame parsing, header compression, stream management, and flow control must work together flawlessly.</p>\n<h4 id=\"end-to-end-client-testing\">End-to-End Client Testing</h4>\n<p>Real HTTP/2 client testing provides the most authentic validation of server implementation correctness. Different HTTP/2 clients exercise different protocol features and behaviors, exposing bugs that synthetic tests might miss. The testing strategy incorporates command-line tools, browser clients, and specialized HTTP/2 testing libraries to maximize coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>curl HTTP/2 Testing</strong> provides command-line validation of basic HTTP/2 functionality. Modern curl versions support HTTP/2 over TLS with the <code>--http2</code> flag, making it ideal for automated testing and debugging. curl testing focuses on request-response correctness, header handling, and error condition responses.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Basic curl Test Commands:\ncurl --http2 -v https://localhost:8443/simple\ncurl --http2 -H &quot;Custom-Header: test-value&quot; https://localhost:8443/echo-headers  \ncurl --http2 -d &quot;request body&quot; https://localhost:8443/post-handler\ncurl --http2 --limit-rate 1k https://localhost:8443/large-response</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The verbose output (<code>-v</code> flag) provides detailed protocol information including frame exchanges, header compression, and TLS negotiation.

Browsers implement sophisticated HTTP/2 optimizations including connection coalescing, priority scheduling, and aggressive multiplexing. Browser testing requires HTTPS with valid certificates, making TLS configuration part of the integration test setup.</p>\n<p>Browser testing methodology involves both manual testing and automated browser automation tools. Manual testing provides immediate visual feedback and debugging information through browser developer tools. Automated testing using tools like Selenium or Playwright enables reproducible test execution and continuous integration.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Browser Test Scenarios:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Multiple Resource Loading</strong>: HTML pages with many CSS, JavaScript, and image resources</li>\n<li><strong>Long-Lived Connections</strong>: WebSocket upgrades and server-sent events over HTTP/2</li>\n<li><strong>Priority Handling</strong>: Critical resources (CSS) vs. non-critical resources (images)</li>\n<li><strong>Error Recovery</strong>: Network interruptions and connection recovery</li>\n<li><strong>Cache Behavior</strong>: HTTP caching with HTTP/2 multiplexing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Browser developer tools provide invaluable insight into HTTP/2 behavior.

Safari&#39;s Web Inspector provides similar capabilities with additional WebKit-specific metrics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"specialized-http2-testing-tools\">Specialized HTTP/2 Testing Tools</h4>\n<p>Dedicated HTTP/2 testing tools provide comprehensive protocol validation beyond what general-purpose clients offer. These tools implement HTTP/2-specific test suites, protocol fuzzing, and compliance checking that validate server behavior against RFC specifications.</p>\n<p><strong>h2spec Compliance Testing</strong> is the de facto standard for HTTP/2 protocol compliance testing. The h2spec tool implements hundreds of test cases covering every aspect of RFC 7540 and RFC 7541. It tests positive cases (valid protocol usage) and negative cases (error handling and protocol violations).</p>\n<p>h2spec testing categories include frame parsing, stream state machines, flow control, header compression, and error handling. Each test case sends specific frame sequences and validates the server&#39;s response against RFC requirements.

Load testing exposes race conditions, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks that only manifest under concurrent stress.</p>\n<p>h2load provides HTTP/2-specific load testing with configurable concurrency, request rates, and connection counts. Unlike HTTP/1.1 load testing, HTTP/2 load testing can achieve high request rates with minimal connection counts due to multiplexing.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>h2load Load Test Examples:\nh2load -n10000 -c10 -m10 https://localhost:8443/small (10K requests, 10 connections, 10 streams)\nh2load -n1000 -c1 -m100 --h1 https://localhost:8443/compare (HTTP/1.1 comparison)\nh2load -t10 -c10 -m50 -d60 https://localhost:8443/sustained (60-second sustained load)</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Load testing should monitor server resource usage including memory consumption, goroutine counts, file descriptor usage, and CPU utilization. Memory leaks often manifest as gradually increasing memory usage under sustained load. Goroutine leaks appear as unbounded goroutine growth over time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"protocol-fuzzing-and-edge-case-testing\">Protocol Fuzzing and Edge Case Testing</h4>\n<p>Protocol fuzzing systematically generates malformed or edge-case HTTP/2 traffic to test server robustness. Think of fuzzing like stress-testing a bridge with unusual load patterns—while normal traffic might work perfectly, edge cases and malformed inputs can expose structural weaknesses. HTTP/2 fuzzing targets binary frame formats, state machine edge cases, and resource exhaustion scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Binary Frame Fuzzing</strong> generates malformed frames with invalid lengths, corrupted headers, and boundary condition violations. Frame fuzzing should trigger appropriate error responses without causing server crashes or resource leaks. Proper frame validation and error handling prevent fuzzing inputs from compromising server stability.</p>\n<p>Frame fuzzing categories include length field manipulation (oversized/undersized frames), type field corruption (invalid frame types), flag field abuse (invalid flag combinations), and stream ID violations (reserved bits, invalid stream assignments). Each category tests different validation code paths and error handling logic.</p>\n<p><strong>State Machine Fuzzing</strong> sends frame sequences that violate HTTP/2 state machine requirements. Examples include sending DATA frames on closed streams, HEADERS frames with invalid dependencies, and CONTINUATION frames without proper HEADERS initiation. State machine fuzzing validates the robustness of stream state tracking and error recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Exhaustion Testing</strong> attempts to exhaust server resources through protocol abuse. Test scenarios include creating excessive concurrent streams, sending oversized header blocks, exhausting flow control windows, and filling dynamic tables with large entries. Resource exhaustion testing validates implementation limits and graceful degradation under attack conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Protocol fuzzing often reveals bugs that traditional testing misses. Even when unit tests pass and integration tests succeed, fuzzing can expose edge cases where the combination of valid protocol elements creates invalid states.

troubleshooting techniques for all milestones: frame parsing issues (Milestone 1), HPACK compression bugs (Milestone 2), stream state violations (Milestone 3), and flow control problems (Milestone 4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of debugging an HTTP/2 server like troubleshooting a complex postal system. Just as mail can get lost at sorting centers, have addresses corrupted, or be delivered out of order, HTTP/2 frames can be malformed at the binary level, headers can be corrupted during compression, or streams can enter invalid states due to concurrency issues. The key to effective debugging is understanding where in the pipeline problems occur and having systematic approaches to isolate and diagnose each category of failure.</p>\n<p>HTTP/2 protocol debugging presents unique challenges because of its binary nature, multiplexed streams, and complex state machines. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where you can inspect raw text traffic, HTTP/2 requires specialized tools to decode binary frames. The multiplexing adds another layer of complexity - errors in one stream can affect others, and race conditions between concurrent streams create intermittent failures that are difficult to reproduce. This section provides concrete diagnostic techniques, common bug patterns, and systematic troubleshooting approaches for each major component.</p>\n<p>The debugging strategy follows a layered approach, starting with the lowest level (binary framing) and working up through header compression, stream management, and flow control. Each layer has characteristic failure modes and diagnostic signatures. Understanding these patterns allows you to quickly identify which component is failing and apply the appropriate troubleshooting techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"frame-parsing-bugs\">Frame Parsing Bugs</h3>\n<p>Binary protocol parsing represents one of the most common sources of bugs in HTTP/2 implementations. Unlike text-based protocols where parsing errors are often obvious, binary parsing failures can manifest as subtle data corruption, mysterious connection resets, or intermittent protocol violations that are difficult to reproduce.</p>\n<p><strong>Endianness Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Network protocols use big-endian byte ordering (most significant byte first), but different architectures have different native byte orders. Think of endianness like reading a multi-digit number - in big-endian, you read left-to-right (most significant digit first), while in little-endian, you would read right-to-left. When your HTTP/2 frame parser doesn&#39;t correctly handle byte order conversion, field values become corrupted in predictable ways.</p>\n<p>The <code>Frame</code> header contains several multi-byte fields that are susceptible to endianness bugs. The 24-bit length field, when incorrectly parsed on a little-endian system, will have its bytes reversed. For example, a frame length of <code>0x000100</code> (256 bytes) would be interpreted as <code>0x000001</code> (1 byte) on a little-endian system without proper conversion.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Correct Value</th>\n<th>Little-Endian Bug</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Length (24-bit)</td>\n<td>0x000100 (256)</td>\n<td>0x000001 (1)</td>\n<td>Premature frame termination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StreamID (31-bit)</td>\n<td>0x00000001</td>\n<td>0x01000000</td>\n<td>Invalid stream ID errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Size</td>\n<td>0x0000FFFF</td>\n<td>0xFFFF0000</td>\n<td>Flow control violations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Native Byte Order Assumption</strong>\nMany developers assume their development machine&#39;s byte order matches the network byte order. This leads to code that works correctly on big-endian systems but fails on common little-endian architectures like x86. The bug often goes undetected during development if testing only occurs on the same architecture as development.</p>\n<p>The diagnostic signature of endianness bugs includes frame length mismatches, where the parser reads far more or fewer bytes than expected for the payload. You&#39;ll see protocol errors like <code>ErrorCodeFrameSizeError</code> when the computed frame size exceeds <code>MaxFrameSize</code>, or premature connection termination when the parser tries to read beyond available data.</p>\n<p><strong>Length Validation Errors</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 frame length validation involves multiple constraints that must all be satisfied simultaneously. The 24-bit length field in the frame header specifies payload bytes, not including the 9-byte header itself. This length must not exceed the negotiated maximum frame size (initially <code>DefaultFrameSize</code> of 16,384 bytes), and certain frame types have additional size constraints.</p>\n<p>Frame length validation follows a hierarchical checking process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Basic Range Check</strong>: Length field must not exceed <code>MaxFrameSize</code> (16,777,215 bytes)</li>\n<li><strong>Connection Limit Check</strong>: Length must not exceed the negotiated <code>SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE</code> value</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Type Constraints</strong>: Some frame types have minimum or exact size requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Stream Context Validation</strong>: Frame size must be reasonable given current stream state and flow control windows</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Frame Type</th>\n<th>Minimum Size</th>\n<th>Maximum Size</th>\n<th>Special Constraints</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeDATA</code></td>\n<td>0 bytes</td>\n<td>Connection limit</td>\n<td>Must respect flow control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeHEADERS</code></td>\n<td>1 byte</td>\n<td>Connection limit</td>\n<td>Must include header block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FrameTypeSETTINGS</code></td>\n<td>0 or 6n bytes</td>\n<td>Connection limit</td>\n<td>Multiple of 6 when not ACK</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PING</td>\n<td>8 bytes</td>\n<td>8 bytes</td>\n<td>Exactly 8 bytes required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GOAWAY</td>\n<td>8+ bytes</td>\n<td>Connection limit</td>\n<td>At least last stream ID + error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Settings Frame Size Validation</strong>\nSETTINGS frames without the ACK flag must contain a payload length that&#39;s a multiple of 6 bytes (each setting is 6 bytes). However, SETTINGS frames with the ACK flag must have zero payload length. Many implementations forget this distinction and either reject valid ACK frames or accept malformed settings with partial entries.</p>\n<p>Binary parsing also introduces <strong>alignment and boundary errors</strong> where frame boundaries don&#39;t align with buffer boundaries. When reading frames from a TCP stream, the underlying transport can deliver data in arbitrary chunks that don&#39;t correspond to frame boundaries. Your parser must handle cases where a frame header spans multiple read operations, or where multiple complete frames arrive in a single buffer.</p>\n<p>The frame parsing state machine must track partial reads and reassemble complete frames:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Header Assembly State</strong>: Accumulating the 9-byte header across multiple reads</li>\n<li><strong>Payload Reading State</strong>: Reading the specified number of payload bytes</li>\n<li><strong>Frame Complete State</strong>: Frame ready for validation and processing</li>\n<li><strong>Error Recovery State</strong>: Handling malformed frames and connection recovery</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Buffer Overflow and Underflow</strong></p>\n<p>Buffer management in binary parsing requires careful bounds checking at every step. <strong>Buffer overflow</strong> occurs when the parser writes beyond allocated memory, typically when the frame length field has been corrupted or when integer arithmetic overflows during size calculations. <strong>Buffer underflow</strong> occurs when the parser attempts to read more data than is available in the current buffer.</p>\n<p>Consider the frame header parsing sequence. The parser must read exactly 9 bytes for the header, then extract the 24-bit length field, and finally read that many additional bytes for the payload. At each step, the parser must verify that sufficient data is available before attempting the read operation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for robust frame parsing is that network data arrives asynchronously and in arbitrary chunks. Your parser cannot assume that complete frames are available in each read operation - it must gracefully handle partial frames and maintain parsing state across multiple I/O operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reserved Bit Handling</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 frame headers contain several reserved bits that must be zero in compliant implementations. The most common reserved bit violations occur in the stream ID field, which reserves the most significant bit (bit 31) for the R flag. Implementations must mask this bit when extracting the stream ID value and should validate that reserved bits are not set.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Reserved Bits</th>\n<th>Validation Rule</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stream ID</td>\n<td>Bit 31 (R flag)</td>\n<td>Must be 0</td>\n<td><code>ErrorCodeProtocolError</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Type</td>\n<td>Bits 8-15</td>\n<td>Must be recognized type</td>\n<td>Connection error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flags</td>\n<td>Unused bits per type</td>\n<td>Type-specific validation</td>\n<td>Frame-specific error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ValidateFrame</code> method must check these reserved bit constraints and generate appropriate <code>ProtocolError</code> responses. Reserved bit violations typically indicate either a buggy peer implementation or data corruption during transmission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hpack-compression-bugs\">HPACK Compression Bugs</h3>\n<p>HPACK header compression introduces complex state management and encoding algorithms that are prone to subtle bugs. Unlike frame parsing where errors are often immediately apparent, HPACK bugs can manifest as gradual state corruption that only becomes visible after processing many requests. Think of HPACK debugging like troubleshooting a dictionary where entries are constantly being added and removed - small errors in table management compound over time until the sender and receiver have completely different dictionaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Table Index Errors</strong></p>\n<p>The HPACK algorithm uses a combined indexing space that merges the static table and dynamic table into a single address space. The static table contains 61 predefined entries (indexed 1-61), while the dynamic table entries follow immediately after (indexed 62 and above). This dual addressing scheme is a common source of off-by-one errors and index calculation bugs.</p>\n<p>Index resolution follows these rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Index 0</strong>: Reserved and invalid - should trigger decompression error</li>\n<li><strong>Index 1-61</strong>: Static table entries, directly addressable</li>\n<li><strong>Index 62+</strong>: Dynamic table entries, calculated as <code>(index - 62)</code> into dynamic table array</li>\n<li><strong>Index &gt; (61 + dynamic_table_size)</strong>: Invalid index, should trigger decompression error</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Index Range</th>\n<th>Table</th>\n<th>Calculation</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Invalid</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td><code>ErrorCodeCompressionError</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-61</td>\n<td>Static</td>\n<td><code>index - 1</code> for array access</td>\n<td>Index &gt; 61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>62+</td>\n<td>Dynamic</td>\n<td><code>index - 62</code> for array access</td>\n<td>Index &gt; 61 + table size</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Dynamic Table Index Calculation</strong>\nThe most common HPACK indexing bug is forgetting that dynamic table indices start at 62, not 61. This leads to off-by-one errors where index 62 incorrectly references static table entry 61 instead of dynamic table entry 0. The bug manifests as header values from previous requests appearing in current responses, creating security vulnerabilities through information leakage.</p>\n<p>The <code>Lookup</code> method must handle index bounds checking and table selection:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Input: index = 65, static_table_size = 61, dynamic_table_entries = 5\nValidation: 65 &lt;= (61 + 5) = 66 ✓ (valid)\nTable Selection: 65 &gt; 61 → Dynamic table\nArray Index: 65 - 62 = 3 (fourth dynamic entry)</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Dynamic Table Size Management</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK dynamic tables implement FIFO eviction with size-based constraints rather than simple entry count limits. Each header entry consumes <code>32 + name.length + value.length</code> bytes, and the table must maintain a running total that never exceeds the configured maximum size. Size management bugs typically involve incorrect size calculations, improper eviction logic, or race conditions in multithreaded implementations.</p>\n<p>The <code>calculateEntrySize</code> function implements the RFC 7541 sizing formula, but implementations often introduce bugs in string length calculation or integer overflow handling. Consider a header entry with name &quot;:status&quot; and value &quot;200&quot; - the size calculation is <code>32 + 7 + 3 = 42</code> bytes. However, if the implementation uses 16-bit integers for size tracking, tables larger than 65,535 bytes will overflow and wrap around to small positive values.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Size Contribution</th>\n<th>Common Bugs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Base Overhead</td>\n<td>32 bytes</td>\n<td>Forgetting to include</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Name Length</td>\n<td>UTF-8 byte count</td>\n<td>Using character count instead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Value Length</td>\n<td>UTF-8 byte count</td>\n<td>Unicode handling errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Tracking</td>\n<td>Running sum</td>\n<td>Integer overflow</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The eviction algorithm must remove entries from the front of the table (oldest entries) until the total size is within limits. However, the eviction loop must carefully handle cases where adding a single large entry requires removing multiple small entries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for dynamic table management is that HPACK uses FIFO eviction based on total byte size, not entry count. A single large entry can force eviction of many smaller entries, and the eviction algorithm must be atomic to prevent inconsistent intermediate states.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Huffman Decoding Issues</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK uses Huffman coding for header value compression, but the decoding algorithm is complex and error-prone. The Huffman code table is predefined by RFC 7541, but implementations must handle variable-length codes, bit-level parsing, and padding validation. Huffman decoding bugs often manifest as corrupted header values, infinite loops in the decoder, or security vulnerabilities through buffer overflows.</p>\n<p>The Huffman decoding process operates on individual bits rather than bytes, requiring careful bit manipulation and accumulator management. The <code>HuffmanDecoder</code> maintains an accumulator for partially decoded symbols and a bit count for tracking position within the current byte.</p>\n<p>Huffman decoding follows this bit-level process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bit Accumulation</strong>: Add input bits to the accumulator, tracking total bit count</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol Matching</strong>: Compare accumulator against code table for valid symbols</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol Emission</strong>: Output matched character and reset accumulator</li>\n<li><strong>Padding Validation</strong>: Ensure any remaining bits match the End-of-String padding pattern</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Huffman Padding Validation</strong>\nThe Huffman alphabet includes a special End-of-String symbol (<code>EOS_SYMBOL</code>) used for padding incomplete bytes. Decoders must validate that any remaining bits after the last complete symbol consist only of the most significant bits of the EOS symbol. Invalid padding indicates either corruption or a malicious compression bomb attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Integer Encoding Edge Cases</strong></p>\n<p>HPACK uses variable-length integer encoding with different prefix sizes (5, 6, or 7 bits) depending on context. The encoding can span multiple bytes using continuation markers, and decoders must handle very large integers and potential overflow conditions. Integer decoding bugs include infinite loops on malformed continuation bytes, arithmetic overflow, and incorrect prefix masking.</p>\n<p>The <code>DecodeInteger</code> method must handle several edge cases:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Edge Case</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Validation Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Maximum Prefix Value</td>\n<td>All prefix bits set to 1</td>\n<td>Indicates multi-byte encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Continuation Bytes</td>\n<td>MSB = 1 indicates more bytes</td>\n<td>Must limit total byte count</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integer Overflow</td>\n<td>Result exceeds language limits</td>\n<td>Check before arithmetic operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Continuation</td>\n<td>MSB patterns</td>\n<td>Detect malformed encoding</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The integer decoding algorithm accumulates values using powers of 128, but must prevent arithmetic overflow. Consider decoding a 5-bit prefix where all prefix bits are set (value 31) followed by continuation bytes. The total value is <code>31 + (continuation_bytes_value * 128^n)</code>, where n is the continuation byte position.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stream-state-bugs\">Stream State Bugs</h3>\n<p>HTTP/2 stream management implements complex state machines that can transition through multiple states based on frame types and flags. Stream state bugs are particularly insidious because they often involve race conditions between concurrent streams and can create security vulnerabilities through state machine violations. Think of stream state debugging like tracking the lifecycle of individual conversations in a busy conference call - each conversation has its own state, but they can interfere with each other in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p><strong>State Machine Violations</strong></p>\n<p>The HTTP/2 stream state machine defines valid transitions between <code>StateIdle</code>, <code>StateOpen</code>, <code>StateHalfClosedLocal</code>, <code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code>, and <code>StateClosed</code>. Invalid transitions occur when frames arrive that are not permitted in the current state, or when the implementation incorrectly updates state without proper validation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Valid Frames</th>\n<th>Invalid Frames</th>\n<th>Transition Triggers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>StateIdle</code></td>\n<td>HEADERS, PRIORITY</td>\n<td>DATA, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>HEADERS → Open</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateOpen</code></td>\n<td>DATA, HEADERS, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>None (all valid)</td>\n<td>END_STREAM → Half-closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedLocal</code></td>\n<td>DATA (receive only), RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>DATA (send)</td>\n<td>END_STREAM received → Closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code></td>\n<td>DATA (send only), RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>DATA (receive)</td>\n<td>END_STREAM sent → Closed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateClosed</code></td>\n<td>PRIORITY, RST_STREAM</td>\n<td>DATA, HEADERS</td>\n<td>None (terminal)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Concurrent State Transitions</strong>\nStream state transitions are not atomic across frame processing, leading to race conditions where two threads attempt to transition the same stream simultaneously. For example, one thread processes an incoming RST_STREAM frame while another processes an outgoing DATA frame. Without proper synchronization, the stream can end up in an inconsistent state or generate invalid frames.</p>\n<p>The <code>TransitionState</code> method must validate transitions atomically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lock Stream State</strong>: Acquire exclusive access to prevent concurrent modifications</li>\n<li><strong>Validate Current State</strong>: Ensure the stream is in the expected current state</li>\n<li><strong>Check Frame Permissions</strong>: Verify the triggering frame is valid for current state</li>\n<li><strong>Update State</strong>: Atomically transition to the new state</li>\n<li><strong>Notify Waiters</strong>: Signal any threads waiting on state changes</li>\n<li><strong>Release Lock</strong>: Allow other operations to proceed</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Stream ID Allocation Issues</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 uses a split namespace for stream IDs - client-initiated streams use odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) while server-initiated streams use even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). Stream ID allocation must maintain monotonic increasing order within each namespace and handle ID exhaustion gracefully. Stream ID bugs include reusing IDs, violating the odd/even rule, or failing to handle the 31-bit limit.</p>\n<p>The <code>AllocateStreamID</code> method tracks separate counters for client and server streams:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stream Type</th>\n<th>ID Pattern</th>\n<th>Counter Variable</th>\n<th>Exhaustion Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client Streams</td>\n<td>1, 3, 5, ...</td>\n<td><code>nextClientStreamID</code></td>\n<td>2^31 - 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server Streams</td>\n<td>2, 4, 6, ...</td>\n<td><code>nextServerStreamID</code></td>\n<td>2^31 - 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reserved</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Connection-level frames</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Stream ID exhaustion requires connection closure because HTTP/2 does not support ID reuse. A busy server processing many short-lived requests can exhaust the server stream ID space, requiring graceful connection termination with a GOAWAY frame.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stream ID Reuse</strong>\nSome implementations incorrectly attempt to reuse stream IDs after streams close, violating the HTTP/2 specification. This can cause frame routing confusion where frames intended for a new stream are delivered to a closed stream&#39;s handler, leading to protocol errors or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Priority and Dependency Cycles</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 stream prioritization uses a weighted dependency tree where streams can depend on other streams for scheduling priority. However, the dependency relationships must form a directed acyclic graph - dependency cycles create scheduling deadlocks where streams wait for each other indefinitely. Priority handling bugs include allowing circular dependencies, incorrect weight calculations, and priority inversion where low-priority streams block high-priority ones.</p>\n<p>The <code>StreamPriority</code> structure defines dependency relationships, but implementations must validate that new dependencies don&#39;t create cycles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cycle Detection</strong>: Use depth-first search to detect circular dependencies before adding new edges</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Removal</strong>: Remove conflicting dependencies to break potential cycles</li>\n<li><strong>Weight Normalization</strong>: Ensure priority weights fall within valid ranges (1-256)</li>\n<li><strong>Scheduling Fairness</strong>: Implement deficit round-robin or similar algorithm to prevent starvation</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Priority Violation</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Circular Dependency</td>\n<td>Graph traversal</td>\n<td>Remove newest dependency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Weight</td>\n<td>Range checking</td>\n<td>Clamp to valid range (1-256)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing Parent</td>\n<td>Dependency validation</td>\n<td>Depend on connection root</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Priority Inversion</td>\n<td>Scheduling analysis</td>\n<td>Boost blocked high-priority streams</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Concurrent Access Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Stream management must handle concurrent access from multiple goroutines processing different streams simultaneously. Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared stream state, when stream cleanup races with active frame processing, or when flow control windows are updated concurrently with data transmission.</p>\n<p>The <code>StreamManager</code> must provide thread-safe operations for all stream lifecycle events:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operation</th>\n<th>Synchronization Required</th>\n<th>Race Condition Risk</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stream Creation</td>\n<td>Stream map write lock</td>\n<td>Duplicate stream IDs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Transitions</td>\n<td>Per-stream lock</td>\n<td>Inconsistent state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control Updates</td>\n<td>Window lock</td>\n<td>Double accounting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Cleanup</td>\n<td>Stream map write lock</td>\n<td>Use-after-free</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for stream concurrency is that HTTP/2 multiplexing creates complex interaction patterns between streams that share connection-level resources. Proper synchronization requires both coarse-grained locks for shared data structures and fine-grained locks for per-stream state to avoid performance bottlenecks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-tools\">Debugging Tools</h3>\n<p>Effective HTTP/2 debugging requires specialized tools that can decode binary protocols, analyze multiplexed traffic, and correlate events across multiple streams. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where simple text-based tools suffice, HTTP/2 debugging demands protocol-aware analysis tools and structured logging strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Wireshark Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Wireshark provides comprehensive HTTP/2 protocol decoding that reveals the binary frame structure, HPACK compression details, and stream multiplexing patterns. The HTTP/2 dissector automatically decodes frame headers, decompresses HPACK headers, and tracks stream states across the connection lifetime.</p>\n<p>Key Wireshark filters for HTTP/2 debugging:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Filter Expression</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Typical Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>http2</code></td>\n<td>All HTTP/2 traffic</td>\n<td>General protocol analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>http2.type == 0</code></td>\n<td>DATA frames only</td>\n<td>Flow control and payload analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>http2.type == 1</code></td>\n<td>HEADERS frames</td>\n<td>Request/response header analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>http2.streamid == N</code></td>\n<td>Specific stream</td>\n<td>Single stream lifecycle tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>http2.flags.end_stream == 1</code></td>\n<td>Stream termination</td>\n<td>Finding premature closures</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Wireshark&#39;s HTTP/2 analysis includes automatic validation of protocol constraints. It flags invalid frame sequences, HPACK decompression errors, and flow control violations with clear error messages. The tool also provides statistics on frame type distribution, stream concurrency levels, and compression effectiveness.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: TLS Encryption</strong>\nProduction HTTP/2 typically uses TLS encryption, making Wireshark analysis impossible without access to the server&#39;s private key or client-side capture. Development environments should include plaintext HTTP/2 support specifically for debugging purposes, even though production deployments mandate encryption.</p>\n<p><strong>Protocol-Specific Logging</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 debugging requires logging that captures protocol-level events with sufficient detail to reconstruct connection and stream state. Generic application logs are insufficient - you need frame-level logging, HPACK table state dumps, and stream state transition tracking.</p>\n<p>Effective HTTP/2 logging captures multiple event categories:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Log Category</th>\n<th>Information Logged</th>\n<th>Example Entry</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frame Processing</td>\n<td>Type, flags, stream ID, payload size</td>\n<td><code>FRAME_RECV: DATA stream=3 len=1024 flags=END_STREAM</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK Operations</td>\n<td>Table operations, compression ratios</td>\n<td><code>HPACK_ADD: :method=POST size=42 table_size=256</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream Lifecycle</td>\n<td>State transitions, creation, cleanup</td>\n<td><code>STREAM_TRANSITION: stream=5 OPEN→HALF_CLOSED_REMOTE</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control</td>\n<td>Window updates, backpressure events</td>\n<td><code>WINDOW_UPDATE: stream=7 delta=32768 new_window=65536</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Conditions</td>\n<td>Protocol violations, recovery actions</td>\n<td><code>PROTOCOL_ERROR: invalid frame type=99 on stream=1</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The logging system must handle high-frequency events without impacting performance. Consider using structured logging formats (JSON) that support automated analysis and correlation across multiple log files.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame-Level Debugging</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s binary framing requires debugging tools that can display raw frame contents alongside decoded interpretations. Frame-level debugging helps identify endianness bugs, length validation errors, and reserved bit violations that are not apparent in higher-level protocol analysis.</p>\n<p>Frame debugging output should include both hex dumps and structured field interpretation:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Frame Header (9 bytes): 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 03\n├─ Length: 0x000100 (256 bytes)\n├─ Type: 0x01 (HEADERS)\n├─ Flags: 0x00 (no flags set)\n└─ Stream ID: 0x00000003 (stream 3)\n\nPayload (256 bytes): 40 0a 3a 61 75 74 68 6f 72 69 74 79...\n├─ HPACK Block Fragment\n├─ First byte: 0x40 (literal with incremental indexing)\n└─ Huffman encoded: yes</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Frame-level logging must capture both successful parsing events and error conditions with sufficient detail to diagnose the root cause. Include information about buffer states, parsing positions, and validation failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection State Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 connections maintain complex state that spans multiple streams, HPACK tables, flow control windows, and negotiated settings. Connection state monitoring provides a centralized view of the connection health and can identify systemic issues that affect multiple streams.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State Category</th>\n<th>Monitored Values</th>\n<th>Alert Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Active Streams</td>\n<td>Count, state distribution</td>\n<td>Exceeds negotiated maximum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK Tables</td>\n<td>Size, eviction rate</td>\n<td>Frequent evictions, size violations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control</td>\n<td>Window levels, blocked streams</td>\n<td>Window exhaustion, deadlocks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Statistics</td>\n<td>Type distribution, error rates</td>\n<td>High error rates, unusual patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settings</td>\n<td>Negotiated values, changes</td>\n<td>Incompatible settings, frequent changes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Connection monitoring should provide both real-time dashboards and historical trend analysis. Look for patterns like gradually increasing error rates, stream lifecycle anomalies, or flow control window exhaustion that indicate systematic problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Stream Correlation Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Multiplexed streams share connection resources and can interfere with each other in subtle ways. Stream correlation analysis identifies cross-stream dependencies, resource contention, and cascading failure patterns that are not apparent when examining streams individually.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Correlation Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Cause</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simultaneous Stream Errors</td>\n<td>Multiple streams fail together</td>\n<td>Connection-level problem</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control Blocking</td>\n<td>High-priority streams stalled</td>\n<td>Connection window exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Priority Inversion</td>\n<td>Low-priority streams complete first</td>\n<td>Scheduling algorithm bug</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Header Corruption</td>\n<td>Random header values appear</td>\n<td>HPACK table corruption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Stream correlation requires aggregating events across multiple streams and identifying temporal relationships. Use time-based windowing to detect events that occur within close proximity and may be causally related.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for HTTP/2 debugging is that the protocol&#39;s multiplexed nature creates complex interaction patterns that are not visible when examining individual components in isolation. Effective debugging requires tools that can correlate events across streams, frames, and protocol layers to identify root causes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Automated Testing and Fuzzing</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s complexity makes it susceptible to edge case bugs that only appear under specific conditions. Automated testing and protocol fuzzing can identify implementation vulnerabilities by generating malformed frames, invalid state transitions, and resource exhaustion conditions.</p>\n<p>Protocol fuzzing strategies for HTTP/2:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fuzzing Target</th>\n<th>Technique</th>\n<th>Expected Bugs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frame Headers</td>\n<td>Random byte sequences</td>\n<td>Parsing crashes, buffer overflows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HPACK Tables</td>\n<td>Invalid indices, size violations</td>\n<td>Table corruption, memory leaks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stream States</td>\n<td>Illegal frame sequences</td>\n<td>State machine violations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flow Control</td>\n<td>Window overflow, underflow</td>\n<td>Arithmetic errors, deadlocks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integer Encoding</td>\n<td>Continuation byte manipulation</td>\n<td>Infinite loops, overflow</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Implement fuzz testing as part of the continuous integration pipeline, not just as a one-time validation exercise. The protocol&#39;s state-dependent behavior means that bugs may only appear after specific sequences of valid operations followed by malformed input.</p>\n<h3

id=\"future-extensions\">Future Extensions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section addresses potential enhancements beyond the core milestones, providing a roadmap for extending the HTTP/2 server with server push capabilities, advanced features, and performance optimizations that build upon the foundations established in milestones 1-4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of this HTTP/2 server implementation as building a solid house foundation - the four milestones establish the structural integrity with binary framing, header compression, stream management, and flow control. Future extensions are like adding modern amenities: server push is like installing a smart anticipatory system that delivers what you need before you ask, advanced features are like home automation that optimizes the experience, and performance optimizations are like upgrading to energy-efficient systems that handle more load with fewer resources. Each extension builds upon the proven foundation while adding capabilities that enhance the overall system&#39;s utility and efficiency.</p>\n<p>The architecture established in the core milestones provides extension points specifically designed for these enhancements. The <code>StreamManager</code> can be extended to handle server-initiated streams, the <code>FrameRouter</code> can incorporate new frame types, and the flow control mechanisms can be enhanced with more sophisticated scheduling algorithms. Rather than retrofitting these features, the modular design allows for organic growth that maintains the system&#39;s integrity while expanding its capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"server-push-push_promise-frame-handling-and-resource-push-strategies\">Server Push: PUSH_PROMISE Frame Handling and Resource Push Strategies</h3>\n<p>Server push represents HTTP/2&#39;s most revolutionary feature - the ability for servers to proactively send resources before clients request them. Think of traditional HTTP as a restaurant where you must order each course individually, waiting for delivery before requesting the next item. Server push transforms this into a tasting menu experience where the chef anticipates your needs and delivers complementary items that enhance the main course, all arriving in perfectly timed coordination.</p>\n<p>The mental model for server push centers around predictive resource delivery. When a client requests an HTML page, the server can analyze the page content and identify critical resources - CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, or fonts - that the browser will inevitably request. Rather than waiting for these subsequent requests, the server initiates push streams to deliver these resources immediately, reducing overall page load time by eliminating round-trip latency.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: PUSH_PROMISE Frame Implementation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Server push requires introducing new frame types and stream management patterns not covered in the core milestones, while maintaining compatibility with existing stream lifecycle management</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Extend existing <code>StreamManager</code> with push-specific methods</li>\n<li>Create separate <code>PushManager</code> component with dedicated stream handling</li>\n<li>Implement push as application-layer feature above HTTP/2 protocol layer</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Extend <code>StreamManager</code> with push capabilities while adding <code>PushManager</code> for policy decisions</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Push streams follow the same lifecycle as client streams but with server initiation, making <code>StreamManager</code> extension natural while <code>PushManager</code> handles the application logic of what to push</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Maintains consistency with existing stream management while cleanly separating protocol mechanics from push policy decisions</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"push_promise-frame-structure-and-processing\">PUSH_PROMISE Frame Structure and Processing</h4>\n<p>The <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> frame serves as the server&#39;s contract with the client, declaring intent to push a specific resource while providing the request headers that would have been sent if the client had initiated the request. This frame type extends the binary framing engine established in Milestone 1 with server-specific semantics.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Length</td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>Frame payload length excluding 9-byte header</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type</td>\n<td><code>uint8</code></td>\n<td><code>FrameTypePUSH_PROMISE</code> (0x5) for push promise frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flags</td>\n<td><code>uint8</code></td>\n<td><code>FlagEndHeaders</code> (0x4) indicates complete headers or continuation needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>StreamID</td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>Parent stream ID that triggered this push promise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PromisedStreamID</td>\n<td><code>uint32</code></td>\n<td>New server-initiated stream ID for the pushed resource</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HeaderBlock</td>\n<td><code>[]byte</code></td>\n<td>HPACK-compressed headers representing the synthetic request</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The frame processing workflow integrates with the existing frame routing infrastructure while introducing server-initiated stream creation. When the server decides to push a resource, it constructs a <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> frame containing the synthetic request headers that represent the client request that would have fetched this resource. The promised stream ID must follow HTTP/2&#39;s server stream allocation rules - even numbers starting from 2 and increasing monotonically.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>PUSH_PROMISE Frame Processing Algorithm:\n1. Server application identifies resource candidate for pushing\n2. Validate that parent stream is in open or half-closed-remote state\n3. Allocate next available server stream ID (even number)\n4. Construct synthetic request headers for the resource\n5. Compress headers using connection's HPACK context\n6. Create PUSH_PROMISE frame with parent stream ID and promised stream ID\n7. Send PUSH_PROMISE frame to client before sending any DATA frames\n8. Create new stream in reserved-local state for the promised stream\n9. Begin sending HEADERS and DATA frames on the promised stream\n10. Handle potential RST_STREAM from client if push is rejected</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The integration with existing flow control mechanisms requires careful consideration. Pushed streams consume connection-level and stream-level windows just like client-initiated streams. However, the server must be more conservative with push resources since the client may not actually need them, potentially wasting bandwidth and window space.</p>\n<h4 id=\"push-policy-and-resource-selection\">Push Policy and Resource Selection</h4>\n<p>The most critical aspect of effective server push lies not in the protocol mechanics but in the intelligent selection of resources to push. Think of this as a restaurant server learning customer preferences - push too aggressively and you overwhelm the client with unwanted resources, push too conservatively and you miss opportunities to improve performance. The optimal strategy balances proactive resource delivery with respectful bandwidth usage.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Push Strategy</th>\n<th>Trigger</th>\n<th>Candidate Resources</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Static Analysis</td>\n<td>HTML response generation</td>\n<td>Referenced CSS, JS, critical images</td>\n<td>Simple implementation, predictable behavior</td>\n<td>Doesn&#39;t account for client cache state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dependency Graph</td>\n<td>Resource request patterns</td>\n<td>Resources with high co-occurrence probability</td>\n<td>Data-driven decisions, adapts over time</td>\n<td>Requires learning phase, complex state management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Link Header Hints</td>\n<td>Application-provided hints</td>\n<td>Developer-specified critical resources</td>\n<td>Developer control, explicit intent</td>\n<td>Requires application modification, manual maintenance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache Integration</td>\n<td>Client cache headers</td>\n<td>Resources known to be stale or missing</td>\n<td>Avoids redundant pushes, efficient bandwidth usage</td>\n<td>Complex cache state tracking, privacy implications</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>PushManager</code> component encapsulates push policy decisions while integrating with the existing stream and connection management infrastructure:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>EvaluatePushCandidates</code></td>\n<td><code>parentStreamID uint32, responseHeaders http.Header</code></td>\n<td><code>[]PushCandidate, error</code></td>\n<td>Analyzes response content and identifies resources suitable for pushing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ValidatePushRequest</code></td>\n<td><code>candidate PushCandidate, connectionState *ConnectionState</code></td>\n<td><code>bool, error</code></td>\n<td>Checks push eligibility considering client settings, window availability, and stream limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreatePushPromise</code></td>\n<td><code>parentStreamID uint32, resource PushCandidate</code></td>\n<td><code>*Frame, uint32, error</code></td>\n<td>Constructs PUSH_PROMISE frame and allocates promised stream ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>HandlePushRejection</code></td>\n<td><code>promisedStreamID uint32, errorCode uint32</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Processes RST_STREAM cancellation of promised stream and updates push policy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The push candidate evaluation process requires analyzing response content to identify linked resources. For HTML responses, this involves parsing the document structure to find stylesheet links, script tags, image references, and font declarations. The challenge lies in distinguishing critical resources that improve page load time from optional resources that might waste bandwidth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overly Aggressive Push Policies</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is pushing every resource referenced in an HTML page, overwhelming clients with unwanted data. This wastes bandwidth and can actually harm performance by consuming flow control windows needed for client-requested resources. Instead, focus on critical resources that block page rendering - typically CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files in the document head - while avoiding speculative pushes of optional content like tracking pixels or below-the-fold images.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"push-stream-lifecycle-management\">Push Stream Lifecycle Management</h4>\n<p>Server push introduces a unique stream lifecycle where the server creates streams proactively rather than reactively. Think of this as the difference between a traditional store where customers browse and request items versus a subscription service where the provider anticipates needs and delivers items before explicit requests. The server must manage this anticipatory relationship while respecting client autonomy to reject unwanted pushes.</p>\n<p>The pushed stream lifecycle follows a modified version of the standard HTTP/2 stream state machine:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Non-existent</td>\n<td><code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> sent</td>\n<td><code>StateReservedLocal</code></td>\n<td>Allocate stream ID, reserve flow control windows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateReservedLocal</code></td>\n<td><code>HEADERS</code> frame sent</td>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code></td>\n<td>Begin response transmission, no client data expected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code></td>\n<td><code>DATA</code> frame sent</td>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code></td>\n<td>Continue response transmission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateHalfClosedRemote</code></td>\n<td><code>DATA</code> frame with <code>END_STREAM</code></td>\n<td><code>StateClosed</code></td>\n<td>Complete response, release resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateReservedLocal</code></td>\n<td><code>RST_STREAM</code> received</td>\n<td><code>StateClosed</code></td>\n<td>Cancel push, release resources, update policy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Connection error</td>\n<td><code>StateClosed</code></td>\n<td>Cleanup all pushed streams</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The key difference from client-initiated streams is that pushed streams never receive request data from the client - they transition directly from reserved to half-closed-remote state. This simplification reduces the complexity of state management while requiring careful handling of the reservation phase where the client might reject the push.</p>\n<p>Push stream integration with the existing <code>StreamManager</code> requires extending the stream allocation logic to handle server-initiated streams:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Extension</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>CreatePushedStream</code></td>\n<td><code>parentStreamID uint32, promisedStreamID uint32</code></td>\n<td><code>*Stream, error</code></td>\n<td>Creates new stream in reserved-local state linked to parent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ValidatePushCapacity</code></td>\n<td><code>requestedPushes int</code></td>\n<td><code>bool, error</code></td>\n<td>Checks if connection can handle additional pushed streams within limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>HandlePushRejection</code></td>\n<td><code>promisedStreamID uint32</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Transitions rejected push stream to closed state and updates counters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetPushedStreams</code></td>\n<td><code>parentStreamID uint32</code></td>\n<td><code>[]uint32, error</code></td>\n<td>Returns list of pushed stream IDs associated with parent stream</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"client-push-settings-and-negotiation\">Client Push Settings and Negotiation</h4>\n<p>HTTP/2 provides clients with granular control over server push behavior through the <code>SETTINGS</code> frame mechanism established in the core milestones. Think of this as a preferences dialog where clients can express their push tolerance - some clients on limited bandwidth connections might disable push entirely, while others might allow moderate pushing for critical resources only.</p>\n<p>The client communicates push preferences through specific settings parameters:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Setting Parameter</th>\n<th>Value Range</th>\n<th>Default</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</code></td>\n<td>0 or 1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Global enable/disable flag for all server push</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</code></td>\n<td>0 to 2^31-1</td>\n<td>No limit</td>\n<td>Includes both regular and pushed streams in the limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE</code></td>\n<td>1 to 2^31-1</td>\n<td>65535</td>\n<td>Applies to pushed streams, affecting push aggressiveness</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The server must respect these settings when making push decisions. When <code>SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH</code> is set to 0, the server must not send any <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> frames. When concurrent stream limits are reached, the server should prioritize client-initiated streams over new pushes. The initial window size affects how much data can be pushed immediately, influencing the cost-benefit calculation for push candidates.</p>\n<p>Push settings integration requires extending the connection&#39;s settings management:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Push Settings Validation Algorithm:\n1. Receive SETTINGS frame from client during connection establishment\n2. Extract SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH value and store in connection state\n3. If push is disabled, mark connection as push-prohibited\n4. For enabled push, extract concurrent stream and window size limits\n5. Use these limits in push candidate evaluation decisions\n6. Send SETTINGS acknowledgment to confirm receipt\n7. Apply settings to all future push decisions on this connection\n8. Handle settings updates during connection lifetime</code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: Server push is fundamentally about respecting client autonomy while providing performance benefits. The server proposes resources it believes will be helpful, but the client retains ultimate authority to accept or reject these proposals. This cooperative model ensures that push enhances rather than harms the client experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-features-connection-coalescing-alternative-services-and-http2-extensions\">Advanced Features: Connection Coalescing, Alternative Services, and HTTP/2 Extensions</h3>\n<p>Beyond the core HTTP/2 protocol features, several advanced capabilities can significantly enhance server performance and client experience. Think of these as professional-grade features that distinguish a production-ready server from a basic implementation - connection coalescing is like having multiple storefronts share a single efficient warehouse, alternative services provide flexible routing options like having multiple delivery methods, and protocol extensions enable future-proofing like modular upgrades to a building&#39;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>These advanced features build upon the solid foundation of the core milestones while introducing sophisticated optimizations that require careful design to maintain the system&#39;s reliability and performance characteristics. Each feature addresses specific limitations or inefficiencies in basic HTTP/2 operations while maintaining backward compatibility and protocol compliance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"connection-coalescing-and-certificate-management\">Connection Coalescing and Certificate Management</h4>\n<p>Connection coalescing allows a single HTTP/2 connection to serve multiple hostnames that share certificate authority, reducing connection overhead and improving resource utilization. Think of this as a shared transportation system where multiple destinations can be reached via the same efficient route, rather than establishing separate pathways for each destination.</p>\n<p>The mental model centers around certificate-based trust relationships. When a server presents a certificate valid for multiple hostnames, or when multiple hostnames resolve to the same IP address with compatible certificates, clients can reuse existing connections rather than establishing new ones. This reduces TLS handshake overhead, connection state memory usage, and overall latency.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Coalescing Strategy</th>\n<th>Certificate Requirement</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Performance Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Same Certificate</td>\n<td>Single cert covers multiple hostnames via SAN</td>\n<td>Low - simple hostname validation</td>\n<td>High - eliminates redundant connections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wildcard Certificate</td>\n<td>Wildcard cert matches subdomain pattern</td>\n<td>Medium - pattern matching logic</td>\n<td>Medium - reduces connections for subdomain services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authority Validation</td>\n<td>Different certs with same CA and compatible policies</td>\n<td>High - certificate chain analysis</td>\n<td>Low - limited applicability</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The server implementation requires extending connection management to track hostname associations and certificate coverage:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component Extension</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Methods</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>CertificateManager</code></td>\n<td>Validates hostname coverage and certificate compatibility</td>\n<td><code>ValidateHostname</code>, <code>GetCoalescingCandidates</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConnectionPool</code></td>\n<td>Manages shared connections across hostnames</td>\n<td><code>FindCoalescableConnection</code>, <code>RegisterHostname</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>HostRouter</code></td>\n<td>Routes requests to appropriate handlers based on hostname</td>\n<td><code>ResolveHandler</code>, <code>ValidateHostnameRequest</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Connection coalescing requires careful validation to prevent security violations. The server must ensure that requests for different hostnames are truly authorized to share the same connection based on certificate coverage and organizational policies. This involves validating Subject Alternative Names (SAN) in certificates and checking that hostname resolution points to the same server infrastructure.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Connection Coalescing Algorithm:\n1. Client establishes connection to hostname A with certificate validation\n2. Client needs connection to hostname B on the same IP address\n3.

Server routes requests based on :authority header to appropriate handlers\n6. Server maintains mapping of hostname to connection for future requests\n7.

Each connection can handle many simultaneous streams, so the optimization focus shifts from connection quantity to connection quality and longevity.</p>\n<p>The mental model centers around connection lifecycle management and resource efficiency.

avoid typical HTTP/2 implementation mistakes and follows established practices.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: Error Boundary Principles</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2&#39;s error handling philosophy prioritizes fault isolation - containing errors at the smallest possible scope. Stream errors should remain stream errors unless they indicate broader corruption like HPACK table inconsistency. This principle guides implementation decisions throughout the protocol stack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: State Machine Complexity</strong></p>\n<p>Stream state machines appear complex but follow logical patterns based on frame semantics. The <code>END_STREAM</code> flag drives most transitions, while <code>RST_STREAM</code> provides emergency termination from any state. Understanding these patterns simplifies implementation and debugging.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: Flow Control Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>HTTP/2 flow control implements receiver-driven backpressure, meaning receivers control the rate at which they consume data. This inverts traditional congestion control and requires careful coordination between connection and stream windows to prevent deadlocks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3

production-grade HTTP/2 server with full multiplexing, binary framing, and header compression capabilities. The key architectural challenge is managing concurrent multiplexed streams over a single TCP connection while implementing complex binary protocol parsing, HPACK compression, and flow control mechanisms.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides foundational context for all milestones (1-4) by explaining the historical motivations for HTTP/2 and the architectural challenges we'll solve.\n\nThe evolution from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents one of the most significant protocol upgrades in web history, fundamentally changing how browsers and servers communicate. Think of HTTP/1.1 as a narrow bridge where cars must cross single-file, with each car waiting for the previous one to completely cross before starting its journey. HTTP/2, in contrast, is like a modern multi-lane highway where multiple vehicles can travel simultaneously, with sophisticated traffic management systems optimizing flow and reducing overall travel time.\n\nUnderstanding why HTTP/2 exists and what problems it solves is crucial for implementing it correctly. This protocol wasn't created in isolation—it emerged from real-world performance bottlenecks that plagued web applications as they grew more complex and resource-intensive. The transition from text-based HTTP/1.1 to binary HTTP/2 also introduces significant implementation complexity that we must carefully navigate.\n\n### HTTP/1.1 Limitations\n\nHTTP/1.1 served the web admirably for over two decades, but its design assumptions became increasingly problematic as web applications evolved from simple document retrieval to complex, resource-heavy applications. The protocol's fundamental architecture creates three critical bottlenecks that severely impact modern web performance.\n\n**Head-of-Line Blocking: The Traffic Jam Problem**\n\nThe most severe limitation of HTTP/1.1 is head-of-line blocking, which occurs because the protocol processes requests sequentially over each TCP connection. Imagine a drive-through restaurant where customers must place their entire order, wait for it to be completely prepared and delivered, before the next customer can even begin ordering. This serialization creates devastating performance impacts when any single request experiences delays.\n\nConsider a typical web page requiring an HTML document, three CSS files, five JavaScript files, and ten images. In HTTP/1.1, if the second CSS file takes 2 seconds to generate on the server (perhaps due to complex preprocessing), every subsequent request must wait those full 2 seconds before even beginning to process, despite other resources being immediately available. This blocking effect compounds across the entire page load, turning minor delays into major performance degradations.\n\nThe mathematical impact is severe: if a page requires 20 resources and the 3rd resource is delayed by D seconds, the total additional delay becomes (20-2) × D seconds for that connection. This creates unpredictable and often catastrophic loading behavior where a single slow resource can effectively halt the entire page rendering process.\n\n| Blocking Scenario | Resources Affected | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|---|\n| Slow database query for one CSS file | All subsequent resources on connection | Linear delay multiplication |\n| Large image processing delay | All resources queued behind it | Complete rendering stall |\n| Third-party API timeout | Entire connection frozen | Cascading failure to other resources |\n| CDN routing issue for one asset | All remaining assets on connection | Unpredictable load times |\n\n**Connection Overhead: The Infrastructure Tax**\n\nHTTP/1.1's head-of-line blocking problem led to a common workaround: opening multiple parallel TCP connections to the same server. Browsers typically open 6-8 connections per domain, attempting to work around the serialization bottleneck. However, this approach introduces its own set of problems that often make performance worse rather than better.\n\nEach TCP connection requires a full three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), taking at minimum one full round-trip time (RTT) to establish. For HTTPS connections, an additional TLS handshake adds 1-2 more RTTs depending on TLS version and session resumption. With typical internet latencies of 50-200ms, establishing a single connection can cost 150-600ms before any application data flows. Multiplying this by 6-8 connections creates substantial overhead that often exceeds the time needed to actually transfer the resources.\n\nThe connection management overhead extends beyond initial establishment. Each connection consumes memory on both client and server for TCP buffers, connection state, and TLS session information. Servers must maintain separate socket handles, buffer space, and processing threads for each connection. For high-traffic sites, this resource consumption becomes a significant scaling bottleneck, limiting the number of concurrent clients the server can handle effectively.\n\nConnection proliferation also creates network inefficiency through poor congestion control behavior. TCP's congestion control algorithms are designed to fairly share bandwidth between connections, but multiple connections from the same client to the same server subvert this fairness mechanism. Six connections effectively get six times their \"fair share\" of bandwidth compared to other network users, creating a tragedy-of-the-commons scenario that degrades overall network performance.\n\n| Connection Issue | Technical Impact | Resource Cost |\n|---|---|---|\n| TCP handshake overhead | 1 RTT per connection minimum | 150-600ms delay per connection |\n| TLS handshake overhead | 1-2 additional RTTs per connection | 300-1200ms additional delay |\n| Memory consumption | ~64KB buffers per connection | 384KB-512KB per domain |\n| Server file descriptor limits | One FD per connection | Reduced concurrent client capacity |\n| Congestion control gaming | Unfair bandwidth allocation | Network-wide performance degradation |\n\n**Header Redundancy: The Repetition Problem**\n\nHTTP/1.1 sends headers as plain text with every request and response, creating massive redundancy that becomes increasingly problematic as applications use more sophisticated client-side technologies. Modern web applications typically send 20-40 headers per request, including lengthy values like User-Agent strings (often 200+ characters), detailed Accept headers, authentication tokens, and various tracking cookies.\n\nThe redundancy problem is particularly severe because most headers remain identical across requests within the same browsing session. The User-Agent header, for example, never changes throughout an entire session but gets transmitted with every single request. Cookie headers often contain session tokens, user preferences, and tracking data that remain static for hours or days but are retransmitted thousands of times. Authorization headers like JWT tokens can be several kilobytes in size but remain unchanged across hundreds of API calls.\n\nThis redundancy has a multiplicative effect on bandwidth consumption and latency. A typical modern web application might send 2-4KB of headers per request. For a page requiring 50 resources, this represents 100-200KB of redundant header data—often exceeding the actual content size. On mobile networks with limited bandwidth and high per-byte costs, this redundancy directly translates to slower loading times and increased user costs.\n\nThe textual format of HTTP/1.1 headers also prevents any optimization opportunities. Headers must be parsed character by character, creating processing overhead on both client and server. There's no mechanism for header compression, caching of common values, or elimination of redundant information across requests.\n\n| Redundancy Issue | Typical Size | Impact per 50-Resource Page |\n|---|---|---|\n| User-Agent header | 200-300 bytes | 10-15KB redundant data |\n| Cookie headers | 500-2000 bytes | 25-100KB redundant data |\n| Accept-* headers | 300-500 bytes | 15-25KB redundant data |\n| Authorization tokens | 1000-4000 bytes | 50-200KB redundant data |\n| **Total header overhead** | **2-4KB per request** | **100-200KB redundant transmission** |\n\n> The combination of these three limitations—head-of-line blocking, connection overhead, and header redundancy—creates a perfect storm of performance problems that compound each other. Attempting to solve head-of-line blocking with more connections exacerbates connection overhead, while the additional connections multiply header redundancy across more parallel streams.\n\n### HTTP/2 Benefits\n\nHTTP/2 addresses each of HTTP/1.1's fundamental limitations through a comprehensive protocol redesign built around four core innovations: multiplexing, binary framing, header compression, and flow control. Rather than applying incremental patches to HTTP/1.1's text-based design, HTTP/2 represents a ground-up rethinking of how HTTP semantics can be efficiently transported over modern networks.\n\n**Multiplexing: The Multi-Lane Highway**\n\nHTTP/2's multiplexing capability transforms the single-file bridge of HTTP/1.1 into a sophisticated multi-lane highway with dynamic lane allocation. Think of it as a modern airport terminal where multiple flights can board simultaneously at different gates, with passengers flowing efficiently through shared infrastructure without blocking each other. This analogy captures the essence of HTTP/2's stream-based architecture.\n\nMultiplexing works by introducing the concept of **streams**—independent, bidirectional sequences of frames that carry a single request-response exchange. Multiple streams can operate concurrently over a single TCP connection, with frames from different streams interleaved at the binary framing layer. When stream 3 is waiting for a slow database query, streams 5, 7, and 11 can continue transmitting their responses without any blocking. This eliminates head-of-line blocking at the HTTP layer entirely.\n\nThe technical implementation uses stream IDs to multiplex frames over the shared connection. Each frame carries a 31-bit stream identifier that allows the receiving endpoint to reconstruct multiple concurrent conversations from the interleaved frame sequence. Client-initiated streams use odd-numbered IDs (1, 3, 5, ...) while server-initiated streams (for server push) use even-numbered IDs (2, 4, 6, ...). This simple scheme allows for over 2 billion concurrent streams per connection direction.\n\nPriority handling adds sophisticated traffic management to the multiplexing system. Streams can be assigned weights (1-256) and dependencies, creating a priority tree that guides frame transmission order. Critical resources like CSS files can be marked as high priority, ensuring they're transmitted before less critical resources like analytics tracking pixels. This priority system allows applications to optimize perceived performance by ensuring render-blocking resources arrive first.\n\n| Multiplexing Feature | HTTP/1.1 Limitation | HTTP/2 Solution |\n|---|---|---|\n| Concurrent requests | Sequential processing | Unlimited concurrent streams |\n| Head-of-line blocking | One slow request blocks all others | Stream independence |\n| Resource prioritization | No priority mechanism | Weight-based priority tree |\n| Connection utilization | Multiple connections needed | Single connection handles all traffic |\n| Request interleaving | Impossible | Frame-level interleaving |\n\n**Binary Framing: The Efficient Transport Layer**\n\nHTTP/2's binary framing layer represents a fundamental shift from HTTP/1.1's text-based approach to a carefully designed binary protocol optimized for machine processing. Think of this as the difference between sending a handwritten letter (which requires human interpretation) versus a structured database record (which can be processed algorithmically). The binary approach enables significant performance and reliability improvements.\n\nThe framing layer introduces a universal frame format with a fixed 9-byte header containing length (24 bits), type (8 bits), flags (8 bits), and stream ID (31 bits). This structured approach eliminates the parsing ambiguities inherent in text-based protocols. HTTP/1.1 parsers must handle numerous edge cases around header folding, whitespace handling, and line ending variations. Binary frames have precisely defined boundaries and unambiguous field meanings.\n\nFrame types provide specialized containers for different kinds of HTTP/2 communication. DATA frames carry request and response payloads, HEADERS frames contain compressed header information, SETTINGS frames negotiate connection parameters, WINDOW_UPDATE frames manage flow control, and PING frames enable connection health monitoring. Each frame type has optimized encoding for its specific purpose, eliminating the one-size-fits-all approach of HTTP/1.1's text format.\n\nThe binary format enables powerful optimizations impossible with text protocols. Frames can be processed with simple memory copies and bit operations rather than complex string parsing. Field extraction becomes a matter of reading fixed offsets rather than scanning for delimiter characters. Frame validation can be performed with simple integer comparisons rather than complex regular expressions.\n\nError handling becomes more robust with binary framing. Malformed frames can be detected immediately through length and type field validation, rather than requiring complex protocol state machines to detect text parsing errors. The binary format also enables precise error reporting—specific fields can be identified as invalid rather than reporting vague \"malformed request\" errors.\n\n| Binary Framing Advantage | Technical Benefit | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|---|\n| Fixed frame header format | Eliminates parsing ambiguity | 10-100x faster frame processing |\n| Type-specific frame encoding | Optimized encoding per use case | Reduced bandwidth consumption |\n| Unambiguous field boundaries | No delimiter scanning needed | Constant-time field extraction |\n| Built-in length prefixing | No buffer overrun vulnerabilities | Improved security and reliability |\n| Machine-optimized format | Bit operations vs. string parsing | Lower CPU overhead |\n\n**Header Compression: The Smart Caching System**\n\nHTTP/2's HPACK header compression system solves the redundancy problem through a sophisticated caching and compression scheme that can achieve 85-95% header size reductions in typical scenarios. Think of HPACK as a smart filing system that remembers what documents you've sent before and references them by index number rather than retransmitting the full content. This analogy captures both the efficiency gains and the stateful nature of the compression system.\n\nHPACK operates using two complementary mechanisms: a static table of common header name-value pairs defined in the specification, and a dynamic table that builds up common patterns specific to each connection. The static table contains 61 predefined entries covering the most common headers like `:method: GET`, `:status: 200`, and `content-type: text/html`. These can be referenced by a single byte index rather than transmitting the full header text.\n\nThe dynamic table learns connection-specific patterns and builds a cache of frequently used header combinations. When a new header like `authorization: Bearer xyz123token` is first sent, it's transmitted in full but also added to the dynamic table. Subsequent requests can reference this header by its dynamic table index, reducing a potentially multi-kilobyte authorization header to a single byte reference.\n\nHuffman encoding provides additional compression for header values that can't be completely eliminated through table references. HPACK uses a custom Huffman table optimized for typical HTTP header content, achieving significant compression ratios for header values while maintaining fast decode performance. The Huffman encoding is particularly effective for headers containing common English words, URLs, and typical header values.\n\nThe compression system includes sophisticated table management to prevent memory exhaustion. The dynamic table has a configurable size limit (typically 4KB) and uses FIFO eviction when the limit is reached. This ensures bounded memory usage while maintaining high hit rates for recently used headers. Connection-specific optimization means that each client-server pair develops its own optimized header vocabulary over time.\n\n| HPACK Component | Compression Mechanism | Typical Size Reduction |\n|---|---|---|\n| Static table references | Index lookup for common headers | 95-99% reduction for common headers |\n| Dynamic table references | Connection-specific header caching | 90-95% reduction for repeated headers |\n| Huffman encoding | Optimized compression for header values | 20-40% reduction for textual content |\n| Literal header encoding | Efficient encoding for new headers | 10-20% overhead for initial transmission |\n| **Combined effect** | **All mechanisms together** | **85-95% total header reduction** |\n\n**Server Push: Proactive Resource Delivery**\n\nServer push represents HTTP/2's most revolutionary feature, enabling servers to proactively send resources to clients before they're explicitly requested. Imagine a restaurant that starts preparing your usual appetizer as soon as you sit down, based on your ordering history—by the time you're ready for it, it's already available. Server push applies this same proactive approach to web resource delivery.\n\nThe push mechanism works through PUSH_PROMISE frames that inform the client about resources the server intends to push. When serving an HTML page, the server can analyze embedded references to CSS, JavaScript, and image files, then immediately begin pushing these resources while the client is still processing the HTML. By the time the client's HTML parser discovers a `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` tag, the CSS file may already be fully received and cached.\n\nPush promises prevent duplicate requests through a promise caching mechanism. When the server sends a PUSH_PROMISE for `/styles.css`, the client marks this resource as \"promised\" in its cache. If the HTML parser later encounters a reference to `/styles.css`, the client can immediately use the pushed resource rather than initiating a new request. This eliminates the traditional waterfall loading pattern where resource dependencies are discovered sequentially.\n\nHowever, server push introduces complexity around cache validation and client state prediction. The server must avoid pushing resources the client already has cached, as this wastes bandwidth and can actually harm performance. Effective push implementations require sophisticated algorithms to predict what resources the client needs and doesn't already possess.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: While server push is powerful, it's also the most complex HTTP/2 feature to implement correctly and can easily harm performance if used inappropriately. Many production implementations start with multiplexing and header compression, adding push capabilities only after mastering the foundational features.\n\n### Implementation Challenges\n\nImplementing HTTP/2 correctly presents several interconnected technical challenges that are significantly more complex than typical HTTP/1.1 server implementation. The protocol's sophisticated features create a web of dependencies between binary parsing, state management, concurrent processing, and resource control that must be carefully orchestrated to achieve correct and performant behavior.\n\n**Binary Protocol Parsing: The Precision Engineering Challenge**\n\nBinary protocol parsing represents a fundamental shift from the forgiving, text-based parsing traditionally used for HTTP/1.1. Think of this as the difference between assembling furniture from IKEA instructions (where small mistakes are recoverable) versus performing precision surgery (where exact technique is critical for success). Binary protocols demand precise handling of every bit and byte, with no room for the flexible interpretation that text protocols traditionally allow.\n\nThe HTTP/2 frame format requires careful attention to byte ordering, bit field extraction, and length validation. The 24-bit length field spans three bytes and must be converted from network byte order (big-endian) to host byte order on little-endian systems. The 8-bit flags field contains bit-packed flags whose meaning varies by frame type—the END_STREAM flag in DATA frames has different implications than in HEADERS frames. The 31-bit stream ID field includes a reserved bit that must always be zero, requiring proper masking during extraction.\n\nFrame parsing must handle partial receives and buffer management complexities absent from text protocols. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where line-based parsing can process partial headers gracefully, binary frames must be received completely before processing. This requires implementing buffering state machines that can accumulate frame data across multiple TCP receive operations, while properly handling the transition between frame header and payload regions.\n\nPayload processing varies significantly by frame type, requiring specialized parsing logic for each frame variant. HEADERS frames contain HPACK-compressed header blocks that require stateful decompression. SETTINGS frames contain key-value pairs with specific validation rules—the SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE parameter must not exceed 2^31-1, while SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE must be between 16,384 and 16,777,215. DATA frames are simpler but must respect flow control constraints.\n\nError detection and recovery in binary protocols requires more sophisticated approaches than text protocol parsing. Malformed frames can't be \"skipped\" like malformed HTTP/1.1 headers—a single byte offset error can make the entire connection unusable. This necessitates robust validation at every parsing stage and careful error propagation to prevent cascading failures.\n\n| Parsing Challenge | Complexity Factor | Error Consequences |\n|---|---|---|\n| Multi-byte integer extraction | Endianness handling, bit masking | Connection corruption |\n| Frame type dispatch | Type-specific validation logic | Protocol violation |\n| Partial frame buffering | State machine complexity | Memory leak potential |\n| HPACK integration | Stateful decompression coupling | Compression context corruption |\n| Flow control integration | Per-frame window accounting | Resource exhaustion |\n\n**State Machine Complexity: The Orchestration Challenge**\n\nHTTP/2's state management complexity far exceeds HTTP/1.1 due to the interaction between connection-level state, per-stream state machines, and shared resources like HPACK compression contexts. Think of this as conducting a symphony orchestra where each musician (stream) has their own piece of music (state machine), but they all must coordinate timing (flow control) and share limited resources (connection settings) while the conductor (connection handler) ensures overall coherence.\n\nStream state machines follow the HTTP/2 specification's defined states: idle, reserved (local/remote), open, half-closed (local/remote), and closed. Each state has specific rules about what frames can be sent or received, what transitions are valid, and what actions must be taken. A stream in the \"half-closed (remote)\" state can send frames but cannot receive them—attempting to process a received DATA frame in this state constitutes a protocol error requiring stream reset.\n\nConnection-level state management coordinates global settings, flow control windows, and HPACK compression contexts that are shared across all streams. The connection maintains a settings registry where parameters like SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE affect HPACK operation for all streams, while SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limits how many streams can be active simultaneously. Changes to these settings can have cascading effects across the entire connection.\n\nThe interaction between stream and connection state creates complex edge cases that must be handled correctly. When the connection's SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS is reduced, existing streams may need to be queued or reset. When a stream transitions to closed state, its flow control window allocation must be returned to the connection-level pool. HPACK table size changes must be synchronized across all active streams using the same compression context.\n\nConcurrency adds another layer of complexity, as multiple goroutines or threads may be operating on different streams simultaneously while sharing connection-level resources. This requires careful synchronization to prevent race conditions in settings updates, HPACK table modifications, and flow control window management. The synchronization must be fine-grained enough to allow high concurrency while preventing the deadlocks that can occur when multiple streams compete for limited resources.\n\n| State Management Challenge | Synchronization Requirement | Failure Mode |\n|---|---|---|\n| Per-stream state machines | Stream-local locking | Invalid state transitions |\n| Connection-level settings | Global coordination | Settings race conditions |\n| HPACK table sharing | Compression context locking | Table corruption |\n| Flow control coordination | Window update synchronization | Deadlock or window leaks |\n| Stream lifecycle management | Creation/destruction coordination | Resource leaks |\n\n**Concurrency Management: The Resource Coordination Challenge**\n\nHTTP/2's multiplexing capabilities create unprecedented concurrency management challenges compared to HTTP/1.1's simple request-response model. The protocol enables potentially thousands of concurrent streams over a single connection, each with independent lifecycle, flow control, and priority requirements. Think of this as managing a busy airport where thousands of passengers (streams) are simultaneously moving through shared infrastructure (connection) with different destinations (responses), priorities (business vs. economy), and timing requirements (connecting flights), all while ensuring no resource conflicts or safety violations.\n\nFlow control presents the most complex concurrency challenge, operating simultaneously at connection and stream levels with interdependent constraints. Each stream has its own send window that must be decremented atomically when sending DATA frames, while the connection-level send window must also be decremented for the same frames. WINDOW_UPDATE frames can arrive asynchronously for either stream or connection windows, requiring careful coordination to wake up blocked streams when window space becomes available.\n\nResource sharing creates potential contention points that must be carefully managed to prevent performance degradation. The HPACK compression context is shared across all streams but requires exclusive access during header processing to prevent table corruption. Connection settings affect all streams but can be updated asynchronously through SETTINGS frames. Priority tree management requires atomic updates to prevent inconsistent stream dependencies.\n\nBackpressure handling becomes critical when the server cannot keep up with incoming stream creation or when flow control windows become exhausted. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where backpressure naturally occurs through TCP's window mechanism, HTTP/2 requires application-level backpressure management. Streams may need to be queued when concurrent stream limits are reached, or data transmission may need to be suspended when flow control windows are exhausted.\n\nThe interaction between HTTP/2's flow control and TCP's flow control creates a multi-layered backpressure system that must be coordinated carefully. HTTP/2 flow control can create artificial backpressure even when TCP has available window space, while TCP backpressure can cause HTTP/2 flow control windows to appear available when they're actually blocked at the transport layer.\n\n> **Architecture Decision Record: Concurrency Model**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 multiplexing requires handling hundreds or thousands of concurrent streams over a single TCP connection, with shared resources and complex inter-dependencies.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Thread-per-stream model with shared connection state\n>   2. Single-threaded event loop with async/await patterns  \n>   3. Hybrid model with connection-level thread and stream worker pools\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid model with dedicated connection thread for frame I/O and worker pool for stream processing\n> - **Rationale**: Connection thread provides serialized access to shared resources (HPACK, settings) while worker pool enables parallel stream processing. This avoids the synchronization complexity of thread-per-stream while providing better CPU utilization than single-threaded approaches.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful work distribution between connection thread and workers, but provides good scalability and manageable synchronization complexity.\n\n| Concurrency Challenge | Coordination Requirement | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|---|\n| Flow control window updates | Atomic window arithmetic across streams | Potential deadlocks if mismanaged |\n| HPACK table access | Exclusive access during compression/decompression | Serialization bottleneck |\n| Priority tree management | Atomic dependency updates | Inconsistent stream scheduling |\n| Settings propagation | Connection-wide atomic updates | Temporary inconsistent state |\n| Stream lifecycle events | Creation/destruction coordination | Resource leak potential |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides practical guidance for implementing the HTTP/2 server architecture, focusing on Go-based solutions that balance simplicity with production-readiness. The recommendations here establish patterns that will be expanded in subsequent sections covering each component in detail.\n\n**A.

Core Logic Skeleton Code:**\n\n```go\n// internal/frame/parser.go - Frame parsing skeleton\npackage frame\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/binary\"\n    \"io\"\n    \"http2-server/internal/protocol\"\n)\n\n// Frame represents a parsed HTTP/2 frame\ntype Frame struct {\n    Length   uint32\n    Type     uint8\n    Flags    uint8\n    StreamID uint32\n    Payload  []byte\n}\n\n// ParseFrame reads and parses a complete HTTP/2 frame from the reader.\n// Returns the parsed frame or an error if parsing fails.\nfunc ParseFrame(r io.Reader) (*Frame, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Read exactly 9 bytes for frame header\n    // TODO 2: Extract length field from bytes 0-2 (24-bit big-endian)\n    // TODO 3: Extract type field from byte 3\n    // TODO 4: Extract flags field from byte 4  \n    // TODO 5: Extract stream ID from bytes 5-8 (31-bit big-endian, mask reserved bit)\n    // TODO 6: Validate frame length doesn't exceed MaxFrameSize\n    // TODO 7: Read exactly Length bytes for payload\n    // TODO 8: Return constructed Frame struct\n    // Hint: Use binary.BigEndian.Uint32() for multi-byte integers\n    // Hint: Stream ID reserved bit is 0x80000000, mask with 0x7FFFFFFF\n}\n\n// SerializeFrame writes a frame to the writer in HTTP/2 wire format.\n// Returns number of bytes written or error.\nfunc SerializeFrame(w io.Writer, f *Frame) (int, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Create 9-byte header buffer\n    // TODO 2: Encode length field into bytes 0-2 (24-bit big-endian)\n    // TODO 3: Encode type field into byte 3\n    // TODO 4: Encode flags field into byte 4\n    // TODO 5: Encode stream ID into bytes 5-8 (31-bit big-endian)\n    // TODO 6: Write header buffer to writer\n    // TODO 7: Write payload buffer to writer\n    // TODO 8: Return total bytes written\n    // Hint: Use binary.BigEndian.PutUint32() then slice off unwanted bytes for 24-bit length\n}\n\n// ValidateFrame checks if a frame conforms to HTTP/2 protocol rules.\n// Returns protocol error if validation fails.\nfunc ValidateFrame(f *Frame) error {\n    // TODO 1: Check if frame length matches payload length\n    // TODO 2: Validate frame length doesn't exceed MaxFrameSize  \n    // TODO 3: Check reserved bit in stream ID is zero\n    // TODO 4: Validate frame type is recognized (0-9)\n    // TODO 5: Perform frame-type specific validation\n    // TODO 6: Return appropriate protocol error for violations\n    // Hint: Different frame types have different validation rules\n    // Hint: Some flags are only valid for specific frame types\n}\n```\n\n**E. Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n- **Binary Parsing**: Use `encoding/binary` package for endianness-safe integer extraction. `binary.BigEndian.Uint32(buf[:4])` handles 32-bit big-endian conversion automatically.\n\n- **Buffered I/O**: Use `bufio.Reader` and `bufio.Writer` for efficient frame I/O. The `ReadFull()` function ensures exact byte counts are read, which is critical for binary protocols.\n\n- **Concurrency**: Use `sync.RWMutex` for stream maps that have many readers but few writers. Use `sync.Mutex` for simpler cases or when write frequency is high.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Create custom error types that implement the `error` interface for protocol-specific errors. This enables type assertions for different error handling strategies.\n\n- **Memory Management**: Use `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated/deallocated buffers like frame headers to reduce GC pressure in high-throughput scenarios.\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the foundation described in this section, verify the setup with these checkpoints:\n\n1. **Project Structure Verification**: Run `find . -name \"*.go\" | head -20` and verify the file organization matches the recommended structure.\n\n2. **Basic Compilation**: Run `go build ./...` to ensure all packages compile without errors. Address any import or syntax issues.\n\n3. **Protocol Constants**: Run `go test -v ./internal/protocol/...` to verify protocol constants and error types are correctly defined.\n\n4. **Infrastructure Code**: Test the connection wrapper with:\n   ```bash\n   go run examples/basic/main.go\n   # Should start server without panicking\n   # Ctrl+C to stop\n   ```\n\n5. **Expected Behavior**: The server should start, bind to a port, and accept connections without processing HTTP/2 frames yet. This establishes the foundation for implementing frame parsing in Milestone 1.\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- **Import errors**: Usually indicate incorrect module structure or missing go.mod\n- **Compilation failures**: Often caused by incorrect type definitions or missing constants\n- **Runtime panics on startup**: Typically indicate nil pointer dereferences in connection setup\n\n**G. Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| \"Package not found\" import errors | Incorrect module path or file location | Check go.mod module name matches import paths | Align import paths with module structure |\n| Constants not recognized | Missing protocol constant definitions | Verify constants.go is in correct package | Import protocol package where constants are used |\n| Connection setup panics | Nil reader/writer in connection wrapper | Add nil checks in NewConnection | Initialize bufio readers/writers properly |\n| Build succeeds but tests fail | Missing test dependencies | Run `go mod tidy` to resolve dependencies | Add missing test imports and dependencies |\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides the scope and boundaries for all milestones (1-4) by defining what the HTTP/2 server implementation will achieve and explicitly excluding features outside the learning objectives.\n\n### Mental Model: Building a Race Car vs. A Production Vehicle\n\nThink of this HTTP/2 server implementation like building a Formula 1 race car for a specific track rather than designing a family sedan for everyday use. Our goal is to demonstrate mastery of HTTP/2's core technical challenges—binary framing, multiplexing, and header compression—rather than creating a production-ready server with all the bells and whistles. Just as a Formula 1 car strips away air conditioning and cup holders to focus on speed and handling, we'll implement the essential HTTP/2 mechanisms while deliberately excluding production concerns like advanced security, monitoring, and performance optimizations.\n\nThis focused approach serves the learning objectives better than attempting to build everything. By the end of this project, you'll have a deep understanding of how HTTP/2's revolutionary features work under the hood, but you won't have spent time on ancillary concerns that don't teach the core protocols.\n\n### Functional Goals\n\nOur HTTP/2 server implementation targets four primary functional capabilities that demonstrate mastery of the protocol's most important innovations. These goals directly correspond to the milestone structure and ensure comprehensive coverage of HTTP/2's technical foundations.\n\n> **Decision: Core Protocol Implementation Over Feature Completeness**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 specification includes numerous features ranging from essential (binary framing) to optional (server push) to implementation-specific (performance optimizations)\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Implement minimal subset (frames only)\n>   - Implement core features (framing + multiplexing + compression + flow control)\n>   - Implement full specification including optional features\n> - **Decision**: Focus on core features that demonstrate the protocol's key innovations\n> - **Rationale**: Core features represent the fundamental paradigm shifts from HTTP/1.1 and provide the most educational value. Optional features can be learned later once the foundation is solid.\n> - **Consequences**: Results in a server that can handle real HTTP/2 clients but lacks production deployment features. Provides deep understanding of protocol mechanics without feature creep.\n\n#### Binary Framing Layer Implementation\n\nThe server must implement complete binary framing capabilities as defined in RFC 7540 Section 4. This includes parsing incoming frames from the wire format, validating frame structure and constraints, and serializing outgoing frames back to binary format.\n\nFrame parsing functionality encompasses reading the 9-byte frame header containing length, type, flags, and stream ID fields, along with extracting the variable-length payload based on the length field. The implementation must handle endianness correctly, validate frame length constraints (maximum `MaxFrameSize` of 16,777,215 bytes), and properly interpret reserved bits according to the specification.\n\n| Frame Type | Purpose | Required Fields | Validation Rules |\n|------------|---------|----------------|------------------|\n| `FrameTypeDATA` | Carries request/response payload | Stream ID, optional padding | Stream ID must be non-zero, payload respects flow control |\n| `FrameTypeHEADERS` | Contains request/response headers | Stream ID, compressed header block | Stream ID must be non-zero, header block must be HPACK-compressed |\n| `FrameTypeSETTINGS` | Communicates connection parameters | Settings identifier and value pairs | Stream ID must be zero for connection-level settings |\n| `FrameTypePING` | Connection keepalive mechanism | 8-byte opaque data | Stream ID must be zero, payload exactly 8 bytes |\n| `FrameTypeGOAWAY` | Graceful connection termination | Last stream ID, error code, debug data | Stream ID must be zero, last stream ID valid |\n| `FrameTypeWINDOW_UPDATE` | Flow control window adjustments | Window size increment | Non-zero increment, valid stream ID |\n\nThe frame validation system must enforce protocol compliance including frame size limits, appropriate stream ID usage (zero for connection-level frames, non-zero for stream-specific frames), and flag interpretation based on frame type. Frame serialization reverses this process, converting internal frame representations back to the binary wire format with proper byte ordering and length calculation.\n\n#### HTTP/2 Multiplexing and Stream Management\n\nThe server implements full multiplexing capabilities allowing multiple concurrent request-response streams over a single TCP connection. This eliminates HTTP/1.1's head-of-line blocking problem by interleaving frames from different streams based on availability rather than processing requests sequentially.\n\nStream management includes implementing the complete HTTP/2 stream state machine with states idle, reserved (local), reserved (remote), open, half-closed (local), half-closed (remote), and closed. State transitions occur based on frame reception and transmission, with strict validation to prevent protocol violations.\n\n| Current State | Triggering Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------|\n| idle | Receive HEADERS frame | open | Create stream, begin header processing |\n| idle | Send PUSH_PROMISE frame | reserved (local) | Reserve stream for server push |\n| open | Send frame with END_STREAM flag | half-closed (local) | Mark local endpoint finished |\n| open | Receive frame with END_STREAM flag | half-closed (remote) | Mark remote endpoint finished |\n| half-closed (local) | Receive frame with END_STREAM flag | closed | Complete stream lifecycle |\n| half-closed (remote) | Send frame with END_STREAM flag | closed | Complete stream lifecycle |\n| Any state | Send/Receive RST_STREAM frame | closed | Immediate stream termination |\n\nStream ID allocation follows HTTP/2 conventions with client-initiated streams using odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) and server-initiated streams using even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). The implementation tracks the highest stream ID seen to prevent stream ID reuse and detect protocol violations.\n\nConcurrent stream limits enforce the `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` setting, rejecting new streams when the limit is exceeded and properly handling stream closure to allow new streams. Stream prioritization provides basic weight-based scheduling, though advanced dependency tree features are excluded from our scope.\n\n#### HPACK Header Compression Engine\n\nThe server implements RFC 7541 HPACK compression providing efficient header compression through static table lookups, dynamic table management, and Huffman encoding. This addresses HTTP/1.1's header redundancy problem where identical headers are transmitted repeatedly.\n\nStatic table implementation includes the predefined 61-entry table containing common HTTP headers like `:method`, `:path`, `:status`, and frequently used header-value pairs. The static table provides immediate compression benefits for standard HTTP semantics without connection-specific state.\n\n| Index | Header Name | Header Value | Usage |\n|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1 | :authority | | Common for all requests |\n| 2 | :method | GET | Most frequent HTTP method |\n| 3 | :method | POST | Second most frequent method |\n| 4 | :path | / | Default path |\n| 8 | :status | 200 | Successful response |\n| 13 | :status | 404 | Not found error |\n| 14 | :status | 500 | Server error |\n\nDynamic table management maintains a connection-specific FIFO table that grows and shrinks based on header frequency and size constraints. The dynamic table uses configurable size limits (typically 4,096 bytes) with automatic eviction of oldest entries when space is needed for new entries.\n\nHeader encoding supports three representation types: indexed header field (reference to static or dynamic table), literal header field with incremental indexing (add to dynamic table), and literal header field never indexed (sensitive headers). The implementation must correctly calculate table indices, manage table size updates, and handle integer encoding with 5-bit, 6-bit, and 7-bit prefixes.\n\nHuffman decoding decompresses header values encoded with HTTP/2's predefined Huffman table optimized for HTTP header patterns. The decoder must handle bit-aligned input, padding validation, and error recovery for malformed Huffman sequences.\n\n#### Flow Control and Backpressure Management\n\nThe server implements HTTP/2's credit-based flow control at both connection and individual stream levels. This prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers and provides fairness across multiplexed streams sharing the same connection.\n\nConnection-level flow control tracks a single window size that limits the total bytes of `DATA` frame payloads across all streams on the connection. The initial connection window defaults to `InitialWindowSize` (65,535 bytes) and can be adjusted via `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE`.\n\nStream-level flow control maintains independent window sizes for each stream, initialized to the connection's initial window size setting. Each stream consumes from both its individual window and the connection's aggregate window when sending `DATA` frames.\n\n| Window Type | Scope | Initial Size | Update Mechanism |\n|-------------|-------|--------------|------------------|\n| Connection Window | All streams combined | 65,535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE frame with stream ID 0 |\n| Stream Window | Individual stream | 65,535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE frame with specific stream ID |\n\nWindow management processes `WINDOW_UPDATE` frames to increment available send capacity, validates window size calculations to prevent overflow conditions, and implements backpressure by queueing data when send windows are exhausted.\n\nThe implementation must handle edge cases including window underflow (sending more than window allows), window overflow (increment causes size to exceed maximum), and deadlock prevention when both endpoints have exhausted windows.\n\n### Non-Functional Goals\n\nBeyond the functional protocol implementation, our HTTP/2 server targets specific non-functional characteristics that demonstrate production-readiness concepts while maintaining educational focus.\n\n> **Decision: Reasonable Performance Over Maximum Optimization**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 implementations can range from naive (functional but slow) to highly optimized (complex but fast)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Naive implementation prioritizing simplicity\n>   - Reasonable performance with standard optimizations\n>   - High-performance implementation with advanced optimizations\n> - **Decision**: Target reasonable performance using standard library features and straightforward algorithms\n> - **Rationale**: Demonstrates awareness of performance concerns without requiring advanced optimization knowledge. Provides foundation for later optimization while keeping code readable.\n> - **Consequences**: Server will handle moderate load but won't compete with production implementations like nginx or Apache. Code remains understandable for learning purposes.\n\n#### Performance Characteristics\n\nThe server targets handling at least 100 concurrent connections with 10 streams per connection under normal conditions. This demonstrates scalability concepts without requiring advanced performance engineering. Frame processing should achieve at least 10,000 frames per second on modern hardware, showing efficient binary protocol handling.\n\nMemory usage should remain bounded with configurable limits on connection count, stream count per connection, and HPACK dynamic table sizes. The implementation uses connection pooling and reasonable buffer sizes rather than advanced memory management techniques.\n\n| Performance Metric | Target Value | Measurement Method |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Concurrent Connections | 100+ | Load testing with multiple clients |\n| Streams per Connection | 10+ | Multiplexing test with concurrent requests |\n| Frame Processing Rate | 10,000+ frames/sec | Synthetic frame generation benchmark |\n| Memory per Connection | <1 MB | Memory profiling during operation |\n| Request Latency | <10ms overhead | Comparison with HTTP/1.1 baseline |\n\n#### Resource Usage and Limits\n\nThe implementation incorporates configurable resource limits preventing resource exhaustion attacks while demonstrating defensive programming practices. Connection limits prevent file descriptor exhaustion, stream limits prevent memory consumption attacks, and flow control windows prevent bandwidth abuse.\n\nBuffer management uses reasonable defaults (64KB read buffers, 1MB write buffers) with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. Dynamic table size limits prevent HPACK decompression bombs, and frame size limits prevent oversized frame attacks.\n\n#### Reliability and Error Recovery\n\nError handling follows HTTP/2 specification guidelines distinguishing between connection errors (requiring `GOAWAY`) and stream errors (requiring `RST_STREAM`). The implementation provides graceful degradation when possible and clear error reporting for debugging.\n\nConnection recovery handles network interruptions, malformed frames, and protocol violations with appropriate error codes. Stream isolation ensures that errors in one stream don't affect other streams on the same connection unless the error is connection-level.\n\n| Error Category | Recovery Action | Client Notification |\n|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Malformed Frame | Send GOAWAY, close connection | Connection error with specific code |\n| Stream Protocol Violation | Send RST_STREAM for affected stream | Stream error, other streams unaffected |\n| Flow Control Violation | Send GOAWAY or RST_STREAM based on scope | Appropriate error code indicating violation |\n| Compression Error | Send GOAWAY (affects connection state) | Connection error, HPACK state corrupted |\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nTo maintain focus on core learning objectives, several HTTP/2 features and production concerns are explicitly excluded from our implementation scope. These exclusions prevent scope creep and ensure depth over breadth in understanding protocol fundamentals.\n\n> **Decision: Educational Depth Over Production Completeness**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 specification and production implementations include numerous features beyond core protocol mechanics\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Implement subset focusing on core innovations\n>   - Implement most features for production-like completeness\n>   - Implement minimal viable HTTP/2 server\n> - **Decision**: Exclude advanced features that don't contribute to understanding core protocol innovations\n> - **Rationale**: Advanced features often involve significant complexity that obscures fundamental concepts. Better to master fundamentals first, then add features incrementally.\n> - **Consequences**: Server won't be production-ready but will provide deep understanding of HTTP/2's key innovations. Clear path for future enhancement.\n\n#### Server Push Implementation\n\nHTTP/2 server push allows servers to proactively send resources to clients before they're requested, potentially improving page load times. However, server push involves significant complexity including resource prioritization, cache awareness, client preference handling, and push promise management.\n\nServer push implementation would require `PUSH_PROMISE` frame handling, managing server-initiated streams with even-numbered stream IDs, coordinating pushed resources with client requests, and handling push cancellation via `RST_STREAM` frames. The feature also involves application-level decisions about which resources to push and when.\n\nWhile valuable for production deployments, server push doesn't demonstrate additional protocol fundamentals beyond what we learn from client-initiated streams. The complexity would distract from mastering binary framing, multiplexing, and compression mechanisms.\n\n#### Advanced Priority and Dependency Features\n\nHTTP/2 includes sophisticated stream prioritization with dependency trees, weight inheritance, and dynamic priority updates. Production implementations often include complex scheduling algorithms, priority propagation mechanisms, and fairness guarantees across priority levels.\n\nAdvanced priority features involve dependency tree manipulation, exclusive dependencies, weight-based scheduling with inheritance, and priority frame processing. These mechanisms can significantly impact performance but require substantial algorithm complexity and careful testing.\n\nOur implementation includes basic weight-based scheduling to demonstrate priority concepts without implementing full dependency tree management. This provides foundation understanding while avoiding algorithmic complexity that doesn't teach additional protocol mechanisms.\n\n#### HTTP/3 and QUIC Integration\n\nHTTP/3 represents the next evolution of HTTP over QUIC transport, addressing some of HTTP/2's limitations like head-of-line blocking at the TCP level. However, HTTP/3 involves entirely different transport protocols, encryption integration, and connection migration concepts.\n\nHTTP/3 implementation would require QUIC protocol implementation, UDP-based transport, built-in encryption, connection migration, and different multiplexing approaches. While intellectually interesting, this represents a completely separate learning track from HTTP/2 over TCP.\n\nUnderstanding HTTP/2 thoroughly provides better foundation for later learning HTTP/3 than attempting both simultaneously. The concepts build progressively from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 to HTTP/3.\n\n#### Production Deployment Features\n\nProduction HTTP/2 servers require numerous operational features including comprehensive logging, metrics collection, health monitoring, graceful shutdown, configuration reloading, and integration with load balancers and reverse proxies.\n\nSecurity hardening involves TLS configuration, certificate management, security header handling, rate limiting, and protection against various attacks. Performance optimization includes connection pooling, buffer tuning, CPU profiling, and memory optimization.\n\nAdministrative features like runtime configuration updates, connection draining, debug endpoints, and operational metrics add significant implementation complexity without teaching HTTP/2 protocol concepts.\n\n| Excluded Feature Category | Examples | Rationale for Exclusion |\n|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------|\n| Security Hardening | TLS cipher selection, rate limiting, DDoS protection | Focus on protocol mechanics, not security implementation |\n| Operational Monitoring | Metrics collection, health checks, alerting | Infrastructure concerns separate from protocol learning |\n| Performance Optimization | Zero-copy I/O, custom memory allocators, CPU optimization | Advanced engineering beyond protocol understanding |\n| Production Integration | Load balancer integration, service discovery, container orchestration | Deployment concerns unrelated to HTTP/2 specification |\n\n#### Advanced Error Recovery and Edge Cases\n\nProduction implementations handle numerous edge cases including network partition recovery, connection migration, complex timeout scenarios, and compatibility with misbehaving clients. These scenarios often involve intricate state management and recovery logic.\n\nAdvanced error recovery might include connection backup strategies, automatic retry mechanisms, client capability detection, and fallback to HTTP/1.1. While important for production use, these features don't teach additional HTTP/2 concepts beyond basic error handling.\n\nOur implementation focuses on correct error detection and standard recovery procedures as specified in RFC 7540, providing solid foundation for understanding error semantics without extensive edge case handling.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Scope Creep Through Feature Addition**\n\nA common mistake in educational implementations is gradually adding \"just one more feature\" until the project becomes unwieldy. This typically happens when encountering real-world clients that expect certain features or when discovering interesting extensions to the base protocol.\n\n**Why it's problematic**: Each additional feature multiplies testing complexity, increases debugging difficulty, and dilutes focus from core learning objectives. Features often have subtle interactions that can mask fundamental bugs.\n\n**How to avoid**: Maintain a strict feature freeze after initial scope definition. Document feature requests for future implementation phases but resist adding them to the current scope. Focus on making the defined scope work perfectly rather than expanding functionality.\n\n**Recognition**: You're experiencing scope creep if you find yourself saying \"this should be easy to add\" or \"real clients expect this feature.\" These are valid observations but belong in separate learning phases.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides practical direction for implementing the goals and maintaining the scope boundaries defined above. The guidance focuses on establishing clear acceptance criteria and preventing common scope creep scenarios.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| HTTP/2 Frame Parsing | Manual byte parsing with encoding/binary | Third-party HTTP/2 library |\n| HPACK Compression | Custom implementation following RFC 7541 | Existing HPACK library |\n| TLS Integration | Go's crypto/tls with basic configuration | Custom TLS configuration with cipher selection |\n| Concurrency Model | Goroutines per connection with channels | Worker pools with custom scheduling |\n| Testing Framework | Standard library testing + table-driven tests | Property-based testing with fuzzing |\n| Binary Protocol Handling | encoding/binary for frame parsing | Custom bit manipulation utilities |\n\n**Recommendation**: Use simple options for maximum learning value. The goal is understanding HTTP/2 internals, not leveraging existing libraries.\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nOrganize the implementation to reflect the logical component boundaries and make the scope clear through directory structure:\n\n```\nhttp2-server/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── server/\n│       └── main.go                 ← Entry point, connection handling\n├── internal/\n│   ├── frame/\n│

goals document\n```\n\nThis structure makes the scope boundaries clear—each directory corresponds to a specific functional goal, and excluded features don't have corresponding directories.\n\n#### Scope Validation Infrastructure\n\nImplement clear acceptance criteria checking to validate goal achievement and prevent scope creep:\n\n```go\n// ScopeValidator ensures implementation stays within defined boundaries\ntype ScopeValidator struct {\n    enabledFeatures map[string]bool\n    resourceLimits  ResourceLimits\n}\n\n// ResourceLimits defines the non-functional goal boundaries\ntype ResourceLimits struct {\n    MaxConnections      int    // 100+ target\n    MaxStreamsPerConn   int    // 10+ target  \n    MaxFrameSize       uint32  // 16777215 max per spec\n    DynamicTableSize   uint32  // 4096 default\n    ConnectionWindow   uint32  // 65535 default\n}\n\n// ValidateFeatureRequest checks if a feature request aligns with goals\nfunc (sv *ScopeValidator) ValidateFeatureRequest(feature string) error {\n    // TODO 1: Check if feature is in enabled features list\n    // TODO 2: Return clear error message for out-of-scope features\n    // TODO 3: Reference the goals document section explaining exclusion\n    // Hint: This prevents runtime scope creep\n}\n\n// ValidateResourceUsage checks if current usage meets non-functional goals\nfunc (sv *ScopeValidator) ValidateResourceUsage(usage ResourceUsage) error {\n    // TODO 1: Compare current usage against limits\n    // TODO 2: Return specific errors for limit violations  \n    // TODO 3: Include current usage values in error messages\n    // Hint: Use this in testing to validate non-functional goals\n}\n```\n\n#### Goal-Driven Testing Strategy\n\nStructure tests to directly validate goal achievement rather than implementation details:\n\n| Functional Goal | Test Category | Success Criteria |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Binary Framing | Unit tests for each frame type | Parse round-trip produces identical frames |\n| HPACK Compression | Compression ratio tests | Achieve >50% compression on typical headers |\n| Stream Management | Concurrent stream tests | Handle 10+ simultaneous streams correctly |\n| Flow Control | Backpressure tests | Properly queue data when windows exhausted |\n\n#### Common Scope Violations\n\n| Violation Pattern | How It Appears | Corrective Action |\n|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Feature Creep | \"Let's add server push since we're already handling streams\" | Document as future enhancement, don't implement |\n| Performance Obsession | \"We need custom memory allocators for speed\" | Stick to reasonable performance targets |\n| Production Pressure | \"Real clients need this TLS configuration\" | Distinguish learning goals from production requirements |\n| Perfectionism | \"We should handle every possible error condition\" | Focus on specification-required error handling |\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint Validation\n\nAfter each milestone, validate that goals remain on track:\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint**: Binary framing handles all required frame types without advanced features\n- ✅ Can parse and serialize DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, WINDOW_UPDATE frames\n- ✅ Frame validation catches protocol violations\n- ❌ No advanced frame types like PUSH_PROMISE or PRIORITY\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint**: HPACK compression works without advanced optimizations  \n- ✅ Static table lookups work correctly for predefined headers\n- ✅ Dynamic table management handles basic insertion and eviction\n- ❌ No advanced Huffman optimizations or compression tuning\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint**: Stream management supports multiplexing without advanced priority\n- ✅ Multiple concurrent streams work correctly\n- ✅ Stream state machine handles all required transitions\n- ❌ No dependency tree management or complex priority scheduling\n\n**Milestone 4 Checkpoint**: Flow control prevents overwhelming receivers\n- ✅ Connection and stream windows enforce limits correctly\n- ✅ Backpressure handling queues data appropriately\n- ❌ No advanced scheduling or fairness algorithms\n\nThe checkpoint validation ensures implementation stays aligned with learning goals rather than expanding into production features that complicate understanding of core HTTP/2 concepts.\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section establishes the architectural foundation for all milestones (1-4) by defining the core components, their interactions, and the concurrency model that enables binary framing, HPACK compression, stream management, and flow control.\n\nThink of an HTTP/2 server as a sophisticated air traffic control system. Just as air traffic control manages multiple aircraft simultaneously over shared airspace with complex routing, priority scheduling, and safety protocols, our HTTP/2 server manages multiple concurrent streams over a single TCP connection with binary framing, header compression, and flow control. The connection is like the airspace - a shared resource that must be carefully coordinated. Each stream is like an individual aircraft with its own flight plan, priority level, and fuel constraints (flow control windows). The various server components work together like different control tower systems: radar (frame parser) identifies incoming traffic, flight control (stream manager) tracks each aircraft's state and route, communications (HPACK engine) compresses radio chatter to reduce bandwidth, and traffic control (flow controller) prevents congestion by managing spacing between aircraft.\n\nThis mental model helps us understand why HTTP/2's architecture is more complex than HTTP/1.1 - we're not just handling one request at a time sequentially, but orchestrating a complex dance of multiplexed interactions that must be carefully coordinated to prevent conflicts, ensure fairness, and maintain performance.\n\n![HTTP/2 Server Component Architecture](./diagrams/component-architecture.svg)\n\n### Component Overview\n\nThe HTTP/2 server architecture consists of five primary components that work in concert to handle multiplexed binary protocol communication. Each component has distinct responsibilities and interfaces that enable clean separation of concerns while supporting the complex interactions required by the HTTP/2 specification.\n\n**Connection Handler** serves as the entry point and orchestrator for all HTTP/2 communication over a single TCP connection. Think of it as the main switchboard operator who receives all incoming calls and routes them to the appropriate departments. This component owns the TCP socket, manages the connection lifecycle, and coordinates between all other components. It maintains connection-level state including settings negotiated during the connection preface, connection-level flow control windows, and the mapping of active streams to their respective handlers.\n\nThe Connection Handler implements the HTTP/2 connection state machine, handling the initial connection preface where the client sends the magic string \"PRI * HTTP/2.0\\r\\n\\r\\nSM\\r\\n\\r\\n\" followed by a SETTINGS frame. It manages connection-level settings such as maximum frame size, header table size, and maximum concurrent streams. When frames arrive, it performs initial validation and routes them to appropriate components based on frame type and stream ID. For stream-specific frames (DATA, HEADERS), it delegates to the Stream Manager. For connection-level frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY), it handles them directly or coordinates with other components as needed.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Interfaces With |\n|---|---|---|\n| Connection Lifecycle | Manages TCP connection, connection preface, and graceful shutdown | Frame Parser, Stream Manager |\n| Settings Management | Handles SETTINGS frames and maintains connection parameters | All components for configuration |\n| Frame Routing | Routes incoming frames to appropriate handlers based on type and stream ID | Frame Parser, Stream Manager |\n| Connection Flow Control | Manages connection-level flow control window | Flow Controller |\n| Error Recovery | Handles connection-level errors and sends GOAWAY frames | All components for error propagation |\n\n**Frame Parser** acts as the binary protocol interpreter, converting between the HTTP/2 wire format and structured frame objects that other components can work with. Imagine it as a translator who speaks both binary HTTP/2 and the internal language of our server components. This component encapsulates all the complexity of binary protocol parsing, endianness handling, and frame validation.\n\nThe Frame Parser implements the core binary framing logic defined in RFC 7540 Section 4. It reads the 9-byte frame header to extract frame length, type, flags, and stream ID, then reads the appropriate number of payload bytes. It handles frame type-specific parsing for DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, WINDOW_UPDATE, and other frame types. The parser validates frame structure including length limits (frames cannot exceed the negotiated maximum frame size), reserved bit constraints, and frame type-specific validation rules.\n\n| Frame Type | Parse Logic | Validation Rules |\n|---|---|---|\n| DATA | Read payload bytes directly | Must have non-zero stream ID, respect flow control |\n| HEADERS | Extract header block fragment | May have padding, END_HEADERS flag handling |\n| SETTINGS | Parse key-value setting pairs | Must have stream ID zero, ACK flag handling |\n| PING | Read 8-byte opaque data | Must have stream ID zero, exactly 8 bytes |\n| GOAWAY | Extract last stream ID and error code | Must have stream ID zero, includes debug data |\n| WINDOW_UPDATE | Extract window size increment | Must be positive, validate against current window |\n\n**Stream Manager** orchestrates the multiplexed stream lifecycle and implements the complex state machines that govern stream behavior. Think of it as a project manager who tracks multiple concurrent projects (streams), each with their own lifecycle, dependencies, and resource requirements. This component maintains the mapping between stream IDs and stream objects, enforces stream state transitions, and implements priority-based scheduling.\n\nThe Stream Manager implements the stream state machine defined in RFC 7540 Section 5.1, tracking each stream through states: idle, reserved (local/remote), open, half-closed (local/remote), and closed. It enforces state transition rules, such as preventing DATA frames from being sent on streams in half-closed-local state. The component manages stream ID allocation, ensuring clients use odd-numbered IDs and the server uses even-numbered IDs for server-initiated streams like server push.\n\nPriority handling is one of the Stream Manager's most complex responsibilities. It maintains a dependency tree where streams can depend on other streams with associated weights. When multiple streams have data to send, the Stream Manager uses this priority information to determine scheduling order. The default priority scheme gives equal weight to all streams, but clients can send PRIORITY frames to establish dependencies and adjust weights.\n\n| Stream State | Allowed Frame Types | Transition Triggers |\n|---|---|---|\n| Idle | HEADERS, PUSH_PROMISE | Receiving HEADERS → open/half-closed-remote |\n| Open | DATA, HEADERS, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM | END_STREAM flag → half-closed |\n| Half-Closed-Local | WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY, RST_STREAM | Receiving END_STREAM → closed |\n| Half-Closed-Remote | DATA, WINDOW_UPDATE, RST_STREAM | Sending END_STREAM → closed |\n| Closed | WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY, RST_STREAM | Stream cleanup after timeout |\n\n**HPACK Engine** implements the sophisticated header compression algorithm defined in RFC 7541. Think of it as a specialized librarian who maintains both a reference collection (static table) and a personalized collection (dynamic table) of commonly used headers, plus a shorthand notation system (Huffman coding) to compress header values. This component significantly reduces bandwidth usage by eliminating redundant header transmission.\n\nThe HPACK Engine maintains two tables: a static table with 61 predefined entries for common HTTP headers like `:method GET` and `:status 200`, and a dynamic table that grows during the connection as new headers are encountered. When encoding headers, it first checks if the header name-value pair exists in either table and can reference it by index. If only the name exists, it can use literal representation with incremental indexing to add the new name-value pair to the dynamic table for future reference.\n\nThe engine implements Huffman coding for compressing header values using the static Huffman table defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B. This provides additional compression for header values that don't benefit from table-based compression. The combination of table-based indexing and Huffman coding typically achieves 85-95% header compression ratios compared to plain text HTTP/1.1 headers.\n\n| Compression Technique | Use Case | Compression Ratio | Processing Cost |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Indexed Header Field | Exact name-value match in tables | ~95% reduction | Very low |\n| Literal with Incremental Indexing | New header to add to dynamic table | ~60% reduction | Medium |\n| Literal Never Indexed | Sensitive headers (cookies, auth) | ~40% reduction | Low |\n| Huffman Encoding | String compression for header values | ~40% reduction | Medium |\n\n**Flow Controller** manages backpressure and prevents overwhelming receivers with more data than they can process. Think of it as a sophisticated water valve system where each stream has its own valve (stream-level flow control) and there's also a main valve for the entire connection (connection-level flow control). This prevents fast senders from overwhelming slow receivers and ensures fair resource allocation among concurrent streams.\n\nFlow control in HTTP/2 operates on two levels simultaneously. Connection-level flow control limits the total amount of DATA frame payload bytes that can be sent across all streams combined. Stream-level flow control limits DATA frames for individual streams. Both the sender and receiver maintain flow control windows - the sender tracks how much data it's allowed to send, and the receiver tracks how much buffer space it has available.\n\nThe Flow Controller tracks these windows and processes WINDOW_UPDATE frames that increase the available send window. When a stream or connection window reaches zero, the Flow Controller queues additional DATA frames until window space becomes available. This queuing mechanism implements backpressure - if the receiver is slow to process data and send WINDOW_UPDATE frames, the sender naturally slows down its transmission rate.\n\n| Window Type | Scope | Initial Size | Update Mechanism | Backpressure Behavior |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Connection Window | All streams combined | 65535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE with stream ID 0 | Queue data across all streams |\n| Stream Window | Individual stream | 65535 bytes | WINDOW_UPDATE with specific stream ID | Queue data for that stream only |\n\n> **Decision: Component Communication Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Components need to coordinate complex interactions like frame processing, stream state updates, and flow control without creating tight coupling or circular dependencies.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Direct method calls between components\n>   2. Event-driven architecture with message passing\n>   3. Layered architecture with defined interfaces\n> - **Decision**: Layered architecture with defined interfaces and minimal direct coupling\n> - **Rationale**: Layered architecture provides clear separation of concerns, makes testing easier by allowing component isolation, and follows the natural data flow from binary frames to application-level HTTP semantics. Event-driven architecture would add complexity without clear benefits for this use case.\n> - **Consequences**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces, making the system more maintainable and testable, but requiring careful interface design to avoid performance overhead from excessive abstraction.\n\n### Module Structure\n\nThe HTTP/2 server implementation follows a layered module structure that mirrors the protocol's architectural layers and supports both internal organization and external extensibility. Think of this structure like a building where each floor has a specific purpose: the foundation handles raw TCP connections, the mechanical floor handles binary protocol details, the office floors handle business logic (streams and compression), and the penthouse provides the clean HTTP API to applications.\n\nThis organization enables developers to understand and modify individual layers without needing deep knowledge of all layers. A developer working on HPACK compression doesn't need to understand TCP socket management, and someone optimizing stream prioritization doesn't need to know binary frame parsing details.\n\n**Package Organization** follows Go's standard project layout with clear separation between executable code, internal implementation, and public APIs. The structure supports both the current HTTP/2 implementation and future extensions like server push or HTTP/3 compatibility.\n\n```\nhttp2-server/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── server/\n│       └── main.go                    ← Server executable entry point\n├── internal/                          ← Internal implementation packages\n│   ├── connection/\n│   │   ├── handler.go                ← Connection lifecycle management\n│   │   ├── settings.go               ← SETTINGS frame handling\n│   │   └── handler_test.go           ← Connection handler tests\n│   ├── frame/\n│   │   ├── parser.go                 ← Binary frame parsing (Milestone 1)\n│   │   ├── serializer.go             ← Frame serialization\n│   │   ├── types.go                  ← Frame type definitions\n│   │   └── frame_test.go             ← Frame parsing tests\n│   ├── hpack/\n│   │   ├── encoder.go                ← Header compression (Milestone 2)\n│   │   ├── decoder.go                ← Header decompression\n│   │   ├── tables.go                 ← Static and dynamic tables\n│   │   ├── huffman.go                ← Huffman coding implementation\n│   │   └── hpack_test.go             ← HPACK compression tests\n│   ├── stream/\n│   │   ├── manager.go                ← Stream lifecycle (Milestone 3)\n│   │   ├── state.go                  ← Stream state machine\n│   │   ├── priority.go               ← Priority and dependency handling\n│   │   └── stream_test.go            ← Stream management tests\n│   ├── flow/\n│   │   ├── controller.go             ← Flow control (Milestone 4)\n│   │   ├── windows.go                ← Window management\n│   │   └── flow_test.go              ← Flow control tests\n│   └── errors/\n│       ├── protocol.go               ← HTTP/2 protocol errors\n│       └── recovery.go               ← Error recovery strategies\n├── pkg/                              ← Public API packages\n│   └── http2/\n│       ├── server.go                 ← Public HTTP/2 server API\n│       └── client.go                 ← Future HTTP/2 client API\n├── testdata/                         ← Test fixtures and sample data\n│   ├── frames/                       ← Binary frame test cases\n│   └── headers/                      ← HPACK test vectors\n└── tools/                            ← Development and debugging tools\n    ├── frame-inspector/              ← Binary frame analysis tool\n    └── hpack-debugger/              ← HPACK compression debugger\n```\n\n**Layer Dependencies** follow a strict hierarchy where higher layers can depend on lower layers, but lower layers never depend on higher layers. This dependency structure prevents circular imports and makes the codebase easier to understand and test.\n\n| Layer | Package | Depends On | Responsibility |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Application | `pkg/http2` | `internal/connection` | Public HTTP/2 server API |\n| Connection | `internal/connection` | `internal/stream`, `internal/frame` | Connection lifecycle and coordination |\n| Protocol Logic | `internal/stream`, `internal/flow` | `internal/frame`, `internal/hpack` | Stream management and flow control |\n| Protocol Parsing | `internal/frame`, `internal/hpack` | `internal/errors` | Binary protocol and compression |\n| Foundation | `internal/errors` | Standard library only | Error types and utilities |\n\n**Interface Boundaries** define clean contracts between layers, enabling independent development and testing of components. Each interface represents a specific concern and can be mocked or stubbed during testing.\n\nThe `FrameProcessor` interface abstracts binary frame handling from higher-level components. Components that need to parse frames depend on this interface rather than directly importing the frame package. Similarly, the `HeaderCompressor` interface abstracts HPACK compression, allowing the stream manager to compress and decompress headers without understanding HPACK implementation details.\n\n| Interface | Methods | Purpose | Implemented By |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `FrameProcessor` | `ParseFrame(r io.Reader) (*Frame, error)` | Binary frame parsing | `internal/frame` |\n| | `SerializeFrame(w io.Writer, f *Frame) error` | Frame serialization | |\n| `HeaderCompressor` | `EncodeHeaders(headers []Header) ([]byte, error)` | Header compression | `internal/hpack` |\n| | `DecodeHeaders(data []byte) ([]Header, error)` | Header decompression | |\n| `StreamManager` | `CreateStream(id uint32) (*Stream, error)` | Stream lifecycle | `internal/stream` |\n| | `GetStream(id uint32) (*Stream, bool)` | Stream lookup | |\n| `FlowController` | `ConsumeWindow(id uint32, size uint32) error` | Flow control | `internal/flow` |\n| | `UpdateWindow(id uint32, increment uint32) error` | Window updates | |\n\n> **Decision: Internal vs Public Package Structure**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 server implementation needs to balance internal flexibility with API stability for external users\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Everything in public packages for maximum accessibility\n>   2. Most logic in internal packages with minimal public API\n>   3. Hybrid approach with clear public/private boundaries\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with comprehensive internal packages and focused public API\n> - **Rationale**: Internal packages allow implementation flexibility and prevent external dependencies on internal details. Public API provides clean interface for server usage while keeping complex protocol details hidden.\n> - **Consequences**: Easier to maintain backward compatibility and refactor internals, but requires careful public API design to ensure sufficient functionality is exposed.\n\n### Threading Model\n\nThe HTTP/2 server employs a structured concurrency model that balances performance with correctness while managing the complex interactions between multiplexed streams, binary frame processing, and flow control. Think of this threading model like a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush: there's a host (connection acceptor) seating customers, dedicated line cooks (connection handlers) for each table section, prep cooks (frame processors) handling specialized tasks, and an expediter (stream coordinator) ensuring orders are completed in the right priority order and nothing gets backed up.\n\nThis analogy helps explain why we can't simply use one thread per request like HTTP/1.1 - in HTTP/2, multiple requests share a single connection, so we need coordination between requests and careful resource management to prevent one slow request from blocking others.\n\n**Connection-Level Concurrency** forms the foundation of the threading model. Each TCP connection runs in its own goroutine, providing natural isolation between different clients while enabling full multiplexing within each connection. This design choice eliminates most synchronization overhead between connections while focusing thread safety concerns on the more complex intra-connection coordination.\n\nWhen a new TCP connection arrives, the server spawns a dedicated Connection Handler goroutine that owns that connection for its entire lifecycle. This goroutine manages the connection preface, settings negotiation, and coordinates all frame processing for that connection. It maintains a continuous read loop that parses incoming frames and routes them to appropriate handlers based on frame type and stream ID.\n\nThe Connection Handler implements a hybrid push-pull model for frame processing. Control frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY) are processed immediately in the connection goroutine to minimize latency for connection-level coordination. Stream-specific frames (DATA, HEADERS) are dispatched to stream-specific goroutines or queued for batch processing depending on current load and stream state.\n\n| Concurrency Pattern | Use Case | Synchronization | Resource Sharing |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| One goroutine per connection | Connection lifecycle, frame routing | Minimal (connection-scoped) | TCP socket, connection state |\n| Goroutine pool for stream processing | DATA and HEADERS frame handling | Channel-based work queues | Stream state, HPACK tables |\n| Dedicated compression goroutine | HPACK encoding/decoding | Mutex on dynamic table | Dynamic table, Huffman decoder |\n| Background maintenance goroutine | Stream cleanup, window updates | Periodic synchronization | Connection-wide state |\n\n**Stream Processing Architecture** handles the complex challenge of processing multiple concurrent streams over a single connection while maintaining proper ordering guarantees and flow control constraints. Each active stream is associated with a lightweight stream processor that maintains stream state and handles stream-specific frame processing.\n\nStream processors are not full goroutines - creating thousands of goroutines for thousands of potential streams would create excessive overhead. Instead, the system uses a bounded goroutine pool where stream processing work is queued and executed by available worker goroutines. This provides parallelism for independent stream operations while controlling resource usage.\n\nThe critical insight is that while HTTP/2 allows frame interleaving, certain operations must maintain ordering guarantees. HEADERS frames that contain the END_HEADERS flag must be processed in order to maintain proper HPACK dynamic table state. DATA frames can be processed out of order as long as flow control windows are updated atomically.\n\nStream processing implements a two-phase approach: parse phase and execute phase. The parse phase extracts frame data and updates protocol state (stream state machine, flow control windows, HPACK tables). The execute phase performs application-level processing like invoking HTTP handlers. The parse phase requires serialization to maintain protocol correctness, while the execute phase can be fully parallelized across streams.\n\n| Stream Processing Phase | Concurrency Level | Synchronization Requirements | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Frame parsing | Sequential per connection | Connection-level mutex | Low (binary parsing is fast) |\n| HPACK decompression | Sequential per connection | Dynamic table mutex | Medium (Huffman decoding) |\n| Stream state updates | Sequential per stream | Stream-level mutex | Low (state machine updates) |\n| Application processing | Parallel across streams | No synchronization needed | High (HTTP handler execution) |\n\n**Synchronization Strategy** minimizes lock contention while ensuring protocol correctness through a combination of lock ordering, fine-grained locking, and lock-free data structures where appropriate. The primary challenge is coordinating access to shared state like HPACK dynamic tables, connection-level flow control windows, and the stream registry.\n\nHPACK dynamic table access requires the most careful synchronization because header compression and decompression operations modify shared table state. The system uses a single reader-writer mutex for each connection's HPACK context, allowing concurrent read operations (header decompression) while serializing write operations (table updates during header processing).\n\nFlow control synchronization operates at two levels: connection-level windows that affect all streams, and stream-level windows that are independent. Connection-level window updates use atomic operations to avoid lock overhead for the common case of window consumption. Stream-level windows use fine-grained locks per stream to enable parallel processing of different streams.\n\n> **Decision: Goroutine-per-Connection vs Shared Thread Pool**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 server needs to handle many concurrent connections efficiently while managing complex per-connection state\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. One goroutine per connection with internal stream multiplexing\n>   2. Shared thread pool processing frames from all connections\n>   3. Hybrid model with connection goroutines plus worker pools\n> - **Decision**: One goroutine per connection with internal stream multiplexing\n> - **Rationale**: Connection-scoped goroutines provide natural isolation for connection state (HPACK tables, settings, flow control windows) without complex synchronization. Go's efficient goroutine scheduling makes this approach scalable to thousands of connections.\n> - **Consequences**: Simplified synchronization model and easier debugging, but requires careful resource management to prevent goroutine leaks and memory growth with connection count.\n\n**Flow Control Threading** represents one of the most subtle aspects of the concurrency model because flow control windows must be updated atomically while supporting high-throughput data transfer. The system implements a lock-free approach for the common case of window consumption combined with synchronized updates for window increments.\n\nEach stream maintains its flow control state using atomic integers for current window size and pending data queue length. When DATA frames arrive, the system atomically decrements the appropriate windows (both connection-level and stream-level) and queues the data for processing. If either window would go negative, the frame is queued until window space becomes available.\n\nWINDOW_UPDATE frame processing increments windows and triggers queued data processing. This operation requires coordination between the frame processing goroutine and any goroutines with queued data. The system uses a combination of atomic operations for window updates and channel signaling to wake up blocked senders.\n\nThe critical insight is that flow control must never drop or reorder data, even under high concurrency. The system maintains strict ordering guarantees by processing WINDOW_UPDATE frames in the connection goroutine and using atomic operations for all window state changes.\n\n| Flow Control Operation | Threading Model | Synchronization | Performance Characteristics |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Window consumption (sending DATA) | Per-connection goroutine | Atomic decrement | High throughput, lock-free |\n| Window updates (WINDOW_UPDATE) | Per-connection goroutine | Atomic increment + signaling | Medium latency for blocked senders |\n| Backpressure queue management | Dedicated flow control goroutine | Channel-based coordination | Bounded memory usage |\n| Cross-stream window coordination | Connection goroutine coordination | Connection-level atomic state | Prevents connection-level deadlock |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: HPACK Dynamic Table Race Conditions**\nA common mistake is allowing concurrent access to HPACK dynamic tables during header compression and decompression. Since the dynamic table is modified during header processing (entries are added with incremental indexing), concurrent header operations on the same connection can corrupt table state or produce incorrect compression results. Always serialize HPACK operations per connection using a mutex or by processing all headers in the connection goroutine.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Flow Control Window Underflow**\nAnother frequent error is failing to check flow control windows atomically before sending DATA frames. If one goroutine checks that window space is available, but another goroutine consumes that space before the first goroutine sends its data, the window can go negative, violating the HTTP/2 specification. Use atomic compare-and-swap operations or process all DATA frame sending in a single goroutine per connection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream State Machine Race Conditions**\nStream state transitions must be atomic with respect to frame processing. If one goroutine is processing a DATA frame while another processes a RST_STREAM frame for the same stream, the stream can end up in an inconsistent state. Either serialize all frame processing for each stream or use fine-grained locking with careful attention to lock ordering to prevent deadlocks.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis subsection provides concrete implementation direction for building the HTTP/2 server architecture described above.

Language-Specific Hints**\n\n- **Binary Parsing**: Use `encoding/binary.BigEndian` for network byte order operations. HTTP/2 uses big-endian (network) byte order for all multi-byte fields.\n- **Buffered I/O**: Use `bufio.Reader` and `bufio.Writer` for efficient frame reading/writing. TCP socket I/O benefits significantly from buffering.\n- **Goroutine Management**: Use `defer conn.Close()` and proper error handling to prevent connection leaks. Each goroutine should clean up its resources.\n- **Atomic Operations**: Use `sync/atomic` package for flow control window operations to avoid lock overhead in the data path.\n- **Memory Management**: Reuse byte slices for frame payloads where possible. Consider using `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated frame objects.\n- **Error Handling**: Convert protocol violations to `ProtocolError` types with appropriate error codes for proper HTTP/2 error signaling.\n\n**F.

Where HTTP/1.1 was like a simple post office with one counter processing letters sequentially, HTTP/2 is like a modern logistics hub with binary-encoded packages, compressed addressing labels, multiple conveyor belts (streams) running simultaneously, and smart routing systems. Each component—frames, streams, connections, and compression tables—serves a specific role in this complex but efficient system.\n\nThe data model forms the foundation upon which all HTTP/2 operations are built. Unlike HTTP/1.1's text-based approach where messages are parsed character by character, HTTP/2 operates on structured **binary framing** where every piece of information has a precisely defined format. This binary approach enables features like **multiplexing** (multiple concurrent streams), **HPACK** header compression, and sophisticated **flow control** that would be impossible or inefficient with text-based protocols.\n\nUnderstanding these data structures is crucial because HTTP/2's complexity emerges from their interactions. Frames carry data between endpoints, streams provide the abstraction for individual request-response pairs, connections manage the overall communication channel, and HPACK tables enable efficient header compression. Each structure contains not just data but also metadata that drives the protocol's advanced features.\n\n> The critical insight is that HTTP/2 inverts the traditional model: instead of thinking about HTTP requests and responses, we think about frames flowing through streams over a connection. The HTTP semantics are reconstructed from these lower-level primitives.\n\n### Frame Types\n\nHTTP/2 frames are the atomic units of communication, analogous to packets in a network protocol. Think of frames as standardized shipping containers—each has the same 9-byte header format regardless of contents, making them easy to route and process, while the payload varies based on the frame type and purpose.\n\nEvery frame begins with a common header structure that provides essential routing and processing information. This header acts like a shipping label, telling the receiver how much data to expect, what type of processing to perform, any special handling instructions (flags), and which stream the frame belongs to.\n\n**Frame Structure Overview**\n\n| Field | Type | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|------|-------------|\n| Length | uint32 | 3 bytes | Payload length (0-16,777,215 bytes), stored as 24-bit big-endian |\n| Type | uint8 | 1 byte | Frame type identifier (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.) |\n| Flags | uint8 | 1 byte | Type-specific boolean flags for frame processing |\n| Reserved | bit | 1 bit | Reserved bit, must be unset (0) |\n| Stream ID | uint32 | 31 bits | Stream identifier (0 for connection-level frames) |\n| Payload | []byte | 0-16MB | Frame-specific data based on type |\n\nThe length field uses a 24-bit representation, allowing payloads up to 16,777,215 bytes (approximately 16MB). However, the default maximum frame size is much smaller (16,384 bytes) for practical reasons—smaller frames enable better multiplexing fairness and reduce memory usage. The reserved bit in the stream ID field must always be zero; recipients should treat frames with this bit set as a connection error.\n\n> **Decision: Fixed 9-Byte Header Format**\n> - **Context**: Need consistent frame parsing regardless of frame type and content\n> - **Options Considered**: Variable-length headers, type-specific headers, fixed-length headers\n> - **Decision**: Fixed 9-byte header for all frame types\n> - **Rationale**: Enables efficient parsing with known header size, simplifies frame routing logic, and provides sufficient space for essential metadata\n> - **Consequences**: Some frame types may have unused header space, but parsing efficiency and implementation simplicity outweigh this minor overhead\n\n**DATA Frame Structure**\n\nDATA frames carry the actual HTTP request and response payloads—the body content that applications care about. Think of DATA frames as the cargo containers in our shipping analogy, carrying the actual goods while the frame header provides the shipping information.\n\n| Component | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Padding Length | uint8 | Optional field present only if PADDED flag is set |\n| Data | []byte | Actual HTTP payload data for the stream |\n| Padding | []byte | Optional random bytes for traffic analysis protection |\n\nDATA frames support optional padding for security purposes. When the `PADDED` flag is set, the first byte of the payload indicates how many padding bytes follow the actual data. This padding helps prevent traffic analysis attacks by obscuring the actual payload size, though it comes at the cost of bandwidth overhead.\n\nThe `END_STREAM` flag on DATA frames indicates that this is the final frame for the stream in this direction. This flag is crucial for stream lifecycle management—when a server sends a DATA frame with `END_STREAM` set, it signals that the response is complete and the stream transitions to a half-closed state.\n\n**HEADERS Frame Structure**\n\nHEADERS frames contain HTTP header fields compressed using HPACK encoding. These frames are analogous to address labels on our shipping containers, but using a sophisticated compression scheme that references previously seen addresses to save space.\n\n| Component | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Padding Length | uint8 | Optional field present only if PADDED flag is set |\n| Exclusive | bit | Stream dependency exclusivity flag (if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Stream Dependency | uint31 | Dependent stream ID (if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Weight | uint8 | Stream priority weight 1-256 (if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Header Block Fragment | []byte | HPACK-compressed header fields |\n| Padding | []byte | Optional random padding bytes |\n\nHEADERS frames can include priority information when the `PRIORITY` flag is set. The priority fields establish a dependency tree that helps servers decide how to allocate resources among concurrent streams. A stream can depend on another stream (creating a parent-child relationship) and have a weight indicating its relative priority among siblings.\n\nThe `END_HEADERS` flag indicates whether this frame contains the complete header block or if additional CONTINUATION frames will follow. The `END_STREAM` flag serves the same purpose as in DATA frames—marking the final frame in one direction of the stream.\n\n> The header block fragment contains HPACK-compressed data that must be processed sequentially to maintain the compression context. Frames cannot be reordered or processed independently when they contain header data.\n\n**SETTINGS Frame Structure**\n\nSETTINGS frames configure connection-level parameters and capabilities between endpoints. Think of these as the initial handshake in our postal facility where both sides agree on operating procedures, maximum package sizes, and processing capabilities.\n\n| Component | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Identifier | uint16 | Setting identifier (predefined constants) |\n| Value | uint32 | 32-bit setting value |\n\nSETTINGS frames contain zero or more setting parameter pairs, each consisting of a 16-bit identifier and 32-bit value. These frames always have stream ID 0, indicating they apply to the entire connection rather than individual streams.\n\n**Common Settings Parameters**\n\n| Setting | Identifier | Default Value | Description |\n|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| HEADER_TABLE_SIZE | 0x1 | 4096 | Maximum HPACK dynamic table size |\n| ENABLE_PUSH | 0x2 | 1 | Server push capability (1=enabled, 0=disabled) |\n| MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS | 0x3 | unlimited | Maximum concurrent streams allowed |\n| INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE | 0x4 | 65535 | Initial flow control window size |\n| MAX_FRAME_SIZE | 0x5 | 16384 | Maximum frame payload size |\n| MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE | 0x6 | unlimited | Maximum header list size in bytes |\n\nThe `ACK` flag in SETTINGS frames creates a request-response pattern. When an endpoint receives a SETTINGS frame without the `ACK` flag, it must apply the settings and send a SETTINGS frame with the `ACK` flag set to confirm receipt. This ensures both sides agree on the connection parameters before proceeding.\n\n**Control Frame Types**\n\nSeveral frame types handle connection and stream management rather than carrying application data. These frames are like the control signals in our postal facility that coordinate operations, report problems, and manage traffic flow.\n\n| Frame Type | Purpose | Stream ID | Key Fields |\n|------------|---------|-----------|------------|\n| PING | Connection liveness testing | 0 | 8-byte opaque data |\n| GOAWAY | Graceful connection termination | 0 | Last stream ID, error code, debug data |\n| WINDOW_UPDATE | Flow control window adjustment | 0 or stream | 31-bit window size increment |\n| RST_STREAM | Immediate stream termination | stream | 32-bit error code |\n| CONTINUATION | Header block continuation | stream | Header block fragment |\n\nPING frames enable connection liveness testing and round-trip time measurement. They contain 8 bytes of opaque data that the recipient must echo back in a PING frame with the `ACK` flag set. This mechanism helps detect network partitions and measure connection latency.\n\nGOAWAY frames initiate graceful connection shutdown by indicating the highest stream ID that will be processed. Streams with IDs higher than this value should be retried on a new connection. The frame includes an error code explaining the shutdown reason and optional debug data for troubleshooting.\n\n### Stream State\n\nHTTP/2 streams represent individual request-response exchanges within the multiplexed connection. Think of streams as independent conveyor belts in our postal facility—each carries one conversation between client and server, but many can operate simultaneously over the same physical infrastructure.\n\nStream state management is one of HTTP/2's most complex aspects because streams have their own lifecycle independent of the underlying connection. Understanding stream states is crucial for implementing correct multiplexing behavior, resource management, and error handling.\n\n**Stream State Machine**\n\nThe stream state machine governs how streams transition through their lifecycle based on frame types and directions. Each state represents a different phase of the request-response exchange and determines what operations are valid.\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------------|\n| idle | Send/receive HEADERS | open | Create stream context, allocate resources |\n| idle | Receive PUSH_PROMISE | reserved (remote) | Reserve stream for server push |\n| idle | Send PUSH_PROMISE | reserved (local) | Reserve stream for outgoing push |\n| open | Send END_STREAM | half-closed (local) | No more outbound frames allowed |\n| open | Receive END_STREAM | half-closed (remote) | No more inbound frames expected |\n| half-closed (local) | Receive END_STREAM | closed | Stream complete, cleanup resources |\n| half-closed (remote) | Send END_STREAM | closed | Stream complete, cleanup resources |\n| any | Send/receive RST_STREAM | closed | Immediate termination, cleanup |\n| reserved (local) | Send HEADERS | half-closed (remote) | Begin push promise fulfillment |\n| reserved (remote) | Receive HEADERS | half-closed (local) | Server beginning push delivery |\n\nThe state machine prevents protocol violations and resource leaks. For example, attempting to send DATA frames on a stream in the `half-closed (local)` state is a protocol error because the local endpoint has already signaled completion with `END_STREAM`.\n\n> **Decision: Explicit State Machine Implementation**\n> - **Context**: Need to track stream lifecycle and prevent invalid frame sequences\n> - **Options Considered**: Implicit state tracking, explicit state machine, stateless frame processing\n> - **Decision**: Explicit state machine with transition validation\n> - **Rationale**: Provides clear error detection, prevents protocol violations, and simplifies debugging by making state transitions visible\n> - **Consequences**: Additional complexity in implementation but much better error handling and protocol compliance\n\n**Stream Metadata Structure**\n\nEach stream maintains metadata beyond just its state to support features like priority scheduling, flow control, and error handling.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| ID | uint32 | Unique stream identifier within connection |\n| State | StreamState | Current lifecycle state (idle, open, closed, etc.) |\n| LocalEndStream | bool | Whether local endpoint sent END_STREAM |\n| RemoteEndStream | bool | Whether remote endpoint sent END_STREAM |\n| Priority | StreamPriority | Priority weight and dependency information |\n| SendWindow | int32 | Available bytes for outbound DATA frames |\n| RecvWindow | int32 | Available bytes for inbound DATA frames |\n| Headers | HeaderFields | Accumulated header fields from HEADERS/CONTINUATION |\n| TrailerFields | HeaderFields | Trailing headers received after body |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Stream creation timestamp for diagnostics |\n| LastActivity | time.Time | Last frame received/sent timestamp |\n| ErrorCode | uint32 | Error code if stream terminated abnormally |\n\nThe `LocalEndStream` and `RemoteEndStream` flags track completion status in each direction independently. This supports HTTP/2's bidirectional nature where request and response completion can happen at different times. For example, a client might send a complete POST request (setting `LocalEndStream`) while the server is still sending a large response.\n\nPriority information includes both dependency relationships and weight values that influence resource allocation. The dependency field can reference another stream, creating a tree structure that guides scheduling decisions. Weight values range from 1-256 and determine relative priority among sibling streams.\n\nFlow control windows track how many bytes each endpoint can send without overwhelming the receiver. These windows operate independently in each direction and are updated through WINDOW_UPDATE frames. The initial window size comes from the connection SETTINGS, but each stream can adjust its windows independently.\n\n**Stream Identifier Allocation**\n\nStream IDs follow specific allocation rules that prevent collisions and enable efficient lookup. Think of stream IDs as tracking numbers in our postal facility—they must be unique, predictable, and meaningful to both sender and receiver.\n\n| Initiator | ID Range | Usage Pattern |\n|-----------|----------|---------------|\n| Client | 1, 3, 5, ... (odd) | Client-initiated requests |\n| Server | 2, 4, 6, ... (even) | Server push streams |\n| Connection | 0 | Connection-level frames only |\n\nClient-initiated streams use odd-numbered IDs starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 for each new stream. Server push streams use even-numbered IDs following the same incrementing pattern. Stream ID 0 is reserved for connection-level frames that don't belong to any specific stream.\n\nThe incrementing requirement means stream IDs must be allocated in order—a client cannot create stream 5 before stream 3. This ordering simplifies connection state management and helps detect protocol violations. However, streams can complete out of order; stream 5 might finish before stream 3.\n\nStream ID exhaustion (reaching the maximum 31-bit value) requires opening a new connection. In practice, this limit (over 2 billion streams) is rarely reached, but implementations should handle this gracefully by refusing new stream creation and potentially initiating connection migration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream ID Reuse**\nA common implementation mistake is attempting to reuse stream IDs after streams close. HTTP/2 explicitly forbids this—once a stream ID is used, it cannot be reused on the same connection. Attempting to create a stream with a previously used ID must trigger a connection error. This restriction prevents confusion and simplifies state management.\n\n**Stream Priority and Dependencies**\n\nHTTP/2 supports prioritization through a dependency tree system where streams can depend on other streams and specify relative weights. This system helps servers decide resource allocation when handling multiple concurrent requests.\n\n| Field | Type | Range | Description |\n|-------|------|-------|-------------|\n| StreamDependency | uint31 | 0-2^31-1 | ID of stream this stream depends on |\n| Exclusive | bool | true/false | Whether dependency is exclusive |\n| Weight | uint8 | 1-256 | Relative priority weight |\n\nStream dependencies create parent-child relationships where child streams should be prioritized only after their parent completes. The exclusive flag determines whether a new dependency replaces existing children (exclusive=true) or joins them as siblings (exclusive=false).\n\nWeight values provide relative prioritization among sibling streams. A stream with weight 200 should receive roughly twice the resources of a stream with weight 100, assuming all other factors are equal. However, priority is advisory—servers can use this information to guide scheduling but are not required to implement any specific algorithm.\n\nThe dependency tree can change dynamically as streams open and close. When a parent stream closes, its children typically become children of the parent's parent, maintaining the relative priority relationships. Implementations must handle circular dependencies by breaking cycles, usually by making the dependent stream a child of the dependency target's parent.\n\n### Connection State\n\nThe HTTP/2 connection represents the overall communication channel between client and server, managing multiple concurrent streams and connection-level settings. Think of the connection as the central control system for our postal facility—it coordinates all the conveyor belts (streams), manages facility-wide policies, and handles communication with the other facility.\n\nConnection state is more complex than individual stream state because it must coordinate multiple streams while maintaining its own configuration, flow control windows, and error handling. The connection acts as both a container for streams and an active participant in the protocol with its own frame types and state transitions.\n\n**Connection Configuration**\n\nConnection-level settings affect all streams and overall behavior. These settings are negotiated through SETTINGS frames and can be updated during the connection lifetime.\n\n| Setting | Local Value | Remote Value | Description |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| HeaderTableSize | uint32 | uint32 | Maximum HPACK dynamic table size for each direction |\n| EnablePush | bool | bool | Whether server push is allowed |\n| MaxConcurrentStreams | uint32 | uint32 | Maximum concurrent open streams |\n| InitialWindowSize | uint32 | uint32 | Default flow control window for new streams |\n| MaxFrameSize | uint32 | uint32 | Maximum frame payload size |\n| MaxHeaderListSize | uint32 | uint32 | Maximum total header list size |\n\nEach setting has both local and remote values because settings are directional. When the local endpoint sends a SETTINGS frame, it's declaring the values the remote endpoint should use when sending to the local endpoint. This asymmetry allows each side to declare its own capabilities and constraints.\n\nSettings changes take effect immediately upon acknowledgment (SETTINGS frame with ACK flag). However, some settings like `InitialWindowSize` only affect new streams, while others like `MaxFrameSize` affect all subsequent frames. Implementation must carefully handle the timing of settings application to avoid protocol violations.\n\n> **Decision: Separate Local and Remote Settings**\n> - **Context**: Settings are directional—each endpoint declares constraints for the other\n> - **Options Considered**: Single settings object, bidirectional settings, separate local/remote tracking\n> - **Decision**: Track local and remote settings separately\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents confusion about which constraints apply in which direction, enables asymmetric configurations, and simplifies validation logic\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex state management but much clearer semantics and fewer bugs\n\n**Connection Flow Control**\n\nConnection-level flow control operates independently of stream-level flow control, providing an additional layer of backpressure management. This dual-level system ensures that individual streams cannot monopolize connection resources while still allowing fine-grained per-stream control.\n\n| Window Type | Purpose | Initial Size | Update Mechanism |\n|-------------|---------|--------------|------------------|\n| Connection Send | Bytes we can send to remote | InitialWindowSize × 1 | Remote WINDOW_UPDATE frames |\n| Connection Recv | Bytes remote can send to us | InitialWindowSize × 1 | Our WINDOW_UPDATE frames |\n| Stream Send | Per-stream send allowance | InitialWindowSize | Remote WINDOW_UPDATE frames |\n| Stream Recv | Per-stream recv allowance | InitialWindowSize | Our WINDOW_UPDATE frames |\n\nEvery DATA frame payload consumes both connection-level and stream-level send window. Before sending a DATA frame, the implementation must verify that both windows have sufficient space. If either window is exhausted, the frame cannot be sent until the appropriate WINDOW_UPDATE frame arrives.\n\nWindow updates can target either the connection (stream ID 0) or specific streams (stream ID > 0). Connection window updates affect the overall connection allowance, while stream window updates affect only that stream. Both types of updates are cumulative—receiving multiple WINDOW_UPDATE frames adds their values to the current window size.\n\nWindow size management requires careful accounting to prevent underflow (sending more than allowed) and overflow (accumulating windows larger than 2^31-1). Underflow is a protocol error requiring connection termination, while overflow should be treated as the maximum window size.\n\n**Active Streams Management**\n\nThe connection maintains a registry of all active streams along with their states and metadata. This registry enables frame routing, resource management, and cleanup operations.\n\n| Registry Component | Type | Purpose |\n|-------------------|------|---------|\n| StreamMap | map[uint32]*Stream | Active stream lookup by ID |\n| LastStreamID | uint32 | Highest stream ID seen from remote |\n| NextStreamID | uint32 | Next stream ID to allocate locally |\n| StreamCount | uint32 | Current number of open streams |\n| MaxStreams | uint32 | Maximum concurrent streams allowed |\n| ClosedStreams | LRU cache | Recently closed streams for late frame detection |\n\nThe stream map provides O(1) lookup for routing incoming frames to their destination streams. Frame processing involves extracting the stream ID from the frame header and looking up the corresponding stream object. Frames for unknown streams may indicate protocol errors or late arrivals after stream cleanup.\n\nStream counting enforces the `MaxConcurrentStreams` setting by rejecting new stream creation when the limit is reached. The count includes all streams in active states (open, half-closed) but excludes idle and closed streams. This enforcement prevents resource exhaustion attacks where one endpoint creates excessive streams.\n\nThe closed streams cache handles the common case of frames arriving after stream cleanup. When a stream closes, its full state is discarded to save memory, but a lightweight entry remains in the cache to detect and properly handle late-arriving frames. This cache typically uses LRU eviction with a modest size limit.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream Cleanup Timing**\nA subtle but critical issue is determining when to clean up closed streams. Cleaning up too aggressively can cause protocol errors if late frames arrive, but keeping streams too long wastes memory. The recommended approach is immediate lightweight cleanup (remove from active map but keep in closed cache) followed by eventual full cleanup after a timeout period or cache pressure.\n\n**Connection Error Handling**\n\nConnection errors affect the entire connection and typically result in connection termination through GOAWAY frames. These errors indicate protocol violations, resource exhaustion, or other conditions that make continued operation impossible or unsafe.\n\n| Error Type | Error Code | Typical Causes | Recovery Action |\n|------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Protocol Error | 0x1 | Malformed frames, invalid state transitions | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Internal Error | 0x2 | Implementation bugs, resource allocation failures | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Flow Control Error | 0x3 | Window violations, invalid WINDOW_UPDATE | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Settings Timeout | 0x4 | No SETTINGS ACK received | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Stream Closed | 0x5 | Frames on closed streams | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Frame Size Error | 0x6 | Frames exceeding size limits | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Refused Stream | 0x7 | Cannot create requested stream | Send RST_STREAM, continue connection |\n| Cancel | 0x8 | Processing cancelled | Context-dependent |\n| Compression Error | 0x9 | HPACK decompression failure | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Connect Error | 0xa | TCP connection problems | Close connection |\n| Enhance Calm | 0xb | Excessive resource usage | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| Inadequate Security | 0xc | TLS configuration insufficient | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n| HTTP/1.1 Required | 0xd | Must downgrade to HTTP/1.1 | Send GOAWAY, close connection |\n\nMost connection errors require immediate termination because they indicate fundamental protocol violations that cannot be recovered. The GOAWAY frame provides graceful termination by indicating which streams completed successfully and can be safely retried on a new connection.\n\nSome errors like `Refused Stream` are stream-specific and can be handled with RST_STREAM frames without affecting the connection. However, repeated stream errors might indicate systematic problems that warrant connection termination.\n\nThe error handling implementation should distinguish between recoverable and fatal conditions, provide clear error messages for debugging, and ensure proper resource cleanup during connection termination. Logging error details helps diagnose implementation bugs and protocol violations.\n\n### HPACK Tables\n\nHPACK (HTTP/2 Header Compression) uses a sophisticated table-based compression scheme that maintains both static and dynamic tables to achieve significant header size reduction. Think of HPACK tables as a sophisticated address book system in our postal facility—frequently used addresses are stored in numbered slots so future packages can reference them by number instead of writing the full address.\n\nThe compression effectiveness comes from HTTP's repetitive nature: most requests contain many identical or similar headers (User-Agent, Accept, Authorization, etc.). Instead of transmitting these headers repeatedly, HPACK assigns them indices and transmits only the index references along with any new or changed headers.\n\nHPACK operates at the connection level with separate compression contexts for each direction. This means client-to-server headers and server-to-client headers have independent compression state, allowing each endpoint to optimize for its typical header patterns.\n\n> The critical insight is that HPACK provides stateful compression—the compression context evolves as headers are processed, creating better compression ratios but requiring careful synchronization between endpoints.\n\n**Static Table Structure**\n\nThe static table contains 61 predefined entries covering the most common HTTP headers. This table is defined by RFC 7541 and is identical for all HTTP/2 connections, providing immediate compression benefits without any setup overhead.\n\n| Index | Name | Value |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| 1 | :authority | |\n| 2 | :method | GET |\n| 3 | :method | POST |\n| 4 | :path | / |\n| 5 | :path | /index.html |\n| 6 | :scheme | http |\n| 7 | :scheme | https |\n| 8 | :status | 200 |\n| 9 | :status | 204 |\n| 10 | :status | 206 |\n| 11 | :status | 304 |\n| 12 | :status | 400 |\n| 13 | :status | 404 |\n| 14 | :status | 500 |\n| 15 | accept-charset | |\n| 16 | accept-encoding | gzip, deflate |\n| 17 | accept-language | |\n| 18 | accept-ranges | |\n| 19 | accept | |\n| 20 | access-control-allow-origin | |\n| 21 | age | |\n| 22 | allow | |\n| 23 | authorization | |\n| 24 | cache-control | |\n| 25 | content-disposition | |\n| 26 | content-encoding | |\n| 27 | content-language | |\n| 28 | content-length | |\n| 29 | content-location | |\n| 30 | content-range | |\n| 31 | content-type | |\n| 32 | cookie | |\n| 33 | date | |\n| 34 | etag | |\n| 35 | expect | |\n| 36 | expires | |\n| 37 | from | |\n| 38 | host | |\n| 39 | if-match | |\n| 40 | if-modified-since | |\n| 41 | if-none-match | |\n| 42 | if-range | |\n| 43 | if-unmodified-since | |\n| 44 | last-modified | |\n| 45 | link | |\n| 46 | location | |\n| 47 | max-forwards | |\n| 48 | proxy-authenticate | |\n| 49 | proxy-authorization | |\n| 50 | range | |\n| 51 | referer | |\n| 52 | refresh | |\n| 53 | retry-after | |\n| 54 | server | |\n| 55 | set-cookie | |\n| 56 | strict-transport-security | |\n| 57 | transfer-encoding | |\n| 58 | user-agent | |\n| 59 | vary | |\n| 60 | via | |\n| 61 | www-authenticate | |\n\nThe static table includes HTTP/2 pseudo-headers (prefixed with `:`) that replace the HTTP/1.1 request line and status line. These pseudo-headers must appear before regular headers and have specific ordering requirements.\n\nEntries with empty values represent name-only matches. For example, index 1 (`:authority`) matches any header with that name regardless of value. This allows partial compression where the name is indexed but the value is transmitted literally.\n\nThe static table provides immediate benefits: a simple `GET /` request can reference indices 2 and 4 instead of transmitting the full `:method: GET` and `:path: /` headers. More complex requests benefit even more as they reference additional static entries.\n\n**Dynamic Table Structure**\n\nThe dynamic table maintains connection-specific header entries that accumulate during the connection lifetime. This table starts empty and grows as headers are processed, creating increasingly effective compression for connection-specific patterns.\n\n| Component | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| Entries | []HeaderEntry | Ordered list of header name-value pairs |\n| Size | uint32 | Current table size in bytes |\n| MaxSize | uint32 | Maximum table size from SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE |\n| InsertionPoint | uint32 | Index where next entry will be inserted |\n| EvictionCount | uint32 | Number of entries evicted due to size constraints |\n\nDynamic table entries are indexed starting from 62 (after the static table) and use a FIFO eviction strategy. When adding a new entry would exceed the maximum table size, the oldest entries are evicted until sufficient space is available.\n\nThe table size calculation includes both the header name and value lengths plus 32 bytes of overhead per entry to account for implementation storage costs. This overhead prevents table thrashing with very small headers and provides a realistic estimate of memory usage.\n\n**Dynamic Table Entry Management**\n\n| Operation | Trigger | Action Taken |\n|-----------|---------|--------------|\n| Addition | Literal header with indexing | Insert at head, evict from tail if needed |\n| Lookup | Indexed header reference | Return name-value pair for index |\n| Eviction | Table size exceeds maximum | Remove oldest entries until under limit |\n| Resize | SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE change | Adjust maximum, evict if necessary |\n| Clear | Table size set to 0 | Remove all entries immediately |\n\nEntry addition happens when the encoder chooses to make a header indexable (literal header with incremental indexing). This decision balances compression benefits against table memory usage. Headers likely to repeat (like Authorization tokens) benefit from indexing, while unique headers (like timestamps) do not.\n\nIndex lookup involves checking both static and dynamic tables. Indices 1-61 reference the static table directly, while indices 62 and above reference dynamic table entries. The implementation must handle the index offset correctly to avoid off-by-one errors.\n\nEviction maintains the FIFO property—oldest entries are removed first regardless of their usage frequency. This simplicity prevents complex cache management but may evict useful entries. Some implementations use smarter eviction policies as optimizations, but basic FIFO is required for interoperability.\n\n> **Decision: FIFO Eviction Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Need deterministic eviction behavior for interoperability between implementations\n> - **Options Considered**: LRU eviction, frequency-based eviction, FIFO eviction\n> - **Decision**: FIFO eviction as specified in RFC 7541\n> - **Rationale**: Ensures identical table state between encoder and decoder, simplifies implementation, and avoids complex cache management algorithms\n> - **Consequences**: May evict useful entries that could provide better compression, but guarantees correctness and interoperability\n\n**Header Encoding Representations**\n\nHPACK supports multiple encoding representations for headers based on caching strategy and compression requirements. These representations provide flexibility in balancing compression ratio, table management, and processing overhead.\n\n| Representation | Pattern | Indexing | Use Case |\n|----------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Indexed Header | 1xxxxxxx | Reference only | Exact name-value match in table |\n| Literal with Incremental Indexing | 01xxxxxx | Add to dynamic table | Likely to repeat in future |\n| Literal without Indexing | 0000xxxx | No table modification | Unique or security-sensitive |\n| Literal Never Indexed | 0001xxxx | No indexing, no proxy caching | Security-sensitive values |\n| Dynamic Table Size Update | 001xxxxx | Table management | Change table size limit |\n\nIndexed headers provide maximum compression by referencing table entries with a single byte (for indices 1-127). This representation handles the common case where headers exactly match previous values.\n\nLiteral representations handle new or modified headers by transmitting the name (indexed or literal) and value (literal or Huffman-encoded). The indexing behavior determines whether the header is added to the dynamic table for future reference.\n\nThe \"never indexed\" representation provides security for sensitive headers like Authorization or Set-Cookie values. These headers are transmitted literally but marked to prevent caching by intermediaries that might expose the values.\n\n**Huffman Encoding Integration**\n\nHPACK optionally applies Huffman encoding to literal string values (header names and values) to achieve additional compression. The Huffman codes are optimized for typical HTTP header content and can provide 20-30% additional compression.\n\n| String Type | Huffman Flag | Encoding Options |\n|-------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Header Name | Optional | Literal or Huffman-encoded |\n| Header Value | Optional | Literal or Huffman-encoded |\n| Indexed Reference | N/A | Index number only |\n\nThe Huffman table is defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B and includes optimized codes for all 256 possible byte values. Common characters in HTTP headers (letters, digits, common punctuation) receive shorter codes, while rare characters receive longer codes.\n\nHuffman encoding operates at the byte level and requires careful handling of padding bits in the final symbol. The decoder must validate that padding bits are all 1's as specified, preventing certain types of compression attacks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Huffman Decoding Boundary Errors**\nA common implementation error occurs when handling Huffman-encoded strings that don't align on byte boundaries. The final byte may contain padding bits that must be validated. Incorrect padding validation can lead to security vulnerabilities or interoperability problems. Always verify that padding bits are set to 1 and that the padding doesn't form a valid symbol prefix.\n\n**Table Synchronization and Error Handling**\n\nHPACK requires perfect synchronization between encoder and decoder tables. Any mismatch in table state causes subsequent compression/decompression failures, requiring connection termination.\n\n| Error Condition | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Invalid Index | Index exceeds table size | Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR |\n| Table Size Violation | Entry addition exceeds limit | Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR |\n| Invalid Huffman Sequence | Decoding failure | Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR |\n| String Length Mismatch | Decoded length doesn't match declared | Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR |\n| Reserved Bits Set | Non-zero reserved bits in patterns | Connection error COMPRESSION_ERROR |\n\nTable synchronization failures are connection-fatal because the compression context cannot be recovered. Unlike stream errors that affect only one stream, HPACK errors affect all subsequent header processing and require starting a new connection.\n\nThe implementation must validate all HPACK input carefully to detect corruption or malicious input early. This includes bounds checking on indices, validating string lengths, and verifying Huffman decoding results.\n\nProper error handling includes detailed logging for debugging while avoiding information leakage that might help attackers. HPACK errors often indicate implementation bugs rather than network issues, making good diagnostics essential for development.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis subsection provides practical

to prevent over-reading payload\n- Use `sync.RWMutex` for connection-level state that has frequent readers\n- Implement HPACK with careful bounds checking to prevent index errors\n- Use `context.Context` for request cancellation and timeout handling\n- Consider using `sync.Pool` for frame and buffer allocation in high-performance scenarios\n\n**Milestone Checkpoints**\n\nAfter implementing the basic data structures, verify functionality with these checkpoints:\n\n1. **Frame Parsing Test**: Create a DATA frame with known payload, serialize it, then parse it back. Verify all fields match exactly.\n\n2. **HPACK Static Table Test**: Look up index 2 (`:method: GET`) and index 8 (`:status: 200`) from static table. Verify correct name-value pairs returned.\n\n3. **Dynamic Table Test**: Add several header entries to dynamic table, then look them up by index. Verify FIFO eviction when table size limit exceeded.\n\n4. **Stream State Test**: Create stream in idle state, transition through open to half-closed-local, verify state transitions follow protocol rules.\n\nExpected output for frame parsing test:\n```\nOriginal: Length=12, Type=0, Flags=1, StreamID=5, Payload=\"Hello World!\"\nParsed:   Length=12, Type=0, Flags=1, StreamID=5, Payload=\"Hello World!\"\n✓ Frame serialization/parsing works correctly\n```\n\n**Common Debugging Issues**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------|-----|\n| Frame length mismatch | Endianness error in parsing | Check byte order in length field | Use binary.BigEndian consistently |\n| Stream ID has high bit set | Reserved bit not cleared | Inspect stream ID parsing | Mask with 0x7FFFFFFF |\n| HPACK index out of bounds | Off-by-one in table lookup | Verify index calculation | Static table is 1-61, dynamic starts at 62 |\n| Dynamic table size grows unbounded | Eviction not implemented | Check Add() method | Implement proper FIFO eviction |\n| Connection hangs on frame read | Incorrect payload length | Verify length field parsing | Validate length before reading payload |\n\n\n## Binary Framing Engine\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section primarily addresses Milestone 1 (Binary Framing) by implementing HTTP/2's binary frame format with parsing, validation, and serialization capabilities.\n\nThink of HTTP/2's binary framing as the difference between sending handwritten letters and using a structured telegram system. In HTTP/1.1, we send human-readable text messages that require careful parsing to understand where headers end and bodies begin. HTTP/2's binary framing is like having a standardized telegram format with a precise header that tells you exactly what type of message follows and how long it is. This structured approach eliminates ambiguity and makes parsing dramatically more efficient.\n\nThe **binary framing engine** serves as the foundation layer of our HTTP/2 server, responsible for converting between the raw bytes on the wire and structured frame objects that higher-level components can work with. This engine must handle the intricate details of binary protocol parsing while providing a clean abstraction for the rest of the system.\n\n![HTTP/2 Frame Structure](./diagrams/frame-structure.svg)\n\n### Frame Parsing\n\nThe core challenge in HTTP/2 frame parsing lies in correctly interpreting the 9-byte frame header followed by a variable-length payload. Unlike HTTP/1.1's text-based format where parsing involves string manipulation and delimiter searching, HTTP/2 parsing requires precise binary operations with careful attention to endianness and bit manipulation.\n\n> **Decision: Fixed 9-Byte Header Design**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 needed a way to prefix each frame with metadata about its contents, type, and destination stream\n> - **Options Considered**: Variable-length headers with length prefixes, fixed-size headers, or embedded metadata within payloads\n> - **Decision**: Use a fixed 9-byte header with specific bit layouts for each field\n> - **Rationale**: Fixed headers enable efficient parsing without lookahead, eliminate parsing ambiguity, and provide sufficient space for all necessary metadata\n> - **Consequences**: Every frame has exactly 9 bytes of overhead, but parsing becomes predictable and fast\n\nThe frame header contains four distinct fields packed into exactly 9 bytes:\n\n| Field | Size | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|------|-------------|\n| Length | 3 bytes | uint24 | Size of frame payload in bytes (0 to 16,777,215) |\n| Type | 1 byte | uint8 | Frame type identifier (DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, etc.) |\n| Flags | 1 byte | uint8 | Type-specific flags (END_STREAM, END_HEADERS, etc.) |\n| Stream ID | 4 bytes | uint31 | Target stream identifier (31 bits, with reserved bit) |\n\nThe parsing algorithm follows these precise steps:\n\n1. **Read exactly 9 bytes** from the connection's input stream, handling potential partial reads due to TCP fragmentation\n2. **Extract the 24-bit length field** by combining the first three bytes in network byte order (big-endian)\n3. **Validate the length field** against the maximum frame size setting and connection limits\n4. **Extract the 8-bit type field** directly from the fourth byte\n5. **Extract the 8-bit flags field** directly from the fifth byte  \n6. **Extract the 31-bit stream ID** from bytes 6-9, masking off the reserved bit in the most significant position\n7. **Validate the stream ID** for proper odd/even assignment and range constraints\n8. **Read the payload bytes** based on the length field, handling partial reads and EOF conditions\n\nThe most critical aspect of frame parsing is handling the endianness correctly. HTTP/2 uses network byte order (big-endian) for all multi-byte fields, which means the most significant byte comes first on the wire. The length field requires special handling since it spans three bytes rather than a standard 2, 4, or 8-byte integer size.\n\n> The reserved bit in the stream ID field must always be zero on the wire. Frames with the reserved bit set to 1 constitute a protocol violation that requires connection termination with a `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.\n\n**Partial Read Handling**: TCP connections provide no guarantee that a single read operation will return the requested number of bytes. The frame parser must accumulate bytes until it has collected the complete header or payload, while detecting connection closures that occur mid-frame.\n\n**Frame Boundary Synchronization**: If the parser ever gets out of sync with frame boundaries (due to implementation bugs or corrupted data), the entire connection becomes unusable. The parser must validate that frame headers make sense and that payload lengths align with frame boundaries.\n\nThe parsing operation yields a structured `Frame` object that encapsulates all header fields plus the raw payload bytes. Higher-level components work exclusively with these structured frames rather than raw byte streams.\n\n### Frame Type Implementation\n\nHTTP/2 defines multiple frame types, each with specific payload formats and semantic meanings. Our implementation focuses on the core frame types essential for basic HTTP/2 functionality: DATA, HEADERS, SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY, and WINDOW_UPDATE frames.\n\n> **Decision: Frame Type Abstraction Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Different frame types have completely different payload structures and processing requirements\n> - **Options Considered**: Single monolithic parser, type-specific parser classes, or generic frame structure with typed payload interpretation\n> - **Decision**: Generic Frame structure with type-specific payload parsing methods\n> - **Rationale**: Maintains parsing efficiency while allowing specialized handling of each frame type's unique requirements\n> - **Consequences**: Frame parsing and payload interpretation are separated, enabling easier testing and frame type extension\n\n#### DATA Frames\n\nDATA frames carry the actual HTTP request or response body content. They represent the payload data that applications ultimately consume, making them the most straightforward frame type from a parsing perspective.\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Pad Length | 0-1 bytes | Optional padding length (present if PADDED flag set) |\n| Data | Variable | Application data bytes |\n| Padding | 0-255 bytes | Optional zero-valued padding bytes |\n\nDATA frame parsing involves:\n\n1. **Check the PADDED flag** to determine if padding length field is present\n2. **Extract pad length** from first payload byte if PADDED flag is set\n3. **Validate padding length** against total payload size to prevent underflow\n4. **Extract data portion** by skipping pad length byte and trailing padding\n5. **Verify padding bytes** are zero-valued (optional but recommended for security)\n\nThe END_STREAM flag on DATA frames indicates that no more frames will be sent on this stream from the sender, making it a critical signal for stream lifecycle management.\n\n#### HEADERS Frames\n\nHEADERS frames contain HTTP header name-value pairs compressed using HPACK encoding. These frames initiate new requests (client to server) or responses (server to client) and may be split across multiple frames if header content exceeds frame size limits.\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Pad Length | 0-1 bytes | Optional padding length (present if PADDED flag set) |\n| Exclusive | 0-1 bits | Stream dependency exclusivity flag (present if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Stream Dependency | 0-31 bits | Parent stream ID for priority tree (present if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Weight | 0-1 bytes | Stream weight value 1-256 (present if PRIORITY flag set) |\n| Header Block Fragment | Variable | HPACK-compressed header data |\n| Padding | 0-255 bytes | Optional zero-valued padding bytes |\n\nHEADERS frame parsing is more complex due to optional fields:\n\n1. **Check PADDED flag** and extract padding length if present\n2. **Check PRIORITY flag** and extract dependency information if present\n3. **Extract header block fragment** from remaining payload after accounting for padding\n4. **Validate header block size** and fragment boundaries\n5. **Store fragment for HPACK decompression** (handled by HPACK engine)\n\nThe END_HEADERS flag indicates that this frame contains the last header block fragment for this header set. Without this flag, subsequent CONTINUATION frames will carry additional fragments.\n\n#### SETTINGS Frames\n\nSETTINGS frames communicate configuration parameters that affect connection behavior. They must be acknowledged by the peer and take effect only after acknowledgment.\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Settings Parameters | Multiple of 6 bytes | Array of setting ID and value pairs |\n\nEach setting parameter consists of:\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Identifier | 2 bytes | Setting type identifier |\n| Value | 4 bytes | Setting value (32-bit unsigned integer) |\n\nSETTINGS frame parsing involves:\n\n1. **Validate payload length** is multiple of 6 bytes (each setting is exactly 6 bytes)\n2. **Extract setting pairs** by reading 2-byte ID followed by 4-byte value\n3. **Validate setting identifiers** against known settings types\n4. **Validate setting values** against allowed ranges for each setting type\n5. **Apply settings** to connection state (after sending acknowledgment)\n\nCommon setting identifiers include:\n\n| Setting | ID | Description | Default Value |\n|---------|----|-----------| --------------|\n| HEADER_TABLE_SIZE | 0x1 | HPACK dynamic table size | 4096 |\n| ENABLE_PUSH | 0x2 | Server push capability | 1 |\n| MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS | 0x3 | Maximum concurrent streams | Unlimited |\n| INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE | 0x4 | Stream flow control window | 65535 |\n| MAX_FRAME_SIZE | 0x5 | Maximum frame payload size | 16384 |\n\n#### Control Frames (PING, GOAWAY, WINDOW_UPDATE)\n\nThese frames handle connection-level control operations:\n\n**PING Frames** carry 8 bytes of opaque data for connection liveness testing:\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Opaque Data | 8 bytes | Data echoed back in PING acknowledgment |\n\n**GOAWAY Frames** signal connection termination with error information:\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Last Stream ID | 4 bytes | Highest stream ID processed |\n| Error Code | 4 bytes | Reason for connection closure |\n| Additional Debug Data | Variable | Optional human-readable error description |\n\n**WINDOW_UPDATE Frames** adjust flow control windows:\n\n| Field | Size | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Window Size Increment | 4 bytes | Number of bytes to add to flow control window |\n\n### Frame Validation\n\nProtocol compliance requires extensive validation of every parsed frame before processing. Frame validation serves as the first line of defense against malformed data, protocol violations, and potential security attacks.\n\n> **Decision: Validation Timing Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Frame validation could occur during parsing, after parsing, or lazily when frames are processed\n> - **Options Considered**: Inline validation during parsing, separate validation pass, or deferred validation\n> - **Decision**: Separate validation step immediately after successful parsing\n> - **Rationale**: Separates parsing complexity from validation logic, enables reusable validation for serialized frames, and provides clear error attribution\n> - **Consequences**: Additional function call overhead but clearer separation of concerns and better testability\n\nThe validation process encompasses multiple categories of checks:\n\n#### Length Validation\n\nFrame length validation prevents buffer overflow attacks and ensures frames conform to negotiated size limits:\n\n| Validation | Rule | Error Response |\n|------------|------|----------------|\n| Maximum frame size | Length ≤ MAX_FRAME_SIZE setting | FRAME_SIZE_ERROR |\n| Minimum frame size | Length meets frame type requirements | FRAME_SIZE_ERROR |\n| Setting frame size | SETTINGS frames are multiples of 6 bytes | FRAME_SIZE_ERROR |\n| Ping frame size | PING frames are exactly 8 bytes | FRAME_SIZE_ERROR |\n| Window update size | WINDOW_UPDATE frames are exactly 4 bytes | FRAME_SIZE_ERROR |\n\n#### Stream ID Validation\n\nStream ID validation ensures proper stream lifecycle and prevents protocol confusion:\n\n| Validation | Rule | Error Response |\n|------------|------|----------------|\n| Reserved bit | Most significant bit of stream ID is 0 | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| Connection frames | SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY have stream ID 0 | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| Stream frames | DATA, HEADERS have non-zero stream ID | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| ID assignment | Client uses odd IDs, server uses even IDs | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| ID ordering | New stream IDs are greater than previous | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n\n#### Flag Validation\n\nFlag validation ensures flags are appropriate for each frame type and combination:\n\n| Frame Type | Valid Flags | Invalid Combinations |\n|------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| DATA | END_STREAM, PADDED | None |\n| HEADERS | END_STREAM, END_HEADERS, PADDED, PRIORITY | None |\n| SETTINGS | ACK | ACK with non-zero payload length |\n| PING | ACK | ACK on stream ID ≠ 0 |\n| GOAWAY | None | Any flags set |\n| WINDOW_UPDATE | None | Any flags set |\n\n#### Payload Structure Validation\n\nEach frame type requires specific payload structure validation:\n\n1. **DATA frames**: If PADDED flag is set, validate that padding length is less than payload length\n2. **HEADERS frames**: Validate that priority information (if present) doesn't create circular dependencies\n3. **SETTINGS frames**: Validate that unknown setting IDs use appropriate ranges and known settings have valid values\n4. **PING frames**: Validate payload is exactly 8 bytes regardless of flags\n5. **GOAWAY frames**: Validate that last stream ID is within reasonable bounds\n6. **WINDOW_UPDATE frames**: Validate that increment is non-zero and doesn't cause window overflow\n\n#### Connection State Validation\n\nFrame validation must consider the current connection state:\n\n| State Check | Validation | Error Response |\n|-------------|------------|----------------|\n| Connection preface | First frame after connection must be SETTINGS | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| GOAWAY sent | No new streams after GOAWAY | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| Settings acknowledgment | SETTINGS ACK must match pending SETTINGS | PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| Stream state | Frame type must be valid for stream's current state | STREAM_CLOSED |\n\n#### Error Response Strategy\n\nWhen validation fails, the response depends on the error scope:\n\n**Connection Errors** (affect entire connection):\n- Send GOAWAY frame with appropriate error code\n- Close the underlying TCP connection\n- Clean up all associated streams and resources\n\n**Stream Errors** (affect single stream):\n- Send RST_STREAM frame with appropriate error code\n- Transition stream to closed state\n- Continue processing other streams normally\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect Endianness Handling**\nMany implementations incorrectly handle the 24-bit length field by treating it as a little-endian value instead of big-endian. This causes frame parsing to completely fail when communicating with standard HTTP/2 implementations. Always use network byte order (big-endian) conversion functions and test with known good HTTP/2 clients.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Reserved Bit Ignorance**\nIgnoring the reserved bit in the stream ID field creates a subtle but serious protocol violation. Implementations that fail to mask off this bit may interpret stream IDs incorrectly, leading to frames being routed to wrong streams. Always apply a bitwise AND with `0x7FFFFFFF` to clear the reserved bit.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Partial Read Assumptions**\nAssuming that socket read operations always return the requested number of bytes leads to frame corruption and parsing failures. TCP provides no such guarantee, especially under high load or with slow connections. Always check return values and accumulate bytes until the complete frame is received.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Frame Size Attack Vulnerability**\nAccepting frames with extremely large length values without validation enables memory exhaustion attacks. An attacker can send a frame claiming to be 16MB but only provide a few bytes, causing the parser to allocate huge buffers. Always validate frame length against negotiated limits and read payload incrementally.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Flag Combination Blindness**\nProcessing frames without validating flag combinations can lead to undefined behavior. For example, a SETTINGS frame with the ACK flag must have zero payload length, but implementations often skip this check. Invalid flag combinations indicate either implementation bugs or protocol attacks.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

`io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` to detect connection closure during frame parsing  \n- Use `bufio.Reader.ReadFull()` to ensure complete frame reads despite TCP fragmentation\n- Implement `io.WriterTo` interface on Frame type for efficient serialization\n- Use `sync.Pool` for frame buffer reuse in high-performance scenarios\n- Consider using `unsafe` package for zero-copy payload access (advanced optimization)\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Distinguish between connection errors (send GOAWAY) and stream errors (send RST_STREAM)\n- Always validate frames before processing to prevent corruption propagation\n- Log protocol violations with sufficient detail for debugging but avoid information leakage\n- Implement connection-level error recovery by gracefully closing connections on fatal errors\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the binary framing engine, verify the following behavior:\n\n**Unit Test Verification:**\n```bash\ngo test ./internal/frame/... -v\n```\nExpected output should show all frame parsing, validation, and serialization tests passing.\n\n**Manual Testing Commands:**\n```bash\n# Test frame parsing with known good frames\necho -n \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" | go run cmd/frame-test/main.go parse\n\n# Test frame serialization roundtrip\ngo run cmd/frame-test/main.go roundtrip --type=SETTINGS --flags=0 --stream-id=0\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior Verification:**\n1. **Frame Header Parsing**: Parser correctly extracts length=0, type=SETTINGS, flags=0, stream-id=0 from the test frame above\n2. **Endianness Handling**: Multi-byte fields display correct values when parsed (not byte-swapped)\n3. **Validation Errors**: Invalid frames (wrong length, reserved bits set) trigger appropriate protocol errors\n4. **Serialization Roundtrip**: Frame→bytes→Frame produces identical frame structures\n\n**Warning Signs to Investigate:**\n- Frame lengths appearing as extremely large values (likely endianness bug)\n- Stream IDs with high bit set (reserved bit not masked)\n- Validation accepting clearly invalid frames (validation logic missing)\n- Parsing hanging indefinitely (partial read handling broken)\n\n\n## HPACK Compression Engine\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section primarily addresses Milestone 2 (HPACK Compression) by implementing RFC 7541 header compression with static/dynamic tables, Huffman coding, and integer encoding capabilities.\n\nThe HPACK compression engine serves as HTTP/2's sophisticated header compression system, fundamentally transforming how headers are transmitted over the wire. Think of HPACK as an intelligent librarian system for HTTP headers. Instead of repeatedly writing out the full title of every book (header name-value pair), the librarian maintains a catalog system with shortcuts. Popular books get permanent catalog numbers (static table), frequently accessed books in the current session get temporary numbers (dynamic table), and book titles are written in a compressed shorthand notation (Huffman coding). This systematic approach dramatically reduces the overhead of header transmission while maintaining complete fidelity.\n\n![HPACK Header Compression Process](./diagrams/hpack-compression-flow.svg)\n\nThe HPACK engine operates through four interconnected mechanisms: static table lookups for predefined common headers, dynamic table management for connection-specific patterns, Huffman decoding for compressed string values, and variable-length integer encoding for efficient numeric representation. Each mechanism addresses specific inefficiencies in raw header transmission while working together to achieve optimal compression ratios.\n\n### Static Table\n\nThe static table represents HPACK's foundation - a predefined catalog of 61 common HTTP header name-value pairs that every HTTP/2 implementation must recognize. Think of this as a universal dictionary shared between all HTTP/2 endpoints, similar to how postal abbreviations (like \"CA\" for California) are universally understood and save space on addresses.\n\nThe static table contains entries ranging from index 1 to 61, with each entry representing either a complete name-value pair or just a header name. For example, index 2 represents the complete pair `:method GET`, while index 1 represents just the name `:authority` without a predetermined value. This dual approach maximizes compression opportunities - common complete pairs like `GET` methods can be represented with a single index, while common header names with variable values can leverage the name portion while encoding only the value separately.\n\n| Index | Name | Value | Usage Pattern |\n|-------|------|-------|---------------|\n| 1 | `:authority` | (empty) | Host header equivalent |\n| 2 | `:method` | `GET` | Most common HTTP method |\n| 3 | `:method` | `POST` | Second most common method |\n| 4 | `:path` | `/` | Root path requests |\n| 8 | `:status` | `200` | Successful responses |\n| 14 | `accept-encoding` | `gzip, deflate` | Common compression preferences |\n| 31 | `user-agent` | (empty) | Browser identification header |\n\nThe static table lookup mechanism operates through direct index resolution. When the HPACK decoder encounters an indexed header field representation (identified by the first bit being 1), it extracts the index value and performs a direct array lookup. Static table entries occupy indices 1-61, making the lookup operation extremely efficient with O(1) complexity.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The static table's contents were carefully chosen based on analysis of real-world HTTP traffic patterns. The selection prioritizes headers that appear in virtually every HTTP request or response, ensuring maximum compression benefit across diverse web applications.\n\n**Static Table Initialization Algorithm:**\n\n1. Create a fixed-size array with 61 entries, indexed from 1 to 61\n2. Populate entries 1-4 with HTTP/2 pseudo-headers (`:authority`, `:method GET`, `:method POST`, `:path /`)\n3. Add status codes 5-14 covering common response statuses (200, 204, 206, 304, 400, 404, 500)\n4. Include standard request headers 15-61 (accept, accept-encoding, cache-control, content-type, etc.)\n5. Mark name-only entries (where value is implementation-specific) versus complete name-value pairs\n6. Create index lookup function that validates range [1,61] and returns `HeaderEntry` or not-found indicator\n\nThe static table's immutability provides several architectural advantages. First, it eliminates synchronization concerns since no modifications occur after initialization. Second, it enables aggressive caching strategies where implementations can pre-compute lookups or use optimized data structures. Third, it ensures perfect interoperability since all implementations share identical static table contents.\n\n**Static Table Access Patterns:**\n\n| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Usage Frequency |\n|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Index Lookup | O(1) | O(1) | Every indexed header field |\n| Reverse Lookup | O(n) or O(1) with hash map | O(n) additional space | During header encoding |\n| Initialization | O(1) | O(1) | Once per implementation |\n| Range Validation | O(1) | O(1) | Every lookup operation |\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Off-by-One Index Errors**\n> Static table indices start at 1, not 0, following HPACK specification conventions. Implementations often incorrectly use zero-based indexing, causing lookups to return wrong headers or trigger out-of-bounds errors. Always validate that index >= 1 and index <= 61 before array access, and remember that array[index-1] accesses the correct entry in zero-based language arrays.\n\n### Dynamic Table\n\nThe dynamic table serves as HPACK's adaptive learning mechanism, functioning like a personalized bookmark collection that evolves based on the specific headers used within a particular HTTP/2 connection. Unlike the static table's universal constants, the dynamic table captures connection-specific patterns, storing recently used header name-value pairs that don't appear in the static table or have connection-specific values.\n\nThink of the dynamic table as a smart cache with a twist - it's not just a typical LRU cache, but rather a FIFO queue with size-based eviction. Imagine a conveyor belt with limited capacity measured in bytes rather than number of items. New items (header entries) are added to one end, and when the belt becomes too full, items fall off the other end regardless of how frequently they were accessed. This FIFO approach ensures deterministic behavior between encoder and decoder, as both maintain identical table state without complex frequency tracking.\n\n**Dynamic Table Structure:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Constraints |\n|-------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| `entries` | `[]HeaderEntry` | Ordered list of header entries | FIFO ordering, newest first |\n| `size` | `uint32` | Current total size in octets | Sum of all entry sizes |\n| `maxSize` | `uint32` | Maximum allowed size | Configurable via SETTINGS frame |\n| `insertionPoint` | `uint32` | Index where next entry will be inserted | Always at position 0 (newest) |\n\nEach header entry in the dynamic table carries overhead beyond its name and value strings. The HPACK specification defines that each entry consumes 32 additional octets beyond the UTF-8 byte length of its name and value. This overhead accounts for implementation data structures and ensures consistent size calculations across different HTTP/2 implementations.\n\n> **Decision: FIFO Eviction Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Dynamic table needs predictable eviction behavior that both encoder and decoder can maintain synchronously\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction based on access patterns\n>   2. FIFO (First In, First Out) eviction based on insertion order\n>   3. Size-based priority eviction based on entry sizes\n> - **Decision**: FIFO eviction with size-based capacity management\n> - **Rationale**: FIFO ensures deterministic behavior without complex state synchronization. Both encoder and decoder can maintain identical table state by following the same insertion and eviction rules, regardless of access patterns.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables simple implementation and perfect encoder-decoder synchronization, but may evict frequently accessed entries that an LRU cache would retain.\n\n**Dynamic Table Management Operations:**\n\n| Operation | Parameters | Returns | Side Effects |\n|-----------|------------|---------|--------------|\n| `Add` | name string, value string | none | Inserts entry, triggers eviction if needed |\n| `Lookup` | index uint32 | HeaderEntry, bool | No state changes |\n| `Resize` | newSize uint32 | error | May trigger eviction, updates maxSize |\n| `EvictEntries` | none | int (evicted count) | Removes oldest entries until size <= maxSize |\n| `CalculateSize` | name, value string | uint32 | Returns total entry size including overhead |\n\nThe insertion algorithm follows a precise sequence to maintain table consistency. When adding a new entry, the dynamic table first calculates the total size including the 32-octet overhead. If this addition would exceed the maximum table size, it performs preemptive eviction of the oldest entries until sufficient space exists. The new entry is then inserted at index 0 (the \"newest\" position), and all existing entries shift to higher indices.\n\n**Dynamic Table Insertion Algorithm:**\n\n1. Calculate new entry size: `len(name) + len(value) + 32`\n2. Check if entry size exceeds maximum table size - if so, reject insertion\n3. While `currentSize + newEntrySize > maxSize`, evict oldest entry (highest index)\n4. Create new `HeaderEntry` with provided name, value, and calculated size\n5. Insert entry at index 0, shifting all existing entries to higher indices\n6. Update total table size by adding new entry size\n7. Update internal bookkeeping (entry count, insertion statistics)\n\nThe dynamic table indexing scheme requires careful coordination with static table indices. Dynamic table entries occupy indices starting at 62 (immediately after the static table's highest index of 61). The dynamic table's internal index 0 (newest entry) maps to HPACK index 62, internal index 1 maps to HPACK index 63, and so forth. This creates a unified index space where indices 1-61 reference static entries and indices 62+ reference dynamic entries.\n\n**Index Mapping Between Tables:**\n\n| HPACK Index Range | Table Type | Internal Index Calculation | Access Pattern |\n|-------------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------|\n| 1-61 | Static Table | `staticIndex = hpackIndex` | Direct array access |\n| 62+ | Dynamic Table | `dynamicIndex = hpackIndex - 62` | Array access with bounds check |\n| 0 | Invalid | N/A | Reserved/error condition |\n\nDynamic table resizing occurs through `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` frames, which can arrive at any time during connection lifetime. The resize operation may require immediate eviction if the new size is smaller than current table contents. The eviction process follows the same FIFO principle - oldest entries are removed first until the table size complies with the new limit.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The 32-octet overhead per entry serves dual purposes: it accounts for typical implementation overhead (pointers, metadata) and provides a buffer against implementation variations. Without this standardized overhead, different implementations might calculate table sizes differently, leading to synchronization drift between encoder and decoder.\n\n**Dynamic Table Eviction Scenarios:**\n\n| Trigger | Condition | Action Taken | Recovery Behavior |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Size Overflow | `currentSize + newEntry > maxSize` | Evict oldest until space available | Normal insertion proceeds |\n| Table Resize | New `maxSize < currentSize` | Evict oldest until compliant | Table remains functional |\n| Connection Reset | New connection or settings | Clear all entries, reset size to 0 | Rebuild from empty state |\n| Memory Pressure | Implementation-specific | May reduce maxSize temporarily | Graceful degradation |\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Dynamic Table Size Calculation**\n> Implementations frequently miscalculate entry sizes by forgetting the 32-octet overhead or incorrectly measuring string lengths. UTF-8 strings must be measured in bytes (octets), not Unicode code points or characters. Always use `len([]byte(string))` in Go or equivalent byte-length functions in other languages. The total size is `len(nameBytes) + len(valueBytes) + 32`, and this exact calculation must match between encoder and decoder.\n\n### Huffman Coding\n\nHuffman coding in HPACK provides the final layer of compression by encoding string values using variable-length bit sequences optimized for typical HTTP header content. Think of Huffman coding as a telegraph operator's shorthand system - frequently used letters get short codes (like \"E\" encoded as a single dot), while rare letters get longer codes. This approach can reduce header string sizes by 15-50% depending on content patterns.\n\nThe HPACK specification defines a static Huffman table optimized for HTTP header values, based on analysis of real-world web traffic. This table assigns shorter bit sequences to characters that appear frequently in HTTP headers (like lowercase letters, digits, and common punctuation) while assigning longer sequences to rarely used characters. The encoding table is bidirectional - the same table supports both encoding strings into compressed bit sequences and decoding compressed sequences back to original strings.\n\n**HPACK Huffman Table Characteristics:**\n\n| Character Category | Code Length Range | Example Characters | Optimization Rationale |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Common lowercase | 5-6 bits | a, e, i, o, s, t | High frequency in header values |\n| Digits | 5-6 bits | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4-9 | Common in content-length, status |\n| Common symbols | 6-8 bits | -, _, ., / | Frequent in URLs, header names |\n| Uppercase letters | 6-8 bits | A, C, G, M, P | Less common but still significant |\n| Special characters | 10-30 bits | Unicode, control chars | Rare, acceptable longer encoding |\n\nThe Huffman decoding process operates on a bit-by-bit basis, using the compressed byte stream to traverse a decoding tree or lookup table. The decoder maintains a state machine that accumulates bits until it identifies a complete character code, then outputs the corresponding character and resets for the next code. This stateful approach handles variable-length codes seamlessly while detecting invalid or incomplete sequences.\n\n**Huffman Decoding Algorithm:**\n\n1. Initialize decoder state: bit accumulator = 0, bit count = 0, output buffer empty\n2. For each byte in compressed input:\n   - Extract 8 bits and add to bit accumulator\n   - Increment bit count by 8\n   - While bit count >= minimum code length:\n     - Check if current bit pattern matches any Huffman code\n     - If match found: append decoded character to output, remove matched bits from accumulator, adjust bit count\n     - If no match and bit count >= maximum code length: signal decoding error\n     - If no match and more bits needed: continue to next input byte\n3. After processing all input bytes:\n   - If remaining bits are non-zero: verify they match EOS padding pattern\n   - If padding invalid: signal decoding error\n   - Return decoded string from output buffer\n\nThe Huffman decoder must handle several edge cases carefully. Incomplete input streams may leave partial codes in the bit accumulator - these must be validated as proper End-of-String (EOS) padding to prevent security vulnerabilities. Invalid bit sequences that don't correspond to any character code must trigger decoding errors rather than producing garbage output.\n\n> **Design Insight**: HPACK uses a static Huffman table rather than dynamic Huffman coding to avoid synchronization complexity between encoder and decoder. While dynamic tables could achieve better compression ratios by adapting to specific traffic patterns, the static approach eliminates the need to maintain and synchronize Huffman trees across connection endpoints.\n\n**Huffman Decoding State Machine:**\n\n| Current State | Input Event | Next State | Action Taken |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|--------------|\n| `ACCUMULATING` | Input byte available | `ACCUMULATING` | Add 8 bits to accumulator |\n| `ACCUMULATING` | Pattern matches code | `ACCUMULATING` | Output character, remove matched bits |\n| `ACCUMULATING` | End of input, valid padding | `COMPLETE` | Return decoded string |\n| `ACCUMULATING` | End of input, invalid padding | `ERROR` | Signal padding error |\n| `ACCUMULATING` | Invalid bit pattern | `ERROR` | Signal decoding error |\n| `ERROR` | Any input | `ERROR` | Maintain error state |\n| `COMPLETE` | Any input | `ERROR` | Decoder already finished |\n\nHuffman boundary handling represents one of the most complex aspects of HPACK implementation. Since Huffman codes have variable lengths and don't align with byte boundaries, the final byte of a Huffman-encoded string may contain partial code bits followed by padding. The HPACK specification mandates that padding consists of the most significant bits of the EOS (End of String) symbol, ensuring that partial codes don't accidentally decode to valid characters.\n\n**Huffman Padding Validation:**\n\nThe EOS symbol in HPACK Huffman coding is represented by 30 consecutive 1-bits (`111111111111111111111111111111`). When a Huffman-encoded string doesn't end exactly on a byte boundary, the remaining bits in the final byte must be filled with the most significant bits of the EOS symbol. For example, if 3 padding bits are needed, they must be `111` (the first 3 bits of the EOS symbol).\n\n| Padding Length | Required Bit Pattern | Validation Check |\n|----------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| 1 bit | `1` | Final bit must be 1 |\n| 2 bits | `11` | Final 2 bits must be 11 |\n| 3 bits | `111` | Final 3 bits must be 111 |\n| 4 bits | `1111` | Final 4 bits must be 1111 |\n| 5 bits | `11111` | Final 5 bits must be 11111 |\n| 6 bits | `111111` | Final 6 bits must be 111111 |\n| 7 bits | `1111111` | Final 7 bits must be 1111111 |\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Huffman Boundary Errors**\n> Implementations often fail to properly validate Huffman padding, either accepting invalid padding patterns or miscalculating padding length. The padding validation must check that remaining bits in the final byte exactly match the most significant bits of the EOS symbol. Accepting invalid padding can create security vulnerabilities where malformed headers are processed incorrectly. Always validate that `remainingBits == (EOS_SYMBOL >> (30 - paddingLength))`.\n\n### Integer Encoding\n\nHPACK integer encoding provides a sophisticated variable-length encoding scheme that efficiently represents numeric values while maintaining byte-alignment for the surrounding bit fields. Think of this encoding as a expandable numeric notation system similar to scientific notation, but optimized for binary representation rather than human readability. Small numbers use minimal space, while larger numbers automatically extend into additional bytes as needed.\n\nThe encoding scheme uses a prefix of N bits within the first byte to represent small integers directly, with the remaining (8-N) bits available for other purposes like flags or type indicators. When the integer value exceeds what the N-bit prefix can represent (2^N - 1), the encoding switches to a multi-byte format that can represent arbitrarily large integers using continuation bytes.\n\n**HPACK Integer Encoding Variants:**\n\n| Prefix Size | Maximum Single-Byte Value | Typical Usage | Remaining Bits Available |\n|-------------|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| 5-bit prefix | 30 (2^5 - 2) | Header field index | 3 bits for pattern/flags |\n| 6-bit prefix | 62 (2^6 - 2) | Maximum dynamic table size | 2 bits for pattern/flags |\n| 7-bit prefix | 126 (2^7 - 2) | String length encoding | 1 bit for Huffman flag |\n| 8-bit prefix | 254 (2^8 - 2) | Standalone integer values | 0 bits (full byte) |\n\nThe integer encoding algorithm operates in two distinct modes based on the value being encoded. For small integers that fit within the prefix bits, the encoding uses a single byte with the integer value stored directly in the prefix portion. For larger integers, the prefix bits are filled with all 1s (indicating multi-byte encoding), and the actual value is encoded using a continuation-byte scheme similar to UTF-8 encoding.\n\n**Single-Byte Integer Encoding (Value < 2^N - 1):**\n\n1. Verify that integer value < (2^N - 1) where N is the prefix size\n2. Store the integer value directly in the N least significant bits of the first byte\n3. Set the (8-N) most significant bits according to the specific HPACK pattern\n4. Output the single byte - encoding complete\n\n**Multi-Byte Integer Encoding (Value >= 2^N - 1):**\n\n1. Set the N prefix bits to all 1s: `(2^N - 1)`\n2. Calculate remaining value: `remainingValue = originalValue - (2^N - 1)`\n3. While remainingValue >= 128:\n   - Output byte with value `(remainingValue % 128) | 0x80` (continuation bit set)\n   - Set remainingValue = remainingValue / 128\n4. Output final byte with value `remainingValue` (continuation bit clear)\n5. Encoding complete\n\nThe decoding process reverses this algorithm, first checking if the prefix bits are all 1s to determine single-byte versus multi-byte mode. In multi-byte mode, the decoder accumulates value from continuation bytes, each contributing 7 bits of value data (the 8th bit indicates whether more bytes follow).\n\n**Integer Decoding Algorithm:**\n\n1. Extract N prefix bits from first byte: `prefixValue = firstByte & ((1 << N) - 1)`\n2. If prefixValue < (2^N - 1): return prefixValue (single-byte encoding)\n3. Initialize accumulator: `totalValue = prefixValue`, `multiplier = 1`\n4. Read next byte, check continuation bit (bit 7)\n5. Add contribution: `totalValue += (byte & 0x7F) * multiplier`\n6. Update multiplier: `multiplier *= 128`\n7. If continuation bit set: repeat from step 4\n8. Return totalValue\n\n> **Decision: Variable-Length Integer Encoding**\n> - **Context**: HPACK needs to encode integers of varying sizes (indices, lengths, sizes) while maintaining bit-level efficiency for flags and patterns\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fixed 32-bit integers for all numeric values\n>   2. LEB128 encoding (Little Endian Base 128) used in other binary formats\n>   3. Custom variable-length encoding with configurable prefix sizes\n> - **Decision**: Custom variable-length encoding with N-bit prefixes\n> - **Rationale**: Allows optimal space usage for small values while supporting arbitrary-size integers. The configurable prefix size enables sharing bytes between integer values and control bits/flags.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation than fixed-size integers, but significantly better compression for typical HTTP/2 header values.\n\n**Integer Encoding Edge Cases:**\n\n| Scenario | Value Range | Encoding Behavior | Validation Required |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Zero value | 0 | Single byte: prefix = 0 | Always valid |\n| Maximum prefix | 2^N - 2 | Single byte: prefix = max-1 | Check prefix size |\n| Prefix boundary | 2^N - 1 | Multi-byte: prefix = all 1s, continuation = 0 | Special case handling |\n| Large integers | > 2^32 | Multi-byte with many continuation bytes | Overflow protection |\n| Invalid continuation | Bit 7 pattern errors | Decoder should reject | Error detection |\n\nThe integer encoding format includes several subtle implementation requirements. The continuation bit (most significant bit of each continuation byte) must be properly set for all bytes except the final one. The value contribution from each continuation byte uses only the lower 7 bits, with the 8th bit serving as the continuation indicator. Overflow protection is essential since malicious inputs could specify extremely large integers that exceed implementation limits.\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Integer Overflow in Multi-Byte Decoding**\n> Malicious or malformed HPACK data might encode extremely large integers using many continuation bytes, potentially causing integer overflow in the decoder. Implementations must limit the maximum number of continuation bytes (typically 4-5 bytes for 32-bit integers) and detect overflow conditions. Use `totalValue > (MAX_INT - contribution) / multiplier` to check for overflow before adding each contribution, and reject any integer that would exceed reasonable bounds.\n\n**Integer Encoding Performance Characteristics:**\n\n| Value Range | Byte Count | Encoding Efficiency | Decode Complexity |\n|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 0 to 2^N-2 | 1 byte | Optimal (50-87% space savings) | O(1) - single operation |\n| 2^N-1 to 2^7-1 | 2 bytes | Good (25-50% space savings) | O(1) - two operations |\n| 2^14 to 2^21 | 3-4 bytes | Moderate (0-25% space savings) | O(k) where k = byte count |\n| > 2^21 | 4+ bytes | Poor (negative space savings) | O(k) with overflow checks |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe HPACK compression engine requires careful coordination between multiple encoding and decoding subsystems.

The single TCP connection is like the airport runway - there's only one physical runway, but multiple aircraft (streams) can be managed simultaneously through careful orchestration. Each aircraft has a unique flight number (stream ID), follows a specific flight plan (state machine), and has priority levels (weight and dependencies) that determine landing order. The air traffic controller (stream manager) tracks each aircraft's status, manages the queue when the runway is busy (flow control), and can cancel flights when necessary (RST_STREAM). Just as airports handle dozens of aircraft concurrently over a single runway through sophisticated scheduling, HTTP/2 handles multiple request-response pairs over a single TCP connection through multiplexing.\n\nThe key insight is that while HTTP/1.1 was like a single-lane road where cars must wait in line, HTTP/2 is like a multi-lane highway where traffic flows independently in parallel lanes, all sharing the same underlying infrastructure but managed through intelligent routing and priority systems.\n\n### Stream State Machine\n\nThe **stream state machine** forms the heart of HTTP/2's multiplexing capability, defining how individual streams transition through their lifecycle from creation to completion. Each stream maintains its own independent state, allowing hundreds of concurrent request-response pairs to coexist safely over a single connection without interference.\n\n![HTTP/2 Stream State Machine](./diagrams/stream-state-machine.svg)\n\nThe state machine governs six distinct states, with transitions triggered by specific frame types and directional considerations. Unlike HTTP/1.1's simple request-response pattern, HTTP/2 streams can be half-closed, meaning one direction (client-to-server or server-to-client) can be closed while the other remains open for additional data.\n\n| Current State | Triggering Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------|\n| `StateIdle` | Send/Receive HEADERS frame | `StateOpen` | Initialize stream metadata, allocate buffers |\n| `StateIdle` | Send PUSH_PROMISE frame | `StateReservedLocal` | Reserve stream for server push (future extension) |\n| `StateIdle` | Receive PUSH_PROMISE frame | `StateReservedRemote` | Acknowledge pushed resource reservation |\n| `StateOpen` | Send END_STREAM flag | `StateHalfClosedLocal` | Mark local direction closed, continue receiving |\n| `StateOpen` | Receive END_STREAM flag | `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Mark remote direction closed, continue sending |\n| `StateHalfClosedLocal` | Receive END_STREAM flag | `StateClosed` | Complete stream closure, release resources |\n| `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Send END_STREAM flag | `StateClosed` | Complete stream closure, release resources |\n| `StateReservedLocal` | Send HEADERS with END_HEADERS | `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Transition to normal stream flow |\n| `StateReservedRemote` | Receive HEADERS frame | `StateHalfClosedLocal` | Accept pushed resource |\n| Any State | Send/Receive RST_STREAM | `StateClosed` | Immediate termination, clean up resources |\n\nThe core data structures supporting the state machine provide comprehensive tracking of each stream's current status and directional flow control:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `uint32` | Unique stream identifier within connection scope |\n| `state` | `StreamState` | Current position in the stream lifecycle state machine |\n| `localEndStream` | `bool` | Whether local endpoint has sent END_STREAM flag |\n| `remoteEndStream` | `bool` | Whether remote endpoint has sent END_STREAM flag |\n| `sendWindow` | `int64` | Available bytes that can be sent to peer (flow control) |\n| `recvWindow` | `int64` | Available bytes that can be received from peer |\n| `priority` | `StreamPriority` | Weight and dependency information for scheduling |\n| `headers` | `map[string]string` | Decoded request/response headers for this stream |\n| `pendingData` | `[]byte` | Buffered data waiting for flow control window |\n| `created` | `time.Time` | Stream creation timestamp for timeout management |\n| `lastActivity` | `time.Time` | Most recent frame received/sent for idle detection |\n\n> **Decision: Separate Local and Remote End Stream Tracking**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 streams can be half-closed, where one direction is closed but the other remains open for continued data flow\n> - **Options Considered**: Single boolean flag, combined state enum, or separate directional flags\n> - **Decision**: Use separate `localEndStream` and `remoteEndStream` boolean flags\n> - **Rationale**: Separate flags provide clear visibility into directional state, simplify half-closed logic, and make debugging easier by explicitly showing which direction initiated closure\n> - **Consequences**: Enables proper half-closed stream handling, increases memory usage slightly per stream, but dramatically simplifies state transition logic\n\nThe state transitions must be carefully validated to prevent protocol violations. Invalid transitions indicate either implementation bugs or malicious clients attempting to exploit the protocol:\n\n| Invalid Transition | Error Condition | Recovery Action |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| HEADERS on closed stream | Stream already completed | Send RST_STREAM with STREAM_CLOSED error |\n| DATA before HEADERS | Stream not yet opened | Send RST_STREAM with PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| Multiple HEADERS without CONTINUATION | Header block not complete | Send connection GOAWAY with PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n| END_STREAM on half-closed direction | Direction already closed | Send RST_STREAM with STREAM_CLOSED error |\n| Frame on reserved stream (wrong type) | Invalid frame for reserved state | Send RST_STREAM with PROTOCOL_ERROR |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in State Transitions**\n\nA common mistake is failing to handle race conditions where both endpoints simultaneously send frames that trigger state transitions. For example, if the client sends a DATA frame with END_STREAM while the server sends RST_STREAM, both frames might be in flight. The implementation must define a consistent ordering: RST_STREAM always wins and immediately transitions to closed, regardless of other pending frames. Without this rule, streams can get stuck in inconsistent states where each endpoint believes different state information.\n\n### Stream ID Allocation\n\nStream ID allocation in HTTP/2 follows a carefully designed numbering scheme that prevents collisions, enables concurrent stream creation, and provides implicit metadata about stream ownership and directionality. The allocation strategy must handle both client-initiated and server-initiated streams while maintaining strict ordering requirements.\n\n![Stream Multiplexing Visualization](./diagrams/multiplexing-visualization.svg)\n\nThe fundamental allocation rule divides the 31-bit stream ID space (bit 32 is reserved) into two non-overlapping ranges:\n\n| Stream Type | ID Range | Initiator | Usage Pattern |\n|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Client-initiated | Odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) | HTTP client | Normal request-response pairs |\n| Server-initiated | Even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...) | HTTP server | Server push (future extension) |\n| Connection control | Stream ID 0 | Either endpoint | SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY frames |\n\nThe allocation process maintains strict monotonicity requirements - each endpoint must use strictly increasing stream IDs for new streams. This ordering enables efficient resource management and prevents certain protocol attacks:\n\n1. **Client allocation**: Start with stream ID 1, increment by 2 for each new stream (1, 3, 5, 7, ...)\n2. **Server allocation**: Start with stream ID 2, increment by 2 for each new stream (2, 4, 6, 8, ...)\n3. **Ordering validation**: Reject any stream ID that is less than or equal to the highest previously used ID from the same initiator\n4. **Resource tracking**: Use the highest allocated stream ID to determine connection liveliness and resource cleanup timing\n\n> **Decision: Monotonic Stream ID Allocation with Gap Tolerance**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 requires monotonically increasing stream IDs, but network conditions might cause frames to arrive out of order\n> - **Options Considered**: Strict sequential validation, gap tolerance with buffering, or relaxed ordering\n> - **Decision**: Implement monotonic validation with limited gap tolerance for reasonable out-of-order delivery\n> - **Rationale**: Strict monotonic ordering prevents resource exhaustion attacks while limited buffering accommodates realistic network reordering without compromising security\n> - **Consequences**: Provides security against malicious clients while maintaining compatibility with standard network conditions, requires bounded buffer for out-of-order stream creation\n\nThe stream ID allocation component tracks allocation state per connection and validates incoming stream creation requests:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `nextClientStreamID` | `uint32` | Next available odd stream ID for client allocation |\n| `nextServerStreamID` | `uint32` | Next available even stream ID for server allocation |\n| `highestClientStreamID` | `uint32` | Highest client stream ID seen (monotonicity check) |\n| `highestServerStreamID` | `uint32` | Highest server stream ID seen (monotonicity check) |\n| `pendingStreams` | `map[uint32]*Stream` | Streams created but not yet confirmed |\n| `maxStreamID` | `uint32` | Maximum allowed stream ID (2^31 - 1) |\n\nStream ID exhaustion represents a serious but manageable condition that occurs when an endpoint approaches the maximum stream ID value. The protocol provides graceful handling through connection cycling:\n\n1. **Exhaustion detection**: Monitor when next stream ID approaches `MaxStreamID` (2^31 - 1)\n2. **Graceful shutdown initiation**: Send GOAWAY frame indicating the highest accepted stream ID\n3. **Connection draining**: Allow existing streams to complete naturally while rejecting new stream creation\n4. **New connection establishment**: Client establishes new connection for additional streams\n5. **Resource cleanup**: After all streams complete, close the exhausted connection\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream ID Reuse After Connection Reset**\n\nA critical mistake is attempting to reuse stream IDs after a connection error and recovery. Each connection maintains independent stream ID allocation state, but implementations sometimes incorrectly carry over stream ID counters across connection boundaries. This can lead to protocol violations when the new connection's stream IDs conflict with cached state from the previous connection. Always reset stream ID allocation to initial values (1 for client, 2 for server) when establishing a new connection.\n\n### Priority Scheduling\n\nHTTP/2's **priority scheduling** system enables intelligent bandwidth allocation among concurrent streams through a sophisticated weight and dependency model. Unlike simple round-robin scheduling, HTTP/2 priority allows clients to express the relative importance of resources and create dependency relationships that optimize page load performance.\n\nThe priority system operates on two fundamental concepts: **stream weights** and **dependency relationships**. Stream weights range from 1 to 256 and determine the relative share of available bandwidth each stream should receive. Dependencies create parent-child relationships where child streams should only receive bandwidth after their parent stream completes or reaches certain milestones.\n\n| Priority Concept | Range/Type | Purpose | Default Value |\n|------------------|------------|---------|---------------|\n| Stream Weight | 1-256 | Relative bandwidth allocation within same priority level | 16 |\n| Dependency Stream ID | 0 or valid stream ID | Parent stream that should be prioritized first | 0 (no dependency) |\n| Exclusive Flag | Boolean | Whether this stream should be the sole child of its parent | false |\n| Priority Tree Depth | Unlimited (implementation limited) | Maximum dependency chain length | Typically limited to 32 levels |\n\nThe priority tree structure enables complex resource relationships common in web applications. For example, HTML documents typically have the highest priority, followed by critical CSS and JavaScript, with images and other assets receiving lower priority. The dependency model allows expressing rules like \"load all CSS before any images\" or \"prioritize above-the-fold images over below-the-fold content.\"\n\n| Stream Type | Typical Weight | Common Dependencies | Scheduling Rationale |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| HTML Document | 220-256 | None (root level) | Critical rendering path foundation |\n| Critical CSS | 200-220 | HTML document | Blocks rendering until loaded |\n| JavaScript | 180-200 | HTML document | May block parsing or execution |\n| Above-fold Images | 100-150 | CSS files | Visible content prioritized |\n| Below-fold Images | 50-100 | Above-fold resources | Deferred until critical path complete |\n| Tracking/Analytics | 1-20 | All content resources | Lowest priority, non-blocking |\n\nThe priority scheduling algorithm maintains a dynamic tree structure that evolves as streams are created, completed, and reprioritized:\n\n| Algorithm Step | Action Taken | Data Structure Update |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| 1. New Stream Creation | Insert stream into priority tree at specified dependency position | Update parent's children list, set stream's parent pointer |\n| 2. Weight Calculation | Calculate effective weight considering parent completion status | Traverse dependency path to root, accumulate weight factors |\n| 3. Bandwidth Allocation | Distribute available send quota proportionally among ready streams | Sort streams by effective priority, allocate bytes proportionally |\n| 4. Stream Completion | Remove completed stream from tree, promote children to grandparent | Update parent-child relationships, recalculate descendant weights |\n| 5. Priority Updates | Process PRIORITY frames to modify weights or dependencies | Rebuild affected tree portions, detect and break dependency cycles |\n\n> **Decision: Simplified Priority Implementation with Weight-Based Scheduling**\n> - **Context**: Full HTTP/2 priority with dependency trees is complex and provides diminishing returns for many applications\n> - **Options Considered**: Full dependency tree implementation, weight-only scheduling, or FIFO ordering\n> - **Decision**: Implement weight-based scheduling with basic dependency support but without complex tree restructuring\n> - **Rationale**: Weight-based scheduling provides 80% of the benefit with 20% of the complexity, making it more maintainable and debuggable for learning purposes\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler implementation that handles most real-world scenarios, but lacks advanced features like dependency tree manipulation and exclusive priorities\n\nThe priority scheduling data structures track both the tree relationships and the dynamic scheduling state:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `weight` | `uint8` | Stream priority weight (1-256), higher means more bandwidth |\n| `dependsOn` | `uint32` | Parent stream ID, or 0 for root-level stream |\n| `exclusive` | `bool` | Whether this stream should be the exclusive child of its parent |\n| `children` | `[]uint32` | List of child stream IDs that depend on this stream |\n| `effectiveWeight` | `float64` | Calculated weight considering parent completion status |\n| `schedulingQuota` | `int64` | Bytes allocated to this stream in current scheduling round |\n| `pendingBytes` | `int64` | Total bytes queued for transmission on this stream |\n\nThe bandwidth allocation algorithm runs each time the connection has data to send and available flow control window:\n\n1. **Identify ready streams**: Find all streams with pending data and available flow control window\n2. **Calculate effective weights**: For each ready stream, compute its effective priority considering parent dependencies and completion status\n3. **Proportional allocation**: Distribute the available connection window proportionally based on effective weights\n4. **Minimum allocation**: Ensure each ready stream receives at least a minimum quantum (typically 1KB) to prevent starvation\n5. **Remainder distribution**: Allocate any remaining bytes to streams with the highest effective weights\n6. **Flow control update**: Deduct allocated bytes from connection and stream flow control windows as data is sent\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Priority Inversion Through Flow Control Exhaustion**\n\nA subtle but serious issue occurs when high-priority streams exhaust their flow control windows while low-priority streams continue transmitting. This creates priority inversion where less important streams consume bandwidth while critical streams wait for window updates. The solution requires integrating priority scheduling with flow control management - when high-priority streams are window-limited, the scheduler should pause lower-priority streams and send WINDOW_UPDATE frames to unblock the critical path.\n\n### Stream Limits\n\n**Stream limits** provide essential resource management and DoS protection for HTTP/2 servers by controlling the number of concurrent streams, enforcing creation rate limits, and providing mechanisms for immediate stream termination when necessary. Without proper limits, malicious clients can easily exhaust server resources by opening thousands of concurrent streams or continuously creating and abandoning streams.\n\nThe HTTP/2 specification defines several categories of stream limits that implementations must enforce:\n\n| Limit Type | Default Value | Scope | Purpose |\n|------------|---------------|--------|---------|\n| `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` | 100 (recommended) | Per-connection | Maximum simultaneously active streams |\n| `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` | 16384-16777215 | Per-connection | Maximum bytes in a single frame payload |\n| `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` | Unlimited (implementation choice) | Per-stream | Maximum decompressed header bytes |\n| Implementation stream creation rate | 10 streams/second (recommended) | Per-connection | DoS protection against stream flooding |\n| Implementation memory per stream | 4KB-16KB typical | Per-stream | Memory exhaustion protection |\n| Implementation total connection streams | 10,000 lifetime typical | Per-connection | Resource cleanup and connection cycling |\n\nThe concurrent stream limit represents the most important protection mechanism. It prevents clients from opening unlimited streams simultaneously while allowing reasonable concurrency for legitimate use cases:\n\n1. **Limit enforcement**: Track active stream count and reject new HEADERS frames when limit is reached\n2. **Stream counting**: Increment counter on stream creation, decrement on transition to `StateClosed`\n3. **Limit negotiation**: Use SETTINGS frames to communicate server capacity to clients\n4. **Graceful degradation**: When approaching limits, prioritize existing streams over new stream creation\n5. **Emergency shedding**: If limits are exceeded due to race conditions, use RST_STREAM to quickly close least important streams\n\n| Stream State | Counts Toward Limit | Rationale |\n|--------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| `StateIdle` | No | Stream not yet created |\n| `StateOpen` | Yes | Fully active stream consuming resources |\n| `StateHalfClosedLocal` | Yes | Still consuming server resources for response |\n| `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Yes | Still consuming server resources for processing |\n| `StateClosed` | No | Resources released, available for new streams |\n| `StateReservedLocal` | Yes | Server-initiated stream consuming resources |\n| `StateReservedRemote` | No | Client reservation, minimal resource usage |\n\nRST_STREAM handling provides the mechanism for immediate stream termination in response to errors, resource exhaustion, or application-level cancellation requests:\n\n| RST_STREAM Error Code | Typical Cause | Server Response |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `PROTOCOL_ERROR` | Invalid frame sequence or malformed data | Log error, close stream, continue connection |\n| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Server implementation bug or resource exhaustion | Close stream, investigate root cause |\n| `FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR` | Stream exceeded flow control window | Close stream, may indicate malicious client |\n| `STREAM_CLOSED` | Frame received on already closed stream | Close stream, normal race condition handling |\n| `FRAME_SIZE_ERROR` | Frame payload exceeds negotiated maximum | Close stream, possible DoS attempt |\n| `REFUSED_STREAM` | Server cannot handle stream (resource limits) | Close stream, client should retry |\n| `CANCEL` | Client-initiated cancellation | Close stream, clean up resources |\n| `COMPRESSION_ERROR` | HPACK decompression failure | Close connection (affects header table) |\n| `CONNECT_ERROR` | HTTP CONNECT method failed | Close stream, connection-specific error |\n\n> **Decision: Adaptive Stream Limits Based on Connection Health**\n> - **Context**: Fixed stream limits may be too restrictive for well-behaved clients or too permissive for malicious ones\n> - **Options Considered**: Fixed limits, per-client adaptive limits, or connection health-based adjustment\n> - **Decision**: Implement base limits with health-based adjustments using connection metrics\n> - **Rationale**: Allows legitimate clients with good behavior to exceed base limits while quickly restricting misbehaving connections\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation but better resource utilization and DoS protection\n\nThe stream limit enforcement requires careful coordination with the connection's overall resource management:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `maxConcurrentStreams` | `uint32` | Maximum allowed simultaneous active streams |\n| `currentStreamCount` | `uint32` | Currently active streams (open + half-closed) |\n| `totalStreamsCreated` | `uint64` | Lifetime stream creation counter for rate limiting |\n| `streamCreationTimes` | `[]time.Time` | Recent stream creation timestamps for rate calculation |\n| `rejectedStreams` | `uint64` | Count of streams rejected due to limits (monitoring) |\n| `emergencyMode` | `bool` | Whether connection is in resource conservation mode |\n| `connectionHealthScore` | `float64` | Calculated health metric for adaptive limit adjustment |\n\nThe stream creation rate limiting algorithm prevents rapid-fire stream creation attacks while accommodating legitimate burst traffic:\n\n1. **Rate calculation**: Maintain sliding window of recent stream creation timestamps\n2. **Burst allowance**: Permit short bursts above sustained rate (token bucket algorithm)\n3. **Sustained rate limiting**: Enforce maximum average creation rate over longer periods\n4. **Adaptive thresholds**: Reduce limits for connections showing suspicious patterns\n5. **Graceful rejection**: Use REFUSED_STREAM error rather than connection termination when possible\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Incomplete Stream Cleanup**\n\nA common implementation mistake is failing to fully clean up stream resources when streams are reset or completed. Each stream typically holds references to header tables, pending data buffers, flow control state, and priority tree positions. When RST_STREAM is received or sent, all of these resources must be immediately released. Incomplete cleanup leads to memory leaks that accumulate over connection lifetime, eventually causing server instability. Implement comprehensive cleanup checklists and use resource tracking to detect leaks during testing.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Just as traffic lights, on-ramps, and merge lanes prevent congestion by controlling how many cars enter different road segments, HTTP/2 flow control prevents network congestion by managing how much data can be sent over connection and stream channels. Unlike a simple traffic light that's either red or green, HTTP/2 flow control uses dynamic \"credit systems\" where senders receive permission tokens (window updates) that specify exactly how many bytes they're allowed to transmit before waiting for more tokens.\n\n![Flow Control Window Management](./diagrams/flow-control-windows.svg)\n\nThe fundamental challenge in HTTP/2 flow control stems from the **multiplexing paradigm** - multiple independent streams share a single TCP connection, creating a two-level resource management problem. At the connection level, we must prevent the aggregate data from all streams from overwhelming the receiver's network buffers. At the stream level, we must ensure that a fast-producing stream doesn't monopolize bandwidth and starve other streams. This dual-layer approach requires careful coordination between connection-wide and per-stream flow control windows, with complex interactions during window updates and backpressure scenarios.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: HTTP/2 flow control operates on a credit-based system where receivers explicitly grant permission for data transmission. This inverts the traditional TCP model where senders transmit optimistically and react to backpressure signals. The receiver-driven approach provides fine-grained control but introduces complexity around window exhaustion, update timing, and deadlock prevention.\n\n### Window Management\n\n**Window management** in HTTP/2 implements a hierarchical credit system where both connections and individual streams maintain separate flow control windows. Think of this as a two-tier banking system: the connection window represents the total credit limit across all accounts (streams), while each stream window represents an individual account balance. Every DATA frame transmission requires \"payment\" from both the stream's account and the connection's master account. If either account lacks sufficient funds, the transaction (DATA frame) must wait until credit becomes available.\n\nThe window management system tracks four distinct window states for each active component:\n\n| Window Type | Scope | Initial Size | Purpose | Update Mechanism |\n|-------------|-------|--------------|---------|------------------|\n| Connection Send Window | Per-Connection | `InitialWindowSize` (65535) | Limits total outbound DATA bytes across all streams | WINDOW_UPDATE frames with StreamID=0 |\n| Stream Send Window | Per-Stream | `InitialWindowSize` (65535) | Limits outbound DATA bytes for specific stream | WINDOW_UPDATE frames with specific StreamID |\n| Connection Receive Window | Per-Connection | `InitialWindowSize` (65535) | Limits total inbound DATA bytes across all streams | Local WINDOW_UPDATE generation |\n| Stream Receive Window | Per-Stream | `InitialWindowSize` (65535) | Limits inbound DATA bytes for specific stream | Local WINDOW_UPDATE generation |\n\nEach window operates as a signed 32-bit integer that decrements when DATA frames are transmitted and increments when WINDOW_UPDATE frames are received (for send windows) or generated (for receive windows). The critical invariant is that **both the connection and stream send windows must have sufficient credit** before any DATA frame transmission can proceed.\n\n> **Decision: Hierarchical Window Architecture**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 requires flow control at both connection and stream levels, but the interaction between these levels wasn't clearly specified in early implementations\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Independent windows (stream and connection windows operate separately)\n>   2. Hierarchical windows (DATA frames consume credit from both levels)\n>   3. Stream-only windows (ignore connection-level flow control)\n> - **Decision**: Hierarchical windows where DATA transmission requires credit from both stream and connection windows\n> - **Rationale**: This approach provides maximum flexibility for receiver-driven flow control while preventing any single stream from overwhelming the connection's aggregate capacity\n> - **Consequences**: Increases implementation complexity but provides robust protection against resource exhaustion and enables sophisticated traffic shaping\n\nThe window tracking implementation maintains these values within the existing data structures:\n\n| Field | Type | Location | Purpose |\n|-------|------|----------|---------|\n| `sendWindow` | `int64` | `Stream` struct | Current send window for this stream |\n| `recvWindow` | `int64` | `Stream` struct | Current receive window for this stream |\n| `connectionSendWindow` | `int64` | Connection state | Aggregate send window across all streams |\n| `connectionRecvWindow` | `int64` | Connection state | Aggregate receive window across all streams |\n| `pendingWindowUpdates` | `map[uint32]int64` | Connection state | Queued WINDOW_UPDATE frames awaiting transmission |\n\nWindow update processing follows a precise protocol when WINDOW_UPDATE frames arrive:\n\n1. **Frame Validation**: Verify the WINDOW_UPDATE frame contains a non-zero window size increment and targets a valid stream (or connection with StreamID=0)\n2. **Overflow Protection**: Check that adding the increment to the current window wouldn't exceed the maximum window size (2^31 - 1)\n3. **Window Application**: Add the increment to the appropriate window (connection if StreamID=0, specific stream otherwise)\n4. **Pending Data Processing**: Scan queued DATA frames and resume transmission for any frames that now have sufficient window credit\n5. **Cascade Updates**: If connection window increased, check all streams for newly transmittable data\n\nThe window update generation logic operates continuously in the background, monitoring receive windows and generating WINDOW_UPDATE frames when windows fall below threshold levels:\n\n| Condition | Action | Window Update Size | Rationale |\n|-----------|--------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Stream receive window < 25% of initial | Generate stream WINDOW_UPDATE | Restore to initial size | Prevent receive window exhaustion on active streams |\n| Connection receive window < 50% of initial | Generate connection WINDOW_UPDATE | Restore to 75% of initial | Maintain aggregate receive capacity across all streams |\n| Stream closed with positive receive window | No action | N/A | Avoid unnecessary protocol overhead |\n| SETTINGS frame changes initial window size | Adjust all existing stream windows | Difference between old and new initial size | Maintain consistent window semantics |\n\n### Backpressure Handling\n\n**Backpressure handling** manages the queueing and resumption of DATA frames when flow control windows become exhausted. Think of this as a sophisticated traffic management system at a busy intersection: when the main road (connection window) or specific lanes (stream windows) become congested, incoming traffic (DATA frames) must queue in organized waiting areas until capacity becomes available. The system maintains separate queues for different priority levels and implements fair scheduling to prevent high-priority streams from completely starving lower-priority ones.\n\nThe backpressure system maintains multiple data structures to track pending transmissions and coordinate resumption:\n\n| Structure | Type | Purpose | Organization |\n|-----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `streamSendQueues` | `map[uint32][]QueuedFrame` | Per-stream DATA frame queues | FIFO queue per stream ID |\n| `blockedOnConnection` | `[]uint32` | Streams waiting for connection window | Priority-ordered list of stream IDs |\n| `blockedOnStream` | `[]uint32` | Streams waiting for stream window | Simple list of stream IDs |\n| `totalQueuedBytes` | `int64` | Total bytes in all queues | Memory usage tracking |\n| `maxQueueSize` | `int64` | Maximum allowed queued bytes | Prevents unbounded memory growth |\n\nThe `QueuedFrame` structure encapsulates all information needed to resume transmission when windows become available:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `frame` | `*Frame` | The original DATA frame awaiting transmission |\n| `timestamp` | `time.Time` | When the frame was queued for timeout detection |\n| `streamID` | `uint32` | Target stream ID for routing |\n| `originalSize` | `uint32` | Frame size for window accounting |\n| `retryCount` | `int` | Number of transmission attempts |\n\nWhen a DATA frame cannot be transmitted due to insufficient window credit, the backpressure handler follows this queueing procedure:\n\n1. **Memory Limit Check**: Verify that adding this frame won't exceed the maximum queue size limit\n2. **Queue Selection**: Choose the appropriate per-stream queue based on the frame's StreamID\n3. **Frame Preparation**: Create a `QueuedFrame` with current timestamp and retry metadata\n4. **Queue Insertion**: Append the frame to the stream's FIFO queue\n5. **Blocked List Update**: Add the stream ID to the appropriate blocked list (connection or stream)\n6. **Memory Tracking**: Update total queued bytes counter for resource monitoring\n\nThe resumption logic activates whenever window credit becomes available through WINDOW_UPDATE frame processing or stream closure:\n\n| Trigger Event | Resumption Scope | Processing Order | Fairness Mechanism |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Connection WINDOW_UPDATE | All blocked streams | Round-robin across streams | Each stream gets equal connection window allocation |\n| Stream WINDOW_UPDATE | Single specific stream | FIFO within stream queue | Maintains per-stream ordering guarantees |\n| Stream closure | Connection window recovery | Priority-weighted distribution | Closed stream's unused window redistributed by priority |\n| SETTINGS initial window change | All affected streams | Priority order | Higher priority streams processed first |\n\nThe fair scheduling algorithm ensures that no single stream monopolizes available window credit during resumption:\n\n1. **Credit Distribution**: When connection window becomes available, divide credit proportionally among blocked streams based on their priority weights\n2. **Stream Processing**: Process each stream's queue in round-robin fashion, transmitting one frame per stream per round\n3. **Remaining Credit**: After each round, recalculate available credit and repeat until either all queues are empty or credit is exhausted  \n4. **Priority Adjustment**: Higher-weight streams get additional rounds proportional to their weight advantage\n\n> **Decision: Fair Scheduling with Priority Weights**\n> - **Context**: Multiple streams competing for limited connection window credit creates potential for starvation scenarios\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Strict priority (higher priority streams always go first)\n>   2. Pure round-robin (all streams get equal treatment)\n>   3. Weighted fair queuing (priority influences allocation but doesn't eliminate lower priorities)\n> - **Decision**: Weighted fair queuing with configurable priority weights\n> - **Rationale**: Balances responsiveness for high-priority streams while preventing complete starvation of background streams\n> - **Consequences**: More complex scheduling logic but provides predictable performance characteristics for different stream types\n\n### Window Edge Cases\n\n**Window edge cases** address the complex failure modes and boundary conditions that arise in HTTP/2 flow control systems. Think of these as the emergency protocols for unusual traffic situations: what happens when the credit system breaks down due to arithmetic overflow, when streams deadlock waiting for each other's windows, or when network partitions cause window updates to be lost. These edge cases often represent the most challenging debugging scenarios because they involve subtle timing interactions between multiple components.\n\nThe most critical edge cases involve **window arithmetic overflow and underflow** conditions that can occur during normal operation:\n\n| Condition | Detection | Recovery Action | Prevention |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|\n| Window overflow (> 2^31-1) | Check addition result before applying | Send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR and close connection | Validate WINDOW_UPDATE increments |\n| Window underflow (< 0) | Check subtraction result before applying | Send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR for stream/connection | Track pending DATA frame sizes accurately |\n| Negative WINDOW_UPDATE | Frame validation during parsing | Send PROTOCOL_ERROR and close connection | Validate increment field is positive |\n| Zero-byte WINDOW_UPDATE | Frame validation during parsing | Send PROTOCOL_ERROR and close connection | Reject WINDOW_UPDATE frames with zero increment |\n\n**Deadlock scenarios** represent particularly dangerous edge cases where circular dependencies between stream and connection windows create unresolvable blocking conditions:\n\n> **Critical Deadlock Pattern**: Stream A and Stream B both have exhausted connection window credit but positive stream window credit. Each stream's application layer continues generating data, filling their respective queues. However, neither can make progress because the connection window remains at zero, and no WINDOW_UPDATE can be sent because the streams themselves are blocked.\n\nThe deadlock prevention system implements several protective mechanisms:\n\n| Deadlock Type | Detection Signal | Prevention Strategy | Recovery Mechanism |\n|---------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Connection window starvation | All streams blocked on connection window | Reserve connection window credit for WINDOW_UPDATE frames | Force-send WINDOW_UPDATE even with zero connection window |\n| Stream priority inversion | High-priority stream blocked while low-priority streams consume window | Priority-based preemption of low-priority queued frames | Redistribute queued frame priority ordering |\n| Circular stream dependencies | Stream dependency graph contains cycles | Dependency graph validation during PRIORITY frame processing | Break cycles by resetting problematic dependency links |\n| Window update loss | Stream remains blocked despite peer claiming to send updates | Timeout-based window refresh requests | Send explicit WINDOW_UPDATE request frames |\n\n**Memory exhaustion** during backpressure handling creates another class of critical edge cases:\n\nThe system implements aggressive memory management when approaching queue size limits:\n\n1. **Early Warning Thresholds**: When total queued bytes exceed 75% of maximum, begin selective frame dropping for lowest-priority streams\n2. **Emergency Shedding**: When approaching 90% of maximum, implement tail-drop for new frames on already-queued streams  \n3. **Priority-Based Eviction**: When at 100% capacity, evict lowest-priority queued frames to make room for higher-priority ones\n4. **Connection Termination**: If memory pressure continues despite aggressive shedding, send GOAWAY and terminate connection\n\n**Clock skew and timing issues** can cause subtle flow control misbehavior in distributed deployments:\n\n| Timing Issue | Symptoms | Root Cause | Mitigation |\n|--------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Delayed WINDOW_UPDATE processing | Streams remain blocked despite sufficient window | WINDOW_UPDATE frames queued behind large DATA frames | Prioritize WINDOW_UPDATE frames in transmission queue |\n| Premature timeout | Streams reset before WINDOW_UPDATE arrives | Network latency exceeds configured timeout | Implement adaptive timeout based on measured RTT |\n| Window update storms | Rapid bursts of WINDOW_UPDATE frames | Receiver generating updates faster than sender can process | Rate-limit WINDOW_UPDATE generation and batch updates |\n| Stale window state | Window tracking becomes inconsistent | Lost or reordered frames cause accounting errors | Implement periodic window state synchronization |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Single-Level Window Accounting**\nMany developers implement only stream-level flow control and ignore connection-level windows, assuming that controlling individual streams provides sufficient protection. This creates a classic \"tragedy of the commons\" scenario where each stream appears well-behaved individually, but their aggregate behavior overwhelms the connection's capacity. The result is receiver buffer exhaustion, TCP-level backpressure, and cascading performance degradation across all streams. **Fix**: Always implement dual-level accounting where DATA frame transmission requires credit from both stream and connection windows.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Arithmetic Overflow Ignored**\nWindow update arithmetic can easily overflow the 32-bit signed integer range, especially in high-throughput scenarios or when malicious peers send large WINDOW_UPDATE increments. Unchecked overflow can wrap the window size to negative values, causing immediate flow control violations and connection termination. **Fix**: Validate that current_window + update_increment ≤ 2^31-1 before applying any WINDOW_UPDATE, and send FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if the check fails.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: WINDOW_UPDATE Frame Blocking**\nA subtle deadlock occurs when WINDOW_UPDATE frames themselves become blocked by flow control windows. Since WINDOW_UPDATE frames are not subject to flow control, they must be transmitted even when DATA frame transmission is blocked. Some implementations incorrectly queue WINDOW_UPDATE frames behind DATA frames, creating unresolvable deadlocks. **Fix**: Always prioritize WINDOW_UPDATE frame transmission and send them immediately regardless of connection window state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Unbounded Queuing**\nWhen implementing backpressure queuing, developers often create unbounded queues that grow without limit during sustained window exhaustion. This can cause memory exhaustion and process crashes under load. **Fix**: Implement strict memory limits for queued frames and use priority-based eviction when approaching limits.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream Closure Window Handling**\nWhen streams close, their unused window credit should be made available to other streams, but many implementations simply discard this credit. This wastes connection-level window capacity and reduces overall throughput. **Fix**: When a stream transitions to closed state, redistribute its unused window credit proportionally among remaining active streams.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe flow control implementation requires sophisticated coordination between multiple components while maintaining thread safety and performance under

**Milestone(s):** This section synthesizes concepts from all milestones (1-4) by demonstrating how the Binary Framing Engine (Milestone 1), HPACK Compression Engine (Milestone 2), Stream Management (Milestone 3), and Flow Control (Milestone 4) work together during actual HTTP/2 request processing, frame routing, and header decompression operations.\n\nThink of an HTTP/2 server as a sophisticated air traffic control system managing multiple concurrent flights (streams) over a single runway (TCP connection). Just as air traffic control receives flight plans, coordinates takeoffs and landings, and manages airspace capacity, our HTTP/2 server receives binary frames, coordinates stream multiplexing, and manages flow control windows. The key insight is that unlike HTTP/1.1's sequential processing (one plane at a time), HTTP/2 enables true multiplexing where multiple conversations happen simultaneously without head-of-line blocking.\n\nThis section explores the intricate dance between our four core engines as they collaborate to process HTTP/2 requests. We'll trace the journey of a frame from its arrival as raw bytes through binary parsing, stream routing, header decompression, and response generation. Understanding these interactions is crucial because HTTP/2's power comes not from individual components but from their seamless orchestration.\n\n![Request Processing Sequence](./diagrams/request-processing-flow.svg)\n\n### Request Processing Flow\n\nThe request processing flow represents the end-to-end journey from frame reception to HTTP response generation. Think of this as a factory assembly line where each station (component) performs specialized work before passing the product to the next station. However, unlike a traditional assembly line, our HTTP/2 factory processes multiple product lines (streams) simultaneously, with sophisticated routing and quality control at each stage.\n\nThe complexity lies in maintaining state consistency across components while handling the inherent asynchrony of multiplexed streams. Each frame arriving on the connection could belong to any active stream, carry different types of data (headers, payload, control information), and trigger cascading effects throughout the system.\n\n#### Frame Reception and Initial Processing\n\nThe journey begins when raw bytes arrive on the TCP connection. The Connection Handler acts as the factory's receiving dock, accepting delivery trucks (TCP segments) and sorting their contents into the appropriate processing queues. This initial stage must be extremely efficient because it directly impacts the server's ability to handle high connection counts.\n\nThe Connection Handler maintains a persistent read loop that continuously monitors the TCP socket for incoming data. When bytes arrive, the handler immediately invokes the Binary Framing Engine's `ParseFrame` method. This creates our first critical interaction point where transport-layer concerns meet protocol-layer parsing.\n\n| Step | Component | Action | State Changes | Error Conditions |\n|------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------------|\n| 1 | Connection Handler | Read bytes from TCP socket | Update connection read buffer | Network errors, connection closure |\n| 2 | Binary Framing Engine | Parse 9-byte frame header | Extract length, type, flags, stream ID | Malformed header, oversized frame |\n| 3 | Binary Framing Engine | Validate frame structure | Check reserved bits, length limits | Protocol violations, invalid frame types |\n| 4 | Binary Framing Engine | Read frame payload | Extract payload bytes based on length | Incomplete reads, payload corruption |\n| 5 | Frame Router | Determine destination component | Route based on frame type and stream ID | Invalid stream ID, closed streams |\n\n> **Critical Insight:** Frame parsing must be atomic and non-blocking. If the Binary Framing Engine encounters an incomplete frame (not enough bytes available), it must preserve the partial state and resume parsing when more data arrives, without blocking other streams on the connection.\n\nThe Binary Framing Engine performs immediate validation of the parsed frame, checking that reserved bits are zero, the frame length doesn't exceed `MaxFrameSize`, and the frame type is recognized. This validation acts as a firewall protecting downstream components from malformed data that could cause crashes or security vulnerabilities.\n\n#### Stream Identification and Routing\n\nOnce a valid frame is parsed, the Frame Router must determine which component should handle it. This routing decision depends on both the frame type and the stream ID. Think of the Frame Router as a sophisticated mail sorting facility that must deliver each piece of mail to the correct department based on both the address and the type of correspondence.\n\nThe routing logic follows a hierarchical decision tree. Connection-level frames (stream ID 0) such as `SETTINGS`, `PING`, and `GOAWAY` are handled directly by the Connection Handler. Stream-specific frames are routed to the appropriate stream handler within the Stream Manager. However, this seemingly simple routing masks significant complexity in edge case handling.\n\n> **Decision: Stream ID Validation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Invalid or closed stream IDs require different error responses than valid streams\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Validate before routing 2) Let stream handlers validate 3) Hybrid validation\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid validation with router checking basic validity and stream handlers checking state-specific rules\n> - **Rationale**: Balances performance (early rejection of obviously invalid frames) with flexibility (stream handlers understand their own state)\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful coordination between router and stream managers to avoid duplicate validation overhead\n\n| Frame Type | Stream ID | Routing Destination | Validation Requirements |\n|------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| `SETTINGS` | 0 | Connection Handler | Must be connection-level, ACK flag validation |\n| `HEADERS` | > 0 | Stream Manager | Stream must exist or be creatable |\n| `DATA` | > 0 | Stream Manager | Stream must be in open or half-closed-remote state |\n| `WINDOW_UPDATE` | 0 or > 0 | Flow Controller | Window increment must be non-zero |\n| `RST_STREAM` | > 0 | Stream Manager | Stream must exist (may be in any state) |\n| `PING` | 0 | Connection Handler | Payload must be exactly 8 bytes |\n\nThe Stream Manager maintains a registry of active streams using a map from stream ID to `Stream` objects. When a frame arrives for a specific stream, the router performs a lookup in this registry. If the stream exists, the frame is dispatched to the stream's handler. If the stream doesn't exist but the frame type is `HEADERS` with appropriate flags, a new stream may be created.\n\n#### Header Processing and HPACK Decompression\n\nWhen `HEADERS` frames arrive at the Stream Manager, they trigger one of the most complex interaction sequences in the entire system. Header frames don't just carry HTTP headers—they carry HPACK-compressed header blocks that must be decompressed using connection-shared state in the HPACK Compression Engine.\n\nThink of HPACK decompression as a conversation between old friends who share inside jokes and shorthand references. The HPACK tables act as this shared context, allowing headers to be referenced by index numbers rather than spelling out full header names and values. However, this shared state creates a critical dependency: header frames for different streams must be processed sequentially to maintain table consistency, even though the streams themselves are independent.\n\nThe Stream Manager coordinates this by maintaining a header decompression queue. When `HEADERS` frames arrive (including potential `CONTINUATION` frames), they're queued for sequential processing by the HPACK Compression Engine. This ensures that dynamic table updates from one stream's headers are visible to subsequent streams while preventing race conditions that could corrupt the shared tables.\n\n| Decompression Step | Component Interaction | State Updates | Error Handling |\n|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1. Frame Queuing | Stream Manager → HPACK Engine | Add to decompression queue | Queue overflow, memory limits |\n| 2. Table Lookup | HPACK Engine internal | Access static/dynamic tables | Invalid index references |\n| 3. Huffman Decoding | HPACK Engine internal | Decode compressed strings | Malformed Huffman sequences |\n| 4. Dynamic Table Update | HPACK Engine internal | Add new entries, evict old ones | Table size violations |\n| 5. Header Reconstruction | HPACK Engine → Stream Manager | Return decoded header list | Incomplete header blocks |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: CONTINUATION Frame Handling**\nA common mistake is treating each `HEADERS` frame as complete. In reality, large header blocks may span multiple frames, with intermediate `CONTINUATION` frames carrying additional compressed data. The Stream Manager must buffer these fragments and only invoke HPACK decompression once the complete header block (indicated by the `FlagEndHeaders` flag) is received. Attempting to decompress partial header blocks will corrupt the HPACK dynamic table state.\n\n#### Request Assembly and HTTP Semantics\n\nAfter successful header decompression, the Stream Manager must assemble the HTTP request from the decoded headers and any associated `DATA` frames. This step bridges the gap between HTTP/2's binary framing layer and traditional HTTP semantics that application handlers expect.\n\nThe assembly process involves reconstructing pseudo-headers (`:method`, `:path`, `:scheme`, `:authority`) into their HTTP/1.1 equivalents and validating that the request conforms to HTTP semantics. For example, `GET` requests should not have request bodies, while `POST` requests often do.\n\n```\nHTTP/2 Headers:              Assembled HTTP Request:\n:method: GET                 GET /api/users HTTP/1.1\n:path: /api/users           Host: example.com\n:scheme: https              Authorization: Bearer token123\n:authority: example.com\nauthorization: Bearer token123\n```\n\nThe Stream Manager creates an internal HTTP request representation that can be passed to application-level handlers. This abstraction allows existing HTTP/1.1 applications to work with HTTP/2 with minimal modification, since they receive familiar HTTP request objects rather than raw frames and headers.\n\n#### Response Generation and Framing\n\nResponse generation reverses the inbound processing pipeline. Application handlers generate HTTP responses using familiar APIs, which the Stream Manager must convert back into HTTP/2 frames. This involves header compression, frame serialization, and coordination with flow control mechanisms.\n\nThe response processing pipeline demonstrates the bidirectional nature of component interactions. While inbound processing flows from Connection Handler through Frame Router to Stream Manager to application, outbound processing must coordinate between application, Stream Manager, HPACK Engine, Flow Controller, and Binary Framing Engine.\n\n| Response Step | Component Flow | Data Transformation | Synchronization Points |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| 1. Handler Response | Application → Stream Manager | HTTP response object | None |\n| 2. Header Compression | Stream Manager → HPACK Engine | HTTP headers → HPACK block | Sequential compression queue |\n| 3. Header Framing | HPACK Engine → Binary Framing Engine | Compressed headers → HEADERS frame | Frame serialization |\n| 4. Flow Control Check | Stream Manager → Flow Controller | Check send windows | Window availability |\n| 5. Data Framing | Stream Manager → Binary Framing Engine | Response body → DATA frames | Frame size limits |\n| 6. Transmission | Binary Framing Engine → Connection Handler | Frames → TCP bytes | Network buffers |\n\n> **Critical Design Point:** Response generation must coordinate with flow control to avoid violating receiver windows. The Stream Manager cannot simply generate all response frames immediately—it must check both stream-level and connection-level send windows before creating `DATA` frames. If windows are exhausted, the response data must be queued until `WINDOW_UPDATE` frames provide additional send capacity.\n\n![Component Architecture](./diagrams/component-architecture.svg)\n\n### Frame Routing\n\nFrame routing represents the nervous system of our HTTP/2 server, directing incoming frames to appropriate handlers based on type, stream ID, and current connection state. Think of the Frame Router as a sophisticated dispatcher in an emergency response system—it must instantly categorize incoming calls (frames) and route them to the correct department (component) while handling edge cases like wrong numbers, prank calls, and emergencies.\n\nThe routing challenge stems from HTTP/2's multiplexed nature. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where each connection carries a single request-response sequence, HTTP/2 connections interleave frames from multiple streams with control frames that affect the entire connection. The router must maintain awareness of connection state, stream lifecycle, and protocol constraints while making routing decisions at high speed.\n\n#### Routing Decision Tree\n\nThe Frame Router implements a hierarchical decision process that prioritizes correctness over raw performance. Each routing decision involves multiple validation steps that can result in different error responses depending on the specific violation detected.\n\nThe primary routing decision depends on the stream ID field in the frame header. Stream ID zero indicates connection-level frames that affect the entire connection's state or configuration. Non-zero stream IDs indicate frames belonging to specific request-response streams. However, this simple distinction masks considerable complexity in validation and error handling.\n\n| Stream ID | Frame Types | Routing Destination | Validation Requirements |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| 0 | `SETTINGS`, `PING`, `GOAWAY`, `WINDOW_UPDATE` | Connection Handler | Connection-level frame validation |\n| > 0 | `HEADERS`, `DATA`, `RST_STREAM`, `WINDOW_UPDATE`, `PUSH_PROMISE` | Stream Manager | Stream existence and state validation |\n| Invalid | Any | Error Handler | Protocol error response generation |\n\n> **Decision: Routing Table vs. Switch Statement**\n> - **Context**: Frame routing needs to be both fast and maintainable as new frame types are added\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Map-based routing table 2) Switch statement 3) Interface-based polymorphism\n> - **Decision**: Switch statement with validation helper functions\n> - **Rationale**: Go's switch statements compile to efficient jump tables, validation logic can be shared, and adding new frame types is straightforward\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more verbose than a map but significantly faster, with better compile-time error detection\n\nThe router must also validate frame type compatibility with stream ID constraints. For example, `SETTINGS` frames are only valid with stream ID 0, while `DATA` frames are only valid with non-zero stream IDs. Violating these constraints results in connection-level `ProtocolError`s that should terminate the connection.\n\n#### Stream State Awareness\n\nStream routing requires awareness of stream lifecycle state because the same frame type may be valid or invalid depending on the current stream state. The Frame Router maintains a lightweight view of stream states to enable early validation without duplicating the full state machine logic present in individual stream handlers.\n\nThink of this as a bouncer at an exclusive club who knows the membership list and current occupancy but doesn't need to know everyone's personal details. The router knows whether stream 42 exists and its basic state (open, closed, etc.) but delegates detailed state transitions to the Stream Manager.\n\nThe router's stream state cache must be kept synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by the Stream Manager. This synchronization happens through event notifications when streams change state, ensuring the router's cache remains consistent without requiring expensive lookups on every frame.\n\n| Stream State | Valid Frame Types | Router Actions | Invalid Frame Handling |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| `StateIdle` | `HEADERS` (creates stream) | Route to Stream Manager for creation | Send `RST_STREAM` for other types |\n| `StateOpen` | `HEADERS`, `DATA`, `RST_STREAM`, `WINDOW_UPDATE` | Route to existing stream handler | Validate flags and dependencies |\n| `StateClosed` | `WINDOW_UPDATE`, `RST_STREAM` (in some cases) | Limited routing or ignore | Most frames should be ignored |\n| Nonexistent | `HEADERS` (if stream creation allowed) | Route for potential stream creation | `ProtocolError` for most frame types |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream State Synchronization**\nA subtle bug occurs when the router's stream state cache becomes inconsistent with the Stream Manager's authoritative state. This typically happens during rapid stream state transitions where the router continues routing frames to a stream that has just transitioned to closed state. The fix involves using atomic updates and ensuring that state change notifications are processed before routing additional frames for the affected stream.\n\n#### Priority and Dependency Routing\n\nStream priority and dependency information affects routing decisions for `HEADERS` and `DATA` frames. While the router doesn't implement the full priority scheduling algorithm (that's the Flow Controller's responsibility), it must validate priority information and route frames to the appropriate priority queue.\n\nPriority routing introduces ordering constraints that can create head-of-line blocking if not handled carefully. The router must balance respecting priority relationships with avoiding deadlocks where high-priority streams block the processing of control frames needed to make progress.\n\nThe router implements priority-aware routing by maintaining separate queues for different priority levels and ensuring that control frames (like `WINDOW_UPDATE`) are always processed promptly regardless of data frame backlog in priority queues.\n\n#### Error Frame Generation\n\nWhen the router detects protocol violations or invalid frame combinations, it must generate appropriate error responses. The error response type depends on whether the violation affects a specific stream or the entire connection.\n\nStream-level errors result in `RST_STREAM` frames that terminate the offending stream while allowing other streams on the connection to continue. Connection-level errors result in `GOAWAY` frames that initiate connection shutdown, preventing new streams while allowing existing streams to complete gracefully.\n\n| Error Type | Detection Point | Response Frame | Affected Scope |\n|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Invalid stream ID | Stream ID validation | `RST_STREAM` | Single stream |\n| Frame size exceeded | Frame length validation | `GOAWAY` | Entire connection |\n| Invalid frame type | Frame type validation | `RST_STREAM` or `GOAWAY` | Depends on severity |\n| State machine violation | Stream state check | `RST_STREAM` | Single stream |\n| Flow control violation | Window validation | `RST_STREAM` or `GOAWAY` | Depends on window type |\n\nThe router must generate these error frames promptly to maintain protocol compliance, but it must also coordinate with the Flow Controller to ensure error frames don't violate flow control windows. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where flow control violations prevent sending flow control error notifications.\n\n![Multiplexing Visualization](./diagrams/multiplexing-visualization.svg)\n\n### Header Decompression Flow\n\nHeader decompression represents one of the most intricate interaction patterns in the HTTP/2 server because it requires coordination between frame-level processing, connection-shared state, and stream-specific request assembly. Think of HPACK decompression as a sophisticated library system where books (headers) can be referenced by catalog numbers (indices) instead of full titles, but the catalog is shared among all library patrons (streams) and must be updated consistently.\n\nThe complexity stems from HPACK's stateful nature. Unlike simple compression schemes where each block can be decompressed independently, HPACK maintains dynamic tables that evolve as headers are processed. This creates a critical constraint: header blocks from different streams must be decompressed sequentially to maintain table consistency, even though the streams themselves operate independently.\n\n#### Header Block Assembly\n\nBefore decompression can begin, the Stream Manager must assemble complete header blocks from potentially fragmented frames. HTTP/2 allows large header sets to span multiple frames using `HEADERS` followed by `CONTINUATION` frames. The assembly process must handle partial receives, frame ordering, and error recovery while maintaining the sequential processing constraint.\n\nThink of this assembly process as reconstructing a jigsaw puzzle where pieces (frames) arrive out of order, and you can't start working on the next puzzle until the current one is complete. The Stream Manager maintains assembly buffers for each stream that's currently receiving headers, tracking which streams have complete header blocks ready for decompression.\n\n| Assembly Step | Stream Manager Action | Buffer Management | Error Conditions |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1. HEADERS frame arrives | Create assembly buffer for stream | Allocate header fragment buffer | Memory allocation failure |\n| 2. Validate header flags | Check for END_HEADERS flag | Determine if more frames expected | Invalid flag combinations |\n| 3. CONTINUATION frames | Append to assembly buffer | Grow buffer as needed | Buffer size limits exceeded |\n| 4. Complete block detected | Mark buffer ready for decompression | Queue for HPACK processing | Header block too large |\n| 5. Submit to HPACK engine | Transfer assembled block | Clear assembly buffer | HPACK engine queue full |\n\n> **Critical Timing Constraint:** Header block assembly must respect the HTTP/2 specification requirement that `CONTINUATION` frames immediately follow their associated `HEADERS` frame without intervening frames for other streams. The Stream Manager enforces this by tracking the \"continuation expected\" state and rejecting non-continuation frames when a header block is incomplete.\n\nThe assembly process must also handle error recovery when header blocks are malformed or incomplete. If a stream fails to send the expected `CONTINUATION` frames, the assembly buffer eventually times out and the incomplete header block is discarded, generating a stream error.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Exhaustion in Assembly Buffers**\nA malicious client can attempt denial-of-service attacks by starting many header blocks but never completing them with `CONTINUATION` frames. This causes assembly buffers to accumulate indefinitely. The mitigation involves setting strict limits on the number of concurrent incomplete header blocks and the maximum size of any individual assembly buffer, with timeout-based cleanup of abandoned header blocks.\n\n#### Sequential Decompression Processing\n\nOnce header blocks are assembled, they enter a strict sequential processing queue maintained by the HPACK Compression Engine. This queue ensures that dynamic table updates occur in the correct order, maintaining the shared decompression context required for subsequent header blocks.\n\nThe sequential processing creates a potential bottleneck in highly multiplexed scenarios where many streams are sending headers simultaneously. However, this constraint is fundamental to HPACK's design and cannot be eliminated without violating the compression algorithm's requirements.\n\nThe HPACK Compression Engine processes the queue using a single-threaded worker that decompresses header blocks one at a time. Each decompression operation may modify the dynamic table by adding new entries or triggering evictions, so these operations cannot be parallelized without sophisticated synchronization mechanisms that would likely eliminate any performance benefits.\n\n| Queue Operation | HPACK Engine State | Dynamic Table Changes | Completion Notification |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Dequeue header block | Lock decompression context | Potential table modifications | Signal to originating stream |\n| Process HPACK instructions | Update table indices | Add entries, evict old ones | Update compression statistics |\n| Decode Huffman strings | Access Huffman decoder | No table changes | String reconstruction |\n| Validate header semantics | Check HTTP/2 requirements | No table changes | Validation error or success |\n| Return decoded headers | Unlock decompression context | Finalize table state | Stream can proceed with request |\n\n> **Decision: Decompression Queue Implementation**\n> - **Context**: Sequential processing requirement conflicts with high concurrency goals\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Single-threaded queue 2) Connection-specific queues 3) Lock-free algorithms\n> - **Decision**: Single-threaded queue with backpressure signals\n> - **Rationale**: Simplest correct implementation, matches HPACK's inherent sequential requirement, backpressure prevents queue overflow\n> - **Consequences**: Potential bottleneck under high header load, but guaranteed correctness and simpler debugging\n\n#### Dynamic Table Management During Decompression\n\nEach header block decompression potentially modifies the dynamic table through literal header insertions. The HPACK Compression Engine must coordinate these modifications with ongoing compression operations for outbound responses, ensuring that the table state remains consistent for both directions of the connection.\n\nThe dynamic table acts as a circular buffer with FIFO eviction when new entries would exceed the configured table size. During decompression, new entries are added to the beginning of the table, and existing entries are shifted to higher indices. If the table becomes full, entries at the highest indices are evicted to make room.\n\nThis table management must be atomic with respect to the decompression operation. If decompression fails partway through a header block (due to invalid HPACK instructions or Huffman decoding errors), any dynamic table modifications must be rolled back to maintain consistency with the sender's table state.\n\n| Table Operation | Before State | During Processing | After State | Rollback Requirements |\n|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Add literal entry | Current table size: N | Tentative insertion at index 0 | Size: N+1, indices shifted | Remove added entry |\n| Evict old entries | Table at max size | Remove highest indices | Size unchanged, new entry added | Restore evicted entries |\n| Index existing entry | Table unchanged | Lookup by index | Table unchanged | No rollback needed |\n| Huffman decode failure | Partial new entry | Decoder error state | Table unchanged | Discard partial entry |\n\n#### Error Recovery and State Synchronization\n\nHeader decompression errors require careful handling because they can desynchronize the dynamic table state between client and server, potentially corrupting all subsequent header processing on the connection. The HPACK specification requires that certain decompression errors be treated as connection errors rather than stream errors.\n\nWhen the HPACK Compression Engine encounters decompression errors, it must determine whether the error affects only the current stream or potentially corrupts the shared decompression context. Invalid table indices or malformed integer encodings typically indicate connection-level problems that require terminating the connection with a `GOAWAY` frame.\n\nThe error recovery process involves coordinating between the HPACK Compression Engine, Stream Manager, and Connection Handler to ensure that error responses are generated promptly and that no subsequent header processing occurs on a potentially corrupted connection.\n\n> **Critical Recovery Principle:** When in doubt about dynamic table consistency, terminate the connection. The cost of debugging subtle compression state corruption far exceeds the cost of occasional false-positive connection terminations. Recovery mechanisms should err on the side of caution to maintain overall system stability.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance provides concrete Go code for implementing the interaction patterns described in the design. The code focuses on the coordination mechanisms between components rather than the internal implementation of individual engines, which are covered in their respective sections.\n\n#### Technology

to reduce system call overhead\n- Implement frame routing with Go's switch statement, which compiles to efficient jump tables  \n- Use `sync.RWMutex` for stream state maps since lookups are much more frequent than updates\n- Channel-based coordination works well for header decompression queues—use buffered channels to prevent blocking\n- Consider `context.Context` for cancellation throughout the request processing pipeline\n- Use `sync.WaitGroup` to coordinate graceful shutdown of processing goroutines\n- Implement backpressure using channel capacity limits and select statements with default cases\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**After implementing request processing flow:**\n- Run `go test ./internal/interactions/ -v` to verify component coordination\n- Test with `curl --http2` requests, observing frame sequences in logs\n- Verify that multiplexed requests (multiple concurrent curl commands) interleave properly\n- Expected behavior: Multiple requests should complete without head-of-line blocking\n\n**After implementing frame routing:**\n- Use Wireshark to capture HTTP/2 traffic and verify frame routing decisions\n- Test invalid frame sequences (wrong stream IDs, invalid state transitions)\n- Expected behavior: Invalid frames should generate appropriate RST_STREAM or GOAWAY responses\n- Signs of problems: Crashes on malformed frames, incorrect error response types\n\n**After implementing header decompression flow:**  \n- Test large header sets that require CONTINUATION frames\n- Verify HPACK table consistency by sending repeated headers that should compress well\n- Expected behavior: Header compression ratios should improve over time as dynamic table fills\n- Signs of problems: Header decompression errors, corrupted request data, table size issues\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Requests hang indefinitely | Header assembly waiting for

frame validation errors (Milestone 1), HPACK decompression errors (Milestone 2), stream state machine violations (Milestone 3), and flow control window errors (Milestone 4). It establishes comprehensive error detection, classification, and recovery strategies essential for a production-grade HTTP/2 server.\n\nThink of error handling in HTTP/2 as a sophisticated immune system for the protocol. Just like a biological immune system must distinguish between harmless variations and genuine threats, our HTTP/2 server must differentiate between recoverable stream-level errors and fatal connection-level errors. The protocol provides specific mechanisms—like antibodies in the form of `RST_STREAM` frames for targeted stream termination and `GOAWAY` frames for graceful connection shutdown. Understanding when to apply localized treatment versus systemic intervention determines whether our server gracefully handles edge cases or crashes under pressure.\n\nThe complexity of HTTP/2 error handling stems from the protocol's multiplexed nature. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where each connection serves a single request-response pair, HTTP/2 connections simultaneously manage dozens of independent streams. A single malformed frame could indicate a bug in one client request (requiring only stream-level recovery) or a fundamental protocol violation that corrupts the entire connection state (requiring connection-level shutdown). The server must make these classification decisions in real-time while maintaining the integrity of unaffected streams.\n\n![Error Handling and Recovery Flow](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\n### Protocol Errors\n\n**Protocol errors** represent violations of the HTTP/2 specification that require immediate detection and appropriate response. These errors range from malformed binary frames that cannot be parsed to logical violations like sending a `DATA` frame on a closed stream. The server's response must be proportional—isolating the damage to the affected stream when possible, or protecting the entire connection when the violation threatens overall protocol integrity.\n\nThe foundation of protocol error handling lies in comprehensive **validation layers** that examine frames at multiple levels. Frame-level validation ensures binary format compliance, while semantic validation checks protocol state consistency. This multi-layered approach prevents malformed data from propagating through the system and corrupting internal state machines.\n\n| Error Category | Scope | Detection Point | Recovery Action |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Frame Format Violations | Connection | Frame parsing | Send `GOAWAY` with `PROTOCOL_ERROR` |\n| Invalid Frame Type | Stream | Frame routing | Send `RST_STREAM` with `PROTOCOL_ERROR` |\n| State Machine Violations | Stream | Stream manager | Send `RST_STREAM` with appropriate code |\n| Flow Control Violations | Stream/Connection | Window validation | Send `RST_STREAM` or `GOAWAY` with `FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR` |\n| HPACK Decompression Failures | Connection | Header decompression | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n| Resource Limit Exceeded | Connection | Resource tracking | Send `GOAWAY` with `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` |\n\n> **Decision: Error Scope Classification Strategy**\n> - **Context**: HTTP/2 errors can affect individual streams or entire connections, requiring different recovery mechanisms\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Always terminate connection on any error (simple but wasteful)\n>   - Always attempt stream-level recovery (complex, risk of connection corruption)\n>   - Classify errors by impact scope and respond appropriately (balanced approach)\n> - **Decision**: Implement error classification that maps violations to minimum necessary scope\n> - **Rationale**: Maximizes connection reuse while preventing error propagation; follows RFC 7540 guidance on error handling proportionality\n> - **Consequences**: Requires sophisticated error detection logic but improves server resilience and client experience\n\nThe `ProtocolError` type encapsulates all HTTP/2 specification violations with precise error codes that map to the standard error codes defined in RFC 7540. Each error includes contextual information that helps with debugging and appropriate response generation.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Code | ErrorCode | RFC 7540 error code indicating violation type |\n| Message | string | Human-readable description with context |\n| StreamID | uint32 | Affected stream ID, or 0 for connection errors |\n| FrameType | uint8 | Frame type that triggered the error |\n| Severity | ErrorSeverity | Classification of error impact scope |\n\n**Frame format validation** represents the first line of defense against protocol violations. The parser must validate every aspect of the 9-byte frame header before attempting to process the payload. Length field validation prevents buffer overflows, while reserved bit checking ensures future protocol compatibility.\n\nThe frame validation algorithm follows these steps:\n\n1. **Header Structure Validation**: Verify the 9-byte header contains valid length, type, and flags combinations according to the frame type specification\n2. **Length Boundary Checking**: Ensure frame length does not exceed negotiated maximum frame size and fits within available buffer space\n3. **Reserved Bit Validation**: Check that all reserved bits in flags and stream ID fields are set to zero as required by the specification\n4. **Frame Type Recognition**: Verify the frame type is known and supported, rejecting unknown types with appropriate error codes\n5. **Flag Consistency Checking**: Validate that flags are appropriate for the frame type and current stream state\n6. **Stream ID Validation**: Ensure stream ID follows odd/even allocation rules and does not exceed the maximum stream ID space\n7. **Payload Length Verification**: For frame types with fixed payload sizes, verify the length field matches expected payload size\n\n> The critical insight for frame validation is that **fail-fast detection** at the parsing boundary prevents corrupted data from entering the system's state machines. Once a frame passes validation, downstream components can assume structural integrity and focus on semantic processing.\n\n**HPACK decompression errors** require special consideration because header compression failures affect the entire connection's header compression context. Unlike other stream-level errors, HPACK failures corrupt the dynamic table state that all subsequent header blocks depend on. The server must immediately terminate the connection to prevent header decompression cascading failures.\n\n| HPACK Error Type | Cause | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Invalid Static Table Index | Index > 61 | Bounds checking during lookup | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n| Dynamic Table Overflow | Entry size exceeds table capacity | Size calculation during insertion | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n| Huffman Decoding Failure | Invalid symbol sequence or padding | Symbol validation during decode | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n| Integer Encoding Violation | Too many continuation bytes | Byte count during variable decode | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n| String Length Mismatch | Declared length != actual bytes | Length tracking during string decode | Send `GOAWAY` with `COMPRESSION_ERROR` |\n\n**Stream state machine violations** occur when frames arrive that are invalid for the current stream state. For example, receiving a `HEADERS` frame on a stream already in the closed state violates the protocol specification. These errors typically indicate client bugs or race conditions in stream lifecycle management.\n\nThe validation process for stream state transitions involves:\n\n1. **Current State Lookup**: Retrieve the stream's current state from the stream manager's state cache\n2. **Frame Type Compatibility**: Check if the incoming frame type is valid for the current stream state according to RFC 7540 state transition rules\n3. **Flag Validation**: Verify frame flags are appropriate for both the frame type and current stream state (e.g., `END_STREAM` flag validity)\n4. **Transition Atomicity**: Ensure state transitions complete atomically to prevent race conditions between concurrent frame processing\n5. **Error Code Selection**: Choose the most specific error code that describes the violation (e.g., `STREAM_CLOSED` vs. `PROTOCOL_ERROR`)\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Condition in Stream State Validation**\nA common bug occurs when stream state validation and state transitions are not properly synchronized. If one goroutine checks that a stream is open and begins processing a frame, while another goroutine concurrently closes that stream, the first goroutine may update an already-closed stream. This leads to inconsistent state and potential crashes. Always use proper locking or atomic operations when checking and updating stream state, and re-validate state after acquiring locks but before making changes.\n\n### Connection Errors\n\n**Connection errors** represent failures that compromise the integrity of the entire HTTP/2 connection and require termination of all multiplexed streams. These errors typically stem from fundamental protocol violations, resource exhaustion, or implementation bugs that corrupt shared connection state. The server handles connection errors through the `GOAWAY` frame mechanism, which provides graceful connection termination while allowing in-flight requests to complete.\n\nThink of connection error handling as performing emergency surgery on a complex system. When a critical component fails, the surgeon must quickly assess whether the problem can be isolated (stream-level error) or whether it threatens the entire patient's stability (connection-level error). The `GOAWAY` frame serves as the anesthesia—gracefully shutting down the system while ensuring no ongoing operations are left in an undefined state.\n\nThe `GOAWAY` frame provides a standardized mechanism for connection termination that includes diagnostic information to help clients understand the failure cause. Unlike abrupt connection closure, `GOAWAY` allows proper cleanup of resources and provides clear error signaling to the peer.\n\n| GOAWAY Field | Purpose | Example Values |\n|---|---|---|\n| Last Stream ID | Highest stream ID server processed | Even numbers for server errors |\n| Error Code | Specific failure reason | `PROTOCOL_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` |\n| Debug Data | Additional diagnostic information | UTF-8 error description |\n\n**Connection-level resource exhaustion** represents one of the most common categories of connection errors. When clients exceed negotiated limits for concurrent streams, frame sizes, or header table sizes, the server must protect itself through connection termination. The `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` error code specifically addresses aggressive client behavior.\n\nThe resource exhaustion detection algorithm:\n\n1. **Concurrent Stream Monitoring**: Track active stream count against the `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` setting, rejecting new streams when the limit is reached\n2. **Frame Size Validation**: Verify every incoming frame does not exceed the negotiated `MAX_FRAME_SIZE` setting before attempting to read the payload\n3. **Header List Size Checking**: Monitor accumulated header block size during CONTINUATION frame assembly to prevent memory exhaustion attacks\n4. **Dynamic Table Size Enforcement**: Ensure HPACK dynamic table size updates do not exceed the `HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` setting\n5. **Connection Window Monitoring**: Track connection-level flow control window to detect aggressive sending patterns that ignore flow control\n6. **Rate Limiting Assessment**: Monitor frame arrival rates to detect denial-of-service attempts through frame flooding\n\n> **Decision: Graceful vs Immediate Connection Termination**\n> - **Context**: When connection errors occur, the server can either close the TCP connection immediately or send GOAWAY first\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Immediate TCP close (fast but provides no diagnostic info)\n>   - GOAWAY then wait for client closure (proper but may delay recovery)\n>   - GOAWAY with timeout fallback (balanced approach)\n> - **Decision**: Send GOAWAY frame with 5-second timeout before forcing TCP connection closure\n> - **Rationale**: Provides diagnostic information to well-behaved clients while preventing resource leaks from misbehaving clients\n> - **Consequences**: Requires connection timeout management but improves debuggability and client experience\n\n**GOAWAY frame generation** must include sufficient diagnostic information to help clients identify and fix the underlying problem. The debug data field should contain actionable information rather than generic error messages.\n\n| Error Scenario | Error Code | Debug Data Content |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Unknown frame type received | `PROTOCOL_ERROR` | \"Unknown frame type 0x0F received\" |\n| Exceeded concurrent streams | `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` | \"Exceeded MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit of 100\" |\n| HPACK decompression failure | `COMPRESSION_ERROR` | \"Invalid Huffman sequence in header block\" |\n| Frame size too large | `FRAME_SIZE_ERROR` | \"Frame size 32768 exceeds limit 16384\" |\n| Implementation bug detected | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | \"Unexpected nil pointer in stream manager\" |\n\n**Connection error recovery workflow** ensures proper cleanup of all connection resources while maintaining system stability:\n\n1. **Error Detection and Classification**: Identify the specific violation and map it to the appropriate HTTP/2 error code\n2. **Active Stream Enumeration**: Collect all streams currently active on the connection to determine the last processed stream ID\n3. **GOAWAY Frame Construction**: Build GOAWAY frame with appropriate error code, last stream ID, and diagnostic debug data\n4. **Frame Transmission**: Send GOAWAY frame to the client with proper error signaling\n5. **Resource Cleanup Scheduling**: Schedule cleanup of all connection-associated resources (streams, buffers, timers)\n6. **Graceful Shutdown Timer**: Start timer to allow orderly connection closure before forcing TCP socket closure\n7. **Connection State Transition**: Mark connection as closing to prevent new frame processing while cleanup proceeds\n8. **Final Resource Release**: Release all memory, close file descriptors, and remove connection from active connection pool\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Leaks During Error Cleanup**\nWhen connection errors occur, it's easy to forget to clean up all associated resources, leading to memory leaks and file descriptor exhaustion. Each connection may have dozens of active streams, each with buffers, timers, and state machines. Ensure error cleanup code traverses all active streams and releases their resources. Use defer statements or finally blocks to guarantee cleanup even if the error handling code itself panics.\n\n### Stream Errors\n\n**Stream errors** represent failures that affect individual streams while leaving the overall connection intact. These errors typically result from application-level problems, client bugs, or resource constraints that can be isolated to specific request-response sequences. The server handles stream errors through `RST_STREAM` frames, which immediately terminate the affected stream without disrupting other multiplexed streams on the same connection.\n\nThe beauty of stream-level error handling lies in its **fault isolation**. When one client request contains malformed data or violates stream-specific constraints, the server can terminate just that stream while allowing dozens of other concurrent requests to proceed normally. This isolation property makes HTTP/2 servers far more resilient than HTTP/1.1 servers, where connection errors terminate all pending requests.\n\nStream error detection occurs at multiple points in the request processing pipeline. The frame router validates stream state consistency, the flow control system detects window violations, and application handlers identify semantic errors in request content.\n\n| Error Detection Point | Error Types Detected | Recovery Mechanism |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Frame routing | Invalid frame for stream state | `RST_STREAM` with state-specific error |\n| Flow control validation | Window underflow/overflow | `RST_STREAM` with `FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR` |\n| Header validation | Malformed HTTP semantics | `RST_STREAM` with `PROTOCOL_ERROR` |\n| Application processing | Request timeout, resource limits | `RST_STREAM` with `CANCEL` or `REFUSED_STREAM` |\n| Stream lifecycle | Premature stream closure | `RST_STREAM` with `STREAM_CLOSED` |\n\n**RST_STREAM frame generation** requires careful selection of the error code to provide meaningful diagnostic information. The error code should precisely describe the failure reason to help clients debug their implementations.\n\n| Stream Error Code | Typical Causes | When to Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| `PROTOCOL_ERROR` | Invalid frame sequence, malformed headers | General protocol violations |\n| `CANCEL` | Client or server cancellation | Voluntary termination |\n| `REFUSED_STREAM` | Server overload, resource unavailable | Temporary rejection |\n| `STREAM_CLOSED` | Frame sent on closed stream | State machine violations |\n| `FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR` | Window violations | Credit system abuse |\n\n**Stream state machine error handling** ensures that stream lifecycle violations are detected and handled appropriately. The state machine must validate every frame against the current stream state and generate appropriate errors for invalid transitions.\n\nThe stream error validation algorithm:\n\n1. **Stream Existence Verification**: Check if the stream ID exists in the stream manager's active stream table\n2. **State Compatibility Check**: Verify the incoming frame type is valid for the stream's current state\n3. **Flag Consistency Validation**: Ensure frame flags are appropriate for both frame type and stream state\n4. **Flow Control Window Check**: Validate that DATA frames do not exceed available send window\n5. **Header Block Completeness**: Verify HEADERS/CONTINUATION sequences are properly terminated with END_HEADERS flag\n6. **Stream Priority Validation**: Check that priority dependencies do not create cycles in the dependency tree\n7. **Error Code Selection**: Choose the most specific error code that describes the detected violation\n\n> The key principle in stream error handling is **minimizing blast radius**. Each error should affect the smallest possible scope while maintaining protocol integrity. Stream errors should never cascade to affect other streams unless the error indicates fundamental connection corruption.\n\n**Stream resource management errors** occur when individual streams exceed their allocated resources or violate per-stream constraints. These errors help prevent individual streams from consuming excessive server resources.\n\n| Resource Type | Limit | Error Detection | Recovery Action |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Header block size | Configurable limit (8KB default) | During CONTINUATION assembly | `RST_STREAM` with `REFUSED_STREAM` |\n| Request body size | Application-defined limit | During DATA frame accumulation | `RST_STREAM` with `CANCEL` |\n| Stream lifetime | Timeout configuration | Timer expiration | `RST_STREAM` with `CANCEL` |\n| Priority updates | Rate limiting | Update frequency tracking | `RST_STREAM` with `ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM` |\n\n**Stream cleanup workflow** ensures that terminated streams release all associated resources and update connection state appropriately:\n\n1. **Stream State Transition**: Move stream to closed state and prevent further frame processing\n2. **Buffer Release**: Free any accumulated header blocks, DATA frame buffers, or assembly state\n3. **Timer Cancellation**: Cancel any active timers associated with the stream (timeouts, keep-alive)\n4. **Flow Control Update**: Release any reserved flow control window space back to connection pool\n5. **Priority Tree Update**: Remove stream from priority dependency tree and update dependent streams\n6. **Statistics Update**: Record stream completion statistics and error metrics for monitoring\n7. **Memory Reclamation**: Remove stream entry from active stream maps and release memory\n8. **Connection Counter Update**: Decrement active stream count to allow new stream creation\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream Error Escalation**\nA subtle bug occurs when stream-level errors are incorrectly escalated to connection errors. For example, if stream state validation code panics due to a nil pointer, the panic might be caught at the connection level and treated as a connection error, causing unnecessary connection termination. Ensure stream-level error handling code is robust and that panics are caught and converted to appropriate stream errors rather than propagating up to connection handlers.\n\n**Error isolation verification** ensures that stream errors do not affect other streams on the same connection. The server must validate that stream error handling preserves connection state integrity.\n\nThe isolation verification checklist:\n\n1. **Connection State Preservation**: Verify that stream errors do not modify connection-level settings or shared state\n2. **HPACK Table Integrity**: Ensure stream errors do not corrupt the shared dynamic table used for header compression\n3. **Flow Control Isolation**: Confirm that stream window errors do not affect connection-level flow control windows\n4. **Frame Processing Continuity**: Validate that other streams continue processing frames normally after a stream error\n5. **Resource Pool Integrity**: Check that stream cleanup properly returns resources to shared pools\n6. **Statistics Isolation**: Ensure stream error metrics do not interfere with connection-level health monitoring\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling implementation requires sophisticated coordination between all HTTP/2 server components. The error system must detect violations at the appropriate scope, generate standardized error responses, and ensure proper resource cleanup without affecting unrelated streams.\n\n**A.

Each milestone requires both isolated unit testing and integrated system validation to ensure protocol compliance and robustness.\n\nThink of testing an HTTP/2 server like quality assurance for a complex air traffic control system. Just as air traffic control must safely coordinate hundreds of simultaneous aircraft arrivals and departures, your HTTP/2 server must manage dozens of concurrent streams over a single connection while maintaining perfect protocol compliance. The testing strategy mirrors this complexity: you need to test individual components in isolation (like testing a single radar unit), validate component interactions (like testing handoff procedures between controllers), and verify the entire system under realistic load (like testing the airport during peak traffic). Each layer of testing catches different classes of bugs, from basic parsing errors to subtle race conditions that only emerge under concurrent load.\n\nThe HTTP/2 protocol's binary nature and complex state machines create unique testing challenges compared to text-based HTTP/1.1. Binary framing requires bit-level accuracy, HPACK compression involves stateful table management, stream multiplexing creates intricate concurrency scenarios, and flow control introduces credit-based backpressure handling. A comprehensive testing strategy must address each of these complexities systematically, building confidence layer by layer from individual frame parsing up to full client integration.\n\n### Unit Testing\n\nUnit testing forms the foundation of HTTP/2 server validation by isolating each component and verifying its behavior under controlled conditions. Unlike integration testing, unit tests provide immediate feedback during development, precise failure localization, and comprehensive edge case coverage. Each major component—Binary Framing Engine, HPACK Compression Engine, Stream Management, and Flow Control—requires specialized testing approaches that address their unique characteristics and failure modes.\n\n#### Binary Framing Engine Unit Tests\n\nThe Binary Framing Engine requires exhaustive testing of frame parsing, serialization, and validation logic. Think of frame parsing like a document scanner that must correctly interpret various document formats—it needs to handle perfect documents flawlessly, detect corruption in damaged documents, and gracefully reject invalid formats. The binary nature of HTTP/2 frames means that single-bit errors can cause catastrophic parsing failures, making comprehensive test coverage essential.\n\nFrame parsing tests must validate every aspect of the 9-byte frame header structure. The `ParseFrame` function processes the header fields in network byte order, extracting the 24-bit length, 8-bit type, 8-bit flags, and 32-bit stream ID. Test cases should cover the full range of valid values, boundary conditions, and invalid combinations.\n\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Expected Behavior | Validation Points |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Header Parsing | Valid frames with all frame types | Successful parsing with correct field extraction | Length, type, flags, stream ID accuracy |\n| Boundary Conditions | Maximum frame size (16777215 bytes) | Successful parsing without overflow | Payload length validation |\n| Invalid Lengths | Frame length exceeding maximum | Parse error with `ErrorCodeFrameSizeError` | Early validation before payload read |\n| Reserved Bits | Stream ID with reserved bit set | Parse error with `ErrorCodeProtocolError` | Bit masking validation |\n| Endianness | Multi-byte fields in network order | Correct value interpretation | Big-endian conversion verification |\n\nFrame type-specific parsing requires dedicated test suites for each frame type. `FrameTypeDATA` frames need testing with various payload sizes and flag combinations, particularly the `FlagEndStream` flag. `FrameTypeHEADERS` frames require validation of header block fragments and the `FlagEndHeaders` flag. `FrameTypeSETTINGS` frames must handle parameter parsing and the ACK flag correctly.\n\n```\nTest: DATA Frame Parsing\nInput: 9-byte header (length=1024, type=0x0, flags=0x1, stream=5) + 1024-byte payload\nExpected: Frame{Length: 1024, Type: FrameTypeDATA, Flags: FlagEndStream, StreamID: 5, Payload: [1024]byte}\nValidation: len(frame.Payload) == frame.Length, frame.Flags&FlagEndStream != 0\n```\n\nFrame serialization testing ensures that `SerializeFrame` produces valid wire format output that can be parsed by other HTTP/2 implementations. The serialization process must convert internal frame structures back to network byte order while preserving all header fields and payload data. Round-trip tests verify that parsing followed by serialization produces identical output.\n\n| Serialization Test | Input Frame | Expected Wire Format | Validation Method |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| DATA Frame | Frame with 512-byte payload | 9-byte header + 512 payload bytes | Byte-by-byte comparison |\n| Empty SETTINGS | Settings frame with no parameters | 9-byte header with zero length | Length field verification |\n| HEADERS Frame | Headers with END_HEADERS flag | Correct flag encoding in byte 4 | Bit pattern validation |\n| Large Frame | Frame at maximum size limit | Complete serialization without truncation | Total size verification |\n\nFrame validation testing ensures the `ValidateFrame` function correctly identifies protocol violations and implementation limits. Validation occurs after parsing but before frame processing, catching malformed frames that could compromise server stability. The validation logic must check frame type constraints, flag combinations, and stream ID restrictions.\n\n**Validation Error Test Cases:**\n\n1. **Frame Size Violations**: Frames exceeding `MaxFrameSize` should trigger `ErrorCodeFrameSizeError`\n2. **Invalid Frame Types**: Unknown frame types should be ignored per RFC 7540\n3. **Stream ID Constraints**: Control frames (SETTINGS, PING, GOAWAY) on non-zero streams should fail\n4. **Flag Misuse**: Invalid flag combinations like `FlagEndHeaders` on DATA frames should be rejected\n5. **Payload Size Mismatches**: SETTINGS frames with incorrect parameter counts should fail validation\n\n#### HPACK Compression Engine Unit Tests\n\nHPACK compression testing requires validation of the complex stateful compression algorithm defined in RFC 7541. Think of HPACK like a shared dictionary that both client and server update simultaneously—any inconsistency in table management breaks the entire compression scheme. The testing strategy must verify static table lookups, dynamic table management, Huffman decoding, and integer encoding under all possible conditions.\n\nStatic table testing validates correct implementation of the predefined 61-entry table specified in RFC 7541 Appendix B. Every HPACK implementation must provide identical static table behavior, making this testing straightforward but critical. The `Lookup` function must return correct header entries for indices 1-61 and handle invalid indices gracefully.\n\n| Static Table Test | Index | Expected Name | Expected Value | Error Condition |\n|-------------------|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Authority Header | 1 | \":authority\" | \"\" | Index 0 should fail |\n| Method GET | 2 | \":method\" | \"GET\" | Standard method lookup |\n| Status 200 | 8 | \":status\" | \"200\" | Common status code |\n| Last Entry | 61 | \"www-authenticate\" | \"\" | Boundary condition |\n| Invalid Index | 62 | N/A | N/A | Should return error |\n\nDynamic table testing requires comprehensive validation of the FIFO eviction system and size management. The `DynamicTable` maintains connection-specific header entries with automatic eviction when size limits are exceeded. Each entry's size calculation follows the formula: `name_length + value_length + 32` bytes of overhead.\n\nThe `Add` method must correctly insert new entries while maintaining the size constraint through eviction. When adding an entry would exceed `maxSize`, the implementation must remove the oldest entries until sufficient space is available. Edge cases include adding an entry larger than the maximum table size (which should empty the table) and adding to a zero-size table (which should be ignored).\n\n```\nTest Scenario: Dynamic Table Eviction\nInitial State: Table with 3 entries totaling 4000 bytes, maxSize=4096\nAction: Add entry requiring 200 bytes\nExpected: Oldest entry evicted, new entry added, total size ≤ 4096\nValidation: Entry count, size calculation, FIFO order preservation\n```\n\nInteger encoding testing validates the variable-length encoding scheme used throughout HPACK for table indices and string lengths. The `DecodeInteger` function must handle 5-bit, 6-bit, and 7-bit prefix encodings with proper continuation byte processing. Test cases must cover small values that fit in the prefix, large values requiring continuation bytes, and invalid encodings that exceed implementation limits.\n\n| Integer Test | Prefix Bits | Encoded Bytes | Expected Value | Edge Case |\n|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Small Value | 5 | [0x0A] | 10 | Fits in prefix |\n| Large Value | 5 | [0x1F, 0xE8, 0x07] | 1337 | Multi-byte encoding |\n| Maximum Prefix | 6 | [0x3F, 0x00] | 63 | Boundary condition |\n| Overflow | 7 | [0x7F, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x7F] | Error | Implementation limit |\n\nHuffman decoding testing ensures correct implementation of the static Huffman table defined in RFC 7541 Appendix B. The `DecodeHuffman` function processes variable-length bit sequences, requiring careful boundary handling and padding validation. The decoder must detect the `EOS_SYMBOL` and reject invalid padding patterns.\n\n**Critical Huffman Test Cases:**\n\n1. **Common Characters**: ASCII letters and digits with short codes\n2. **Rare Characters**: Extended ASCII with longer codes  \n3. **Boundary Conditions**: Strings ending at byte boundaries vs. requiring padding\n4. **Invalid Padding**: Padding bits that don't match EOS prefix\n5. **Truncated Input**: Incomplete bit sequences that can't form valid symbols\n\n#### Stream Management Unit Tests\n\nStream management testing validates the complex state machine and concurrent stream handling that forms the core of HTTP/2 multiplexing. Think of stream management like managing multiple phone conversations on a single line—each conversation has its own state (dialing, talking, hanging up) but they all share the same physical connection. The testing strategy must verify state transitions, stream ID allocation, priority scheduling, and concurrent access patterns.\n\nStream state machine testing requires comprehensive validation of the state transitions defined in RFC 7540 Section 5.1. Each stream progresses through states from `StateIdle` to `StateClosed`, with frame types and flags triggering specific transitions. Invalid transitions must be detected and result in stream errors or connection errors as appropriate.\n\n| Current State | Frame Type | Flags | Expected Next State | Error Condition |\n|---------------|------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| StateIdle | HEADERS | 0x0 | StateOpen | Normal request start |\n| StateOpen | DATA | FlagEndStream | StateHalfClosedRemote | Client completes request |\n| StateHalfClosedRemote | HEADERS | 0x0 | StateHalfClosedRemote | Response headers |\n| StateHalfClosedRemote | DATA | FlagEndStream | StateClosed | Response complete |\n| StateClosed | DATA | 0x0 | Error | Invalid frame on closed stream |\n\nThe `TransitionState` function must validate each transition against the current state and frame type. Invalid transitions should generate `RST_STREAM` frames with appropriate error codes. The implementation must handle concurrent state changes from multiple goroutines processing frames simultaneously.\n\nStream ID allocation testing validates the odd/even assignment scheme and monotonic ordering requirements. Client-initiated streams use odd IDs (1, 3, 5...) while server-initiated streams use even IDs (2, 4, 6...). The `AllocateStreamID` function must track the highest allocated ID and prevent reuse of stream IDs within a connection.\n\n```\nTest: Concurrent Stream ID Allocation\nScenario: 10 goroutines simultaneously allocate client stream IDs\nExpected: Unique odd IDs in monotonic order (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19)\nValidation: No duplicates, all odd, strictly increasing sequence\n```\n\nPriority scheduling testing validates the weight-based bandwidth allocation specified in RFC 7540 Section 5.3. The `ScheduleStreams` function must distribute available transmission windows among active streams based on their configured weights. The deficit round-robin algorithm ensures fair scheduling while respecting priority relationships.\n\nPriority testing requires careful setup of stream hierarchies and measurement of bandwidth allocation over multiple scheduling rounds. Test scenarios should include equal-weight streams (uniform distribution), varied weights (proportional distribution), and priority inversions (higher-weight streams blocked by flow control).\n\n#### Flow Control Unit Tests\n\nFlow control testing validates the credit-based window management that prevents buffer overflow in HTTP/2 implementations. Think of flow control like water pressure regulation—each stream and the overall connection have pressure gauges (windows) that prevent pipes from bursting due to excessive flow. The testing strategy must verify window calculations, `WINDOW_UPDATE` processing, and backpressure queue management under various conditions.\n\nWindow management testing focuses on the `WindowManager` component that tracks both connection-level and stream-level send windows. Each DATA frame transmission reduces both windows, while `WINDOW_UPDATE` frames increment the appropriate window. The implementation must prevent window underflow and handle window overflow conditions gracefully.\n\n| Window Test Scenario | Initial Connection Window | Initial Stream Window | Data Size | Expected Result |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Normal Transmission | 65535 | 65535 | 1024 | Windows reduced by 1024 |\n| Stream Window Exhaustion | 65535 | 500 | 1024 | Transmission blocked |\n| Connection Window Exhaustion | 500 | 65535 | 1024 | Transmission blocked |\n| Both Windows Exhausted | 500 | 500 | 1024 | Transmission blocked |\n\nThe `CanSendData` function must check both connection and stream windows before allowing DATA frame transmission. The `ConsumeWindows` function atomically decrements both windows to maintain consistency. Window update processing must handle concurrent updates and detect overflow conditions.\n\n```\nTest: Concurrent Window Updates\nSetup: Stream window = 1000, multiple WINDOW_UPDATE frames with increment = 5000\nAction: Process 10 concurrent WINDOW_UPDATE frames\nExpected: Window increases by 50000, no overflow, atomic updates\nValidation: Final window value, no race conditions, consistent state\n```\n\nBackpressure queue testing validates the queuing mechanism used when transmission windows are exhausted. The `BackpressureQueue` buffers DATA frames until windows become available, maintaining transmission order and priority relationships. Queue management must prevent unbounded growth while preserving frame ordering.\n\n**Backpressure Test Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Single Stream Blocking**: One stream exhausts its window while others continue transmission\n2. **Connection Blocking**: All streams blocked by connection window exhaustion  \n3. **Priority Ordering**: Higher-priority streams drain first when windows become available\n4. **Queue Overflow**: Queue size limits prevent memory exhaustion\n5. **Frame Timeout**: Old queued frames are discarded to prevent unbounded buffering\n\n### Integration Testing\n\nIntegration testing validates the complete HTTP/2 server implementation by testing component interactions and end-to-end protocol compliance. While unit tests verify isolated component behavior, integration tests catch bugs that emerge from component interactions, concurrent execution, and real network conditions. The integration testing strategy employs multiple client implementations and testing tools to ensure broad compatibility and protocol adherence.\n\nIntegration testing serves as the bridge between unit-level validation and production deployment. Think of it like testing a complete symphony orchestra after rehearsing individual sections—while each musician might play perfectly in isolation, the full performance requires coordination, timing, and seamless interaction between all parts. HTTP/2's complexity demands similar holistic validation where frame parsing, header compression, stream management, and flow control must work together flawlessly.\n\n#### End-to-End Client Testing\n\nReal HTTP/2 client testing provides the most authentic validation of server implementation correctness. Different HTTP/2 clients exercise different protocol features and behaviors, exposing bugs that synthetic tests might miss. The testing strategy incorporates command-line tools, browser clients, and specialized HTTP/2 testing libraries to maximize coverage.\n\n**curl HTTP/2 Testing** provides command-line validation of basic HTTP/2 functionality. Modern curl versions support HTTP/2 over TLS with the `--http2` flag, making it ideal for automated testing and debugging. curl testing focuses on request-response correctness, header handling, and error condition responses.\n\n```\nBasic curl Test Commands:\ncurl --http2 -v https://localhost:8443/simple\ncurl --http2 -H \"Custom-Header: test-value\" https://localhost:8443/echo-headers  \ncurl --http2 -d \"request body\" https://localhost:8443/post-handler\ncurl --http2 --limit-rate 1k https://localhost:8443/large-response\n```\n\nThe verbose output (`-v` flag) provides detailed protocol information including frame exchanges, header compression, and TLS negotiation. Successful curl tests should show `* Using HTTP2, server supports multi-use` and frame-level debugging information when using `--http2-prior-knowledge` for cleartext HTTP/2.\n\n| curl Test Category | Command | Expected Behavior | Validation Points |\n|-------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Basic GET | `curl --http2 -v https://localhost:8443/` | 200 response with correct content | Response headers, body content |\n| Header Echo | `curl --http2 -H \"X-Test: value\" https://localhost:8443/echo` | Headers reflected in response | Header preservation through HPACK |\n| Large Response | `curl --http2 https://localhost:8443/10mb` | Complete download without corruption | Flow control, frame fragmentation |\n| Concurrent Requests | Multiple curl processes simultaneously | All requests succeed | Stream multiplexing |\n\n**Browser Testing** validates real-world client behavior with modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Browsers implement sophisticated HTTP/2 optimizations including connection coalescing, priority scheduling, and aggressive multiplexing. Browser testing requires HTTPS with valid certificates, making TLS configuration part of the integration test setup.\n\nBrowser testing methodology involves both manual testing and automated browser automation tools. Manual testing provides immediate visual feedback and debugging information through browser developer tools. Automated testing using tools like Selenium or Playwright enables reproducible test execution and continuous integration.\n\n**Critical Browser Test Scenarios:**\n\n1. **Multiple Resource Loading**: HTML pages with many CSS, JavaScript, and image resources\n2. **Long-Lived Connections**: WebSocket upgrades and server-sent events over HTTP/2\n3. **Priority Handling**: Critical resources (CSS) vs. non-critical resources (images)\n4. **Error Recovery**: Network interruptions and connection recovery\n5. **Cache Behavior**: HTTP caching with HTTP/2 multiplexing\n\nBrowser developer tools provide invaluable insight into HTTP/2 behavior. Chrome's Network tab shows protocol versions, connection reuse, and stream prioritization. Firefox's developer tools include HTTP/2 frame inspection and timing analysis. Safari's Web Inspector provides similar capabilities with additional WebKit-specific metrics.\n\n#### Specialized HTTP/2 Testing Tools\n\nDedicated HTTP/2 testing tools provide comprehensive protocol validation beyond what general-purpose clients offer. These tools implement HTTP/2-specific test suites, protocol fuzzing, and compliance checking that validate server behavior against RFC specifications.\n\n**h2spec Compliance Testing** is the de facto standard for HTTP/2 protocol compliance testing. The h2spec tool implements hundreds of test cases covering every aspect of RFC 7540 and RFC 7541. It tests positive cases (valid protocol usage) and negative cases (error handling and protocol violations).\n\nh2spec testing categories include frame parsing, stream state machines, flow control, header compression, and error handling. Each test case sends specific frame sequences and validates the server's response against RFC requirements. Failed tests indicate protocol violations that could cause interoperability issues with other HTTP/2 implementations.\n\n```\nh2spec Test Execution:\nh2spec --host localhost --port 8443 --tls --strict\nh2spec --host localhost --port 8080 --timeout 5s (cleartext)\nh2spec --host localhost --port 8443 --tls --sections 3.5,4,5 (specific sections)\n```\n\nh2spec test results identify the specific RFC section and requirement that failed, enabling precise bug identification. The `--strict` flag enables additional compliance checks beyond the minimum RFC requirements. Test failures should be investigated immediately as they indicate fundamental protocol implementation bugs.\n\n| h2spec Test Section | Focus Area | Critical Tests | Common Failures |\n|---------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Section 3.5 | HTTP/2 Connection Preface | Connection initialization | Missing or invalid preface |\n| Section 4 | Frame Definitions | Frame parsing and validation | Frame size limits, reserved bits |\n| Section 5 | Stream States | State machine compliance | Invalid state transitions |\n| Section 6 | Error Handling | Error codes and recovery | Missing GOAWAY frames |\n\n**HTTP/2 Load Testing** validates server behavior under realistic concurrent load using tools like h2load, wrk2 with HTTP/2 support, or custom load generators. Load testing exposes race conditions, memory leaks, and performance bottlenecks that only manifest under concurrent stress.\n\nh2load provides HTTP/2-specific load testing with configurable concurrency, request rates, and connection counts. Unlike HTTP/1.1 load testing, HTTP/2 load testing can achieve high request rates with minimal connection counts due to multiplexing.\n\n```\nh2load Load Test Examples:\nh2load -n10000 -c10 -m10 https://localhost:8443/small (10K requests, 10 connections, 10 streams)\nh2load -n1000 -c1 -m100 --h1 https://localhost:8443/compare (HTTP/1.1 comparison)\nh2load -t10 -c10 -m50 -d60 https://localhost:8443/sustained (60-second sustained load)\n```\n\nLoad testing should monitor server resource usage including memory consumption, goroutine counts, file descriptor usage, and CPU utilization. Memory leaks often manifest as gradually increasing memory usage under sustained load. Goroutine leaks appear as unbounded goroutine growth over time.\n\n#### Protocol Fuzzing and Edge Case Testing\n\nProtocol fuzzing systematically generates malformed or edge-case HTTP/2 traffic to test server robustness. Think of fuzzing like stress-testing a bridge with unusual load patterns—while normal traffic might work perfectly, edge cases and malformed inputs can expose structural weaknesses. HTTP/2 fuzzing targets binary frame formats, state machine edge cases, and resource exhaustion scenarios.\n\n**Binary Frame Fuzzing** generates malformed frames with invalid lengths, corrupted headers, and boundary condition violations. Frame fuzzing should trigger appropriate error responses without causing server crashes or resource leaks. Proper frame validation and error handling prevent fuzzing inputs from compromising server stability.\n\nFrame fuzzing categories include length field manipulation (oversized/undersized frames), type field corruption (invalid frame types), flag field abuse (invalid flag combinations), and stream ID violations (reserved bits, invalid stream assignments). Each category tests different validation code paths and error handling logic.\n\n**State Machine Fuzzing** sends frame sequences that violate HTTP/2 state machine requirements. Examples include sending DATA frames on closed streams, HEADERS frames with invalid dependencies, and CONTINUATION frames without proper HEADERS initiation. State machine fuzzing validates the robustness of stream state tracking and error recovery.\n\n**Resource Exhaustion Testing** attempts to exhaust server resources through protocol abuse. Test scenarios include creating excessive concurrent streams, sending oversized header blocks, exhausting flow control windows, and filling dynamic tables with large entries. Resource exhaustion testing validates implementation limits and graceful degradation under attack conditions.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Protocol fuzzing often reveals bugs that traditional testing misses. Even when unit tests pass and integration tests succeed, fuzzing can expose edge cases where the combination of valid protocol elements creates invalid states. This is particularly important for HTTP/2 due to its state machine complexity and binary encoding.\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nMilestone checkpoints provide concrete verification steps after completing each implementation phase. These checkpoints serve as quality gates, ensuring each milestone delivers working functionality before proceeding to more complex features. Think of milestone checkpoints like flight test phases for aircraft development—each phase validates specific capabilities before advancing to more complex maneuvers.\n\nEach checkpoint includes both automated testing commands and manual verification steps. Automated tests provide quick pass/fail feedback, while manual verification ensures the implementation behaves correctly under realistic conditions. The checkpoints progress from basic functionality to complete HTTP/2 protocol compliance.\n\n#### Milestone 1 Checkpoint: Binary Framing\n\nAfter implementing the Binary Framing Engine, the server should successfully parse, validate, and serialize all required HTTP/2 frame types. The checkpoint validates frame header parsing, payload extraction, and wire format serialization without requiring higher-level protocol features.\n\n**Automated Test Verification:**\n\n```\nTest Command: go test -v ./internal/framing/...\nExpected Output:\n=== RUN   TestParseDataFrame\n--- PASS: TestParseDataFrame (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestParseHeadersFrame  \n--- PASS: TestParseHeadersFrame (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestParseSettingsFrame\n--- PASS: TestParseSettingsFrame (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestFrameValidation\n--- PASS: TestFrameValidation (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestFrameSerialization\n--- PASS: TestFrameSerialization (0.00s)\nPASS\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Frame Parsing Test**: Create a minimal test program that reads HTTP/2 frames from a file and parses them using `ParseFrame`. Generate test frames using another HTTP/2 implementation or hex-encoded test vectors.\n\n2. **Serialization Round-Trip**: Verify that parsing a frame followed by serialization produces identical binary output. Any differences indicate endianness issues or field corruption.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Send malformed frames and verify the server generates appropriate `ProtocolError` instances with correct error codes.\n\n**Expected Behavior Indicators:**\n\n- Frame parsing correctly extracts all header fields (length, type, flags, stream ID)\n- Payload reading respects the length field without reading too much or too little data  \n- Frame validation catches oversized frames, invalid stream ID assignments, and reserved bit violations\n- Serialization produces valid wire format that other HTTP/2 implementations can parse\n\n**Common Issues and Debugging:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Command | Resolution |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------|\n| Parse errors on valid frames | Endianness issues | `hexdump -C frame.bin` | Fix network byte order conversion |\n| Payload size mismatches | Length field corruption | Debug frame header parsing | Verify 24-bit length extraction |\n| Validation false positives | Incorrect reserved bit handling | Test with known-good frames | Fix bit masking logic |\n| Serialization differences | Field order or padding | Compare serialized output byte-by-byte | Check frame structure alignment |\n\n#### Milestone 2 Checkpoint: HPACK Compression\n\nAfter implementing HPACK compression, the server should correctly decompress header blocks and maintain dynamic table state across requests. The checkpoint validates static table lookups, dynamic table management, Huffman decoding, and integer encoding without requiring complete stream processing.\n\n**Automated Test Verification:**\n\n```\nTest Command: go test -v ./internal/hpack/...\nExpected Output:\n=== RUN   TestStaticTableLookup\n--- PASS: TestStaticTableLookup (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestDynamicTableManagement\n--- PASS: TestDynamicTableManagement (0.00s)  \n=== RUN   TestHuffmanDecoding\n--- PASS: TestHuffmanDecoding (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestIntegerEncoding\n--- PASS: TestIntegerEncoding (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestHeaderBlockDecoding\n--- PASS: TestHeaderBlockDecoding (0.00s)\nPASS\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Static Table Verification**: Query all static table entries (indices 1-61) and verify they match RFC 7541 Appendix B exactly.\n\n2. **Dynamic Table Evolution**: Process a sequence of header blocks that add entries to the dynamic table and verify proper FIFO eviction when size limits are exceeded.\n\n3. **Huffman Decoding Test**: Decode Huffman-compressed header values using test vectors from RFC 7541 and verify correct string reconstruction.\n\n4. **Cross-Implementation Testing**: Exchange header blocks with another HTTP/2 implementation to verify compression compatibility.\n\n**Expected Behavior Indicators:**\n\n- Static table lookups return correct name-value pairs for all valid indices\n- Dynamic table size management maintains the configured size limit through proper eviction\n- Huffman decoding handles all character encodings including edge cases and padding\n- Integer encoding/decoding works correctly for all prefix lengths (5, 6, 7 bits)\n- Header block decompression produces semantically correct HTTP headers\n\n**HPACK-Specific Debugging:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Investigation Steps | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----|\n| Decompression failures | Dynamic table inconsistency | Log table state after each header block | Verify FIFO eviction order |\n| Huffman decode errors | Padding validation issues | Test with known Huffman sequences | Fix EOS symbol handling |\n| Integer overflow | Continuation byte handling | Test large integer values | Implement proper bounds checking |\n| Table size violations | Entry size calculation errors | Verify overhead calculation (32 bytes) | Fix size accounting formula |\n\n#### Milestone 3 Checkpoint: Stream Management\n\nAfter implementing stream management, the server should handle multiple concurrent streams with correct state transitions and priority scheduling. The checkpoint validates stream lifecycle management, state machine compliance, and concurrent stream handling without requiring complete flow control.\n\n**Automated Test Verification:**\n\n```\nTest Command: go test -v ./internal/streams/...\nExpected Output:\n=== RUN   TestStreamStateTransitions\n--- PASS: TestStreamStateTransitions (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestStreamIDAllocation  \n--- PASS: TestStreamIDAllocation (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestPriorityScheduling\n--- PASS: TestPriorityScheduling (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestConcurrentStreams\n--- PASS: TestConcurrentStreams (0.00s)\n=== RUN   TestStreamLimits\n--- PASS: TestStreamLimits (0.00s)\nPASS\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Stream Lifecycle Testing**: Open multiple streams simultaneously and verify they transition through states correctly as frames are sent and received.\n\n2. **Priority Scheduling Verification**: Configure streams with different weights and verify bandwidth allocation matches priority ratios under load.\n\n3. **Concurrent Access Testing**: Send frames for multiple streams simultaneously from different goroutines and verify thread-safe state management.\n\n4. **Stream Limit Enforcement**: Attempt to exceed the maximum concurrent streams setting and verify proper rejection with appropriate error codes.\n\n**Expected Behavior Indicators:**\n\n- Stream state transitions follow RFC 7540 state machine exactly\n- Stream ID allocation maintains odd/even separation and monotonic ordering  \n- Priority scheduling distributes bandwidth proportionally based on stream weights\n- Concurrent stream access doesn't cause race conditions or state corruption\n- Stream limits prevent resource exhaustion through excessive stream creation\n\n**Stream Management Debugging:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Debug Approach | Solution |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| Invalid state transitions | State machine bugs | Log all state changes with frame types | Fix transition validation logic |\n| Stream ID collisions | ID allocation races | Test concurrent allocation | Add proper synchronization |\n| Priority inversion | Scheduling algorithm bugs | Monitor bandwidth distribution | Fix deficit round-robin implementation |\n| Memory leaks | Stream cleanup failures | Monitor stream count over time | Implement proper stream cleanup |\n\n#### Milestone 4 Checkpoint: Complete HTTP/2 Server\n\nAfter implementing flow control, the server should provide complete HTTP/2 protocol compliance with multiplexing, header compression, and flow control. The final checkpoint validates end-to-end functionality using real HTTP/2 clients and comprehensive protocol compliance testing.\n\n**Automated Test Verification:**\n\n```\nTest Command: go test -v ./...\nExpected Output: All test packages pass\nIntegration Command: h2spec --host localhost --port 8443 --tls\nExpected Output: All h2spec tests pass\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Browser Testing**: Load a complex web page with multiple resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) and verify all resources load correctly via HTTP/2.\n\n2. **curl Integration**: Execute various curl commands testing different HTTP methods, headers, and response sizes.\n\n3. **Performance Testing**: Run h2load to verify the server handles concurrent load without degradation.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Trigger various error conditions and verify appropriate HTTP/2 error responses.\n\n**Expected Behavior Indicators:**\n\n- All HTTP/2 clients connect successfully and exchange data correctly\n- Stream multiplexing allows concurrent request processing over single connections\n- Flow control prevents buffer overflow and handles backpressure appropriately  \n- Header compression reduces bandwidth usage compared to uncompressed headers\n- Error conditions generate proper HTTP/2 error frames (GOAWAY, RST_STREAM)\n\n**Final Integration Issues:**\n\n| Problem | Symptoms | Root Cause Analysis | Resolution |\n|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|\n| Connection hangs | Client timeouts | Check flow control deadlocks | Verify window update generation |\n| Performance degradation | High latency under load | Profile goroutine and memory usage | Optimize critical path performance |\n| Intermittent failures | Sporadic test failures | Look for race conditions | Add proper synchronization |\n| Protocol compliance failures | h2spec test failures | Review RFC compliance | Fix specific protocol violations |\n\n> **Testing Success Criteria**: A fully functional HTTP/2 server should pass all unit tests, handle real client traffic correctly, achieve acceptable performance under load, and maintain protocol compliance under all tested conditions. Any failures in these areas indicate implementation bugs that must be resolved before deployment.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe HTTP/2 server testing implementation requires sophisticated test infrastructure that mirrors the protocol's complexity. Unlike simple REST API testing, HTTP/2 testing must handle binary protocols, stateful compression, concurrent streams, and complex state machines. The testing strategy builds from simple unit tests to complete protocol compliance validation.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Testing Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Unit Testing Framework | Standard Go testing package | Testify with assert/require helpers |\n| HTTP/2 Test Client | net/http.Client with ForceAttemptHTTP2 | Custom HTTP/2 client with frame control |\n| Binary Frame Testing | Hand-coded byte arrays | Property-based testing with quick |\n| Load Testing | Simple go routines | h2load or custom performance harness |\n| Protocol Compliance | Manual test cases | h2spec automated compliance testing |\n| Mocking/Stubs | Interface-based mocking | gomock for generated mocks |\n| Test Data Management | Embedded test vectors | External test data files |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── cmd/\n│   ├── server/\n│   │   ├── main.go                    ← HTTP/2 server entry point\n│   │   └── main_test.go               ← Integration test setup\n│   └── test-client/\n│       └── main.go                    ← Custom HTTP/2 test client\n├── internal/\n│   ├── framing/\n│   │   ├── parser.go                  ← Frame parsing implementation  \n│   │   ├── parser_test.go             ← Frame parsing unit tests\n│   │   ├── serializer.go              ← Frame serialization\n│   │   ├── serializer_test.go         ← Serialization unit tests\n│   │   └── validator_test.go          ← Frame validation tests\n│   ├── hpack/\n│   │   ├── tables.go                  ← Static/dynamic table implementation\n│   │   ├── tables_test.go             ← Table management unit tests\n│   │   ├── huffman.go                 ← Huffman encoding/decoding\n│   │   ├── huffman_test.go            ← Huffman unit tests\n│   │   └── integration_test.go        ← HPACK integration tests\n│   ├── streams/\n│   │   ├── manager.go                 ← Stream lifecycle management\n│   │   ├── manager_test.go            ← Stream management unit tests\n│   │   ├── statemachine_test.go       ← State transition tests\n│   │   └── priority_test.go           ← Priority scheduling tests\n│   └── flow/\n│       ├── controller.go              ← Flow control implementation\n│       ├── controller_test.go         ← Flow control unit tests\n│       └── backpressure_test.go       ← Backpressure handling tests\n├── test/\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   ├── client_test.go             ← Real client integration tests\n│   │   ├── compliance_test.go         ← Protocol compliance tests\n│   │   └── performance_test.go        ← Load testing and benchmarks\n│   ├── fixtures/\n│   │   ├── frames/                    ← Binary frame test data\n│   │   ├── headers/                   ← HPACK test vectors\n│   │   └── traces/                    ← HTTP/2 connection traces\n│   └── utils/\n│       ├── client.go                  ← Test client utilities\n│       ├── server.go                  ← Test server setup\n│       └── assertions.go              ← Custom test assertions\n└── scripts/\n    ├── run-h2spec.sh                  ← Protocol compliance testing\n    ├── load-test.sh                   ← Performance testing script\n    └── generate-test-data.sh          ← Test data generation\n```\n\n#### Testing Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n```go\n// test/utils/server.go -

Just as mail can get lost at sorting centers, have addresses corrupted, or be delivered out of order, HTTP/2 frames can be malformed at the binary level, headers can be corrupted during compression, or streams can enter invalid states due to concurrency issues. The key to effective debugging is understanding where in the pipeline problems occur and having systematic approaches to isolate and diagnose each category of failure.\n\nHTTP/2 protocol debugging presents unique challenges because of its binary nature, multiplexed streams, and complex state machines. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where you can inspect raw text traffic, HTTP/2 requires specialized tools to decode binary frames. The multiplexing adds another layer of complexity - errors in one stream can affect others, and race conditions between concurrent streams create intermittent failures that are difficult to reproduce. This section provides concrete diagnostic techniques, common bug patterns, and systematic troubleshooting approaches for each major component.\n\nThe debugging strategy follows a layered approach, starting with the lowest level (binary framing) and working up through header compression, stream management, and flow control. Each layer has characteristic failure modes and diagnostic signatures. Understanding these patterns allows you to quickly identify which component is failing and apply the appropriate troubleshooting techniques.\n\n### Frame Parsing Bugs\n\nBinary protocol parsing represents one of the most common sources of bugs in HTTP/2 implementations. Unlike text-based protocols where parsing errors are often obvious, binary parsing failures can manifest as subtle data corruption, mysterious connection resets, or intermittent protocol violations that are difficult to reproduce.\n\n**Endianness Issues**\n\nNetwork protocols use big-endian byte ordering (most significant byte first), but different architectures have different native byte orders. Think of endianness like reading a multi-digit number - in big-endian, you read left-to-right (most significant digit first), while in little-endian, you would read right-to-left. When your HTTP/2 frame parser doesn't correctly handle byte order conversion, field values become corrupted in predictable ways.\n\nThe `Frame` header contains several multi-byte fields that are susceptible to endianness bugs. The 24-bit length field, when incorrectly parsed on a little-endian system, will have its bytes reversed. For example, a frame length of `0x000100` (256 bytes) would be interpreted as `0x000001` (1 byte) on a little-endian system without proper conversion.\n\n| Field | Correct Value | Little-Endian Bug | Symptom |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Length (24-bit) | 0x000100 (256) | 0x000001 (1) | Premature frame termination |\n| StreamID (31-bit) | 0x00000001 | 0x01000000 | Invalid stream ID errors |\n| Window Size | 0x0000FFFF | 0xFFFF0000 | Flow control violations |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Native Byte Order Assumption**\nMany developers assume their development machine's byte order matches the network byte order. This leads to code that works correctly on big-endian systems but fails on common little-endian architectures like x86. The bug often goes undetected during development if testing only occurs on the same architecture as development.\n\nThe diagnostic signature of endianness bugs includes frame length mismatches, where the parser reads far more or fewer bytes than expected for the payload. You'll see protocol errors like `ErrorCodeFrameSizeError` when the computed frame size exceeds `MaxFrameSize`, or premature connection termination when the parser tries to read beyond available data.\n\n**Length Validation Errors**\n\nHTTP/2 frame length validation involves multiple constraints that must all be satisfied simultaneously. The 24-bit length field in the frame header specifies payload bytes, not including the 9-byte header itself. This length must not exceed the negotiated maximum frame size (initially `DefaultFrameSize` of 16,384 bytes), and certain frame types have additional size constraints.\n\nFrame length validation follows a hierarchical checking process:\n\n1. **Basic Range Check**: Length field must not exceed `MaxFrameSize` (16,777,215 bytes)\n2. **Connection Limit Check**: Length must not exceed the negotiated `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` value\n3. **Frame Type Constraints**: Some frame types have minimum or exact size requirements\n4. **Stream Context Validation**: Frame size must be reasonable given current stream state and flow control windows\n\n| Frame Type | Minimum Size | Maximum Size | Special Constraints |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `FrameTypeDATA` | 0 bytes | Connection limit | Must respect flow control |\n| `FrameTypeHEADERS` | 1 byte | Connection limit | Must include header block |\n| `FrameTypeSETTINGS` | 0 or 6n bytes | Connection limit | Multiple of 6 when not ACK |\n| PING | 8 bytes | 8 bytes | Exactly 8 bytes required |\n| GOAWAY | 8+ bytes | Connection limit | At least last stream ID + error |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Settings Frame Size Validation**\nSETTINGS frames without the ACK flag must contain a payload length that's a multiple of 6 bytes (each setting is 6 bytes). However, SETTINGS frames with the ACK flag must have zero payload length. Many implementations forget this distinction and either reject valid ACK frames or accept malformed settings with partial entries.\n\nBinary parsing also introduces **alignment and boundary errors** where frame boundaries don't align with buffer boundaries. When reading frames from a TCP stream, the underlying transport can deliver data in arbitrary chunks that don't correspond to frame boundaries. Your parser must handle cases where a frame header spans multiple read operations, or where multiple complete frames arrive in a single buffer.\n\nThe frame parsing state machine must track partial reads and reassemble complete frames:\n\n1. **Header Assembly State**: Accumulating the 9-byte header across multiple reads\n2. **Payload Reading State**: Reading the specified number of payload bytes\n3. **Frame Complete State**: Frame ready for validation and processing\n4. **Error Recovery State**: Handling malformed frames and connection recovery\n\n**Buffer Overflow and Underflow**\n\nBuffer management in binary parsing requires careful bounds checking at every step. **Buffer overflow** occurs when the parser writes beyond allocated memory, typically when the frame length field has been corrupted or when integer arithmetic overflows during size calculations. **Buffer underflow** occurs when the parser attempts to read more data than is available in the current buffer.\n\nConsider the frame header parsing sequence. The parser must read exactly 9 bytes for the header, then extract the 24-bit length field, and finally read that many additional bytes for the payload. At each step, the parser must verify that sufficient data is available before attempting the read operation.\n\n> The critical insight for robust frame parsing is that network data arrives asynchronously and in arbitrary chunks. Your parser cannot assume that complete frames are available in each read operation - it must gracefully handle partial frames and maintain parsing state across multiple I/O operations.\n\n**Reserved Bit Handling**\n\nHTTP/2 frame headers contain several reserved bits that must be zero in compliant implementations. The most common reserved bit violations occur in the stream ID field, which reserves the most significant bit (bit 31) for the R flag. Implementations must mask this bit when extracting the stream ID value and should validate that reserved bits are not set.\n\n| Field | Reserved Bits | Validation Rule | Error Response |\n|-------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Stream ID | Bit 31 (R flag) | Must be 0 | `ErrorCodeProtocolError` |\n| Frame Type | Bits 8-15 | Must be recognized type | Connection error |\n| Flags | Unused bits per type | Type-specific validation | Frame-specific error |\n\nThe `ValidateFrame` method must check these reserved bit constraints and generate appropriate `ProtocolError` responses. Reserved bit violations typically indicate either a buggy peer implementation or data corruption during transmission.\n\n### HPACK Compression Bugs\n\nHPACK header compression introduces complex state management and encoding algorithms that are prone to subtle bugs. Unlike frame parsing where errors are often immediately apparent, HPACK bugs can manifest as gradual state corruption that only becomes visible after processing many requests. Think of HPACK debugging like troubleshooting a dictionary where entries are constantly being added and removed - small errors in table management compound over time until the sender and receiver have completely different dictionaries.\n\n**Table Index Errors**\n\nThe HPACK algorithm uses a combined indexing space that merges the static table and dynamic table into a single address space. The static table contains 61 predefined entries (indexed 1-61), while the dynamic table entries follow immediately after (indexed 62 and above). This dual addressing scheme is a common source of off-by-one errors and index calculation bugs.\n\nIndex resolution follows these rules:\n1. **Index 0**: Reserved and invalid - should trigger decompression error\n2. **Index 1-61**: Static table entries, directly addressable\n3. **Index 62+**: Dynamic table entries, calculated as `(index - 62)` into dynamic table array\n4. **Index > (61 + dynamic_table_size)**: Invalid index, should trigger decompression error\n\n| Index Range | Table | Calculation | Error Condition |\n|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 0 | Invalid | N/A | `ErrorCodeCompressionError` |\n| 1-61 | Static | `index - 1` for array access | Index > 61 |\n| 62+ | Dynamic | `index - 62` for array access | Index > 61 + table size |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Dynamic Table Index Calculation**\nThe most common HPACK indexing bug is forgetting that dynamic table indices start at 62, not 61. This leads to off-by-one errors where index 62 incorrectly references static table entry 61 instead of dynamic table entry 0. The bug manifests as header values from previous requests appearing in current responses, creating security vulnerabilities through information leakage.\n\nThe `Lookup` method must handle index bounds checking and table selection:\n\n```\nInput: index = 65, static_table_size = 61, dynamic_table_entries = 5\nValidation: 65 <= (61 + 5) = 66 ✓ (valid)\nTable Selection: 65 > 61 → Dynamic table\nArray Index: 65 - 62 = 3 (fourth dynamic entry)\n```\n\n**Dynamic Table Size Management**\n\nHPACK dynamic tables implement FIFO eviction with size-based constraints rather than simple entry count limits. Each header entry consumes `32 + name.length + value.length` bytes, and the table must maintain a running total that never exceeds the configured maximum size. Size management bugs typically involve incorrect size calculations, improper eviction logic, or race conditions in multithreaded implementations.\n\nThe `calculateEntrySize` function implements the RFC 7541 sizing formula, but implementations often introduce bugs in string length calculation or integer overflow handling. Consider a header entry with name \":status\" and value \"200\" - the size calculation is `32 + 7 + 3 = 42` bytes. However, if the implementation uses 16-bit integers for size tracking, tables larger than 65,535 bytes will overflow and wrap around to small positive values.\n\n| Component | Size Contribution | Common Bugs |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------|\n| Base Overhead | 32 bytes | Forgetting to include |\n| Name Length | UTF-8 byte count | Using character count instead |\n| Value Length | UTF-8 byte count | Unicode handling errors |\n| Total Tracking | Running sum | Integer overflow |\n\nThe eviction algorithm must remove entries from the front of the table (oldest entries) until the total size is within limits. However, the eviction loop must carefully handle cases where adding a single large entry requires removing multiple small entries.\n\n> The critical insight for dynamic table management is that HPACK uses FIFO eviction based on total byte size, not entry count. A single large entry can force eviction of many smaller entries, and the eviction algorithm must be atomic to prevent inconsistent intermediate states.\n\n**Huffman Decoding Issues**\n\nHPACK uses Huffman coding for header value compression, but the decoding algorithm is complex and error-prone. The Huffman code table is predefined by RFC 7541, but implementations must handle variable-length codes, bit-level parsing, and padding validation. Huffman decoding bugs often manifest as corrupted header values, infinite loops in the decoder, or security vulnerabilities through buffer overflows.\n\nThe Huffman decoding process operates on individual bits rather than bytes, requiring careful bit manipulation and accumulator management. The `HuffmanDecoder` maintains an accumulator for partially decoded symbols and a bit count for tracking position within the current byte.\n\nHuffman decoding follows this bit-level process:\n1. **Bit Accumulation**: Add input bits to the accumulator, tracking total bit count\n2. **Symbol Matching**: Compare accumulator against code table for valid symbols\n3. **Symbol Emission**: Output matched character and reset accumulator\n4. **Padding Validation**: Ensure any remaining bits match the End-of-String padding pattern\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Huffman Padding Validation**\nThe Huffman alphabet includes a special End-of-String symbol (`EOS_SYMBOL`) used for padding incomplete bytes. Decoders must validate that any remaining bits after the last complete symbol consist only of the most significant bits of the EOS symbol. Invalid padding indicates either corruption or a malicious compression bomb attack.\n\n**Integer Encoding Edge Cases**\n\nHPACK uses variable-length integer encoding with different prefix sizes (5, 6, or 7 bits) depending on context. The encoding can span multiple bytes using continuation markers, and decoders must handle very large integers and potential overflow conditions. Integer decoding bugs include infinite loops on malformed continuation bytes, arithmetic overflow, and incorrect prefix masking.\n\nThe `DecodeInteger` method must handle several edge cases:\n\n| Edge Case | Description | Validation Required |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Maximum Prefix Value | All prefix bits set to 1 | Indicates multi-byte encoding |\n| Continuation Bytes | MSB = 1 indicates more bytes | Must limit total byte count |\n| Integer Overflow | Result exceeds language limits | Check before arithmetic operations |\n| Invalid Continuation | MSB patterns | Detect malformed encoding |\n\nThe integer decoding algorithm accumulates values using powers of 128, but must prevent arithmetic overflow. Consider decoding a 5-bit prefix where all prefix bits are set (value 31) followed by continuation bytes. The total value is `31 + (continuation_bytes_value * 128^n)`, where n is the continuation byte position.\n\n### Stream State Bugs\n\nHTTP/2 stream management implements complex state machines that can transition through multiple states based on frame types and flags. Stream state bugs are particularly insidious because they often involve race conditions between concurrent streams and can create security vulnerabilities through state machine violations. Think of stream state debugging like tracking the lifecycle of individual conversations in a busy conference call - each conversation has its own state, but they can interfere with each other in unexpected ways.\n\n**State Machine Violations**\n\nThe HTTP/2 stream state machine defines valid transitions between `StateIdle`, `StateOpen`, `StateHalfClosedLocal`, `StateHalfClosedRemote`, and `StateClosed`. Invalid transitions occur when frames arrive that are not permitted in the current state, or when the implementation incorrectly updates state without proper validation.\n\n| Current State | Valid Frames | Invalid Frames | Transition Triggers |\n|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| `StateIdle` | HEADERS, PRIORITY | DATA, RST_STREAM | HEADERS → Open |\n| `StateOpen` | DATA, HEADERS, RST_STREAM | None (all valid) | END_STREAM → Half-closed |\n| `StateHalfClosedLocal` | DATA (receive only), RST_STREAM | DATA (send) | END_STREAM received → Closed |\n| `StateHalfClosedRemote` | DATA (send only), RST_STREAM | DATA (receive) | END_STREAM sent → Closed |\n| `StateClosed` | PRIORITY, RST_STREAM | DATA, HEADERS | None (terminal) |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Concurrent State Transitions**\nStream state transitions are not atomic across frame processing, leading to race conditions where two threads attempt to transition the same stream simultaneously. For example, one thread processes an incoming RST_STREAM frame while another processes an outgoing DATA frame. Without proper synchronization, the stream can end up in an inconsistent state or generate invalid frames.\n\nThe `TransitionState` method must validate transitions atomically:\n\n1. **Lock Stream State**: Acquire exclusive access to prevent concurrent modifications\n2. **Validate Current State**: Ensure the stream is in the expected current state\n3. **Check Frame Permissions**: Verify the triggering frame is valid for current state\n4. **Update State**: Atomically transition to the new state\n5. **Notify Waiters**: Signal any threads waiting on state changes\n6. **Release Lock**: Allow other operations to proceed\n\n**Stream ID Allocation Issues**\n\nHTTP/2 uses a split namespace for stream IDs - client-initiated streams use odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...) while server-initiated streams use even numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). Stream ID allocation must maintain monotonic increasing order within each namespace and handle ID exhaustion gracefully. Stream ID bugs include reusing IDs, violating the odd/even rule, or failing to handle the 31-bit limit.\n\nThe `AllocateStreamID` method tracks separate counters for client and server streams:\n\n| Stream Type | ID Pattern | Counter Variable | Exhaustion Point |\n|-------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n| Client Streams | 1, 3, 5, ... | `nextClientStreamID` | 2^31 - 1 |\n| Server Streams | 2, 4, 6, ... | `nextServerStreamID` | 2^31 - 2 |\n| Reserved | 0 | N/A | Connection-level frames |\n\nStream ID exhaustion requires connection closure because HTTP/2 does not support ID reuse. A busy server processing many short-lived requests can exhaust the server stream ID space, requiring graceful connection termination with a GOAWAY frame.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stream ID Reuse**\nSome implementations incorrectly attempt to reuse stream IDs after streams close, violating the HTTP/2 specification. This can cause frame routing confusion where frames intended for a new stream are delivered to a closed stream's handler, leading to protocol errors or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Priority and Dependency Cycles**\n\nHTTP/2 stream prioritization uses a weighted dependency tree where streams can depend on other streams for scheduling priority. However, the dependency relationships must form a directed acyclic graph - dependency cycles create scheduling deadlocks where streams wait for each other indefinitely. Priority handling bugs include allowing circular dependencies, incorrect weight calculations, and priority inversion where low-priority streams block high-priority ones.\n\nThe `StreamPriority` structure defines dependency relationships, but implementations must validate that new dependencies don't create cycles:\n\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Use depth-first search to detect circular dependencies before adding new edges\n2. **Dependency Removal**: Remove conflicting dependencies to break potential cycles\n3. **Weight Normalization**: Ensure priority weights fall within valid ranges (1-256)\n4. **Scheduling Fairness**: Implement deficit round-robin or similar algorithm to prevent starvation\n\n| Priority Violation | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Circular Dependency | Graph traversal | Remove newest dependency |\n| Invalid Weight | Range checking | Clamp to valid range (1-256) |\n| Missing Parent | Dependency validation | Depend on connection root |\n| Priority Inversion | Scheduling analysis | Boost blocked high-priority streams |\n\n**Concurrent Access Issues**\n\nStream management must handle concurrent access from multiple goroutines processing different streams simultaneously. Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared stream state, when stream cleanup races with active frame processing, or when flow control windows are updated concurrently with data transmission.\n\nThe `StreamManager` must provide thread-safe operations for all stream lifecycle events:\n\n| Operation | Synchronization Required | Race Condition Risk |\n|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Stream Creation | Stream map write lock | Duplicate stream IDs |\n| State Transitions | Per-stream lock | Inconsistent state |\n| Flow Control Updates | Window lock | Double accounting |\n| Stream Cleanup | Stream map write lock | Use-after-free |\n\n> The critical insight for stream concurrency is that HTTP/2 multiplexing creates complex interaction patterns between streams that share connection-level resources. Proper synchronization requires both coarse-grained locks for shared data structures and fine-grained locks for per-stream state to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n\n### Debugging Tools\n\nEffective HTTP/2 debugging requires specialized tools that can decode binary protocols, analyze multiplexed traffic, and correlate events across multiple streams. Unlike HTTP/1.1 where simple text-based tools suffice, HTTP/2 debugging demands protocol-aware analysis tools and structured logging strategies.\n\n**Wireshark Analysis**\n\nWireshark provides comprehensive HTTP/2 protocol decoding that reveals the binary frame structure, HPACK compression details, and stream multiplexing patterns. The HTTP/2 dissector automatically decodes frame headers, decompresses HPACK headers, and tracks stream states across the connection lifetime.\n\nKey Wireshark filters for HTTP/2 debugging:\n\n| Filter Expression | Purpose | Typical Use Case |\n|------------------|---------|------------------|\n| `http2` | All HTTP/2 traffic | General protocol analysis |\n| `http2.type == 0` | DATA frames only | Flow control and payload analysis |\n| `http2.type == 1` | HEADERS frames | Request/response header analysis |\n| `http2.streamid == N` | Specific stream | Single stream lifecycle tracking |\n| `http2.flags.end_stream == 1` | Stream termination | Finding premature closures |\n\nWireshark's HTTP/2 analysis includes automatic validation of protocol constraints. It flags invalid frame sequences, HPACK decompression errors, and flow control violations with clear error messages. The tool also provides statistics on frame type distribution, stream concurrency levels, and compression effectiveness.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: TLS Encryption**\nProduction HTTP/2 typically uses TLS encryption, making Wireshark analysis impossible without access to the server's private key or client-side capture. Development environments should include plaintext HTTP/2 support specifically for debugging purposes, even though production deployments mandate encryption.\n\n**Protocol-Specific Logging**\n\nHTTP/2 debugging requires logging that captures protocol-level events with sufficient detail to reconstruct connection and stream state. Generic application logs are insufficient - you need frame-level logging, HPACK table state dumps, and stream state transition tracking.\n\nEffective HTTP/2 logging captures multiple event categories:\n\n| Log Category | Information Logged | Example Entry |\n|--------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Frame Processing | Type, flags, stream ID, payload size | `FRAME_RECV: DATA stream=3 len=1024 flags=END_STREAM` |\n| HPACK Operations | Table operations, compression ratios | `HPACK_ADD: :method=POST size=42 table_size=256` |\n| Stream Lifecycle | State transitions, creation, cleanup | `STREAM_TRANSITION: stream=5 OPEN→HALF_CLOSED_REMOTE` |\n| Flow Control | Window updates, backpressure events | `WINDOW_UPDATE: stream=7 delta=32768 new_window=65536` |\n| Error Conditions | Protocol violations, recovery actions | `PROTOCOL_ERROR: invalid frame type=99 on stream=1` |\n\nThe logging system must handle high-frequency events without impacting performance. Consider using structured logging formats (JSON) that support automated analysis and correlation across multiple log files.\n\n**Frame-Level Debugging**\n\nHTTP/2's binary framing requires debugging tools that can display raw frame contents alongside decoded interpretations. Frame-level debugging helps identify endianness bugs, length validation errors, and reserved bit violations that are not apparent in higher-level protocol analysis.\n\nFrame debugging output should include both hex dumps and structured field interpretation:\n\n```\nFrame Header (9 bytes): 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 03\n├─ Length: 0x000100 (256 bytes)\n├─ Type: 0x01 (HEADERS)\n├─ Flags: 0x00 (no flags set)\n└─ Stream ID: 0x00000003 (stream 3)\n\nPayload (256 bytes): 40 0a 3a 61 75 74 68 6f 72 69 74 79...\n├─ HPACK Block Fragment\n├─ First byte: 0x40 (literal with incremental indexing)\n└─ Huffman encoded: yes\n```\n\nFrame-level logging must capture both successful parsing events and error conditions with sufficient detail to diagnose the root cause. Include information about buffer states, parsing positions, and validation failures.\n\n**Connection State Monitoring**\n\nHTTP/2 connections maintain complex state that spans multiple streams, HPACK tables, flow control windows, and negotiated settings. Connection state monitoring provides a centralized view of the connection health and can identify systemic issues that affect multiple streams.\n\n| State Category | Monitored Values | Alert Conditions |\n|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Active Streams | Count, state distribution | Exceeds negotiated maximum |\n| HPACK Tables | Size, eviction rate | Frequent evictions, size violations |\n| Flow Control | Window levels, blocked streams | Window exhaustion, deadlocks |\n| Frame Statistics | Type distribution, error rates | High error rates, unusual patterns |\n| Settings | Negotiated values, changes | Incompatible settings, frequent changes |\n\nConnection monitoring should provide both real-time dashboards and historical trend analysis. Look for patterns like gradually increasing error rates, stream lifecycle anomalies, or flow control window exhaustion that indicate systematic problems.\n\n**Stream Correlation Analysis**\n\nMultiplexed streams share connection resources and can interfere with each other in subtle ways. Stream correlation analysis identifies cross-stream dependencies, resource contention, and cascading failure patterns that are not apparent when examining streams individually.\n\n| Correlation Pattern | Symptom | Likely Cause |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Simultaneous Stream Errors | Multiple streams fail together | Connection-level problem |\n| Flow Control Blocking | High-priority streams stalled | Connection window exhaustion |\n| Priority Inversion | Low-priority streams complete first | Scheduling algorithm bug |\n| Header Corruption | Random header values appear | HPACK table corruption |\n\nStream correlation requires aggregating events across multiple streams and identifying temporal relationships. Use time-based windowing to detect events that occur within close proximity and may be causally related.\n\n> The key insight for HTTP/2 debugging is that the protocol's multiplexed nature creates complex interaction patterns that are not visible when examining individual components in isolation. Effective debugging requires tools that can correlate events across streams, frames, and protocol layers to identify root causes.\n\n**Automated Testing and Fuzzing**\n\nHTTP/2's complexity makes it susceptible to edge case bugs that only appear under specific conditions. Automated testing and protocol fuzzing can identify implementation vulnerabilities by generating malformed frames, invalid state transitions, and resource exhaustion conditions.\n\nProtocol fuzzing strategies for HTTP/2:\n\n| Fuzzing Target | Technique | Expected Bugs |\n|----------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Frame Headers | Random byte sequences | Parsing crashes, buffer overflows |\n| HPACK Tables | Invalid indices, size violations | Table corruption, memory leaks |\n| Stream States | Illegal frame sequences | State machine violations |\n| Flow Control | Window overflow, underflow | Arithmetic errors, deadlocks |\n| Integer Encoding | Continuation byte manipulation | Infinite loops, overflow |\n\nImplement fuzz testing as part of the continuous integration pipeline, not just as a one-time validation exercise. The protocol's state-dependent behavior means that bugs may only appear after specific sequences of valid operations followed by malformed input.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete implementation approaches for building robust debugging capabilities into your HTTP/2 server, with specific focus on diagnostic logging, protocol validation, and troubleshooting workflows.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Logging Framework | Go standard log package |

Extensions\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section addresses potential enhancements beyond the core milestones, providing a roadmap for extending the HTTP/2 server with server push capabilities, advanced features, and performance optimizations that build upon the foundations established in milestones 1-4.\n\nThink of this HTTP/2 server implementation as building a solid house foundation - the four milestones establish the structural integrity with binary framing, header compression, stream management, and flow control. Future extensions are like adding modern amenities: server push is like installing a smart anticipatory system that delivers what you need before you ask, advanced features are like home automation that optimizes the experience, and performance optimizations are like upgrading to energy-efficient systems that handle more load with fewer resources. Each extension builds upon the proven foundation while adding capabilities that enhance the overall system's utility and efficiency.\n\nThe architecture established in the core milestones provides extension points specifically designed for these enhancements. The `StreamManager` can be extended to handle server-initiated streams, the `FrameRouter` can incorporate new frame types, and the flow control mechanisms can be enhanced with more sophisticated scheduling algorithms. Rather than retrofitting these features, the modular design allows for organic growth that maintains the system's integrity while expanding its capabilities.\n\n### Server Push: PUSH_PROMISE Frame Handling and Resource Push Strategies\n\nServer push represents HTTP/2's most revolutionary feature - the ability for servers to proactively send resources before clients request them. Think of traditional HTTP as a restaurant where you must order each course individually, waiting for delivery before requesting the next item. Server push transforms this into a tasting menu experience where the chef anticipates your needs and delivers complementary items that enhance the main course, all arriving in perfectly timed coordination.\n\nThe mental model for server push centers around predictive resource delivery. When a client requests an HTML page, the server can analyze the page content and identify critical resources - CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, or fonts - that the browser will inevitably request. Rather than waiting for these subsequent requests, the server initiates push streams to deliver these resources immediately, reducing overall page load time by eliminating round-trip latency.\n\n> **Decision: PUSH_PROMISE Frame Implementation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Server push requires introducing new frame types and stream management patterns not covered in the core milestones, while maintaining compatibility with existing stream lifecycle management\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Extend existing `StreamManager` with push-specific methods\n>   2. Create separate `PushManager` component with dedicated stream handling\n>   3. Implement push as application-layer feature above HTTP/2 protocol layer\n> - **Decision**: Extend `StreamManager` with push capabilities while adding `PushManager` for policy decisions\n> - **Rationale**: Push streams follow the same lifecycle as client streams but with server initiation, making `StreamManager` extension natural while `PushManager` handles the application logic of what to push\n> - **Consequences**: Maintains consistency with existing stream management while cleanly separating protocol mechanics from push policy decisions\n\n#### PUSH_PROMISE Frame Structure and Processing\n\nThe `PUSH_PROMISE` frame serves as the server's contract with the client, declaring intent to push a specific resource while providing the request headers that would have been sent if the client had initiated the request. This frame type extends the binary framing engine established in Milestone 1 with server-specific semantics.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Length | `uint32` | Frame payload length excluding 9-byte header |\n| Type | `uint8` | `FrameTypePUSH_PROMISE` (0x5) for push promise frames |\n| Flags | `uint8` | `FlagEndHeaders` (0x4) indicates complete headers or continuation needed |\n| StreamID | `uint32` | Parent stream ID that triggered this push promise |\n| PromisedStreamID | `uint32` | New server-initiated stream ID for the pushed resource |\n| HeaderBlock | `[]byte` | HPACK-compressed headers representing the synthetic request |\n\nThe frame processing workflow integrates with the existing frame routing infrastructure while introducing server-initiated stream creation. When the server decides to push a resource, it constructs a `PUSH_PROMISE` frame containing the synthetic request headers that represent the client request that would have fetched this resource. The promised stream ID must follow HTTP/2's server stream allocation rules - even numbers starting from 2 and increasing monotonically.\n\n```\nPUSH_PROMISE Frame Processing Algorithm:\n1. Server application identifies resource candidate for pushing\n2. Validate that parent stream is in open or half-closed-remote state\n3. Allocate next available server stream ID (even number)\n4. Construct synthetic request headers for the resource\n5. Compress headers using connection's HPACK context\n6. Create PUSH_PROMISE frame with parent stream ID and promised stream ID\n7. Send PUSH_PROMISE frame to client before sending any DATA frames\n8. Create new stream in reserved-local state for the promised stream\n9. Begin sending HEADERS and DATA frames on the promised stream\n10. Handle potential RST_STREAM from client if push is rejected\n```\n\nThe integration with existing flow control mechanisms requires careful consideration. Pushed streams consume connection-level and stream-level windows just like client-initiated streams. However, the server must be more conservative with push resources since the client may not actually need them, potentially wasting bandwidth and window space.\n\n#### Push Policy and Resource Selection\n\nThe most critical aspect of effective server push lies not in the protocol mechanics but in the intelligent selection of resources to push. Think of this as a restaurant server learning customer preferences - push too aggressively and you overwhelm the client with unwanted resources, push too conservatively and you miss opportunities to improve performance. The optimal strategy balances proactive resource delivery with respectful bandwidth usage.\n\n| Push Strategy | Trigger | Candidate Resources | Pros | Cons |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|------|------|\n| Static Analysis | HTML response generation | Referenced CSS, JS, critical images | Simple implementation, predictable behavior | Doesn't account for client cache state |\n| Dependency Graph | Resource request patterns | Resources with high co-occurrence probability | Data-driven decisions, adapts over time | Requires learning phase, complex state management |\n| Link Header Hints | Application-provided hints | Developer-specified critical resources | Developer control, explicit intent | Requires application modification, manual maintenance |\n| Cache Integration | Client cache headers | Resources known to be stale or missing | Avoids redundant pushes, efficient bandwidth usage | Complex cache state tracking, privacy implications |\n\nThe `PushManager` component encapsulates push policy decisions while integrating with the existing stream and connection management infrastructure:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `EvaluatePushCandidates` | `parentStreamID uint32, responseHeaders http.Header` | `[]PushCandidate, error` | Analyzes response content and identifies resources suitable for pushing |\n| `ValidatePushRequest` | `candidate PushCandidate, connectionState *ConnectionState` | `bool, error` | Checks push eligibility considering client settings, window availability, and stream limits |\n| `CreatePushPromise` | `parentStreamID uint32, resource PushCandidate` | `*Frame, uint32, error` | Constructs PUSH_PROMISE frame and allocates promised stream ID |\n| `HandlePushRejection` | `promisedStreamID uint32, errorCode uint32` | `error` | Processes RST_STREAM cancellation of promised stream and updates push policy |\n\nThe push candidate evaluation process requires analyzing response content to identify linked resources. For HTML responses, this involves parsing the document structure to find stylesheet links, script tags, image references, and font declarations. The challenge lies in distinguishing critical resources that improve page load time from optional resources that might waste bandwidth.\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Overly Aggressive Push Policies**\n> \n> A common mistake is pushing every resource referenced in an HTML page, overwhelming clients with unwanted data. This wastes bandwidth and can actually harm performance by consuming flow control windows needed for client-requested resources. Instead, focus on critical resources that block page rendering - typically CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files in the document head - while avoiding speculative pushes of optional content like tracking pixels or below-the-fold images.\n\n#### Push Stream Lifecycle Management\n\nServer push introduces a unique stream lifecycle where the server creates streams proactively rather than reactively. Think of this as the difference between a traditional store where customers browse and request items versus a subscription service where the provider anticipates needs and delivers items before explicit requests. The server must manage this anticipatory relationship while respecting client autonomy to reject unwanted pushes.\n\nThe pushed stream lifecycle follows a modified version of the standard HTTP/2 stream state machine:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------------|\n| Non-existent | `PUSH_PROMISE` sent | `StateReservedLocal` | Allocate stream ID, reserve flow control windows |\n| `StateReservedLocal` | `HEADERS` frame sent | `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Begin response transmission, no client data expected |\n| `StateHalfClosedRemote` | `DATA` frame sent | `StateHalfClosedRemote` | Continue response transmission |\n| `StateHalfClosedRemote` | `DATA` frame with `END_STREAM` | `StateClosed` | Complete response, release resources |\n| `StateReservedLocal` | `RST_STREAM` received | `StateClosed` | Cancel push, release resources, update policy |\n| Any | Connection error | `StateClosed` | Cleanup all pushed streams |\n\nThe key difference from client-initiated streams is that pushed streams never receive request data from the client - they transition directly from reserved to half-closed-remote state. This simplification reduces the complexity of state management while requiring careful handling of the reservation phase where the client might reject the push.\n\nPush stream integration with the existing `StreamManager` requires extending the stream allocation logic to handle server-initiated streams:\n\n| Method Extension | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `CreatePushedStream` | `parentStreamID uint32, promisedStreamID uint32` | `*Stream, error` | Creates new stream in reserved-local state linked to parent |\n| `ValidatePushCapacity` | `requestedPushes int` | `bool, error` | Checks if connection can handle additional pushed streams within limits |\n| `HandlePushRejection` | `promisedStreamID uint32` | `error` | Transitions rejected push stream to closed state and updates counters |\n| `GetPushedStreams` | `parentStreamID uint32` | `[]uint32, error` | Returns list of pushed stream IDs associated with parent stream |\n\n#### Client Push Settings and Negotiation\n\nHTTP/2 provides clients with granular control over server push behavior through the `SETTINGS` frame mechanism established in the core milestones. Think of this as a preferences dialog where clients can express their push tolerance - some clients on limited bandwidth connections might disable push entirely, while others might allow moderate pushing for critical resources only.\n\nThe client communicates push preferences through specific settings parameters:\n\n| Setting Parameter | Value Range | Default | Description |\n|-------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` | 0 or 1 | 1 | Global enable/disable flag for all server push |\n| `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` | 0 to 2^31-1 | No limit | Includes both regular and pushed streams in the limit |\n| `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` | 1 to 2^31-1 | 65535 | Applies to pushed streams, affecting push aggressiveness |\n\nThe server must respect these settings when making push decisions. When `SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH` is set to 0, the server must not send any `PUSH_PROMISE` frames. When concurrent stream limits are reached, the server should prioritize client-initiated streams over new pushes. The initial window size affects how much data can be pushed immediately, influencing the cost-benefit calculation for push candidates.\n\nPush settings integration requires extending the connection's settings management:\n\n```\nPush Settings Validation Algorithm:\n1. Receive SETTINGS frame from client during connection establishment\n2. Extract SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH value and store in connection state\n3. If push is disabled, mark connection as push-prohibited\n4. For enabled push, extract concurrent stream and window size limits\n5. Use these limits in push candidate evaluation decisions\n6. Send SETTINGS acknowledgment to confirm receipt\n7. Apply settings to all future push decisions on this connection\n8. Handle settings updates during connection lifetime\n```\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: Server push is fundamentally about respecting client autonomy while providing performance benefits. The server proposes resources it believes will be helpful, but the client retains ultimate authority to accept or reject these proposals. This cooperative model ensures that push enhances rather than harms the client experience.\n\n### Advanced Features: Connection Coalescing, Alternative Services, and HTTP/2 Extensions\n\nBeyond the core HTTP/2 protocol features, several advanced capabilities can significantly enhance server performance and client experience. Think of these as professional-grade features that distinguish a production-ready server from a basic implementation - connection coalescing is like having multiple storefronts share a single efficient warehouse, alternative services provide flexible routing options like having multiple delivery methods, and protocol extensions enable future-proofing like modular upgrades to a building's infrastructure.\n\nThese advanced features build upon the solid foundation of the core milestones while introducing sophisticated optimizations that require careful design to maintain the system's reliability and performance characteristics. Each feature addresses specific limitations or inefficiencies in basic HTTP/2 operations while maintaining backward compatibility and protocol compliance.\n\n#### Connection Coalescing and Certificate Management\n\nConnection coalescing allows a single HTTP/2 connection to serve multiple hostnames that share certificate authority, reducing connection overhead and improving resource utilization. Think of this as a shared transportation system where multiple destinations can be reached via the same efficient route, rather than establishing separate pathways for each destination.\n\nThe mental model centers around certificate-based trust relationships. When a server presents a certificate valid for multiple hostnames, or when multiple hostnames resolve to the same IP address with compatible certificates, clients can reuse existing connections rather than establishing new ones. This reduces TLS handshake overhead, connection state memory usage, and overall latency.\n\n| Coalescing Strategy | Certificate Requirement | Implementation Complexity | Performance Benefit |\n|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Same Certificate | Single cert covers multiple hostnames via SAN | Low - simple hostname validation | High - eliminates redundant connections |\n| Wildcard Certificate | Wildcard cert matches subdomain pattern | Medium - pattern matching logic | Medium - reduces connections for subdomain services |\n| Authority Validation | Different certs with same CA and compatible policies | High - certificate chain analysis | Low - limited applicability |\n\nThe server implementation requires extending connection management to track hostname associations and certificate coverage:\n\n| Component Extension | Responsibility | Key Methods |\n|--------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| `CertificateManager` | Validates hostname coverage and certificate compatibility | `ValidateHostname`, `GetCoalescingCandidates` |\n| `ConnectionPool` | Manages shared connections across hostnames | `FindCoalescableConnection`, `RegisterHostname` |\n| `HostRouter` | Routes requests to appropriate handlers based on hostname | `ResolveHandler`, `ValidateHostnameRequest` |\n\nConnection coalescing requires careful validation to prevent security violations. The server must ensure that requests for different hostnames are truly authorized to share the same connection based on certificate coverage and organizational policies. This involves validating Subject Alternative Names (SAN) in certificates and checking that hostname resolution points to the same server infrastructure.\n\n```\nConnection Coalescing Algorithm:\n1. Client establishes connection to hostname A with certificate validation\n2. Client needs connection to hostname B on the same IP address\n3. Server validates that existing certificate covers hostname B via SAN or wildcard\n4. If valid, server accepts requests for hostname B on existing connection A\n5. Server routes requests based on :authority header to appropriate handlers\n6. Server maintains mapping of hostname to connection for future requests\n7. If certificate validation fails, client establishes separate connection\n8. Connection cleanup considers all associated hostnames\n```\n\n#### Alternative Services and Protocol Negotiation\n\nAlternative Services (Alt-Svc) enable servers to advertise different protocol endpoints for the same service, allowing clients to upgrade to more efficient protocols or use different network paths. Think of this as a service directory that tells clients about faster or more reliable ways to reach the same destination - like suggesting a high-speed rail option when someone asks for directions to a city accessible by regular roads.\n\nThe Alt-Svc mechanism operates through HTTP response headers that advertise protocol alternatives:\n\n| Header Format | Example | Description |\n|---------------|---------|-------------|\n| `Alt-Svc: protocol=\"hostname:port\"; ma=seconds` | `Alt-Svc: h2=\"api.example.com:443\"; ma=3600` | Advertises HTTP/2 on specific endpoint with max-age |\n| `Alt-Svc: protocol=\":port\"; ma=seconds` | `Alt-Svc: h2=\":8443\"; ma=7200` | Advertises protocol on same hostname, different port |\n| `Alt-Svc: clear` | `Alt-Svc: clear` | Clears all previously advertised alternatives |\n\nAlternative services integration requires extending the server's response generation to include Alt-Svc advertisements based on available protocol endpoints:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `AdvertiseAlternatives` | `request *http.Request, config *AltSvcConfig` | `string, error` | Generates Alt-Svc header value based on available alternatives |\n| `ValidateAlternative` | `protocol string, endpoint string` | `bool, error` | Checks if advertised alternative is actually available |\n| `HandleAltSvcRequest` | `altEndpoint string, request *http.Request` | `*http.Response, error` | Processes request via alternative service endpoint |\n| `UpdateAltSvcCache` | `hostname string, alternatives []Alternative` | `error` | Updates client cache with new alternative service information |\n\n> **Decision: Alt-Svc Implementation Scope**\n> - **Context**: Alternative Services can advertise various protocols including HTTP/3, WebSocket, and custom protocols, but our implementation focuses on HTTP/2 improvements\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Full Alt-Svc implementation supporting all protocols\n>   2. HTTP/2-specific Alt-Svc for port and hostname alternatives\n>   3. Static configuration-based alternative advertisement\n> - **Decision**: HTTP/2-specific Alt-Svc with configuration-based alternatives\n> - **Rationale**: Stays within project scope while providing practical benefits for load balancing and protocol optimization\n> - **Consequences**: Enables performance improvements through better endpoint selection while avoiding complexity of multi-protocol support\n\n#### HTTP/2 Protocol Extensions\n\nThe HTTP/2 specification defines extension mechanisms that allow for future protocol enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility. Think of these as expansion slots in computer hardware - they provide standardized ways to add new capabilities without redesigning the entire system. Common extensions include new frame types, additional settings parameters, and enhanced flow control mechanisms.\n\nProtocol extension support requires designing the frame processing pipeline to handle unknown frame types gracefully while providing hooks for extension registration:\n\n| Extension Category | Examples | Implementation Impact |\n|-------------------|----------|----------------------|\n| New Frame Types | `ORIGIN`, `CACHE_DIGEST`, experimental frames | Requires extensible frame router with registration mechanism |\n| Settings Extensions | `SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL` | Extends settings validation and negotiation logic |\n| Header Extensions | New pseudo-headers, custom compression dictionaries | Requires HPACK extension points and validation updates |\n| Flow Control Extensions | Priority-based windows, quality-of-service parameters | Extends window management with new scheduling algorithms |\n\nThe extensible frame processing architecture builds upon the frame router established in the core milestones:\n\n| Component | Extension Point | Description |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| `FrameRegistry` | Frame type registration | Allows registration of custom frame handlers |\n| `ExtensibleRouter` | Plugin-based routing | Routes unknown frame types to registered extensions |\n| `ExtensionManager` | Extension lifecycle | Manages loading, initialization, and cleanup of extensions |\n\n```\nExtension Registration Algorithm:\n1. Extension module registers frame type handlers during server initialization\n2. Frame router builds dispatch table including both standard and extension handlers\n3. During frame processing, router checks for registered handler for frame type\n4. If handler exists, delegates frame processing to extension\n5. Extension processes frame according to its specific semantics\n6. Extension returns processing result to router for further dispatch\n7. Unknown frame types without handlers are ignored per HTTP/2 specification\n8. Connection errors in extensions are handled gracefully without affecting core protocol\n```\n\n### Performance Optimizations: Connection Pooling, Memory Management, and High-Performance I/O Patterns\n\nProduction HTTP/2 servers require sophisticated optimizations to handle thousands of concurrent connections while maintaining low latency and high throughput. Think of these optimizations as the difference between a hobbyist workshop and a professional manufacturing facility - the basic functionality might be similar, but the operational efficiency, resource utilization, and scalability characteristics are fundamentally different.\n\nThese optimizations build upon the architectural foundation established in the core milestones, enhancing rather than replacing the basic functionality. The key insight is that performance improvements must maintain correctness - a fast but incorrect implementation provides no value in production environments.\n\n#### Connection Pooling and Resource Management\n\nConnection pooling in HTTP/2 differs fundamentally from HTTP/1.1 pooling due to the persistent, multiplexed nature of HTTP/2 connections. Think of HTTP/1.1 connection pooling as managing a fleet of single-passenger vehicles, while HTTP/2 connection pooling is like managing a smaller fleet of high-capacity buses. Each connection can handle many simultaneous streams, so the optimization focus shifts from connection quantity to connection quality and longevity.\n\nThe mental model centers around connection lifecycle management and resource efficiency. Rather than creating and destroying connections frequently, the server maintains long-lived connections that efficiently multiplex many concurrent requests. The challenge lies in balancing connection reuse with resource cleanup, handling connection failures gracefully, and managing memory usage across long-lived connections.\n\n| Pooling Strategy | Connection Lifetime | Resource Usage | Complexity |\n|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|\n| Fixed Pool Size | Predetermined connection limit | Predictable memory footprint | Low - simple connection allocation |\n| Dynamic Scaling | Connections created/destroyed based on load | Variable memory usage | Medium - requires load monitoring |\n| Adaptive Pooling | ML-based prediction of optimal pool size | Optimized for current traffic patterns | High - requires traffic analysis |\n| Hybrid Approach | Fixed baseline with dynamic expansion | Balanced resource usage and performance | Medium - configurable thresholds |\n\nThe connection pool implementation extends the basic connection management with sophisticated lifecycle and resource tracking:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Key Methods |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| `ConnectionPool` | Manages pool of active connections with lifecycle tracking | `AcquireConnection`, `ReleaseConnection`, `HealthCheck` |\n| `ConnectionFactory` | Creates new connections with proper configuration | `CreateConnection`, `ConfigureConnection`, `ValidateConnection` |\n| `ResourceMonitor` | Tracks resource usage and triggers cleanup | `MonitorUsage`, `TriggerCleanup`, `ReportMetrics` |\n| `LoadBalancer` | Distributes new streams across available connections | `SelectConnection`, `UpdateWeights`, `HandleFailure` |\n\nConnection pooling requires sophisticated health monitoring to detect and handle connection failures:\n\n```\nConnection Health Monitoring Algorithm:\n1. Monitor connection for signs of degradation: high error rates, slow responses, timeout errors\n2. Implement periodic ping/pong frames to validate connection liveness\n3. Track per-connection metrics: active streams, error count, response times\n4. When degradation detected, mark connection for drainage\n5. Stop assigning new streams to degraded connection\n6. Allow existing streams to complete naturally\n7. Once all streams complete, close connection gracefully\n8. Create replacement connection if pool size drops below minimum\n9. Update load balancing weights based on connection performance\n10. Log connection lifecycle events for operational monitoring\n```\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Connection Pool Memory Leaks**\n> \n> Long-lived HTTP/2 connections can accumulate memory leaks through HPACK dynamic tables, stream metadata, and buffered data. Implement periodic connection recycling where connections are gracefully closed and replaced after handling a certain number of requests or after a time threshold. This prevents memory usage from growing unboundedly while maintaining the performance benefits of connection reuse.\n\n#### Memory Management and Garbage Collection Optimization\n\nHTTP/2's binary framing and multiplexing create unique memory management challenges compared to HTTP/1.1. Think of HTTP/1.1 memory usage as individual meals - each request consumes memory temporarily and cleans up completely when finished. HTTP/2 is more like a buffet restaurant where multiple customers share common resources, requiring careful management of shared state and resource cleanup.\n\nThe primary memory consumers in HTTP/2 implementations include HPACK dynamic tables, stream metadata, frame buffers, and flow control windows. Each component requires different optimization strategies based on its usage patterns and lifecycle characteristics.\n\n| Memory Component | Growth Pattern | Optimization Strategy |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| HPACK Dynamic Tables | Grows with unique headers, bounded by table size | Implement aggressive eviction, header value deduplication |\n| Stream Metadata | Linear growth with concurrent streams | Use object pooling, lazy initialization of optional fields |\n| Frame Buffers | Temporary growth during frame processing | Buffer pooling, size-based buffer selection |\n| Flow Control State | Fixed size per stream, linear with stream count | Pack bit fields, use efficient data structures |\n\nMemory optimization requires implementing object pooling and buffer reuse strategies that reduce garbage collection pressure:\n\n| Pool Type | Object Lifecycle | Reuse Strategy |\n|-----------|-----------------|----------------|\n| `FramePool` | Frame objects for parsing/serialization | Size-based pools for different frame types |\n| `BufferPool` | Byte slices for frame payloads | Power-of-two sized buffers with size classification |\n| `StreamPool` | Stream metadata objects | Pool unused stream objects after cleanup |\n| `HeaderPool` | Header entry objects for HPACK | Reuse header entry objects in dynamic table |\n\nThe buffer management system requires careful design to balance memory efficiency with allocation performance:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `AcquireBuffer` | `size int` | `[]byte, error` | Gets appropriately sized buffer from pool |\n| `ReleaseBuffer` | `buffer []byte` | `error` | Returns buffer to pool for reuse |\n| `OptimizePool` | `usage PoolUsage` | `error` | Adjusts pool sizes based on usage patterns |\n| `ReportMemoryStats` | `none` | `MemoryStats, error` | Provides detailed memory usage breakdown |\n\n```\nBuffer Pool Optimization Algorithm:\n1. Classify buffer requests into size categories (small: <1KB, medium: 1-16KB, large: >16KB)\n2. Maintain separate pools for each size category with different retention policies\n3. For small buffers, maintain larger pool sizes due to high turnover\n4. For large buffers, maintain smaller pools and implement aggressive cleanup\n5. Monitor pool hit rates and adjust pool sizes dynamically\n6. Implement buffer zeroing for security-sensitive data\n7. Use sync.Pool for garbage collector integration where appropriate\n8. Implement buffer leak detection in debug builds\n```\n\n#### High-Performance I/O Patterns and Zero-Copy Operations\n\nHTTP/2's binary framing enables sophisticated I/O optimizations that minimize data copying and system call overhead. Think of traditional I/O as manually carrying individual packages between buildings, while optimized I/O is like using conveyor belts and automated systems that move data efficiently with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe key optimization opportunities include zero-copy frame transmission, vectored I/O for multiple frames, and direct memory mapping for large payloads. These techniques require careful integration with the existing frame processing pipeline while maintaining correctness and security properties.\n\n| I/O Pattern | Optimization Technique | Performance Benefit | Implementation Complexity |\n|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Frame Writing | Vectored I/O with writev() syscall | Reduces syscall overhead | Medium - requires frame batching |\n| Large Payloads | sendfile() or splice() for zero-copy | Eliminates user-space copying | High - requires file descriptor management |\n| Frame Reading | Read buffer management and parsing optimization | Reduces memory allocation | Medium - requires careful buffer handling |\n| TLS Integration | TLS record alignment with HTTP/2 frames | Optimizes encryption overhead | High - requires TLS library integration |\n\nHigh-performance I/O requires extending the connection layer with optimized read/write operations:\n\n| Method Extension | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `WriteFrameVector` | `frames []*Frame` | `int, error` | Writes multiple frames in single syscall |\n| `ReadFrameBuffer` | `buffer []byte, offset int` | `*Frame, int, error` | Parses frame from existing buffer |\n| `SendFile` | `file *os.File, offset, size int64` | `int64, error` | Zero-copy file transmission for DATA frames |\n| `EnableWriteBuffering` | `size int` | `error` | Configures write buffering for small frames |\n\n```\nZero-Copy Frame Transmission Algorithm:\n1. Identify DATA frames with file-backed payloads larger than threshold\n2. Validate that file descriptor is suitable for sendfile() operation\n3. Construct HTTP/2 frame header and write to connection\n4. Use sendfile() syscall to transmit file content directly from kernel\n5. Update flow control windows without copying payload data\n6. Handle partial transmissions and retry logic for incomplete sends\n7. Fall back to regular I/O for small payloads or non-file data\n8. Maintain frame boundary alignment for HTTP/2 protocol compliance\n```\n\nThe vectored I/O implementation batches multiple small frames into single system calls, reducing the overhead of frequent syscall invocations:\n\n| Batching Strategy | Frame Selection | Latency Impact | Throughput Benefit |\n|------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Time-based batching | All frames ready within timeout window | Adds controlled latency | High - amortizes syscall cost |\n| Size-based batching | Frames until total size reaches threshold | Minimal latency impact | Medium - balances latency and throughput |\n| Priority-aware batching | High priority frames bypass batching | Preserves priority semantics | Medium - some frames skip optimization |\n\n> **Key Performance Insight**: The most significant performance improvements in HTTP/2 come from reducing per-frame overhead rather than optimizing individual operations. Focus on batching operations, reusing objects, and minimizing memory allocations rather than micro-optimizing individual frame processing steps. The multiplexed nature of HTTP/2 means that small per-frame improvements compound dramatically across hundreds of concurrent streams.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance provides practical directions for extending the HTTP/2 server with the advanced features described above. The focus is on providing concrete starting points that integrate cleanly with the existing codebase while enabling incremental development of these sophisticated features.\n\n#### Technology

supporting all milestones (1-4) by establishing a common vocabulary for HTTP/2 concepts, frame types, HPACK compression terms, and protocol-specific terminology needed throughout the implementation.\n\nThis glossary serves as a comprehensive reference for HTTP/2 terminology encountered throughout the server implementation. Think of it as a technical dictionary that bridges the gap between RFC specifications and practical implementation. Just as a software engineer keeps API documentation handy while coding, this glossary provides quick access to precise definitions that prevent misunderstandings and implementation errors.\n\nThe terminology is organized into logical categories that align with the implementation milestones, making it easy to reference the appropriate vocabulary while working on specific components. Each definition includes not just the meaning but also implementation context and common usage patterns.\n\n### HTTP/2 Core Concepts\n\nThese fundamental terms form the conceptual foundation of HTTP/2 and appear throughout all implementation phases.\n\n| Term | Definition | Implementation Context |\n|------|------------|----------------------|\n| **multiplexing** | The ability to handle multiple concurrent request-response sequences (streams) over a single TCP connection, with frames from different streams interleaved | Core architectural principle enabling concurrent stream processing without head-of-line blocking |\n| **head-of-line blocking** | Performance limitation in HTTP/1.1 where a slow request blocks all subsequent requests on the same connection, forcing browsers to open multiple connections | Problem that HTTP/2 multiplexing solves by allowing independent stream processing |\n| **binary framing** | HTTP/2's structured binary protocol format that replaces HTTP/1.1's text-based message format with typed, length-prefixed frames | Foundation for efficient parsing and protocol extensibility in Milestone 1 |\n| **stream** | An independent, bidirectional sequence of frames within an HTTP/2 connection, corresponding to a single request-response exchange | Primary unit of request processing managed by the Stream Manager component |\n| **connection state** | The overall configuration and active stream tracking for an HTTP/2 connection, including settings, flow control windows, and stream registry | Maintained by Connection component and shared across all processing components |\n| **server push** | Proactive resource delivery mechanism where the server sends resources before the client explicitly requests them, based on anticipated needs | Advanced feature for performance optimization, typically implemented after core functionality |\n| **scope creep** | The gradual expansion of project requirements beyond originally defined goals, particularly problematic in complex protocol implementations | Development risk managed through explicit non-goals and milestone boundaries |\n\n### Frame Types and Structure\n\nHTTP/2 uses typed frames as the basic unit of communication.

using transmission permission tokens to prevent receiver overload | Dual-level system with both connection and stream windows |\n| **credit-based system** | Flow control mechanism where receivers grant transmission credits via WINDOW_UPDATE frames, and senders track available credits | Requires careful accounting to prevent underflow and synchronization issues |\n| **hierarchical windows** |

Tracking and updating of flow control window sizes through WINDOW_UPDATE frame processing and credit consumption | Central component coordinating between connection and stream flow control |\n| **backpressure handling** | Data queueing mechanism when flow control windows are exhausted, with automatic resumption when credits become available | Prevents data loss while respecting receiver

Size** | 2^31 - 1 | Flow control | Arithmetic overflow protection |\n\n### Common Implementation Patterns\n\nUnderstanding these patterns helps avoid typical HTTP/2 implementation mistakes and follows established practices.\n\n> **Design Insight: Error Boundary Principles**\n>\n> HTTP/2's error handling philosophy prioritizes fault isolation - containing errors at the smallest possible scope. Stream errors should remain stream errors unless they indicate broader corruption like HPACK table inconsistency. This principle guides implementation decisions throughout the protocol stack.\n\n> **Design Insight: State Machine Complexity**\n>\n> Stream state machines appear complex but follow logical patterns based on frame semantics. The `END_STREAM` flag drives most transitions, while `RST_STREAM` provides emergency termination from any state. Understanding these patterns simplifies implementation and debugging.\n\n> **Design Insight: Flow Control Philosophy**\n>\n> HTTP/2 flow control implements receiver-driven backpressure, meaning receivers control the rate at which they consume data. This inverts traditional congestion control and requires careful coordination between connection and stream windows to prevent deadlocks.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance provides practical advice for using the terminology correctly in code and avoiding common vocabulary-related mistakes.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Protocol Constants | Hard-coded constants in main package | Separate constants package with documentation |\n| Error Definitions | Simple error codes with string messages | Structured error types with context and recovery hints |\n| State Tracking | Basic enum values with switch statements | State machine framework with transition validation |\n| Logging Framework | Standard library logging with structured fields | Specialized HTTP/2 protocol logger with frame inspection |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\ninternal/http2/\n  constants.go              ← Protocol constants and frame type definitions\n  errors.go                 ← Error codes and structured error types\n  glossary.go              ← Terminology validation and documentation helpers\n  frame_types.go           ← Frame type constants and flag definitions\n  state_machine.go         ← Stream state constants and transition validation\n  hpack_constants.go       ← HPACK-specific constants and table definitions\n  flow_control_constants.go ← Flow control limits and default values\n```\n\n#### Protocol Constants Implementation\n\n```go\npackage http2\n\n// Frame type constants as defined in RFC 7540\nconst (\n    FrameTypeDATA         uint8 = 0x0\n    FrameTypeHEADERS      uint8 = 0x1\n    FrameTypePRIORITY     uint8 = 0x2\n    FrameTypeRST_STREAM   uint8 = 0x3\n    FrameTypeSETTINGS     uint8 = 0x4\n    FrameTypePUSH_PROMISE uint8 = 0x5\n    FrameTypePING         uint8 = 0x6\n    FrameTypeGOAWAY       uint8 = 0x7\n    FrameTypeWINDOW_UPDATE uint8 = 0x8\n    FrameTypeCONTINUATION uint8 = 0x9\n)\n\n// Frame flag constants\nconst (\n    FlagEndStream   uint8 = 0x1\n    FlagAck         uint8 = 0x1  // For SETTINGS and PING frames\n    FlagEndHeaders  uint8 = 0x4\n    FlagPadded      uint8 = 0x8\n    FlagPriority    uint8 = 0x20 // For HEADERS frame\n)\n\n// Protocol limits and defaults\nconst (\n    MaxFrameSize     uint32 = (1 << 24) -
