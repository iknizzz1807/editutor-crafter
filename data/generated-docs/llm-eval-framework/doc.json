The key architectural challenge is building a scalable, extensible evaluation pipeline that handles diverse metrics while maintaining result reproducibility and providing actionable insights for model performance optimization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - Understanding the evaluation challenge is foundational to all components</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-llm-evaluation-challenge\">The LLM Evaluation Challenge</h3>\n<p>Think of evaluating a large language model like trying to grade a creative writing exam where the test questions are open-ended essays, there are multiple valid answers to each question, and the grading criteria themselves are subjective and context-dependent. Unlike traditional software testing where you can assert that <code>add(2, 3) == 5</code>, evaluating language models requires measuring qualities like coherence, factual accuracy, helpfulness, and style—none of which have simple binary answers.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge stems from the <strong>generative and probabilistic nature</strong> of language models. Traditional software systems are deterministic: given the same input, they produce the same output every time. This makes testing straightforward—you define expected outputs and compare actual results. Language models, however, are designed to be creative and varied in their responses. The same prompt can yield dozens of different but equally valid answers, each with subtle differences in tone, structure, and approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Statistical evaluation</strong> becomes necessary because individual test cases don&#39;t provide reliable signals about model quality. A model might fail spectacularly on one carefully crafted prompt while excelling on a hundred similar ones. The evaluation system must aggregate results across large datasets to identify genuine patterns versus random variation. This requires sophisticated statistical analysis, confidence intervals, and significance testing—concepts foreign to traditional software QA processes.</p>\n<p>The <strong>multi-dimensional nature of language quality</strong> adds another layer of complexity. A single response might be factually accurate but poorly written, or beautifully crafted but misleading. Traditional metrics like exact string matching are inadequate. Evaluation frameworks must simultaneously measure multiple aspects: factual correctness, grammatical quality, coherence, relevance, helpfulness, safety, and alignment with instructions. Each dimension may require different measurement approaches and may conflict with others.</p>\n<p><strong>Context dependency</strong> makes evaluation even more challenging. The quality of a language model response depends heavily on the specific use case, domain, and user expectations. A response that&#39;s excellent for a creative writing assistant might be terrible for a medical information system. The evaluation framework must support domain-specific metrics, configurable quality criteria, and the ability to slice results by different contexts and use cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale and efficiency</strong> concerns emerge quickly in production environments. Comprehensive evaluation might involve thousands of test cases across dozens of metrics, each requiring expensive API calls to language models. The evaluation process itself often uses LLMs as judges, multiplying the computational cost. The framework must handle batch processing, parallel execution, caching, and graceful degradation when API limits are reached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Unlike traditional software where bugs are binary (the code works or it doesn&#39;t), language model evaluation deals with degrees of quality across multiple subjective dimensions. This requires statistical thinking, not deterministic assertions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>reproducibility challenge</strong> is particularly acute for LLM evaluation. Language models are often non-deterministic by design, using temperature settings and sampling to introduce controlled randomness. External API-based models may change their behavior over time as providers update their systems. Evaluation results must be reproducible despite these sources of variation, requiring careful control of randomness, model versioning, and baseline management.</p>\n<p><strong>Human alignment</strong> presents the ultimate evaluation challenge. The goal isn&#39;t just technical correctness but alignment with human judgment and preferences. This requires expensive human annotation to establish ground truth, sophisticated techniques like LLM-as-judge evaluation where models evaluate other models, and continuous calibration against human preferences. The framework must support both automated metrics and human-in-the-loop evaluation workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"current-evaluation-landscape\">Current Evaluation Landscape</h3>\n<p>The current landscape of LLM evaluation tools reveals a fragmented ecosystem with significant gaps that prevent comprehensive, production-ready evaluation at scale. Understanding these limitations is crucial for designing an evaluation framework that addresses real-world needs rather than repeating existing mistakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Academic benchmarks and leaderboards</strong> dominate the current evaluation landscape, but they suffer from fundamental limitations when applied to production systems. Benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and BIG-bench focus on narrow task-specific performance metrics that don&#39;t translate well to real-world applications. These benchmarks typically measure performance on standardized datasets with pre-defined metrics, but production LLM applications often require custom evaluation criteria that reflect specific business requirements and user needs.</p>\n<p>The <strong>static nature</strong> of academic benchmarks creates additional problems. Models can be specifically optimized for benchmark performance without improving general capability, leading to Goodhart&#39;s law effects where &quot;when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot; Furthermore, benchmark datasets become contaminated over time as they&#39;re included in model training data, making historical comparisons unreliable. Production evaluation requires dynamic test suites that can evolve with the application and resist gaming.</p>\n<p><strong>Existing evaluation platforms</strong> like LangSmith, Weights &amp; Biases, and various open-source tools provide pieces of the evaluation puzzle but lack comprehensive solutions. These tools typically excel in specific areas while leaving significant gaps in others.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Platform Category</th>\n<th>Strengths</th>\n<th>Limitations</th>\n<th>Production Readiness</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Academic Benchmarks</td>\n<td>Standardized, reproducible, broad research adoption</td>\n<td>Static datasets, narrow metrics, gaming susceptibility</td>\n<td>Low - research focus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LangSmith/LangChain</td>\n<td>Good dataset management, LLM integration, versioning</td>\n<td>Limited metric types, vendor lock-in, scaling issues</td>\n<td>Medium - emerging platform</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>W&amp;B/MLOps Platforms</td>\n<td>Excellent experiment tracking, visualization, collaboration</td>\n<td>Generic ML focus, limited LLM-specific features</td>\n<td>Medium - requires customization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Open Source Tools</td>\n<td>Customizable, transparent, community-driven</td>\n<td>Fragmented, maintenance burden, limited support</td>\n<td>Low - requires significant investment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Solutions</td>\n<td>Perfect fit for specific needs, full control</td>\n<td>High development cost, maintenance burden, expertise required</td>\n<td>High - but expensive</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Metric limitations</strong> represent another critical gap in the current landscape. Most existing tools rely heavily on traditional NLP metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which measure surface-level text similarity but poorly capture semantic meaning, factual accuracy, or task-specific quality. While newer approaches like BERTScore and semantic similarity using embeddings show promise, they lack calibration and interpretability. Practitioners struggle to understand what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; semantic similarity score for their specific use case.</p>\n<p>The <strong>LLM-as-judge</strong> approach has emerged as a popular solution for more nuanced evaluation, where language models evaluate the outputs of other language models. However, current implementations suffer from inconsistency, bias, and lack of proper calibration. Different judge models can produce dramatically different scores for the same content, and there&#39;s insufficient tooling for ensuring judge reliability, detecting judge bias, or calibrating judge scores against human preferences.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability and cost management</strong> represent practical barriers that existing tools inadequately address. Comprehensive evaluation can require thousands of API calls, quickly becoming expensive and slow. Most tools lack sophisticated caching, batching, and rate limiting capabilities. They also struggle with the checkpoint and resume functionality necessary for large-scale evaluations that may be interrupted by API failures or resource constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration and workflow challenges</strong> prevent many organizations from adopting systematic evaluation practices. Existing tools often require significant integration work to fit into production workflows. They lack the CI/CD integration, automated regression detection, and reporting capabilities necessary for embedding evaluation into software development processes. Many tools assume data scientists will manually run evaluations rather than supporting automated, continuous evaluation pipelines.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Build Comprehensive Framework Rather Than Extend Existing Tools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Organizations need production-ready evaluation capabilities that current tools don&#39;t provide comprehensively</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Extend existing open-source tools with missing capabilities</li>\n<li>Integrate multiple existing tools into a unified workflow</li>\n<li>Build new comprehensive framework from scratch</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Build new framework with clean architecture and comprehensive feature set</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Existing tools have fundamental architectural limitations that prevent adding missing capabilities without major rewrites. Integration approaches create maintenance nightmares and still leave capability gaps. A purpose-built framework can address all requirements with consistent architecture.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Higher initial development cost but better long-term maintainability, feature completeness, and user experience. Avoids vendor lock-in and technical debt from working around existing tool limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Data management and versioning</strong> capabilities in existing tools are often inadequate for production needs. While tools like LangSmith provide basic dataset versioning, they lack the sophisticated diff, merge, and rollback capabilities necessary for managing evolving test suites in collaborative environments. They also struggle with large datasets, lacking efficient storage, querying, and sampling capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Statistical rigor</strong> is notably absent from most existing evaluation tools. They provide basic aggregation (mean, median) but lack the statistical testing, confidence intervals, and significance analysis necessary for making reliable comparisons between models or detecting genuine performance regressions versus random variation. This limitation prevents organizations from making data-driven decisions about model deployments and improvements.</p>\n<p>The <strong>reporting and analysis</strong> capabilities of current tools focus primarily on displaying individual scores rather than providing actionable insights. They lack sophisticated failure analysis, error clustering, and root cause analysis capabilities. Reports are often generic rather than tailored to specific stakeholders&#39; needs (engineers vs. product managers vs. executives).</p>\n<p><strong>Customization and extensibility</strong> represent final major limitations. While most tools claim to support custom metrics, the reality is often clunky plugin systems, limited documentation, and poor integration with the broader evaluation workflow. Organizations end up building significant custom tooling anyway, defeating the purpose of using existing platforms.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Evaluation Tool Selection Based on Demos Rather Than Production Needs</strong>\nMany organizations select evaluation tools based on impressive demos or marketing materials without thoroughly evaluating production requirements. They discover limitations only after significant integration work, leading to tool abandonment or expensive workarounds. Always evaluate tools against comprehensive production checklists including scale, customization, integration, and statistical capabilities.</p>\n<p>The market clearly needs a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines the dataset management capabilities of platforms like LangSmith, the statistical rigor of academic research tools, the scalability requirements of production systems, and the customization capabilities that organizations require for their specific use cases. This framework must be architecturally designed from the ground up to handle the unique challenges of LLM evaluation rather than adapting tools designed for traditional machine learning workflows.</p>\n<p>The <strong>emergence of foundation model evaluation</strong> as a distinct discipline requires specialized tooling that understands the unique characteristics of language models: their probabilistic outputs, multi-dimensional quality criteria, context dependency, and the need for both automated and human evaluation. Current tools approach LLM evaluation as an extension of traditional ML evaluation, missing opportunities for LLM-specific optimizations and capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The complexity of LLM evaluation requires careful technology selection and implementation planning.

Just as a medical laboratory provides standardized tests with reliable results that doctors can trust for diagnosis, our framework must provide standardized evaluation protocols that AI engineers can trust for model assessment. The laboratory analogy extends further: we need proper sample handling (dataset management), various diagnostic tests (metrics), efficient processing (parallel evaluation), and clear reports that enable actionable decisions.</p>\n<p>The framework&#39;s <strong>primary responsibility</strong> is to transform the chaotic, ad-hoc process of LLM evaluation into a systematic, reproducible, and scalable workflow. Currently, most teams evaluate their language models through manual spot-checking or simple accuracy calculations on small samples. This approach fails catastrophically as applications grow in complexity and scale. Our framework bridges this gap by providing enterprise-grade evaluation infrastructure that maintains scientific rigor while remaining accessible to practitioners.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-evaluation-capabilities\">Core Evaluation Capabilities</h4>\n<p>The framework must deliver <strong>comprehensive evaluation coverage</strong> across the full spectrum of language model applications. This means supporting both objective metrics like exact string matching and subjective metrics that require semantic understanding. The system treats evaluation as a multi-dimensional problem where different aspects of model performance require different measurement approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective measurement capabilities</strong> form the foundation of the evaluation system. The framework implements exact match scoring with configurable normalization options, allowing teams to specify whether whitespace, capitalization, or punctuation differences should be considered errors. Fuzzy matching extends this capability by using edit distance algorithms to measure how close model outputs are to expected results, with configurable similarity thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic evaluation capabilities</strong> address the fundamental challenge that language allows multiple correct expressions of the same meaning. The framework implements semantic similarity scoring using embedding models to compare the meaning of model outputs against reference answers. This approach captures cases where the model produces a correct answer using different words or phrasing than the expected output.</p>\n<p><strong>Statistical evaluation robustness</strong> ensures that evaluation results are scientifically sound and actionable. The framework computes confidence intervals for all metrics, performs significance testing when comparing model versions, and adjusts for multiple comparisons to prevent false discoveries. This statistical rigor transforms evaluation from guesswork into evidence-based decision making.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The key architectural decision here is treating metrics as first-class plugins rather than hardcoded functions. This enables teams to implement domain-specific evaluation criteria while leveraging the framework&#39;s infrastructure for execution, caching, and reporting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Evaluation Capability</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Supported Use Cases</th>\n<th>Quality Assurance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact Match</td>\n<td>Character-by-character comparison with normalization options</td>\n<td>Structured output validation, code generation, factual QA</td>\n<td>Configurable whitespace/case handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fuzzy Match</td>\n<td>Edit distance with configurable similarity thresholds</td>\n<td>Natural language answers with minor variations</td>\n<td>Threshold calibration against human judgment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Semantic Similarity</td>\n<td>Embedding cosine similarity with multiple embedding models</td>\n<td>Open-ended responses, paraphrasing tasks</td>\n<td>Cross-validation against human evaluators</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LLM-as-Judge</td>\n<td>Structured prompting of judge models with consistency controls</td>\n<td>Complex reasoning, creativity, subjective quality</td>\n<td>Multi-judge consensus and calibration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Metrics</td>\n<td>Plugin architecture with standardized interfaces</td>\n<td>Domain-specific evaluation criteria</td>\n<td>Validation against ground truth samples</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"dataset-management-and-versioning\">Dataset Management and Versioning</h4>\n<p><strong>Dataset management</strong> operates like a version control system specifically designed for evaluation data. Think of it as &quot;Git for test cases&quot; where every change to the evaluation dataset is tracked, reversible, and auditable. This versioning capability is crucial because evaluation datasets evolve continuously as teams discover edge cases, add new test scenarios, or refine expected outputs based on model behavior.</p>\n<p>The framework implements <strong>immutable dataset versioning</strong> where each version represents a complete snapshot of the evaluation data at a specific point in time. This approach prevents the common problem of evaluation drift, where gradual changes to test cases make it impossible to compare model performance across time periods. Teams can confidently compare a model&#39;s performance today against its performance six months ago using the exact same evaluation criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Dataset splitting capabilities</strong> ensure proper train/test separation with stratified sampling across important dimensions like difficulty level, topic category, or input length. The framework prevents data leakage by maintaining strict boundaries between training and evaluation data, with cryptographic hashing to detect any overlap between splits.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dataset Management Feature</th>\n<th>Technical Implementation</th>\n<th>Prevents Common Problem</th>\n<th>Audit Capability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Version Control</td>\n<td>Content-addressable storage with merkle trees</td>\n<td>Evaluation drift over time</td>\n<td>Full change history with diffs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dataset Splitting</td>\n<td>Stratified sampling with configurable ratios</td>\n<td>Biased evaluation samples</td>\n<td>Reproducible splits with fixed seeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Schema Validation</td>\n<td>JSON Schema with custom validators</td>\n<td>Malformed test cases</td>\n<td>Validation error reports</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Import/Export</td>\n<td>Multi-format support with automatic mapping</td>\n<td>Data format lock-in</td>\n<td>Provenance tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Golden Examples</td>\n<td>Quality-weighted sampling for calibration</td>\n<td>Inconsistent evaluation standards</td>\n<td>Human annotation tracking</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"scalable-execution-infrastructure\">Scalable Execution Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>The evaluation runner operates as a <strong>distributed task execution engine</strong> optimized for language model API calls. Think of it as a specialized job scheduler that understands the unique characteristics of LLM evaluation: high latency, rate limits, variable response times, and expensive API calls that should never be repeated unnecessarily.</p>\n<p><strong>Parallel execution capabilities</strong> maximize throughput while respecting API rate limits through intelligent backoff strategies and request queuing. The framework automatically distributes evaluation work across available resources, scaling from single-machine development environments to distributed cloud deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Caching and checkpointing</strong> transform evaluation from a fragile, all-or-nothing process into a robust, resumable workflow. The framework caches all model responses using content-based hashing, ensuring that re-running evaluations with identical inputs skips expensive API calls. Checkpoint files enable recovery from failures without losing progress, critical for large-scale evaluations that may take hours or days to complete.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The caching strategy uses content-addressable storage where the cache key combines the model configuration, prompt, and generation parameters. This approach automatically invalidates cached results when any evaluation parameter changes while maximizing cache hits for identical requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"comprehensive-reporting-and-analysis\">Comprehensive Reporting and Analysis</h4>\n<p>The reporting system transforms raw evaluation scores into <strong>actionable insights</strong> that guide model improvement decisions. Rather than simply presenting aggregate scores, the framework performs statistical analysis to identify performance patterns, flag significant changes, and highlight areas needing attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Regression detection</strong> automatically compares current evaluation results against historical baselines, flagging metrics that have degraded beyond statistical significance thresholds. This capability enables continuous integration workflows where model changes that significantly harm performance trigger alerts or block deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure analysis</strong> clusters common error patterns and identifies the test cases where models struggle most. This analysis helps teams understand whether model failures are concentrated in specific domains, input types, or difficulty levels, enabling targeted improvement efforts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Comprehensive Goal Scope</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: LLM evaluation spans many different use cases, from simple classification to complex reasoning tasks, each requiring different measurement approaches</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Focus on a narrow set of metrics for simplicity</li>\n<li>Build a comprehensive framework supporting diverse evaluation needs</li>\n<li>Create a minimal core with extensive plugin architecture</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Comprehensive framework with plugin architecture for extensibility</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Production AI systems require diverse evaluation approaches, and teams need a single platform that grows with their sophistication rather than multiple specialized tools</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Higher initial complexity but significantly better long-term adoption and utility across different use cases</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Setting clear boundaries prevents <strong>scope creep</strong> that could compromise the framework&#39;s core mission. Think of these non-goals as <strong>architectural guardrails</strong> that maintain focus on evaluation excellence rather than expanding into adjacent but distinct problem domains.</p>\n<h4 id=\"model-training-and-fine-tuning\">Model Training and Fine-Tuning</h4>\n<p>The framework explicitly <strong>does not implement model training capabilities</strong>. While evaluation results inform training decisions, the framework treats model training as a separate concern handled by specialized ML training platforms. This separation maintains clean architectural boundaries and prevents the framework from becoming an unwieldy all-in-one ML platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Training data preparation</strong> falls outside the framework&#39;s scope, even though evaluation datasets might inform training data selection. Teams use external tools for data cleaning, augmentation, and training set preparation, then import the results into the evaluation framework for assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Hyperparameter optimization</strong> represents another boundary. While evaluation results guide hyperparameter selection, the framework does not implement automated hyperparameter search algorithms. Teams integrate the framework with external optimization tools when needed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: This boundary prevents the common antipattern of evaluation frameworks becoming bloated ML platforms that do many things poorly instead of doing evaluation exceptionally well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"real-time-model-serving\">Real-Time Model Serving</h4>\n<p>The framework <strong>does not provide model serving infrastructure</strong> for production deployments. Evaluation runs in batch mode against pre-trained models accessed through APIs or local inference, but the framework does not implement real-time serving, load balancing, or production monitoring capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Production monitoring</strong> represents a related but separate concern. While the framework can evaluate production model outputs in batch mode, it does not provide real-time monitoring, alerting, or performance dashboards for live systems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"data-collection-and-annotation\">Data Collection and Annotation</h4>\n<p>The framework <strong>assumes evaluation datasets already exist</strong> and focuses on their efficient utilization rather than their creation. While the framework supports importing datasets from various formats, it does not provide data collection tools, annotation interfaces, or crowd-sourcing capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Human evaluation interfaces</strong> fall outside the scope, even though human judgment often provides ground truth for evaluation metrics. Teams use external annotation tools and import the results into the framework for systematic evaluation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"model-development-and-architecture\">Model Development and Architecture</h4>\n<p>The framework maintains <strong>complete agnosticism</strong> about model architectures, training methodologies, and deployment strategies. It evaluates models purely through their inputs and outputs, treating them as black boxes regardless of their internal implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Model optimization recommendations</strong> exceed the framework&#39;s scope. While evaluation results highlight performance weaknesses, the framework does not suggest specific model architecture changes, training strategies, or optimization techniques.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Non-Goal Category</th>\n<th>Specific Exclusions</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n<th>Integration Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Model Training</td>\n<td>Training loops, optimization algorithms, gradient computation</td>\n<td>Specialized ML training platforms handle this better</td>\n<td>Import trained models for evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Real-Time Serving</td>\n<td>API endpoints, load balancing, latency optimization</td>\n<td>Production serving has different requirements</td>\n<td>Evaluate served models through their APIs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Collection</td>\n<td>Web scraping, annotation tools, crowd-sourcing platforms</td>\n<td>Data collection needs domain-specific tools</td>\n<td>Import collected datasets for evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Model Architecture</td>\n<td>Architecture design, layer optimization, compression</td>\n<td>Model development is a separate discipline</td>\n<td>Evaluate models regardless of architecture</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Production Monitoring</td>\n<td>Real-time dashboards, alerting, log analysis</td>\n<td>Monitoring systems have different performance requirements</td>\n<td>Run evaluations on production data batches</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-ml-research-capabilities\">Advanced ML Research Capabilities</h4>\n<p>The framework <strong>does not implement cutting-edge research techniques</strong> that are still experimental or require specialized expertise. This includes advanced uncertainty quantification, causal inference methods, or novel evaluation paradigms that lack established best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Research experiment management</strong> falls outside the scope. While the framework supports systematic evaluation, it does not provide experiment tracking, research collaboration tools, or academic publication workflows beyond basic report generation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enterprise-authentication-and-authorization\">Enterprise Authentication and Authorization</h4>\n<p>The framework implements <strong>basic security practices</strong> but does not provide enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, or compliance features. Teams deploying in enterprise environments integrate the framework with their existing security infrastructure rather than expecting comprehensive access control within the evaluation system.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance reporting</strong> for regulations like GDPR or industry standards exceeds the framework&#39;s scope. While the framework maintains audit trails of evaluation activities, it does not generate compliance reports or implement data governance workflows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Focused Scope Boundaries</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: LLM evaluation intersects with many adjacent domains like model training, production serving, and enterprise security</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Build a comprehensive ML platform including all adjacent capabilities</li>\n<li>Focus exclusively on core evaluation with minimal integration points</li>\n<li>Provide excellent evaluation with clean integration interfaces to external systems</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Focused evaluation excellence with clean integration interfaces</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Specialized tools excel in their domains, and users benefit more from best-in-class evaluation that integrates well than from mediocre all-in-one solutions</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires integration work for complete workflows but delivers superior evaluation capabilities and maintains long-term architectural flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Scope Creep During Implementation</strong>\nTeams frequently expand the framework&#39;s scope during development, adding training capabilities, real-time serving, or comprehensive ML platform features. This dilutes focus and compromises the core evaluation mission. The solution is maintaining strict architectural reviews that reject features outside the defined scope, regardless of how useful they might seem.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Under-Scoped Metric Support</strong>\nConversely, teams sometimes define goals too narrowly, supporting only exact match or simple accuracy metrics. This forces users to implement complex evaluation logic outside the framework, defeating its purpose. The solution is comprehensive metric support within the evaluation domain while maintaining clear boundaries around non-evaluation concerns.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Integration Planning</strong>\nFocusing exclusively on core evaluation without considering integration needs creates isolated tools that don&#39;t fit real workflows. The solution is designing clean integration interfaces for external systems while avoiding direct implementation of those systems&#39; capabilities.</p>\n<h3

Components</h3>\n<p>Think of the LLM evaluation framework as a <strong>scientific laboratory</strong> designed for language model experimentation. Just as a laboratory has specialized equipment for different phases of research—sample preparation, measurement instruments, experimental procedures, and results analysis—our evaluation framework has four specialized layers that work together to transform raw test cases into actionable insights about model performance.</p>\n<p>The architecture follows a <strong>layered pipeline design</strong> where each layer has a distinct responsibility and communicates through well-defined interfaces. This separation allows each layer to evolve independently while maintaining system integrity. Data flows unidirectionally from dataset management through metrics computation and evaluation execution to final reporting, with cross-cutting concerns like caching and error handling managed at the appropriate abstraction level.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dataset-management-layer\">Dataset Management Layer</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Dataset Management Layer</strong> serves as the foundation of our evaluation laboratory, functioning like a sophisticated specimen repository. This layer handles the entire lifecycle of evaluation data, from initial ingestion through versioning and organization. Think of it as a combination of a scientific sample library and a version control system—it maintains the integrity and traceability of your evaluation datasets while providing efficient access patterns for downstream components.</p>\n<p>The dataset management layer consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive data governance:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Interfaces</th>\n<th>Storage Backend</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>DatasetLoader</code></td>\n<td>Import and validate test cases from external formats</td>\n<td><code>load_from_csv()</code>, <code>load_from_json()</code>, <code>validate_schema()</code></td>\n<td>File system, object storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TestCaseRegistry</code></td>\n<td>Manage individual test cases with metadata</td>\n<td><code>add_test_case()</code>, <code>get_by_tags()</code>, <code>update_metadata()</code></td>\n<td>Structured database</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>VersionManager</code></td>\n<td>Track dataset changes with git-like semantics</td>\n<td><code>create_version()</code>, <code>diff_versions()</code>, <code>rollback_to()</code></td>\n<td>Version graph database</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DatasetSplitter</code></td>\n<td>Create train/test/validation partitions</td>\n<td><code>train_test_split()</code>, <code>stratified_split()</code>, <code>cross_validation_split()</code></td>\n<td>Computed dynamically</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GoldenExampleManager</code></td>\n<td>Curate high-quality reference cases</td>\n<td><code>mark_as_golden()</code>, <code>get_golden_set()</code>, <code>validate_quality()</code></td>\n<td>Specialized metadata store</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Layered Dataset Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Test cases need multiple access patterns—by tags, by difficulty, by version, and by quality level—while maintaining data consistency and enabling efficient queries</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Single flat file storage with in-memory indexing</li>\n<li>Relational database with normalized schema</li>\n<li>Layered architecture with specialized components</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implemented layered architecture with component specialization</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Each access pattern has different performance characteristics and consistency requirements.

Just as scientists use different instruments to measure different properties of their specimens—microscopes for structure, spectrometers for composition, scales for mass—our metrics engine provides different evaluation instruments for different aspects of language model performance.</p>\n<p>This layer implements a <strong>plugin architecture</strong> that allows metrics to be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The core insight is that different evaluation scenarios require fundamentally different measurement approaches, yet all metrics must integrate seamlessly into the evaluation pipeline and produce comparable results.</p>\n<p>The metrics engine revolves around the <code>BaseMetric</code> abstract interface, which standardizes how all metrics integrate with the evaluation system:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Implementation Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>compute()</code></td>\n<td><code>model_output: str</code>, <code>expected_output: str</code>, <code>test_case: TestCase</code></td>\n<td><code>MetricResult</code></td>\n<td>Calculate score for single test case</td>\n<td>Must handle edge cases (empty strings, None values)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>is_applicable()</code></td>\n<td><code>test_case: TestCase</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Check if metric applies to test case</td>\n<td>Use test case tags and metadata for filtering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_name()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Return metric identifier</td>\n<td>Must be unique across all registered metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_description()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Return human-readable description</td>\n<td>Used for documentation and report generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>validate_config()</code></td>\n<td><code>config: Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Validate metric-specific configuration</td>\n<td>Return list of validation errors, empty if valid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>MetricResult</code> structure provides a standardized container for metric outputs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Validation Rules</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>score</code></td>\n<td><code>float</code></td>\n<td>Numerical score between 0.0 and 1.0</td>\n<td>Enforced range, NaN values rejected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td>Metric-specific additional information</td>\n<td>JSON-serializable values only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>explanation</code></td>\n<td><code>Optional[str]</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable scoring rationale</td>\n<td>Especially important for LLM-as-judge metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>confidence</code></td>\n<td><code>Optional[float]</code></td>\n<td>Metric&#39;s confidence in the score</td>\n<td>Between 0.0 and 1.0, None if not applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>computation_time</code></td>\n<td><code>float</code></td>\n<td>Milliseconds required to compute score</td>\n<td>Used for performance monitoring and optimization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Plugin Architecture for Metrics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Different evaluation scenarios require different metrics (exact match for factual questions, semantic similarity for creative tasks, LLM-as-judge for nuanced evaluation), and users need to add custom metrics without modifying core code</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Hardcoded metrics with conditional logic</li>\n<li>Strategy pattern with factory registration</li>\n<li>Plugin system with dynamic loading</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implemented plugin system with registry-based discovery</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Plugin architecture provides maximum flexibility for custom metrics while maintaining type safety through the abstract base class.

These metrics compare outputs character-by-character or after applying normalization rules like whitespace trimming and case conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic Similarity Metrics</strong>: Utilize embedding models to measure meaning similarity rather than surface text similarity. Critical for creative tasks, summarization, and scenarios where multiple valid outputs exist. The embedding comparison uses cosine similarity in high-dimensional vector space.</p>\n<p><strong>LLM-as-Judge Metrics</strong>: Employ language models to evaluate other language model outputs using natural language criteria. Particularly valuable for nuanced evaluation scenarios like creativity, helpfulness, or adherence to complex guidelines that are difficult to encode algorithmically.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom Domain Metrics</strong>: User-defined metrics that implement domain-specific evaluation logic.

The system computes confidence intervals for all aggregate metrics to provide uncertainty quantification.</p>\n<p><strong>Regression Detection</strong>: Current evaluation results are compared against stored baseline evaluations using statistical significance testing. The system automatically flags metrics that have degraded beyond configurable thresholds while controlling for multiple comparison problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure Analysis</strong>: Test cases with low scores are analyzed to identify common failure patterns. The system clusters similar failures using semantic similarity and provides representative examples of each failure category.</p>\n<p><strong>Trend Analysis</strong>: When multiple evaluation runs are available, the system analyzes performance trends over time, identifying gradual improvements or degradations that might not trigger regression detection thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong>Insight Generation</strong>: The final stage synthesizes findings from all previous analyses to generate actionable recommendations for model improvement, highlighting the most promising areas for development focus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-flow-overview\">Data Flow Overview</h3>\n<p>The evaluation framework implements a <strong>unidirectional data flow architecture</strong> with clearly defined transformation stages and well-controlled side effects.

In a lab, researchers maintain detailed records of experiments, specimens, procedures, and results. Each experiment has a specific protocol (like our test cases), produces measurable outcomes (like our evaluation results), and gets catalogued in a versioned system where changes are tracked over time (like our dataset versioning). Just as lab notebooks must be precise, reproducible, and auditable, our data model ensures that every evaluation can be exactly reproduced and compared across time.</p>\n<p>The data model forms the backbone of our LLM evaluation framework, defining how test cases, evaluation results, metrics, and dataset versions are structured, stored, and related. This foundation enables reproducible evaluations, reliable comparisons, and comprehensive analysis across different models and time periods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-case-schema\">Test Case Schema</h3>\n<p>The <code>TestCase</code> represents the atomic unit of evaluation - a single prompt-response pair with associated metadata that defines one specific test of model behavior. Think of each test case as a carefully crafted scientific hypothesis: we present a specific input (the prompt) and define what constitutes a correct or acceptable response (the expected output), along with contextual information that helps us understand when and how to apply this test.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Design Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>The test case schema balances simplicity with extensibility. Every test case must have the essential components needed for evaluation (prompt and expected output), while the metadata system provides unlimited flexibility for adding domain-specific information without changing the core schema. This design ensures that the framework can handle diverse evaluation scenarios - from simple question-answering tasks to complex multi-turn conversations - without requiring schema migrations as requirements evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Case Structure</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>case_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier for the test case, used for caching and tracking</td>\n<td><code>&quot;tc_001_basic_math&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>prompt</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>The input text sent to the language model for evaluation</td>\n<td><code>&quot;What is 2 + 2?&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expected_output</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>The reference answer or ideal response for comparison</td>\n<td><code>&quot;4&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tags</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Categorical labels for organizing and filtering test cases</td>\n<td><code>[&quot;math&quot;, &quot;arithmetic&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>difficulty</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Complexity level using standardized scale</td>\n<td><code>&quot;easy&quot;</code> | <code>&quot;medium&quot;</code> | <code>&quot;hard&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict[str, Any]</code></td>\n<td>Flexible key-value storage for domain-specific information</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;topic&quot;: &quot;arithmetic&quot;, &quot;grade_level&quot;: 2}</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The <code>case_id</code> serves dual purposes - it provides stable references for caching (avoiding re-evaluation when test cases haven&#39;t changed) and enables precise tracking of results across dataset versions.

This breaks caching and makes it impossible to track the same logical test case across dataset versions. Instead, use stable, human-meaningful IDs like <code>&quot;customer_support_billing_001&quot;</code> that persist even when content changes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Unvalidated Metadata Schemas</strong>\nTeams often treat the metadata dictionary as completely unstructured, leading to inconsistent keys, incompatible value types, and broken analysis tools. Establish metadata conventions early and use validation schemas to ensure consistency. For example, always use <code>snake_case</code> for keys and document expected value types.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Evaluation Context</strong>\nStoring results without capturing the exact model configuration, dataset version, and environmental conditions makes it impossible to reproduce evaluations or debug score changes. Always store complete context, including API versions, model parameters, and system configuration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Change Tracking</strong>\nSimple version numbers without detailed change tracking make it impossible to understand why evaluation scores changed between runs. Implement comprehensive diff tracking that shows exactly which test cases were added, modified, or removed, and how those changes impacted overall scores.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Storage Schema Evolution</strong>\nHardcoding data structures without considering future extensions leads to painful migrations when new fields are needed. Design schemas with extension points (like metadata dictionaries) and use backward-compatible serialization formats that can handle missing fields gracefully.</p>\n<h3

Just as a laboratory needs rigorous sample tracking, versioning of experimental procedures, and systematic organization of test conditions, our evaluation framework requires sophisticated dataset management to ensure reproducible, reliable, and scalable LLM evaluations.</p>\n<p>Think of the dataset management system as a specialized version control system combined with a data warehouse, specifically designed for evaluation workloads. Unlike traditional databases that optimize for transactional operations, or standard version control systems that handle text files, our system must handle the unique characteristics of evaluation datasets: structured test cases with rich metadata, semantic relationships between similar test cases, and the need for both content-based versioning and temporal tracking of dataset evolution.</p>\n<p>The system handles three fundamental responsibilities: ingesting evaluation data from various sources with automatic schema validation, maintaining a complete history of dataset changes with diff capabilities, and organizing datasets into training and evaluation splits that preserve statistical properties. These capabilities work together to provide the data foundation that enables all other components in the evaluation pipeline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdataset-lifecycle.svg\" alt=\"Dataset Lifecycle State Machine\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"dataset-loader\">Dataset Loader</h3>\n<p>The dataset loader functions as the primary ingestion engine, transforming raw evaluation data from multiple formats into our standardized <code>TestCase</code> schema. Think of it as a sophisticated data translator that not only converts between formats but also validates, enriches, and normalizes the incoming data to ensure consistency across all evaluation workflows.</p>\n<p>The loader supports three primary input formats: CSV files for tabular data export from spreadsheets and databases, JSON files for structured data with complex nested fields, and JSONL (JSON Lines) format for streaming large datasets efficiently. Each format requires different parsing strategies and validation approaches, but all must produce identical <code>TestCase</code> objects that conform to our evaluation schema.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Format Support with Automatic Schema Detection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Evaluation teams work with diverse data sources including spreadsheets, databases, annotation tools, and API exports, each producing different file formats</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Support only JSON format and require manual conversion</li>\n<li>Support multiple formats with manual schema mapping configuration</li>\n<li>Support multiple formats with automatic schema detection and mapping</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement automatic schema detection with fallback to manual configuration</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Automatic detection reduces friction for evaluation teams while maintaining flexibility for edge cases. Manual conversion creates unnecessary barriers, and requiring configuration for every import slows down evaluation iteration cycles</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Increases loader complexity but dramatically improves user experience. Requires robust error handling for ambiguous schema detection cases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The automatic schema mapping system analyzes input files to identify columns or fields that correspond to our core <code>TestCase</code> schema. For CSV files, it uses heuristics based on column names (case-insensitive matching for variations like &quot;prompt&quot;, &quot;input&quot;, &quot;question&quot;) and content analysis (detecting which columns contain long text versus short categorical values). For JSON formats, it performs recursive field analysis to locate nested structures that match our expected schema patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Schema Field</th>\n<th>CSV Detection Heuristics</th>\n<th>JSON Detection Patterns</th>\n<th>Fallback Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>prompt</code></td>\n<td>Column names: prompt, input, question, query</td>\n<td>Root or nested field matching: prompt, input, text</td>\n<td>Use first text column &gt;50 chars avg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expected_output</code></td>\n<td>Column names: expected, answer, output, target</td>\n<td>Fields: expected, answer, output, label</td>\n<td>Use second text column if available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tags</code></td>\n<td>Column names: tags, categories, labels</td>\n<td>Array fields or comma-separated strings</td>\n<td>Split on common delimiters (comma, semicolon)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>difficulty</code></td>\n<td>Column names: difficulty, level, complexity</td>\n<td>String or numeric fields with difficulty keywords</td>\n<td>Default to &quot;medium&quot; if not detected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>case_id</code></td>\n<td>Column names: id, case_id, test_id</td>\n<td>Unique identifier fields</td>\n<td>Generate UUID if missing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The validation engine ensures that all loaded test cases conform to the required schema constraints before accepting them into the dataset. This includes checking that essential fields like <code>prompt</code> and <code>expected_output</code> are non-empty, validating that <code>tags</code> contain meaningful categorical information rather than noise, and ensuring that <code>difficulty</code> levels map to our standardized taxonomy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight is that schema validation must happen at ingestion time, not during evaluation execution.

Rather than loading entire files into memory, it processes them in configurable chunks (default 1000 test cases), validates each chunk, and incrementally builds the complete dataset.

When a test case&#39;s expected output changes, the system recognizes this as a potentially significant modification that could affect evaluation results, not just a text edit.

This dual-level tracking enables both high-level dataset evolution understanding and precise debugging of evaluation differences across versions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that evaluation datasets require semantic versioning, not just content versioning. A single character change in an expected output can fundamentally alter evaluation results, so the versioning system must understand and track these semantic changes explicitly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"dataset-splitting\">Dataset Splitting</h3>\n<p>The dataset splitting system provides sophisticated algorithms for dividing datasets into training, testing, and validation subsets while preserving important statistical properties. Think of it as a scientific sampling system that ensures each subset remains representative of the overall population, preventing evaluation bias that could lead to incorrect conclusions about model performance.</p>\n<p>Traditional random splitting works adequately for homogeneous datasets, but evaluation datasets often contain structured heterogeneity: different difficulty levels, topic categories, input formats, and edge case patterns. Simple random splitting might accidentally concentrate all difficult cases in the training set or place all examples from specific categories in the validation set, leading to unreliable evaluation results.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision: Stratified Sampling with Multi-Attribute Support</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Evaluation datasets contain multiple categorical and continuous attributes that affect test case difficulty and model performance patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Simple random splitting ignoring test case attributes</li>\n<li>Stratified sampling on a single attribute (e.g., difficulty)</li>\n<li>Multi-attribute stratified sampling with proportional allocation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement multi-attribute stratified sampling with configurable stratification keys</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Multi-attribute stratification ensures representative splits across all important dimensions, preventing evaluation bias. Single-attribute stratification misses interactions between attributes, while random splitting provides no guarantees about subset representativeness</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more complex splitting algorithms and may not always achieve exact split ratios, but provides much more reliable evaluation results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stratified sampling algorithm works by creating strata (groups) based on combinations of categorical attributes, then sampling from each stratum proportionally to maintain the overall distribution. For example, if the original dataset contains 30% easy cases, 50% medium cases, and 20% hard cases, each split will maintain approximately the same proportions.</p>\n<p><strong>Stratified Splitting Algorithm</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Analyze the dataset</strong> to identify all unique combinations of stratification attributes, creating a stratum for each combination</li>\n<li><strong>Calculate target proportions</strong> for each stratum based on their frequency in the complete dataset</li>\n<li><strong>Determine target sizes</strong> for each split (train/test/validation) based on the configured split ratios</li>\n<li><strong>Allocate test cases</strong> from each stratum to splits proportionally, ensuring minimum representation thresholds are met</li>\n<li><strong>Handle remainder cases</strong> when proportional allocation doesn&#39;t divide evenly by using randomized assignment weighted by stratum size</li>\n<li><strong>Validate split quality</strong> by computing distribution statistics and flagging splits that deviate significantly from target proportions</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Dataset Splitting Interface</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>train_test_split</code></td>\n<td>test_size: float, stratify_by: List[str]</td>\n<td>Tuple[Dataset, Dataset]</td>\n<td>Split into training and testing datasets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>train_test_val_split</code></td>\n<td>test_size: float, val_size: float, stratify_by: List[str]</td>\n<td>Tuple[Dataset, Dataset, Dataset]</td>\n<td>Three-way split with validation set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>k_fold_split</code></td>\n<td>k: int, stratify_by: List[str]</td>\n<td>List[Tuple[Dataset, Dataset]]</td>\n<td>Generate k training/validation pairs for cross-validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>temporal_split</code></td>\n<td>split_date: datetime</td>\n<td>Tuple[Dataset, Dataset]</td>\n<td>Split based on test case creation timestamps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>validate_split_quality</code></td>\n<td>splits: List[Dataset], stratify_by: List[str]</td>\n<td>Dict[str, float]</td>\n<td>Compute distribution similarity metrics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The system supports both proportional and absolute split specifications. Proportional splits specify percentages (e.g., 70% train, 20% test, 10% validation), while absolute splits specify exact counts (e.g., 1000 test cases, remainder for training). This flexibility accommodates different evaluation scenarios: research experiments often use proportional splits, while production evaluations may require fixed-size test sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Split Quality Validation Metrics</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Name</th>\n<th>Formula</th>\n<th>Interpretation</th>\n<th>Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chi-Square Statistic</td>\n<td>Σ((observed - expected)² / expected)</td>\n<td>Distribution similarity between splits</td>\n<td>&lt; 0.05 for good splits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jensen-Shannon Divergence</td>\n<td>Symmetric KL divergence variant</td>\n<td>Information-theoretic distribution distance</td>\n<td>&lt; 0.1 for similar distributions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cramér&#39;s V</td>\n<td>√(χ² / (n × min(k-1, r-1)))</td>\n<td>Effect size of distribution differences</td>\n<td>&lt; 0.3 for acceptable splits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Stratum Size</td>\n<td>min(count per stratum per split)</td>\n<td>Ensures adequate representation</td>\n<td>≥ 5 cases per stratum per split</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The temporal splitting capability handles datasets where test cases have creation timestamps, enabling evaluation of model performance over time. This is crucial for detecting concept drift or evaluating how models perform on newer types of questions that weren&#39;t available during training dataset creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Dataset Splitting</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Stratification Attributes</strong>\nMany teams perform simple random splits without considering test case attributes, leading to biased evaluation results. For example, if all &quot;expert&quot; difficulty cases randomly end up in the training set, the test set won&#39;t properly evaluate model performance on difficult cases. Always identify the key attributes that affect model performance and stratify on those attributes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Stratum Representation</strong>\nWhen stratifying on multiple attributes, some attribute combinations may have very few test cases, leading to strata with only 1-2 examples. These cases can&#39;t be split meaningfully across train/test sets. The system should either merge small strata with similar ones or flag datasets that don&#39;t have sufficient diversity for the desired split configuration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Temporal Leakage in Time-Series Data</strong>\nFor datasets containing temporal information, random splitting can create temporal leakage where test cases from earlier time periods are used to evaluate models on later time periods. Always use temporal splitting for time-sensitive evaluation scenarios, placing earlier cases in training and later cases in testing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Validating Split Quality</strong>\nTeams often assume that split algorithms produce representative subsets without verification. Always compute and review split quality metrics, especially for datasets with complex attribute distributions. Poor splits can invalidate entire evaluation studies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology

(Evaluation Metrics) - This section covers the complete metrics computation system including exact match, semantic similarity, LLM-as-judge, and custom metrics</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The metrics engine is the heart of our evaluation framework - it transforms raw model outputs into meaningful scores that guide AI system improvement. Think of the metrics engine as a sophisticated grading system, similar to how a university might evaluate student essays using multiple criteria: some assignments get scored by exact answer matching (like math problems), others by semantic understanding (like literature analysis), and still others by expert human judgment (like creative writing). Our engine mirrors this flexibility by supporting multiple evaluation approaches within a unified, extensible architecture.</p>\n<p>The core architectural challenge lies in creating a system that can seamlessly handle vastly different metric types - from simple string comparison to complex neural embedding calculations to LLM-powered evaluation - while maintaining consistent interfaces, reliable caching, and meaningful score aggregation. Each metric type has unique computational requirements, error modes, and performance characteristics, yet they must integrate smoothly into the same evaluation pipeline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fmetric-processing.svg\" alt=\"Metric Processing Pipeline\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"metric-interface-design\">Metric Interface Design</h3>\n<p>The foundation of our extensible metrics system rests on a common interface that abstracts the scoring process while accommodating the diverse computational patterns of different metric types. Think of this interface as a universal translator that allows metrics as different as exact string matching and neural similarity computation to speak the same language within our evaluation framework.</p>\n<p><strong>BaseMetric Abstract Class</strong></p>\n<p>Every metric in our system inherits from <code>BaseMetric</code>, which defines the essential contract for score computation. The interface design balances simplicity for implementers with sufficient flexibility to handle the computational complexity of modern evaluation approaches.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>compute</code></td>\n<td><code>model_output: str, expected_output: str, test_case: TestCase</code></td>\n<td><code>MetricResult</code></td>\n<td>Core scoring logic that compares model output against expected result</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>is_applicable</code></td>\n<td><code>test_case: TestCase</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Determines if this metric should run for the given test case based on tags/metadata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_name</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Returns unique identifier for this metric type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_description</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable description of what this metric measures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>requires_preprocessing</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Whether metric needs text normalization before scoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_preprocessing_steps</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>List of preprocessing operations (e.g., &quot;normalize_whitespace&quot;, &quot;lowercase&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>compute</code> method serves as the primary entry point, receiving the model&#39;s actual output, the expected reference output, and the complete test case context.

The interface design makes preprocessing explicit and trackable rather than hidden within metric implementations.</p>\n<p>Standard preprocessing operations include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Whitespace normalization</strong>: Convert multiple spaces/tabs/newlines to single spaces</li>\n<li><strong>Case normalization</strong>: Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison</li>\n<li><strong>Punctuation handling</strong>: Remove or normalize punctuation marks</li>\n<li><strong>Unicode normalization</strong>: Handle different Unicode representations of same characters</li>\n<li><strong>Format stripping</strong>: Remove markdown, HTML, or other formatting artifacts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each applied preprocessing step gets recorded in the <code>MetricResult.preprocessing_applied</code> field, enabling debugging when preprocessing changes affect scores unexpectedly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"built-in-metrics\">Built-in Metrics</h3>\n<p>Our framework provides a comprehensive suite of built-in metrics that handle the most common evaluation scenarios.

The penalty function exponentially reduces scores for outputs significantly shorter than the reference text.</p>\n<p>Our implementation handles multiple reference answers by computing BLEU against each reference and taking the maximum score, reflecting the common scenario where multiple valid answers exist for the same prompt.</p>\n<p><strong>ROUGE Score Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) focuses on recall rather than precision, measuring what fraction of the reference content appears in the model output.

Think of this as recruiting an expert human evaluator who never gets tired, maintains consistent standards, and can process thousands of evaluations per hour.</p>\n<p>This approach excels in scenarios where rule-based metrics fail: evaluating creativity, assessing argument quality, checking factual accuracy, or measuring adherence to complex style guidelines. However, it introduces new challenges around consistency, cost, and potential bias that require careful system design.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge Model Selection and Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The effectiveness of LLM-as-judge evaluation depends heavily on selecting appropriate judge models and configuring them for consistent, reliable scoring.

This typically happens when developers use raw similarity scores or count-based metrics without normalization. The framework validates score ranges and raises exceptions for violations, but plugin developers should implement explicit normalization in their metrics rather than relying on framework validation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Semantic Similarity Threshold Misunderstanding</strong>\nMany developers assume that high cosine similarity scores (like 0.8) automatically indicate strong semantic similarity, but embedding models have different score distributions. A 0.8 similarity might represent strong similarity in one model but weak similarity in another. Always calibrate thresholds using golden examples from your specific domain and embedding model combination.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: LLM Judge Prompt Instability</strong>\nSmall changes in judge prompts can cause dramatic score distribution shifts that appear as false performance regressions. This happens because LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt wording, format, and example selection. Implement prompt versioning, validate prompts on calibration datasets before production use, and monitor judge score distributions for unexpected shifts.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Preprocessing Order Dependency</strong>\nThe order of text preprocessing steps significantly affects final scores, but many developers treat preprocessing as a simple pipeline. For example, removing punctuation before lowercasing produces different results than lowercasing before removing punctuation. Make preprocessing order explicit and consistent across metrics, and test different orderings on your specific data to identify the most appropriate sequence.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Plugin Resource Leaks</strong>\nCustom metrics that make external API calls or load large models often fail to clean up resources properly, leading to memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion during long evaluation runs. Always implement proper resource cleanup in plugin code using context managers or try/finally blocks, and test plugins under extended execution scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Metric Applicability Over-Filtering</strong>\nOverly restrictive applicability rules can result in test cases being evaluated by too few metrics, reducing the comprehensiveness of evaluation. This often happens when developers create highly specific tag requirements. Prefer inclusive applicability rules and let aggregation handle metric diversity rather than restricting which metrics can evaluate which test cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

Think of it as a sophisticated job scheduler for a distributed computing system - it needs to balance throughput, reliability, and resource efficiency while providing visibility into progress and handling inevitable failures gracefully.</p>\n<p>The core challenge is managing the inherent unpredictability of LLM API calls. Unlike traditional batch processing where each task has predictable execution time and failure modes, LLM evaluation involves network requests with variable latency, rate limits that change dynamically, and API responses that may be malformed or incomplete. The evaluation runner must handle these uncertainties while maintaining high throughput and providing reliable progress estimates.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fevaluation-flow.svg\" alt=\"Evaluation Execution Flow\"></p>\n<p>The evaluation runner operates on a four-layer architecture: the execution engine manages batch processing and concurrency, the caching system eliminates redundant API calls, the checkpoint system ensures crash recovery, and the progress tracking system provides real-time visibility. Each layer has distinct responsibilities but must coordinate closely to achieve optimal performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"execution-engine\">Execution Engine</h3>\n<p>The execution engine is the heart of the evaluation runner, responsible for orchestrating parallel evaluation across potentially thousands of test cases while respecting API rate limits and resource constraints. Think of it as an air traffic control system - it needs to coordinate many concurrent operations safely while maximizing overall throughput.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge is balancing concurrency for speed against stability and rate limiting. Too much concurrency overwhelms APIs and causes cascade failures. Too little concurrency leaves performance on the table. The execution engine dynamically adjusts concurrency based on observed API response times and error rates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Adaptive Batch Processing Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Large evaluation datasets (10K+ test cases) require parallel processing for reasonable completion times, but LLM APIs have complex rate limiting and reliability characteristics</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Fixed batch sizes, dynamic batch sizing based on API latency, per-provider adaptive concurrency</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement adaptive batch processing with per-provider concurrency control and exponential backoff</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fixed approaches fail under varying API conditions. Adaptive sizing allows the system to automatically optimize for current API performance while preventing overload</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables high throughput under good conditions while maintaining stability during API degradation, but requires more complex monitoring and tuning logic</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Interfaces</th>\n<th>Error Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>BatchProcessor</code></td>\n<td>Divides test cases into optimally-sized batches</td>\n<td><code>process_batch(items, processor_func)</code></td>\n<td>Retries failed batches with exponential backoff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConcurrencyManager</code></td>\n<td>Controls parallel evaluation threads per API provider</td>\n<td><code>acquire_slot(provider)</code>, <code>release_slot(provider)</code></td>\n<td>Blocks new requests when provider error rate exceeds threshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RateLimiter</code></td>\n<td>Enforces API rate limits to prevent rejection</td>\n<td><code>acquire()</code>, <code>get_wait_time()</code></td>\n<td>Implements token bucket algorithm with provider-specific limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ProviderRouter</code></td>\n<td>Routes evaluation requests to appropriate LLM providers</td>\n<td><code>route_request(test_case)</code>, <code>get_healthy_providers()</code></td>\n<td>Fails over to backup providers when primary is unavailable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The execution engine processes evaluations in three phases: preparation, execution, and aggregation. During preparation, it analyzes the dataset to determine optimal batching strategy based on test case complexity and estimated execution time. The execution phase processes batches in parallel while continuously monitoring API health and adjusting concurrency. The aggregation phase combines results from all batches and computes final statistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Batch Size Optimization Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system starts with a conservative baseline batch size (typically 10-20 test cases) based on the configured concurrency limits</li>\n<li>It measures the actual processing time for each completed batch, including API latency, metric computation, and result serialization</li>\n<li>For each LLM provider, it maintains a rolling average of successful batch completion times over the last 50 batches</li>\n<li>If the average completion time is below the target threshold (e.g., 30 seconds), the system increases batch size by 25%</li>\n<li>If completion times exceed the threshold or error rates rise above 5%, batch size is reduced by 50%</li>\n<li>The system maintains separate batch size settings for each provider since their performance characteristics differ significantly</li>\n<li>Batch sizes are bounded between a minimum of 5 (to handle degraded conditions) and maximum of 100 (to prevent excessive memory usage)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The concurrency manager implements a sophisticated slot-based system where each LLM provider has a dedicated pool of execution slots. This prevents one slow provider from blocking evaluation progress with other providers. The slot allocation is dynamic - providers with better performance characteristics receive more slots during peak processing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that batch processing for LLM evaluation must be adaptive rather than static. API performance varies dramatically based on time of day, model load, and provider infrastructure changes. A system optimized for peak performance will crash during degraded conditions, while one optimized for reliability will be unnecessarily slow during good conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Provider Health Monitoring:</strong></p>\n<p>The execution engine continuously monitors each LLM provider&#39;s health using multiple metrics. Response latency is tracked using exponential moving averages with recent responses weighted more heavily. Error rates are computed over sliding windows to detect both sudden failures and gradual degradation. The system maintains separate health scores for different types of errors - transient network issues are treated differently from authentication failures or rate limit rejections.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Metric</th>\n<th>Measurement Window</th>\n<th>Healthy Threshold</th>\n<th>Degraded Threshold</th>\n<th>Recovery Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Response Latency</td>\n<td>50 requests</td>\n<td>&lt; 5 seconds</td>\n<td>&gt; 15 seconds</td>\n<td>20 consecutive requests &lt; 8 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Rate</td>\n<td>100 requests</td>\n<td>&lt; 2%</td>\n<td>&gt; 10%</td>\n<td>Error rate &lt; 1% for 5 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rate Limit Hits</td>\n<td>10 minutes</td>\n<td>&lt; 1 per minute</td>\n<td>&gt; 5 per minute</td>\n<td>No rate limits for 15 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout Rate</td>\n<td>50 requests</td>\n<td>&lt; 5%</td>\n<td>&gt; 20%</td>\n<td>Timeout rate &lt; 3% for 10 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When a provider enters degraded state, the execution engine reduces its concurrency allocation and begins routing new requests to healthy providers. If all providers are degraded, the system enters backoff mode where it processes requests sequentially with increasing delays between attempts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"result-caching-system\">Result Caching System</h3>\n<p>The result caching system eliminates redundant API calls by storing LLM responses keyed by prompt content and provider configuration. Think of it as a sophisticated memoization layer - it remembers previous computations so identical requests can be answered instantly without expensive API calls.</p>\n<p>The challenge with caching LLM responses is determining when two prompts are &quot;identical&quot; enough to return cached results. Simple string equality is too restrictive since minor formatting differences shouldn&#39;t invalidate the cache. However, semantic equivalence is too expensive to compute at query time. The caching system uses a hybrid approach with content-based hashing and configurable normalization rules.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Content-Addressable Cache with Layered Keys</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: LLM API calls are expensive (time and cost) and many evaluation runs contain duplicate or near-duplicate test cases</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Simple prompt hash, semantic similarity clustering, multi-level cache hierarchy</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Content-addressable storage using normalized prompt hash as primary key with provider config hash as secondary key</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides exact match caching with predictable performance while allowing cache hits across different evaluation runs</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Eliminates redundant API calls for identical prompts but misses opportunities for semantic similarity caching</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cache Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Key Structure</th>\n<th>Storage Backend</th>\n<th>TTL Policy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>PromptCache</code></td>\n<td>Stores LLM responses by prompt content</td>\n<td><code>sha256(normalized_prompt + provider_config)</code></td>\n<td>SQLite with WAL mode</td>\n<td>30 days for successful responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EmbeddingCache</code></td>\n<td>Caches embeddings for semantic similarity metrics</td>\n<td><code>sha256(text + embedding_model)</code></td>\n<td>HDF5 files with compression</td>\n<td>90 days (embeddings more stable)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MetricCache</code></td>\n<td>Caches computed metric results</td>\n<td><code>sha256(model_response + expected_output + metric_config)</code></td>\n<td>Memory-mapped files</td>\n<td>Session-only (metrics change frequently)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The prompt normalization process is configurable but typically includes whitespace normalization, consistent line ending conversion, and removal of non-semantic formatting. The normalization must be deterministic and reversible to ensure cache consistency across different execution environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Cache Key Generation Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system extracts the core prompt content from the <code>TestCase</code>, excluding metadata fields like <code>case_id</code> and <code>tags</code> that don&#39;t affect the LLM response</li>\n<li>It applies configured normalization rules: strip leading/trailing whitespace, normalize line endings to <code>\\n</code>, collapse multiple consecutive spaces to single spaces</li>\n<li>The provider configuration is serialized to a canonical JSON representation with keys sorted alphabetically</li>\n<li>A composite string is formed by concatenating normalized prompt, provider config JSON, and a cache version identifier</li>\n<li>The final cache key is computed as <code>sha256(composite_string)</code> and encoded as a hex string for storage</li>\n<li>Secondary keys are generated for provider-specific optimizations and cache invalidation patterns</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The caching system implements a write-through policy where responses are stored immediately after successful API calls. This ensures cache consistency even if the evaluation process crashes partway through. Cache hits are validated by checking response metadata for completeness and comparing timestamps against configured TTL policies.</p>\n<p><strong>Cache Invalidation Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>Cache invalidation is triggered by several events: provider configuration changes, cache version updates, and explicit invalidation requests. The system uses a tombstone approach where invalidated entries are marked as deleted rather than immediately removed, allowing for cache statistics and debugging.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Invalidation Trigger</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n<th>Recovery Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Provider Config Change</td>\n<td>All entries for affected provider</td>\n<td>Mark with tombstone, lazy cleanup</td>\n<td>Immediate for new requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache Version Update</td>\n<td>Global cache invalidation</td>\n<td>Rename cache directory, create fresh</td>\n<td>Next evaluation run startup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Explicit Request</td>\n<td>User-specified patterns</td>\n<td>Pattern matching on cache keys</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TTL Expiration</td>\n<td>Individual entries based on age</td>\n<td>Background cleanup process</td>\n<td>Continuous</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The cache provides detailed statistics including hit rates, storage utilization, and performance impact. These metrics help optimize cache policies and troubleshoot evaluation performance issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"checkpoint-and-recovery\">Checkpoint and Recovery</h3>\n<p>The checkpoint and recovery system ensures that large evaluation runs can survive crashes, API outages, and other interruptions without losing progress. Think of it as a database transaction log - it records the system&#39;s state at regular intervals so recovery can resume from the last known good checkpoint rather than starting over.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge is balancing checkpoint frequency against performance overhead. Frequent checkpoints minimize lost work but slow down overall execution. Infrequent checkpoints reduce overhead but risk losing significant progress. The system uses adaptive checkpointing that increases frequency during unstable conditions and reduces it during smooth operation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hierarchical Checkpointing with Incremental Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Large evaluation runs can take hours to complete, and various failures (API outages, crashes, network issues) can interrupt progress</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Full state snapshots at fixed intervals, incremental checkpoints with transaction logs, distributed checkpointing across workers</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hierarchical checkpointing with fast incremental updates and periodic full snapshots</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Combines fast recovery (incremental) with guaranteed consistency (full snapshots) while minimizing I/O overhead during normal operation</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables sub-minute recovery times with minimal performance impact, but requires more complex checkpoint management logic</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Checkpoint Type</th>\n<th>Frequency</th>\n<th>Content</th>\n<th>Storage Size</th>\n<th>Recovery Time</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Incremental</td>\n<td>Every 10 completed evaluations</td>\n<td>Result deltas and progress counters</td>\n<td>&lt; 1MB typically</td>\n<td>&lt; 10 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Batch Complete</td>\n<td>End of each batch</td>\n<td>Full batch results and updated statistics</td>\n<td>5-50MB per batch</td>\n<td>30-60 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full Snapshot</td>\n<td>Every 500 evaluations or 30 minutes</td>\n<td>Complete evaluation state</td>\n<td>50-500MB</td>\n<td>2-5 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emergency</td>\n<td>Before shutdown or on error</td>\n<td>Current progress with error context</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td>&lt; 5 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The checkpoint system maintains a write-ahead log (WAL) of all evaluation state changes. Each entry in the WAL includes a sequence number, timestamp, operation type, and the affected data. This allows the recovery process to replay operations in the correct order and detect any inconsistencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint State Management:</strong></p>\n<p>The checkpointing system tracks multiple categories of state that must be preserved across crashes. Evaluation progress includes completed test cases, pending batches, and provider health metrics. Configuration state includes dataset version, metric configurations, and runtime parameters. Error state includes failed test cases, retry counts, and error classifications.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before starting any evaluation batch, the system writes a BATCH_START record to the WAL with batch ID and test case IDs</li>\n<li>As individual test cases complete, EVALUATION_COMPLETE records are written with results and timing information</li>\n<li>When a full batch completes successfully, a BATCH_COMPLETE record summarizes the batch results and updates overall progress</li>\n<li>Every 500 completed evaluations, a FULL_SNAPSHOT record captures the complete evaluation state</li>\n<li>If an error occurs, an ERROR_RECORD captures the failure context and marks affected test cases for retry</li>\n<li>The WAL is fsynced to disk after each write to ensure durability even during hard crashes</li>\n<li>Old WAL entries are pruned after successful full snapshots to prevent unbounded growth</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The recovery process scans the WAL from the most recent full snapshot forward, replaying operations to reconstruct the evaluation state. It validates each operation for consistency and handles gaps or corruption by falling back to the previous consistent state.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery Process Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<p>Recovery begins by scanning the checkpoint directory for the most recent full snapshot and corresponding WAL files. The system validates the snapshot integrity using stored checksums and begins WAL replay from the snapshot&#39;s sequence number.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Recovery Phase</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n<th>Validation Checks</th>\n<th>Fallback Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Snapshot Load</td>\n<td>Deserialize evaluation state from snapshot file</td>\n<td>Checksum validation, schema version compatibility</td>\n<td>Try previous snapshot if current is corrupted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WAL Replay</td>\n<td>Apply operations from WAL in sequence order</td>\n<td>Sequence number gaps, operation consistency</td>\n<td>Stop at first inconsistency, use partial recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Validation</td>\n<td>Verify recovered state matches expected invariants</td>\n<td>Progress counters, result consistency, provider health</td>\n<td>Reset inconsistent components to safe defaults</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resume Preparation</td>\n<td>Identify incomplete batches and failed test cases</td>\n<td>Check for pending operations, validate retry counts</td>\n<td>Mark uncertain test cases for re-evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for checkpoint recovery is that partial progress is better than no progress. Even if some test cases must be re-evaluated due to uncertainty, preserving the majority of completed work provides significant time savings for large evaluation runs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Crash Recovery Scenarios:</strong></p>\n<p>The checkpoint system handles various failure modes with different recovery strategies. Hard crashes (power loss, kill -9) rely on WAL replay from the last fsynced checkpoint. Soft crashes (exceptions, API failures) can use in-memory state for faster recovery. Network partitions may leave some results in uncertain states that require re-evaluation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"progress-tracking\">Progress Tracking</h3>\n<p>The progress tracking system provides real-time visibility into evaluation execution with accurate time estimates and detailed performance metrics. Think of it as a sophisticated dashboard for a complex manufacturing process - it needs to show not just overall progress but also bottlenecks, quality metrics, and predictive estimates for completion.</p>\n<p>The challenge with progress tracking for LLM evaluation is that execution time per test case varies dramatically based on prompt complexity, API provider performance, and metric computation requirements. Simple linear extrapolation gives poor time estimates. The tracking system uses statistical modeling based on historical performance to provide accurate completion estimates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Modal Progress Estimation with Confidence Intervals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Users need accurate progress estimates for evaluation runs that can take hours, but LLM API response times are highly variable and unpredictable</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Linear extrapolation from average times, exponential smoothing of recent performance, machine learning models based on test case features</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Statistical modeling using test case complexity features and provider performance history with confidence intervals</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides more accurate estimates than simple averages while giving users realistic expectations about estimate uncertainty</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more sophisticated tracking infrastructure but delivers significantly better user experience for long-running evaluations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Progress Dimension</th>\n<th>Measurement Approach</th>\n<th>Update Frequency</th>\n<th>Accuracy Target</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Overall Completion</td>\n<td>Count of completed vs total test cases</td>\n<td>Real-time</td>\n<td>±2% of actual progress</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time Remaining</td>\n<td>Statistical model based on test case complexity</td>\n<td>Every 10 completions</td>\n<td>±20% for 80% of estimates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider Performance</td>\n<td>Response time percentiles and error rates</td>\n<td>Per API call</td>\n<td>Real-time health indicators</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quality Metrics</td>\n<td>Score distributions and failure analysis</td>\n<td>Per completed batch</td>\n<td>Batch-level accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The progress tracking system maintains detailed statistics about evaluation performance that inform both real-time estimates and post-evaluation analysis. It tracks not just completion counts but also error patterns, performance bottlenecks, and quality trends.</p>\n<p><strong>Complexity-Based Time Estimation:</strong></p>\n<p>The progress tracker analyzes each test case to estimate its execution complexity based on multiple factors. Prompt length affects API response time. Expected output length influences metric computation time. The number of applicable metrics determines total scoring overhead. Provider health status affects retry likelihood.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each test case, extract complexity features: prompt token count, expected output token count, number of applicable metrics, provider assignment</li>\n<li>Look up historical performance data for similar test cases using k-nearest neighbors matching on the feature vector</li>\n<li>Compute base time estimate as weighted average of similar cases, with more recent examples weighted more heavily</li>\n<li>Apply provider-specific adjustments based on current health status and observed latency patterns</li>\n<li>Add metric computation overhead based on the configured metric types (exact match is fast, semantic similarity requires embeddings, LLM-as-judge needs additional API calls)</li>\n<li>Generate confidence intervals using the variance in historical performance for similar test cases</li>\n<li>Update estimates continuously as new performance data becomes available</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The estimation model is retrained periodically using completed evaluation data to improve accuracy. The system maintains separate models for different providers and metric combinations to capture their distinct performance characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Performance Monitoring:</strong></p>\n<p>Progress tracking goes beyond simple completion counts to provide detailed performance insights. The system monitors throughput trends, identifies bottlenecks, and predicts potential issues before they cause significant delays.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Metric</th>\n<th>Calculation Method</th>\n<th>Normal Range</th>\n<th>Alert Threshold</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Evaluations/Minute</td>\n<td>Rolling average over 5-minute window</td>\n<td>Varies by provider</td>\n<td>50% below historical average</td>\n<td>Identifies throughput degradation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API Response Time</td>\n<td>P95 latency over recent 100 requests</td>\n<td>&lt; 10 seconds typical</td>\n<td>&gt; 30 seconds</td>\n<td>Detects provider performance issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Rate</td>\n<td>Failed requests / total requests over 10 minutes</td>\n<td>&lt; 2%</td>\n<td>&gt; 10%</td>\n<td>Indicates API or configuration problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Queue Depth</td>\n<td>Pending evaluations waiting for available slots</td>\n<td>&lt; 50 typical</td>\n<td>&gt; 200</td>\n<td>Shows concurrency bottlenecks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache Hit Rate</td>\n<td>Cache hits / total requests over evaluation run</td>\n<td>10-30% typical</td>\n<td>&lt; 5%</td>\n<td>Indicates caching effectiveness</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The monitoring system generates automatic alerts when performance metrics deviate significantly from expected ranges. These alerts include suggested diagnostic actions and potential remediation strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Progress Visualization and Reporting:</strong></p>\n<p>The progress tracking system generates multiple views of evaluation progress optimized for different audiences. Developers need detailed technical metrics and error diagnostics. Project managers need high-level completion estimates and risk assessments. The system provides both real-time dashboards and periodic summary reports.</p>\n<p>Real-time progress display includes overall completion percentage, estimated time remaining with confidence intervals, current throughput rate, and provider health status. A detailed breakdown shows progress by test case category, metric type, and difficulty level. Error summary highlights the most common failure patterns and affected test cases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for progress tracking is that uncertainty is as important as the estimate itself. Users make better decisions when they understand not just that an evaluation will complete in &quot;2 hours&quot; but that the estimate has a 90% confidence interval of &quot;1.5 to 3 hours&quot; based on current performance trends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Linear Extrapolation for Time Estimates</strong>\nSimple progress calculations like <code>(total_cases - completed_cases) * average_time_per_case</code> give misleading estimates because LLM API performance varies dramatically. Early test cases may complete quickly while later complex ones take much longer. Use statistical models based on test case complexity and provider performance history instead.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Provider Health in Batch Sizing</strong>\nFixed batch sizes that work well under normal conditions can cause cascade failures when API providers are degraded. Always incorporate provider health metrics into batch size calculations and reduce concurrency when error rates increase.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cache Keys That Miss Obvious Duplicates</strong>\nUsing raw prompt strings as cache keys misses opportunities to cache results for semantically identical prompts with minor formatting differences. Implement prompt normalization that strips non-semantic differences while preserving meaning.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Checkpoint Corruption During Shutdown</strong>\nWriting checkpoints during system shutdown can result in incomplete or corrupted state files that prevent successful recovery. Use atomic write operations (write to temporary file, then rename) and validate checkpoint integrity before cleanup.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Progress Estimates Without Confidence Intervals</strong>\nGiving users precise time estimates like &quot;2 hours 37 minutes remaining&quot; without indicating uncertainty leads to frustration when estimates change. Always provide confidence intervals that reflect the inherent uncertainty in LLM evaluation timing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling and Recovery Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology Recommendations:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Batch Processing</td>\n<td><code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code></td>\n<td><code>asyncio</code> with <code>aiohttp</code> for async API calls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Result Caching</td>\n<td><code>sqlite3</code> with pickle serialization</td>\n<td>Redis with JSON serialization and TTL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Progress Tracking</td>\n<td>Simple console output with <code>tqdm</code></td>\n<td>Web dashboard with WebSocket updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Checkpointing</td>\n<td>JSON files with atomic writes</td>\n<td>SQLite WAL mode with transactions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rate Limiting</td>\n<td><code>time.sleep()</code> with token bucket</td>\n<td><code>aiohttp_retry</code> with exponential backoff</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Recommended File Structure:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>evaluation_framework/\n  evaluation_runner/\n    __init__.py\n    execution_engine.py       ← BatchProcessor, ConcurrencyManager\n    caching.py               ← PromptCache, EmbeddingCache  \n    checkpointing.py         ← CheckpointManager, WALWriter\n    progress_tracking.py     ← ProgressTracker, TimeEstimator\n    rate_limiting.py         ← RateLimiter, ProviderHealthMonitor\n  tests/\n    test_execution_engine.py\n    test_caching.py\n    test_checkpointing.py\n    test_progress_tracking.py</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Infrastructure Starter Code (Complete Rate Limiter):</strong></p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">python</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> time</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> threading</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">from</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> collections </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> deque</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">from</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> typing </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> Dict, Optional</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">from</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> dataclasses </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">import</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> dataclass</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">@dataclass</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">class</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> RateLimitConfig</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    max_requests: </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">int</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    time_window: </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">int</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">  #

Analysis) - This section covers the complete statistical analysis engine that transforms raw evaluation results into actionable insights through score aggregation, regression detection, failure analysis, and comprehensive report generation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reporting and analysis system represents the culmination of the evaluation framework — the component that transforms raw evaluation data into actionable insights for model improvement. Think of it as a <strong>data scientist&#39;s workbench</strong> built into the evaluation pipeline: it doesn&#39;t just show you numbers, but automatically surfaces patterns, detects problems, and generates hypotheses about what&#39;s working and what needs attention.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional software testing where pass/fail is binary, LLM evaluation produces rich, multidimensional data that requires sophisticated analysis to be meaningful. A single evaluation run might generate thousands of scored responses across dozens of metrics and categories. The reporting system must synthesize this complexity into clear, actionable insights while preserving the statistical rigor needed for confident decision-making.</p>\n<p>The analysis engine operates on four levels of insight generation: <strong>descriptive statistics</strong> that summarize current performance, <strong>comparative analysis</strong> that detects changes over time, <strong>diagnostic analysis</strong> that identifies failure patterns, and <strong>prescriptive insights</strong> that suggest improvement directions. Each level builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of model performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Freporting-pipeline.svg\" alt=\"Reporting and Analysis Pipeline\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Automated Statistical Analysis vs Manual Report Building</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Organizations need to process evaluation results at scale without requiring statistical expertise from every user</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Manual analysis with raw data exports, template-based reporting, fully automated statistical analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Fully automated statistical analysis with configurable thresholds and customizable report templates</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Manual analysis doesn&#39;t scale and requires statistical expertise. Template-based reporting lacks the sophistication needed for LLM evaluation complexity. Automated analysis ensures consistent methodology while remaining accessible to non-statisticians.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables rapid insight generation and reduces time-to-decision. Requires sophisticated statistical algorithms and careful handling of edge cases like small sample sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"score-aggregation\">Score Aggregation</h3>\n<p><strong>Score aggregation</strong> transforms individual metric results into meaningful statistical summaries that reveal performance patterns across different dimensions of the evaluation dataset. Think of it as creating a <strong>multidimensional performance map</strong> — instead of looking at thousands of individual scores, you get clear views of performance by category, difficulty level, and other meaningful groupings.</p>\n<p>The aggregation system must handle the inherent complexity of LLM evaluation data: different metrics have different scales and interpretations, test cases belong to multiple overlapping categories, and statistical significance varies dramatically with sample size. The goal is to provide both high-level summaries for quick decision-making and detailed breakdowns for deep analysis.</p>\n<p>The aggregation engine processes evaluation results through multiple statistical lenses simultaneously. <strong>Overall performance metrics</strong> provide system-wide health indicators, while <strong>category-based breakdowns</strong> reveal strengths and weaknesses in specific areas. <strong>Tag-based analysis</strong> enables fine-grained performance investigation, and <strong>difficulty-stratified results</strong> help understand model capabilities across different challenge levels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Level Aggregation vs Flat Summarization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Evaluation results need to be interpretable at different levels of granularity for different stakeholders</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single overall score, hierarchical breakdown by tags/categories, configurable aggregation dimensions</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Multi-level hierarchical aggregation with automatic statistical significance testing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Different stakeholders need different views — executives want overall trends, engineers need category-specific insights, researchers need tag-level details. Statistical significance testing prevents over-interpretation of small sample results.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Provides comprehensive insights but requires careful statistical methodology and clear presentation of confidence levels.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>statistical foundation</strong> of score aggregation rests on robust descriptive statistics that account for the unique characteristics of evaluation data. Each aggregation level computes central tendency measures (mean, median), variability measures (standard deviation, interquartile range), and distributional characteristics (skewness, outlier detection). The system automatically adjusts statistical methods based on sample size and distribution properties.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Statistical Measure</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Calculation Method</th>\n<th>Interpretation Guidelines</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Mean Score</td>\n<td>Central tendency</td>\n<td>Arithmetic mean with outlier handling</td>\n<td>Primary performance indicator, sensitive to extreme values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Median Score</td>\n<td>Robust central tendency</td>\n<td>50th percentile</td>\n<td>Less affected by outliers, better for skewed distributions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard Deviation</td>\n<td>Variability measure</td>\n<td>Population standard deviation</td>\n<td>Indicates consistency, higher values suggest uneven performance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Confidence Interval</td>\n<td>Uncertainty bounds</td>\n<td>Bootstrap or t-distribution based</td>\n<td>95% CI for mean score, wider intervals indicate less certainty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sample Size</td>\n<td>Statistical power</td>\n<td>Count of valid results</td>\n<td>Minimum 30 for reliable statistics, flag small samples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Percentile Breakdown</td>\n<td>Distribution shape</td>\n<td>10th, 25th, 75th, 90th percentiles</td>\n<td>Reveals distribution characteristics and outlier patterns</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Category-based aggregation</strong> organizes results according to the natural structure of the evaluation dataset. The system automatically discovers categories from test case tags and metadata, then computes comprehensive statistics for each category. This enables identification of systematic strengths and weaknesses — for example, consistently high performance on factual questions but poor performance on creative tasks.</p>\n<p>The aggregation algorithm handles <strong>overlapping categories</strong> intelligently. Since test cases can belong to multiple categories (e.g., both &quot;medical&quot; and &quot;factual&quot;), the system avoids double-counting while still providing complete category-specific insights. Each test case contributes to all applicable category statistics, with clear tracking of overlap patterns for transparency.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aggregation Level</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Statistical Measures</th>\n<th>Use Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Overall</td>\n<td>All test cases</td>\n<td>Mean, median, std dev, CI, percentiles</td>\n<td>System health monitoring, executive dashboards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Category</td>\n<td>Test cases by category tags</td>\n<td>Per-category stats, category comparison</td>\n<td>Domain-specific performance analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tag</td>\n<td>Test cases by individual tags</td>\n<td>Tag-specific performance, tag correlation</td>\n<td>Fine-grained debugging, feature analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Difficulty</td>\n<td>Test cases by difficulty level</td>\n<td>Performance vs difficulty curve</td>\n<td>Capability assessment, training prioritization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Temporal</td>\n<td>Results over time windows</td>\n<td>Trend analysis, change detection</td>\n<td>Performance monitoring, regression tracking</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Score normalization and weighting</strong> ensures meaningful comparisons across different metrics and categories. The system applies configurable normalization schemes to handle metrics with different scales and distributions. <strong>Equal weighting</strong> treats all metrics as equally important, while <strong>custom weighting</strong> allows domain experts to emphasize critical evaluation dimensions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>temporal aggregation</strong> component tracks performance changes over time by computing rolling statistics and trend indicators. This enables detection of gradual performance changes that might be missed in single-evaluation snapshots. The system maintains statistical baselines and computes change significance to distinguish real trends from random fluctuation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight: Statistical Significance in Practice</strong>\nSmall sample sizes plague many LLM evaluations, making statistical significance testing crucial. The aggregation system automatically flags results with insufficient statistical power and adjusts confidence intervals accordingly. This prevents over-interpretation of results based on too little data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Aggregation Configuration</strong> allows customization of the statistical analysis to match organizational needs and domain requirements. Users can specify minimum sample sizes for reliable statistics, choose statistical methods appropriate for their data characteristics, and configure alerting thresholds for performance changes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Configuration Parameter</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Default Value</th>\n<th>Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>min_sample_size</code></td>\n<td>Minimum cases for reliable statistics</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Controls statistical significance flags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>confidence_level</code></td>\n<td>Confidence interval width</td>\n<td>0.95</td>\n<td>Affects uncertainty bound calculations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>outlier_threshold</code></td>\n<td>Standard deviations for outlier detection</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n<td>Balances outlier sensitivity vs false positives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>normalization_method</code></td>\n<td>Score normalization approach</td>\n<td>&quot;min_max&quot;</td>\n<td>Determines cross-metric comparison validity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>weighting_scheme</code></td>\n<td>Metric importance weighting</td>\n<td>&quot;equal&quot;</td>\n<td>Controls relative metric influence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>temporal_window</code></td>\n<td>Time window for trend analysis</td>\n<td>30 days</td>\n<td>Balances trend sensitivity vs noise</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-score-aggregation\">Common Pitfalls in Score Aggregation</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Simpson&#39;s Paradox in Category Aggregation</strong>\nWhen aggregating scores across categories, the overall average can show improvement while all individual categories show decline (or vice versa) due to changing category composition. The aggregation system addresses this by tracking category distribution changes and flagging potential Simpson&#39;s paradox cases with detailed composition analysis.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Statistical Significance with Multiple Comparisons</strong>\nWhen computing statistics for dozens of categories simultaneously, random chance will produce apparently significant results even when no real differences exist. The system applies multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni or FDR) when flagging category differences and clearly indicates adjusted vs unadjusted significance levels.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Metric Scale Incompatibility</strong>\nAggregating metrics with fundamentally different scales (0-1 probabilities vs 0-100 BLEU scores) without proper normalization produces meaningless results. The system enforces metric metadata requirements that specify scale and distribution characteristics, then applies appropriate normalization before aggregation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regression-detection\">Regression Detection</h3>\n<p><strong>Regression detection</strong> serves as the evaluation framework&#39;s <strong>early warning system</strong>, automatically identifying when model performance has degraded compared to established baselines. Think of it as a <strong>continuous integration system for AI quality</strong> — just as CI catches code regressions before they reach production, this system catches performance regressions before they impact users.</p>\n<p>The challenge of regression detection in LLM evaluation goes far beyond simple metric comparison. Performance can degrade in subtle ways that affect only specific categories or edge cases, changes can be gradual rather than sudden, and statistical noise can mask real degradation or create false alarms. The detection system must distinguish meaningful performance changes from random variation while being sensitive enough to catch important regressions early.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseline management</strong> forms the foundation of effective regression detection. The system maintains multiple types of baselines: <strong>golden baselines</strong> representing the best-ever performance, <strong>production baselines</strong> reflecting current deployed model performance, and <strong>development baselines</strong> tracking progress during model iteration. Each baseline includes not just aggregate scores but complete distributional characteristics needed for rigorous statistical comparison.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Statistical Testing vs Threshold-Based Detection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to distinguish real performance changes from random variation in noisy evaluation metrics</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Simple threshold comparison, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning anomaly detection</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Statistical hypothesis testing with configurable significance levels and effect size thresholds</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Thresholds alone can&#39;t account for natural variation in evaluation metrics. Statistical testing provides principled uncertainty quantification. ML anomaly detection adds complexity without clear benefits for this use case.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables confident regression detection with quantified uncertainty. Requires careful statistical methodology and clear interpretation guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>statistical testing framework</strong> applies appropriate hypothesis tests based on data characteristics and comparison requirements. For normally distributed metrics, the system uses <strong>t-tests</strong> or <strong>Welch&#39;s t-test</strong> when variances differ. For non-normal distributions, it applies <strong>Mann-Whitney U tests</strong> or other non-parametric alternatives. The framework automatically selects appropriate tests based on data distribution analysis and sample size considerations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Comparison Type</th>\n<th>Statistical Test</th>\n<th>Requirements</th>\n<th>Interpretation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single metric, normal distribution</td>\n<td>Two-sample t-test</td>\n<td>n &gt; 30, normality confirmed</td>\n<td>p-value &lt; α indicates significant change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single metric, non-normal</td>\n<td>Mann-Whitney U test</td>\n<td>No distribution assumptions</td>\n<td>Rank-based comparison, robust to outliers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple metrics</td>\n<td>Multivariate Hotelling T²</td>\n<td>Correlated metrics</td>\n<td>Tests for overall performance vector change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time series</td>\n<td>Changepoint detection</td>\n<td>Sequential data</td>\n<td>Identifies when performance regime shifted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Category-specific</td>\n<td>Stratified analysis</td>\n<td>Sufficient per-category samples</td>\n<td>Detects localized performance changes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Effect size estimation</strong> ensures that statistically significant changes are also practically meaningful. A large evaluation dataset might detect tiny performance differences that are statistically significant but practically irrelevant. The system computes <strong>Cohen&#39;s d</strong> for metric differences and flags only changes that exceed both statistical significance and practical significance thresholds.</p>\n<p>The <strong>multi-dimensional regression analysis</strong> simultaneously monitors performance across all evaluation dimensions to detect subtle degradations that might be missed by overall metrics. This includes category-specific regressions, tag-level changes, and difficulty-stratified analysis. The system applies multiple comparison corrections to control false discovery rates when testing many dimensions simultaneously.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Regression Detection Dimension</th>\n<th>Analysis Method</th>\n<th>Alert Criteria</th>\n<th>Action Recommended</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Overall Performance</td>\n<td>Global metric comparison</td>\n<td>p &lt; 0.05, effect size &gt; 0.2</td>\n<td>Immediate investigation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Category-Specific</td>\n<td>Per-category statistical tests</td>\n<td>FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.05</td>\n<td>Domain expert review</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tag-Level</td>\n<td>Fine-grained tag analysis</td>\n<td>Multiple tags affected</td>\n<td>Pattern analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Difficulty-Stratified</td>\n<td>Performance vs difficulty</td>\n<td>Slope change &gt; threshold</td>\n<td>Capability assessment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Temporal Pattern</td>\n<td>Trend analysis</td>\n<td>Significant negative slope</td>\n<td>Long-term monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distribution Shape</td>\n<td>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</td>\n<td>Distribution shift detected</td>\n<td>Data quality investigation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Changepoint detection algorithms</strong> identify when performance characteristics fundamentally shift, even if the change is gradual. The system applies <strong>CUSUM (Cumulative Sum)</strong> control charts and <strong>Bayesian changepoint detection</strong> to identify the specific evaluation run when performance regime changed. This enables precise timing of regression onset and correlation with model changes or data updates.</p>\n<p>The <strong>adaptive baseline system</strong> automatically updates baseline expectations as models improve, preventing false regression alerts when the current model significantly outperforms historical baselines. However, it maintains <strong>golden standard baselines</strong> that represent the best-ever performance to detect any retreat from peak capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight: The Baseline Staleness Problem</strong>\nBaselines become less relevant over time as evaluation datasets evolve and model capabilities advance. The system addresses this by maintaining multiple baseline types with different update policies: recent baselines for short-term regression detection and stable baselines for long-term capability tracking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Regression alert configuration</strong> allows teams to customize detection sensitivity based on their risk tolerance and evaluation methodology. High-stakes production systems might require very sensitive detection with low significance thresholds, while research environments might prefer higher thresholds to reduce alert fatigue.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Configuration Parameter</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Typical Values</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>significance_threshold</code></td>\n<td>p-value threshold for statistical significance</td>\n<td>0.01, 0.05, 0.10</td>\n<td>Lower = fewer false positives, more missed regressions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>effect_size_threshold</code></td>\n<td>Minimum effect size for practical significance</td>\n<td>0.1, 0.2, 0.3</td>\n<td>Higher = fewer trivial alerts, might miss subtle issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>baseline_update_policy</code></td>\n<td>How frequently baselines are updated</td>\n<td>&quot;manual&quot;, &quot;monthly&quot;, &quot;best_ever&quot;</td>\n<td>More frequent = fewer false alerts, less sensitivity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>multiple_comparison_correction</code></td>\n<td>Method for adjusting p-values</td>\n<td>&quot;bonferroni&quot;, &quot;fdr&quot;, &quot;none&quot;</td>\n<td>Stricter = fewer false discoveries, more missed detections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>temporal_sensitivity</code></td>\n<td>Lookback period for trend detection</td>\n<td>7, 14, 30 days</td>\n<td>Longer = smoother trends, slower detection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"failure-analysis\">Failure Analysis</h3>\n<p><strong>Failure analysis</strong> transforms individual evaluation failures into systematic insights about model limitations and improvement opportunities. Think of it as <strong>forensic analysis for AI systems</strong> — instead of just knowing that some test cases failed, you understand the underlying patterns, root causes, and specific areas where the model struggles.</p>\n<p>The challenge lies in the sheer volume and diversity of failure modes in LLM evaluation. A single evaluation run might produce hundreds of incorrect responses across dozens of categories and failure types. Manual analysis of this scale is impractical, yet automated analysis must preserve the nuanced understanding that human experts bring to failure interpretation.</p>\n<p>The <strong>failure clustering algorithm</strong> groups similar failures to reveal systematic patterns rather than treating each failure as an isolated incident. The system applies <strong>semantic clustering</strong> using embedding representations of failed responses, <strong>error type classification</strong> based on rubric violations, and <strong>root cause analysis</strong> that traces failures back to likely model limitations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Semantic Clustering vs Rule-Based Classification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to group diverse failure modes into meaningful categories for analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Manual categorization, rule-based error classification, semantic similarity clustering</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach combining semantic clustering with rule-based classification and human validation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Pure rule-based systems miss novel failure modes. Pure clustering produces clusters that aren&#39;t interpretable. Hybrid approach provides both comprehensiveness and interpretability.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables discovery of unexpected failure patterns while maintaining interpretable categories. Requires more sophisticated implementation and occasional human calibration.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Semantic failure clustering</strong> uses embedding representations to group failures with similar semantic characteristics, even when surface-level responses differ significantly. For example, all instances where the model provides factually incorrect medical information might cluster together regardless of the specific medical domain or question format.</p>\n<p>The clustering algorithm applies <strong>hierarchical clustering</strong> with <strong>cosine similarity</strong> on response embeddings, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters using <strong>silhouette analysis</strong> and <strong>gap statistic</strong> methods.

The failure analysis system balances attention between high-frequency failures and potentially high-impact rare failures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"report-generation\">Report Generation</h3>\n<p><strong>Report generation</strong> synthesizes all analysis outputs into comprehensive, actionable documents that serve different stakeholder needs within the organization. Think of it as creating a <strong>personalized data story</strong> for each audience — the same underlying evaluation data becomes an executive summary for leadership, a technical deep-dive for engineers, and a research report for model developers.</p>\n<p>The report generation system must handle multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, interactive dashboards), different levels of technical detail, and various time horizons (single evaluation reports, longitudinal studies, comparative analyses). Most critically, reports must be <strong>actionable</strong> — they should not just present information but guide specific decisions and improvement actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-audience report generation</strong> creates tailored views of the same evaluation results. <strong>Executive summaries</strong> focus on high-level trends, business impact, and strategic recommendations. <strong>Engineering reports</strong> emphasize actionable failure patterns, performance breakdowns, and implementation recommendations. <strong>Research reports</strong> provide detailed statistical analyses, methodological notes, and detailed failure case studies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Template-Based vs Dynamic Report Generation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to generate professional reports quickly while maintaining flexibility for different use cases</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Fixed report templates, completely custom generation, hybrid template system with dynamic sections</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid template system with customizable sections and dynamic content generation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fixed templates are too rigid for diverse use cases.

If a chart, table, or analysis doesn&#39;t lead to actionable insights, it creates noise rather than value. The report generation system applies this filter ruthlessly to ensure maximum utility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Report validation and quality control</strong> ensures that generated reports are accurate, complete, and professionally presented. The system validates data consistency across report sections, checks for sufficient statistical power before making claims, and applies formatting consistency rules for professional appearance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-reporting-and-analysis\">Common Pitfalls in Reporting and Analysis</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-Interpretation of Noisy Data</strong>\nLLM evaluation metrics are inherently noisy, and small changes can appear significant when viewed in isolation. The reporting system addresses this by always presenting confidence intervals, requiring minimum sample sizes for strong claims, and prominently displaying uncertainty indicators in all analyses.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Chart Junk and Information Overload</strong>\nComplex evaluation results can lead to cluttered visualizations that obscure rather than illuminate insights. The system applies strict information design principles: every visual element must serve a specific analytical purpose, color is used strategically to highlight important information, and complexity is progressively disclosed through interactive features.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Static Analysis of Dynamic Systems</strong>\nLLM models and evaluation datasets both evolve over time, making point-in-time reports potentially misleading. The system addresses this by incorporating temporal context in all analyses, highlighting when historical comparisons may not be valid due to dataset changes, and providing guidance on when baseline updates are needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The reporting and analysis system requires sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities combined with flexible report generation.

Raw materials (test cases) enter at one end, pass through multiple processing stations (validation, execution, scoring, analysis), and emerge as finished products (reports with actionable insights). Each station has specific responsibilities, clear input/output contracts, and well-defined handoff protocols. Just as a factory manager needs to understand the entire flow to optimize production, developers need to understand how evaluation data flows through the system to debug issues and optimize performance.</p>\n<p>The <strong>evaluation sequence</strong> represents the complete journey from dataset loading to report generation, while <strong>component communication</strong> defines the precise contracts between processing stations.

The system performs deep validation at this stage because fixing data issues early prevents cascading failures during expensive evaluation execution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Dataset validation happens before metric loading to fail fast on data issues.

This is the most resource-intensive phase involving LLM API calls and metric computations.</p>\n<p>The <code>BatchProcessor</code> orchestrates parallel execution while respecting rate limits and resource constraints:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The batch processor reads test cases from the prepared dataset and organizes them into execution batches based on the configured <code>max_concurrent_evaluations</code> limit</li>\n<li>For each batch, the system generates cache keys based on the prompt content and LLM provider configuration to check the <code>PromptCache</code> for existing responses</li>\n<li>Cache misses trigger LLM API calls through the configured provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local inference), with the <code>RateLimiter</code> enforcing request frequency limits</li>\n<li>The system stores successful LLM responses in the prompt cache with configurable TTL values to avoid redundant API calls in future evaluations</li>\n<li>Each model response flows through the metrics pipeline, where applicable metrics compute scores and generate <code>MetricResult</code> objects with detailed metadata</li>\n<li>The <code>CheckpointManager</code> periodically writes evaluation progress to the write-ahead log, enabling recovery from crashes or API failures</li>\n<li>The <code>ProgressTracker</code> updates completion statistics and provides real-time ETA estimates based on historical processing rates</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Execution Stage</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Processing</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Checkpointing</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Batch Formation</td>\n<td><code>List[TestCase]</code></td>\n<td>Group by batch size and provider</td>\n<td><code>List[Batch]</code></td>\n<td>Initial batch plan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LLM Invocation</td>\n<td><code>TestCase</code> + provider config</td>\n<td>API call with caching and rate limiting</td>\n<td>Model response string</td>\n<td>After each batch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric Computation</td>\n<td>Model response + expected output</td>\n<td>Parallel metric evaluation</td>\n<td><code>Dict[str, MetricResult]</code></td>\n<td>After metric completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Result Aggregation</td>\n<td>Individual metric results</td>\n<td>Compute overall scores and metadata</td>\n<td><code>EvaluationResult</code></td>\n<td>After each test case</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The evaluation execution phase implements sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms. The <code>CheckpointManager</code> maintains a write-ahead log that records evaluation intentions before executing them, enabling precise recovery after crashes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Checkpointing happens after metric computation rather than after LLM API calls because metric computation is deterministic and cheap to recompute, while LLM responses are expensive and non-deterministic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Execution Phase</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Rate Limit Cascade Failures</strong>\nWhen one LLM provider hits rate limits, naive implementations often retry immediately, causing more rate limit violations and eventually exhausting all providers. This creates a cascade failure where the entire evaluation stops making progress.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Avoid</strong>: Implement exponential backoff with jitter and provider health monitoring. The <code>RateLimiter</code> should track per-provider error rates and automatically reduce request frequency when rate limits are detected. The system should also distribute load across multiple providers when available.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Exhaustion with Large Datasets</strong>\nLoading entire evaluation results into memory causes out-of-memory errors with large datasets.

handling is critical throughout dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting analysis (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of error handling in an LLM evaluation framework like designing a hospital&#39;s emergency response system. Just as a hospital must handle everything from minor cuts to multi-organ failures while keeping essential services running, our evaluation framework must gracefully handle diverse failure scenarios—from network hiccups to complete dataset corruption—while maintaining the integrity of ongoing evaluations and preserving partial progress.</p>\n<p>The challenge in LLM evaluation systems is that errors can cascade across multiple domains simultaneously. A single API rate limit can trigger timeout exceptions, which can cause batch processing failures, which can corrupt checkpoint files, which can make evaluation recovery impossible. Unlike traditional software where errors often have local scope, evaluation framework errors tend to propagate through the entire system workflow, requiring sophisticated isolation and recovery mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Our comprehensive error handling strategy operates on three levels: <strong>prevention through design</strong> (using circuit breakers, rate limiting, and validation), <strong>graceful degradation</strong> (failing partially while maintaining core functionality), and <strong>recovery mechanisms</strong> (checkpointing, retry logic, and state reconstruction). Each component maintains its own error boundaries while participating in system-wide error coordination through structured message passing and health monitoring.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/llm-eval-framework/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling and Recovery Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-modes\">Failure Modes</h3>\n<p>Understanding failure modes requires thinking like a detective—we must anticipate not just what can go wrong, but how multiple failures can interact to create cascade effects. Each failure mode has distinct characteristics in terms of <strong>detectability</strong> (how quickly we notice), <strong>scope</strong> (what gets affected), <strong>recoverability</strong> (whether we can fix it automatically), and <strong>data impact</strong> (whether we lose information).</p>\n<h4 id=\"infrastructure-failures\">Infrastructure Failures</h4>\n<p>Infrastructure failures represent the foundation layer where everything else depends on external services and system resources. These failures often have the highest blast radius because they affect multiple components simultaneously.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Impact Scope</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Data Loss Risk</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>LLM API Rate Limiting</td>\n<td>HTTP 429 response codes</td>\n<td>Single provider</td>\n<td>Exponential backoff + provider failover</td>\n<td>None if cached</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LLM API Service Outage</td>\n<td>Connection timeouts, DNS failures</td>\n<td>Provider-wide</td>\n<td>Circuit breaker + alternative providers</td>\n<td>High without caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Intermittency</td>\n<td>Socket timeouts, packet loss</td>\n<td>Variable by connection</td>\n<td>Retry with jitter + connection pooling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk Space Exhaustion</td>\n<td>OS errno ENOSPC</td>\n<td>System-wide writes</td>\n<td>Cleanup + compression + external storage</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Exhaustion</td>\n<td>OOM killer, allocation failures</td>\n<td>Process-level</td>\n<td>Reduce batch sizes + garbage collection</td>\n<td>High for in-flight work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Permission Denied</td>\n<td>OS errno EACCES</td>\n<td>File/directory specific</td>\n<td>Permission repair + fallback locations</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>LLM API failures</strong> are particularly complex because they exhibit both predictable patterns (quota limits reset daily) and unpredictable behavior (model deployments causing temporary outages). Our <code>CircuitBreaker</code> component tracks failure patterns and automatically switches to alternative providers when primary services degrade.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Provider Fallback Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: LLM APIs have different availability patterns, rate limits, and performance characteristics</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single provider with retry, round-robin across providers, intelligent failover based on health monitoring</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Intelligent failover with health monitoring and provider-specific circuit breakers</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Different providers excel in different scenarios (OpenAI for speed, Anthropic for reasoning, local models for privacy), and their outages rarely correlate</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires provider capability mapping and consistent response formatting, but dramatically improves evaluation reliability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Resource exhaustion failures</strong> require predictive detection rather than reactive handling. Our <code>ResourceMonitor</code> tracks disk usage, memory consumption, and file descriptor counts, triggering cleanup procedures before hard limits are reached.</p>\n<h4 id=\"data-corruption-and-validation-failures\">Data Corruption and Validation Failures</h4>\n<p>Data corruption represents a particularly insidious class of failures because corrupted data often appears valid until it propagates through the system and causes downstream failures. Think of data corruption like a virus—by the time symptoms appear, the infection has often spread to multiple components.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Impact Scope</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Prevention Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Malformed JSON in Dataset</td>\n<td>Schema validation failure</td>\n<td>Single dataset load</td>\n<td>Skip invalid records + error report</td>\n<td>Pre-validation + type checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Encoding Issues (UTF-8)</td>\n<td>Decode exceptions</td>\n<td>Text processing pipeline</td>\n<td>Fallback encoding detection + normalization</td>\n<td>Character set validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing Required Fields</td>\n<td>Field access exceptions</td>\n<td>Test case processing</td>\n<td>Default value substitution + warnings</td>\n<td>Comprehensive schema validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circular References in Data</td>\n<td>Infinite recursion detection</td>\n<td>Serialization/deserialization</td>\n<td>Reference breaking + linearization</td>\n<td>DAG validation during construction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corrupted Cache Files</td>\n<td>Checksum mismatches</td>\n<td>Cache-dependent operations</td>\n<td>Cache invalidation + rebuilding</td>\n<td>Content-addressable storage + checksums</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Version Conflicts</td>\n<td>Merge conflict detection</td>\n<td>Dataset versioning</td>\n<td>Manual resolution + conflict markers</td>\n<td>Optimistic locking + change detection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Our <code>DataValidator</code> implements a multi-stage validation pipeline that catches corruption early. The first stage performs structural validation (JSON syntax, required fields), the second stage validates semantic constraints (score ranges, reference consistency), and the third stage performs cross-reference validation (foreign key integrity, circular dependency detection).</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Validation Pipeline Flow:\n1. Raw data ingestion with format detection\n2. Structural validation against JSON schema\n3. Field-level validation with type coercion\n4. Semantic validation with business rules\n5.

Our <code>SchemaUpgrader</code> maintains migration paths between schema versions, automatically transforming legacy data formats while preserving semantic meaning.</p>\n<h4 id=\"concurrency-and-state-management-failures\">Concurrency and State Management Failures</h4>\n<p>Concurrency failures in evaluation systems are particularly challenging because long-running evaluations involve complex state coordination between multiple asynchronous processes. Unlike web applications where requests are short-lived, evaluation workflows can run for hours or days, creating extended windows for race conditions and state inconsistencies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Impact Scope</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Prevention Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Race Conditions in Batch Processing</td>\n<td>Inconsistent results, data races</td>\n<td>Batch-level</td>\n<td>Idempotent operations + retry</td>\n<td>Pessimistic locking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadlock in Resource Allocation</td>\n<td>Timeout detection, dependency cycles</td>\n<td>Multi-resource operations</td>\n<td>Deadlock detection + resource ordering</td>\n<td>Lock hierarchy enforcement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stale Cache Invalidation</td>\n<td>Cache hit/miss ratio anomalies</td>\n<td>Cached computations</td>\n<td>TTL expiration + version tagging</td>\n<td>Cache coherence protocols</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Checkpoint File Corruption</td>\n<td>Checksum validation failures</td>\n<td>Evaluation recovery</td>\n<td>Checkpoint rollback + partial replay</td>\n<td>Write-ahead logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transaction Log Corruption</td>\n<td>Sequential read failures</td>\n<td>Persistent state</td>\n<td>Log repair + state reconstruction</td>\n<td>Redundant logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lost Updates in Concurrent Writes</td>\n<td>Version mismatch detection</td>\n<td>Shared state modifications</td>\n<td>Optimistic concurrency control</td>\n<td>Compare-and-swap operations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Our <code>CheckpointManager</code> implements a sophisticated write-ahead logging system that ensures evaluation state remains consistent even during system failures. Each state modification is logged before being applied, creating a recoverable transaction history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Write-Ahead Logging for Checkpoints</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Long-running evaluations need crash recovery without losing hours of progress</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Periodic full snapshots, incremental deltas, write-ahead logging with snapshots</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with write-ahead logging and periodic full snapshots</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: WAL provides fine-grained recovery capability while snapshots bound recovery time by limiting replay length</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly higher I/O overhead during normal operation, but dramatically faster recovery times and stronger consistency guarantees</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"evaluation-logic-failures\">Evaluation Logic Failures</h4>\n<p>Evaluation logic failures represent semantic errors in the evaluation process itself—cases where the system operates correctly from a technical perspective but produces meaningless or misleading results. These failures are often the most dangerous because they can go undetected while corrupting the entire evaluation outcome.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Impact Scope</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Prevention Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Metric Computation Overflow</td>\n<td>NaN/infinity detection</td>\n<td>Individual metric results</td>\n<td>Fallback to alternative computation</td>\n<td>Input range validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Division by Zero in Statistics</td>\n<td>Exception catching</td>\n<td>Aggregation computations</td>\n<td>Zero-sample handling + warnings</td>\n<td>Sample size validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Embedding Dimensionality Mismatch</td>\n<td>Shape validation errors</td>\n<td>Semantic similarity metrics</td>\n<td>Model compatibility checking</td>\n<td>Provider validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LLM Judge Inconsistency</td>\n<td>Score variance analysis</td>\n<td>LLM-as-judge evaluations</td>\n<td>Multiple judge consensus + calibration</td>\n<td>Judge prompt validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Preprocessing Pipeline Errors</td>\n<td>Text corruption detection</td>\n<td>Text normalization</td>\n<td>Pipeline stage isolation + rollback</td>\n<td>Stage-by-stage validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Metric Plugin Crashes</td>\n<td>Exception isolation</td>\n<td>Plugin metric computation</td>\n<td>Sandboxed execution + fallback scoring</td>\n<td>Resource limit enforcement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>LLM-as-judge inconsistency</strong> is particularly challenging because it represents a fundamental reliability issue with using language models to evaluate language models. Our <code>JudgeCalibrator</code> maintains consistency by using golden examples to detect judge drift and automatically recalibrating scoring rubrics.</p>\n<p>The <strong>metric computation pipeline</strong> implements defensive programming techniques where each metric computation is wrapped in error handling that provides sensible fallbacks. For example, if semantic similarity computation fails due to embedding API issues, the system falls back to fuzzy string matching with appropriate confidence scoring.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recovery-strategies\">Recovery Strategies</h3>\n<p>Recovery strategies operate like a medical triage system—we must quickly assess the severity of each failure, prioritize response efforts, and apply the most effective treatment while minimizing collateral damage. The key insight is that different failure types require fundamentally different recovery approaches, from immediate retry (for transient network issues) to complete evaluation restart (for corrupted state).</p>\n<h4 id=\"immediate-recovery-patterns\">Immediate Recovery Patterns</h4>\n<p>Immediate recovery patterns handle transient failures that are likely to resolve quickly without human intervention. These patterns prioritize speed of recovery over comprehensive diagnosis, making them suitable for infrastructure hiccups and temporary resource constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Exponential Backoff with Jitter</strong> forms the foundation of our retry logic. When an operation fails, we don&#39;t immediately retry—instead, we wait an exponentially increasing duration with random jitter to prevent thundering herd effects. The algorithm adapts the backoff parameters based on failure patterns, learning the optimal retry timing for different types of operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Retry Attempt</th>\n<th>Base Wait Time</th>\n<th>Jitter Range</th>\n<th>Max Wait</th>\n<th>Circuit Breaker Check</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1 second</td>\n<td>±200ms</td>\n<td>1.2s</td>\n<td>Closed → Continue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2 seconds</td>\n<td>±400ms</td>\n<td>2.4s</td>\n<td>Closed → Continue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4 seconds</td>\n<td>±800ms</td>\n<td>4.8s</td>\n<td>Half-Open → Test</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>8 seconds</td>\n<td>±1.6s</td>\n<td>9.6s</td>\n<td>Open → Fail Fast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5+</td>\n<td>16 seconds</td>\n<td>±3.2s</td>\n<td>19.2s</td>\n<td>Open → Alternative Provider</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Our <code>RetryManager</code> maintains separate retry policies for different operation types. API calls use aggressive retry with circuit breaker integration, while file I/O operations use conservative retry with filesystem health checks. Database operations use intermediate retry with transaction isolation validation.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker Integration</strong> prevents retry storms when downstream services are genuinely unavailable. The circuit breaker tracks failure rates over sliding time windows and automatically transitions between closed (normal operation), open (fast-fail mode), and half-open (testing recovery) states.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Circuit Breaker State Transitions:\n1. CLOSED: Normal operation, requests pass through\n2. Failure rate exceeds threshold → transition to OPEN\n3. OPEN: All requests fail immediately, preventing load on struggling service\n4. After timeout period → transition to HALF_OPEN\n5. HALF_OPEN: Single test request allowed through\n6. Test request succeeds → CLOSED, test request fails → OPEN</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Provider Failover</strong> implements intelligent routing across multiple LLM providers based on real-time health monitoring. When the primary provider fails, the system automatically routes requests to healthy alternatives while maintaining response format consistency.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Provider Status</th>\n<th>Routing Decision</th>\n<th>Fallback Chain</th>\n<th>Quality Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Primary Healthy</td>\n<td>Route to primary</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Baseline quality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary Degraded</td>\n<td>Load balance across healthy</td>\n<td>Secondary → Tertiary</td>\n<td>Minimal impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary Failed</td>\n<td>Route to best alternative</td>\n<td>Health-ranked providers</td>\n<td>Possible quality variation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All Providers Degraded</td>\n<td>Queue requests + batch retry</td>\n<td>Local model fallback</td>\n<td>Significant impact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"graceful-degradation-strategies\">Graceful Degradation Strategies</h4>\n<p>Graceful degradation ensures that partial failures don&#39;t bring down the entire evaluation system. Instead of treating any failure as a complete system failure, we identify which functionality can continue operating and which needs to be temporarily disabled.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Evaluation Continuation</strong> allows evaluations to proceed even when some metrics fail or some test cases encounter errors. The system maintains a detailed error log while computing results for all successful operations, providing maximum value from partially successful runs.</p>\n<p>Our <code>EvaluationCoordinator</code> implements a sophisticated dependency analysis system that determines which operations can proceed independently. If semantic similarity metrics fail due to embedding API issues, exact match and LLM-as-judge metrics can continue operating normally. The final report clearly indicates which results are complete and which are partial.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component Failure</th>\n<th>Continuing Operations</th>\n<th>Degraded Operations</th>\n<th>User Notification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Embedding API Down</td>\n<td>Exact match, LLM-as-judge</td>\n<td>Semantic similarity disabled</td>\n<td>Warning in report header</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary LLM Provider Failed</td>\n<td>Exact match, semantic similarity</td>\n<td>LLM-as-judge using secondary provider</td>\n<td>Provider switch notification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk Nearly Full</td>\n<td>All metrics computation</td>\n<td>Caching disabled, reporting limited</td>\n<td>Resource constraint warning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Intermittent</td>\n<td>Cached operations</td>\n<td>Real-time API calls queued</td>\n<td>Network status indicator</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Metric Fallback Hierarchies</strong> provide alternative scoring methods when primary metrics fail. For instance, if semantic similarity computation fails, the system can fall back to fuzzy string matching with appropriate confidence adjustments. Each fallback is clearly marked in the results to maintain evaluation transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpointed Progress Preservation</strong> ensures that even catastrophic failures don&#39;t result in complete work loss. The system continuously saves progress checkpoints that allow evaluation resumption from the last successful batch, minimizing re-computation requirements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Granular Checkpoint Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Long-running evaluations need fine-grained recovery without excessive I/O overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Checkpoint after every test case, checkpoint after every batch, checkpoint only at major milestones</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Adaptive checkpointing based on evaluation progress and system health</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Frequent checkpoints during unstable periods, less frequent during stable operation, balancing recovery granularity with performance overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex checkpoint management logic, but optimal balance between recovery capability and system performance</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"state-reconstruction-and-repair\">State Reconstruction and Repair</h4>\n<p>State reconstruction handles scenarios where system state has become corrupted or inconsistent, requiring careful analysis and repair procedures. Unlike immediate recovery patterns that assume the system is fundamentally healthy, state reconstruction acknowledges that something has gone fundamentally wrong and needs to be fixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Transaction Log Replay</strong> reconstructs consistent system state from write-ahead logs when checkpoint files become corrupted. The replay process validates each logged operation before applying it, skipping corrupted or inconsistent entries while maintaining referential integrity.</p>\n<p>The replay algorithm operates in several phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Log Validation Phase</strong>: Scan the entire transaction log to identify corrupted entries, missing sequences, and consistency violations</li>\n<li><strong>Checkpoint Selection Phase</strong>: Identify the latest valid checkpoint that can serve as a replay starting point</li>\n<li><strong>Incremental Replay Phase</strong>: Apply logged operations in strict chronological order, validating preconditions before each operation</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency Verification Phase</strong>: Verify that the reconstructed state satisfies all system invariants and cross-reference constraints</li>\n<li><strong>Reconciliation Phase</strong>: Handle any remaining inconsistencies through conflict resolution rules or user intervention prompts</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Cache Coherence Restoration</strong> handles scenarios where cached results have become inconsistent with their underlying data sources. Our cache system maintains content-addressable storage where cache keys are derived from input hashes, but cache corruption can still occur due to file system issues or concurrent access problems.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cache Inconsistency Type</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Repair Strategy</th>\n<th>Prevention Update</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stale Embeddings</td>\n<td>Embedding model version mismatch</td>\n<td>Batch recomputation + versioning</td>\n<td>Model version tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corrupted Response Cache</td>\n<td>Checksum validation failure</td>\n<td>Entry eviction + API retry</td>\n<td>Atomic write operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orphaned Cache Entries</td>\n<td>Reference counting audit</td>\n<td>Garbage collection + compaction</td>\n<td>Reference tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache Size Explosion</td>\n<td>Disk usage monitoring</td>\n<td>LRU eviction + size limits</td>\n<td>Proactive cleanup policies</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Dataset Version Reconciliation</strong> resolves conflicts when multiple users simultaneously modify evaluation datasets. Our version control system detects conflicts at the test case level and provides structured conflict resolution tools.</p>\n<p>When merge conflicts occur, the system presents users with a three-way diff view showing the base version, both conflicting modifications, and suggested resolutions. For automated resolution, we implement conflict resolution rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content conflicts (same test case modified differently) require manual resolution</li>\n<li>Addition conflicts (same case_id added with different content) prioritize the modification with more comprehensive metadata</li>\n<li>Tag conflicts (same test case tagged differently) merge tag sets with conflict annotations</li>\n<li>Metadata conflicts (same test case with different difficulty/category) use most recent timestamp</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"error-propagation-and-isolation\">Error Propagation and Isolation</h4>\n<p>Error propagation control prevents single component failures from cascading throughout the entire system. We implement bulkhead patterns that isolate different types of operations while maintaining coordinated error reporting and recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Isolation Boundaries</strong> ensure that failures in one component don&#39;t directly affect others. Each major component (Dataset Manager, Metrics Engine, Evaluation Runner, Reporter) operates with its own error handling context and resource limits.</p>\n<p>Our <code>ErrorBoundary</code> system intercepts exceptions at component boundaries and translates them into structured error messages that other components can understand and respond to appropriately. This prevents the error handling logic of one component from needing deep knowledge about the internal failure modes of other components.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Isolation Mechanism</th>\n<th>Error Translation</th>\n<th>Recovery Coordination</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Dataset Manager</td>\n<td>Process isolation + file locks</td>\n<td>Dataset operation errors → structured messages</td>\n<td>Version rollback coordination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metrics Engine</td>\n<td>Thread pools + resource limits</td>\n<td>Metric computation errors → score invalidation</td>\n<td>Partial result aggregation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Evaluation Runner</td>\n<td>Async task isolation + timeouts</td>\n<td>Execution errors → batch failure notifications</td>\n<td>Checkpoint coordination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reporter</td>\n<td>Memory isolation + temp files</td>\n<td>Report generation errors → partial output</td>\n<td>Alternative format generation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Structured Error Context Propagation</strong> ensures that when errors do cross component boundaries, they carry sufficient context for intelligent handling decisions. Each error includes not just the immediate failure reason, but also the evaluation context, attempted recovery actions, and suggested next steps.</p>\n<p>Our <code>ErrorContext</code> data structure captures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Failure Classification</strong>: Transient vs. permanent, local vs. systemic, recoverable vs. fatal</li>\n<li><strong>Operational Context</strong>: Which evaluation run, which test cases, which metrics, which providers</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental Context</strong>: System resources, network conditions, concurrent operations</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery History</strong>: What recovery attempts have been made, what worked, what failed</li>\n<li><strong>Impact Assessment</strong>: What functionality is affected, what can continue, what must stop</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This rich error context enables sophisticated recovery decision making. For example, if embedding API failures are detected during semantic similarity computation, the error context indicates whether this affects a small subset of test cases (continue with warnings) or the majority of the evaluation (pause and retry with different provider).</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The error handling implementation bridges robust theoretical design with practical engineering realities. Junior developers often struggle with error handling because it requires thinking about all the ways things can go wrong—which requires experience they don&#39;t yet have. Our implementation provides comprehensive error handling infrastructure that catches common mistakes while being extensible for domain-specific failure modes.</p>\n<h4

milestones (1-4) - Testing strategy spans dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting analysis (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Testing an LLM evaluation framework presents unique challenges compared to traditional software testing. Think of it like quality assurance for a quality assurance system - we need to verify that our system correctly measures the quality of something inherently subjective and probabilistic. Unlike testing a calculator where 2+2 always equals 4, we&#39;re testing a system where &quot;good&quot; output depends on context, domain expertise, and often human judgment. Our testing strategy must therefore balance mathematical precision with the inherent fuzziness of language evaluation.</p>\n<p>The testing approach follows a <strong>test pyramid architecture</strong> with three distinct layers, each serving different validation purposes. At the foundation, unit tests verify individual components work correctly in isolation - can our exact match metric correctly identify identical strings? In the middle, integration tests verify components work together properly - does our metrics engine correctly orchestrate multiple metrics and aggregate their results? At the apex, end-to-end tests verify the complete evaluation workflow produces reliable, actionable insights for real-world scenarios.</p>\n<p>Each milestone introduces specific testing challenges that require specialized approaches. Dataset management testing must verify data integrity across versions and formats. Metrics testing must validate both deterministic scoring (exact match) and probabilistic scoring (semantic similarity, LLM-as-judge). Evaluation runner testing must verify correct behavior under concurrency, failures, and resource constraints. Reporting testing must validate statistical computations and ensure insights are mathematically sound.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-pyramid\">Test Pyramid</h3>\n<p>The test pyramid organizes our testing strategy into three layers with different scopes, speeds, and purposes. This structure ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining fast feedback cycles for developers and reliable validation for production deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Unit Tests</strong> form the pyramid base and focus on individual component correctness. These tests run in milliseconds, use no external dependencies, and verify core business logic through deterministic inputs and outputs. Unit tests answer the question: &quot;Does this component implement its contract correctly?&quot; They use mocked dependencies, synthetic data, and focus on edge cases that might be rare in integration scenarios but could cause system failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration Tests</strong> form the pyramid middle and focus on component interaction correctness. These tests run in seconds, may use lightweight external dependencies (like embedded databases), and verify that components correctly communicate through their interfaces. Integration tests answer the question: &quot;Do these components work together correctly?&quot; They use realistic data flows, test error propagation between components, and verify that the system maintains consistency across component boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>End-to-End Tests</strong> form the pyramid apex and focus on complete workflow correctness. These tests run in minutes, use production-like environments with real LLM APIs, and verify that the entire system delivers value to users. End-to-end tests answer the question: &quot;Does the complete system solve the user&#39;s problem correctly?&quot; They use real datasets, actual LLM providers, and validate the full evaluation lifecycle from dataset loading through final report generation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The pyramid shape reflects both the number of tests at each level and their execution frequency. We need many fast unit tests running continuously, fewer integration tests running on commits, and even fewer end-to-end tests running before releases. This balance provides confidence without creating development friction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"unit-test-organization\">Unit Test Organization</h4>\n<p>Unit tests focus on individual class and method correctness with comprehensive coverage of business logic, edge cases, and error conditions. Each component follows a consistent testing structure that makes tests readable, maintainable, and comprehensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Dataset Management Unit Tests</strong> verify core data structures and operations work correctly in isolation. These tests validate test case creation, dataset operations, version control logic, and data format conversions without touching the file system or external dependencies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Test Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Test Case Validation</td>\n<td>Verify <code>TestCase</code> schema compliance</td>\n<td>Valid test case creation, missing required fields, invalid field types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dataset Operations</td>\n<td>Verify <code>Dataset</code> manipulation methods</td>\n<td>Add test case, remove test case, dataset merging, duplicate handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Version Control Logic</td>\n<td>Verify versioning algorithms</td>\n<td>Content hash computation, diff generation, merge conflict detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Format Conversion</td>\n<td>Verify import/export correctness</td>\n<td>CSV to <code>TestCase</code> conversion, JSON schema validation, malformed data handling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The dataset loader unit tests use synthetic data that covers edge cases rarely seen in real datasets but critical for robustness. For example, testing CSV files with embedded commas, JSON with nested quotes, and malformed Unicode characters. These tests verify the loader&#39;s resilience without requiring actual external files.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics Engine Unit Tests</strong> verify scoring algorithms produce correct results across the full range of inputs. These tests are particularly critical because metric correctness directly impacts evaluation quality, and bugs in scoring logic can invalidate entire evaluation runs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Test Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact Match Logic</td>\n<td>Verify string comparison accuracy</td>\n<td>Identical strings, whitespace differences, case sensitivity, Unicode normalization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fuzzy Match Logic</td>\n<td>Verify normalization pipeline</td>\n<td>Character normalization, punctuation removal, stop word handling, custom patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Semantic Similarity</td>\n<td>Verify embedding-based scoring</td>\n<td>Synonymous phrases, contradictory statements, embedding cache behavior, threshold calibration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LLM-as-Judge</td>\n<td>Verify judge prompt generation</td>\n<td>Prompt template rendering, response parsing, error handling, consistency controls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Score Aggregation</td>\n<td>Verify statistical computations</td>\n<td>Mean/median calculation, confidence intervals, outlier detection, weighted averages</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Metrics unit tests use carefully crafted test cases with known expected outputs.

Guide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - Debugging techniques are essential throughout dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of debugging an LLM evaluation framework like being a detective investigating a crime scene. You have symptoms (the evaluation failed or produced unexpected results), potential suspects (various components that could be malfunctioning), and evidence (logs, cached data, intermediate results). The key is knowing where to look first, what clues to gather, and how to systematically eliminate possibilities until you find the root cause.</p>\n<p>The debugging challenge is particularly complex in evaluation systems because failures can cascade across multiple layers. A dataset loading error might not surface until metric computation, an embedding cache corruption might cause semantic similarity scores to drift silently, and API rate limiting might create intermittent failures that are difficult to reproduce. Understanding these interaction patterns is crucial for effective debugging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-implementation-bugs\">Common Implementation Bugs</h3>\n<p>The most frequent bugs developers encounter when building and using the evaluation framework fall into predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps developers quickly identify and fix issues without extensive investigation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dataset-management-bugs\">Dataset Management Bugs</h4>\n<p><strong>Schema Validation Failures</strong></p>\n<p>The most common dataset management bug involves schema validation failures that aren&#39;t immediately obvious. When the <code>DatasetLoader</code> attempts to map CSV columns to the <code>TestCase</code> schema, subtle mismatches can cause entire datasets to be rejected or partially loaded with corrupted data.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Case sensitivity mismatch</td>\n<td>&quot;prompt&quot; column not found error</td>\n<td>CSV has &quot;Prompt&quot; but loader expects &quot;prompt&quot;</td>\n<td>Add case-insensitive column mapping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Extra whitespace in headers</td>\n<td>Random columns marked as missing</td>\n<td>CSV headers have trailing spaces</td>\n<td>Strip whitespace in column name normalization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unicode encoding issues</td>\n<td>Garbled text in loaded test cases</td>\n<td>CSV saved with different encoding than UTF-8</td>\n<td>Detect encoding automatically or force UTF-8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing required fields</td>\n<td>Schema validation error after load</td>\n<td>Some test cases lack expected_output</td>\n<td>Add validation during load with clear error messages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tag parsing failures</td>\n<td>Tags appear as strings instead of lists</td>\n<td>JSON tags serialized as strings in CSV</td>\n<td>Parse tag columns as JSON arrays with fallback</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Silent Schema Violations</strong>\nMany developers assume that if <code>load_dataset()</code> returns successfully, all test cases are valid. However, the loader might skip invalid rows silently or apply default values that mask data quality issues. Always check the returned <code>Dataset.test_cases</code> count against the expected number of rows and validate a sample of loaded cases manually.</p>\n<p><strong>Version Control Conflicts</strong></p>\n<p>Dataset versioning introduces merge conflicts that can corrupt the version history if not handled properly. The <code>DatasetVersionControl</code> system tracks changes using content hashes, but concurrent modifications can create inconsistent states.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hash collision detection failure</td>\n<td>Different datasets with same version ID</td>\n<td>Weak hashing algorithm or insufficient content coverage</td>\n<td>Use SHA-256 with complete test case serialization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Merge conflict resolution</td>\n<td>Lost changes after version merge</td>\n<td>Automatic merge overwrites manual edits</td>\n<td>Implement three-way merge with conflict markers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circular version references</td>\n<td>Infinite loop during version traversal</td>\n<td>Parent-child relationships create cycles</td>\n<td>Validate version graph for cycles during creation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrent write corruption</td>\n<td>Version metadata inconsistent</td>\n<td>Multiple processes writing simultaneously</td>\n<td>Use file locking or atomic rename operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orphaned version cleanup</td>\n<td>Disk space grows without bound</td>\n<td>Old versions never garbage collected</td>\n<td>Implement reference counting for version cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Version Drift</strong>\nWhen multiple team members work on the same dataset, their local versions can diverge silently. The framework tracks content hashes, but developers often don&#39;t notice that their &quot;latest&quot; version differs from others. Always compare version IDs and change summaries before assuming you&#39;re working with the same dataset version.</p>\n<h4 id=\"metrics-engine-bugs\">Metrics Engine Bugs</h4>\n<p><strong>Embedding Cache Corruption</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>EmbeddingCache</code> stores computed embeddings to avoid redundant API calls, but cache corruption can cause semantic similarity scores to become unreliable. This is particularly insidious because the corruption often affects only a subset of embeddings, making the problem appear intermittent.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stale embedding retrieval</td>\n<td>Semantic similarity scores don&#39;t match expected values</td>\n<td>Cache returns old embeddings after model update</td>\n<td>Include model version in cache key</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial cache corruption</td>\n<td>Some similarity scores are obviously wrong (negative, &gt;1.0)</td>\n<td>Database corruption affects specific entries</td>\n<td>Validate cached embeddings before use</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory pressure eviction</td>\n<td>Embeddings cache hit rate drops unexpectedly</td>\n<td>System memory pressure causes cache eviction</td>\n<td>Monitor memory usage and implement cache size limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrent access corruption</td>\n<td>Random cache misses despite recent computation</td>\n<td>Multiple processes writing to cache simultaneously</td>\n<td>Use database transactions or file locking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Text preprocessing inconsistency</td>\n<td>Same text produces different embeddings</td>\n<td>Text preprocessed differently during cache storage vs retrieval</td>\n<td>Store preprocessing metadata with cached embeddings</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Silent Cache Poisoning</strong>\nWhen the embedding model changes (e.g., upgrading from text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-small), cached embeddings from the old model remain valid according to the cache logic but are semantically incompatible. This causes semantic similarity scores to drift gradually as cached and fresh embeddings get mixed. Always invalidate the cache when changing embedding models.</p>\n<p><strong>LLM-as-Judge Inconsistency</strong></p>\n<p>The LLM-as-judge evaluation pattern is notoriously unreliable because language models can produce different scores for identical inputs. This non-determinism makes debugging particularly challenging since the same test might pass or fail on different runs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Temperature sensitivity</td>\n<td>Judge scores vary widely between runs</td>\n<td>Non-zero temperature causes random sampling</td>\n<td>Set temperature=0.0 for deterministic output</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prompt engineering failures</td>\n<td>Judge produces unparseable scores (&quot;Good&quot; instead of numbers)</td>\n<td>Judge prompt doesn&#39;t constrain output format sufficiently</td>\n<td>Add explicit format requirements and examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Context length overflow</td>\n<td>Judge truncates long inputs silently</td>\n<td>Model response or expected output exceeds context window</td>\n<td>Implement chunking or fallback to exact match</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Model-specific biases</td>\n<td>Judge consistently favors certain response patterns</td>\n<td>Different judge models have different scoring tendencies</td>\n<td>Calibrate score thresholds per judge model</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parsing edge cases</td>\n<td>Score extraction fails on valid judge responses</td>\n<td>Regex or JSON parsing doesn&#39;t handle all output formats</td>\n<td>Use robust parsing with multiple fallback strategies</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Judge Model Drift</strong>\nCloud LLM providers occasionally update their models behind the same API endpoint, causing judge scoring to drift over time even with identical prompts and temperature settings. This breaks evaluation reproducibility. Always log the exact model version used for judging and monitor score distributions for unexpected changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"evaluation-runner-bugs\">Evaluation Runner Bugs</h4>\n<p><strong>Concurrency and Rate Limiting Issues</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>EvaluationRunner</code> processes test cases in parallel to maximize throughput, but this introduces race conditions and rate limiting complications that can cause evaluations to fail or produce incorrect results.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Rate limit cascade failures</td>\n<td>Evaluation fails completely after initial rate limit hit</td>\n<td>No exponential backoff, all retries happen simultaneously</td>\n<td>Implement jittered exponential backoff with per-provider limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache race conditions</td>\n<td>Same prompt evaluated multiple times simultaneously</td>\n<td>Multiple workers check cache, find miss, make same API call</td>\n<td>Use atomic cache operations or request deduplication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory exhaustion</td>\n<td>Evaluation slows dramatically or crashes with OOM</td>\n<td>Large result sets stored in memory without streaming</td>\n<td>Implement result streaming and periodic memory cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Progress tracking corruption</td>\n<td>Progress bar shows &gt;100% or goes backwards</td>\n<td>Concurrent updates to progress counters without synchronization</td>\n<td>Use atomic operations or message passing for progress updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Checkpoint corruption</td>\n<td>Recovery loads partial or inconsistent state</td>\n<td>Checkpoint written while evaluation state is changing</td>\n<td>Use copy-on-write or stop-the-world checkpointing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Thundering Herd on Recovery</strong>\nWhen an evaluation resumes from a checkpoint, all pending test cases often start processing simultaneously, overwhelming the LLM API and triggering rate limits immediately. This can make recovery slower than restarting from scratch. Implement gradual ramp-up after recovery, starting with small batch sizes and increasing as the system proves stable.</p>\n<p><strong>Result Caching Edge Cases</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>PromptCache</code> stores LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls, but cache key generation and invalidation logic contains subtle bugs that can cause stale results to be served or cache misses where hits should occur.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hash collision false positives</td>\n<td>Different prompts return identical cached responses</td>\n<td>Weak hash function causes different prompts to map to same key</td>\n<td>Use cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of full prompt content</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider config ignored in key</td>\n<td>Same prompt with different models/temperatures returns same cached result</td>\n<td>Cache key doesn&#39;t include all provider configuration parameters</td>\n<td>Include full <code>LLMProviderConfig</code> in cache key generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TTL inconsistency</td>\n<td>Cache returns stale results after configured expiration</td>\n<td>System clock drift or timezone issues affect TTL calculation</td>\n<td>Use UTC timestamps and validate system clock synchronization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cache key encoding issues</td>\n<td>Unicode prompts produce inconsistent cache keys</td>\n<td>String encoding differences affect hash computation</td>\n<td>Normalize all text to UTF-8 before hashing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large prompt truncation</td>\n<td>Cache misses for prompts that should hit</td>\n<td>Hash computation truncates very long prompts</td>\n<td>Use streaming hash computation for large inputs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Development vs Production Cache Differences</strong>\nDevelopers often test with small datasets and see excellent cache hit rates, but production evaluations with larger, more diverse datasets experience much lower hit rates. This happens because development datasets often contain duplicate or very similar prompts, while production datasets are more varied. Always test caching performance with production-scale, production-diversity datasets.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reporting-and-analysis-bugs\">Reporting and Analysis Bugs</h4>\n<p><strong>Statistical Analysis Errors</strong></p>\n<p>The reporting system performs statistical analysis to detect regressions and generate insights, but statistical computations are prone to edge cases that can produce misleading or invalid results.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Small sample size inflation</td>\n<td>Statistical significance detected with tiny effect sizes</td>\n<td>Insufficient sample size makes noise appear significant</td>\n<td>Enforce minimum sample size requirements before statistical tests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple comparison errors</td>\n<td>False positive regression alerts</td>\n<td>Testing many metrics simultaneously inflates Type I error rate</td>\n<td>Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction for multiple comparisons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outlier contamination</td>\n<td>Mean scores drastically affected by few extreme values</td>\n<td>No outlier detection before computing summary statistics</td>\n<td>Use robust statistics (median, IQR) or outlier removal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distribution assumption violations</td>\n<td>t-tests applied to non-normal data</td>\n<td>Statistical tests assume normality but scores are skewed</td>\n<td>Use non-parametric tests or transform data to normality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing data handling</td>\n<td>Analysis excludes failed test cases without adjustment</td>\n<td>Metrics computed only on successful cases bias results upward</td>\n<td>Use intent-to-treat analysis or explicitly model failure rates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Simpson&#39;s Paradox in Aggregation</strong>\nWhen aggregating scores across different test case categories, overall performance can appear to improve even when every individual category got worse, or vice versa. This happens when the mix of test case types changes between evaluations. Always report both overall and per-category statistics, and investigate any cases where trends diverge.</p>\n<p><strong>Visualization and Export Failures</strong></p>\n<p>Report generation involves complex data transformations and external dependencies that can fail in hard-to-diagnose ways, often producing partially corrupt outputs that appear valid at first glance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chart rendering failures</td>\n<td>Reports contain blank spaces where charts should appear</td>\n<td>JavaScript errors in chart library or data format mismatches</td>\n<td>Validate chart data schema and handle rendering exceptions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PDF export corruption</td>\n<td>Generated PDFs are unreadable or truncated</td>\n<td>HTML to PDF conversion fails on complex layouts</td>\n<td>Simplify CSS, avoid unsupported features, test with headless browser</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unicode handling in exports</td>\n<td>Special characters appear as boxes or question marks</td>\n<td>Export pipeline doesn&#39;t preserve UTF-8 encoding</td>\n<td>Ensure UTF-8 encoding throughout export pipeline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large dataset memory issues</td>\n<td>Report generation fails or takes extremely long</td>\n<td>Visualization libraries load entire dataset into memory</td>\n<td>Implement data sampling or streaming for large reports</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Template variable injection</td>\n<td>Report shows raw template syntax instead of values</td>\n<td>Template rendering fails but error is silently ignored</td>\n<td>Validate template variable binding and handle missing data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Browser-Specific Rendering Differences</strong>\nHTML reports often render correctly in one browser but break in others due to CSS compatibility issues or JavaScript differences. This is particularly problematic when stakeholders use different browsers than developers. Always test report rendering in multiple browsers and use progressive enhancement for advanced features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-techniques\">Debugging Techniques</h3>\n<p>Effective debugging of the evaluation framework requires systematic approaches tailored to the distributed, asynchronous nature of the system. The following techniques provide structured methodologies for diagnosing and resolving issues across all components.</p>\n<h4 id=\"structured-diagnostic-approach\">Structured Diagnostic Approach</h4>\n<p><strong>Symptom Classification and Triage</strong></p>\n<p>When an evaluation fails or produces unexpected results, the first step is classifying the symptom to determine which diagnostic path to follow. Different symptom types require different investigation strategies and have different urgency levels.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom Category</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Investigation Priority</th>\n<th>Initial Diagnostic Steps</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Complete evaluation failure</td>\n<td>Process crashes, no results generated</td>\n<td>Critical - investigate immediately</td>\n<td>Check process logs, validate dataset loading, verify API credentials</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial evaluation failure</td>\n<td>Some test cases succeed, others fail</td>\n<td>High - may indicate systematic issues</td>\n<td>Analyze failure patterns by tags, difficulty, prompt length</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Score distribution anomalies</td>\n<td>Unexpectedly high/low scores, narrow distributions</td>\n<td>Medium - may indicate metric bugs</td>\n<td>Compare score histograms with baselines, validate metric implementations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance degradation</td>\n<td>Evaluation takes much longer than expected</td>\n<td>Medium - check for resource issues</td>\n<td>Monitor CPU/memory usage, analyze batch processing efficiency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Report generation issues</td>\n<td>Missing charts, formatting problems, export failures</td>\n<td>Low - functional but presentation problems</td>\n<td>Validate data pipeline inputs, check template rendering</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Component Isolation Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation framework consists of multiple interacting components, making it challenging to determine which component is responsible for a given issue. Systematic component isolation helps narrow down the investigation scope.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Start with the outermost component</strong>: Begin investigation at the point where you first observe the problem (usually the <code>EvaluationCoordinator</code> or report output).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Trace the data flow backwards</strong>: Follow the data transformation chain in reverse, validating inputs and outputs at each stage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use component boundaries as checkpoints</strong>: Each major component (<code>DatasetLoader</code>, <code>MetricRegistry</code>, <code>BatchProcessor</code>, etc.) should provide validation methods to check its internal state.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Isolate external dependencies</strong>: Test with mock implementations of LLM APIs, file systems, and databases to determine if the issue is internal or external.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Reduce to minimal test case</strong>: Create the smallest possible dataset and simplest possible configuration that reproduces the issue.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Log Analysis and Correlation</strong></p>\n<p>The framework generates logs from multiple components that execute concurrently.

The framework provides an interactive metric testing interface that allows developers to evaluate individual metrics with custom inputs and inspect intermediate computation steps.</p>\n<p>The metric testing workflow follows this pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Load a specific test case</strong>: Select a failing test case or create a synthetic case that demonstrates the issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Execute metric in isolation</strong>: Run the problematic metric alone, bypassing the normal evaluation pipeline.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Inspect preprocessing steps</strong>: Examine how text preprocessing affects the inputs before metric computation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Trace computation steps</strong>: For complex metrics like semantic similarity, inspect embedding generation and similarity calculation separately.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Compare with expected behavior</strong>: Run the same inputs through alternative implementations or manual calculations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Cache and Storage Debugging</strong></p>\n<p>Many evaluation issues stem from corrupted or inconsistent cached data.

A comprehensive regression testing framework helps catch these issues before they affect production evaluations.</p>\n<p>The regression testing strategy operates at multiple levels:</p>\n<p><strong>Unit-level regression tests</strong> validate individual components with synthetic data that exercises edge cases and error conditions. These tests run quickly and provide immediate feedback during development.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration-level regression tests</strong> use real datasets and LLM APIs to validate cross-component interactions. These tests take longer but catch issues that unit tests miss.</p>\n<p><strong>End-to-end regression tests</strong> run complete evaluations with known datasets and verify that results match historical baselines within acceptable tolerance ranges.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance regression tests</strong> measure evaluation throughput, memory usage, and API efficiency to detect performance degradations that might not affect correctness but impact user experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Principle</strong>: Regression tests must be deterministic despite the non-deterministic nature of LLM APIs. Use fixed random seeds, cached responses, or mock providers to ensure test results are reproducible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Baseline Management and Drift Detection</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation framework&#39;s primary purpose is detecting changes in model performance over time. However, the framework itself can introduce measurement drift that masquerades as model performance changes. Systematic baseline management helps distinguish real performance changes from measurement artifacts.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseline establishment</strong> involves running the same evaluation multiple times with identical configurations to establish natural score variation ranges. This variation becomes the threshold for detecting real performance changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Drift detection</strong> monitors evaluation results for systematic changes that might indicate framework bugs rather than model changes. Examples include gradual score inflation due to cache corruption or sudden score shifts due to API provider model updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Control group evaluation</strong> runs a subset of test cases with a fixed, well-understood model (like GPT-3.5-turbo with fixed parameters) alongside production evaluations. Changes in control group scores indicate measurement issues rather than model performance changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-validation with external tools</strong> periodically validates framework results against other evaluation tools or manual assessment to detect systematic biases or calibration drift.</p>\n<h4 id=\"performance-profiling-and-optimization\">Performance Profiling and Optimization</h4>\n<p><strong>Resource Usage Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Evaluation performance issues often stem from resource bottlenecks that aren&#39;t immediately obvious. Systematic resource monitoring helps identify these bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Type</th>\n<th>Monitoring Approach</th>\n<th>Common Bottlenecks</th>\n<th>Optimization Strategies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>CPU utilization</td>\n<td>Profile CPU usage during batch processing</td>\n<td>JSON parsing, text preprocessing, statistical computations</td>\n<td>Optimize data structures, use compiled libraries, implement caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory consumption</td>\n<td>Track memory growth during evaluation</td>\n<td>Large datasets loaded entirely into memory, embedding cache growth</td>\n<td>Implement streaming, add memory limits, use memory mapping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network bandwidth</td>\n<td>Monitor API request/response sizes and frequencies</td>\n<td>Large prompts, inefficient batching, redundant API calls</td>\n<td>Compress requests, optimize batch sizes, improve caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk I/O</td>\n<td>Profile file read/write patterns</td>\n<td>Frequent checkpoint writes, large log files, cache thrashing</td>\n<td>Use write-ahead logging, implement log rotation, optimize cache placement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API quota usage</td>\n<td>Track requests per minute across all providers</td>\n<td>Inefficient retry logic, redundant requests, poor load balancing</td>\n<td>Implement intelligent retry policies, improve caching, add provider failover</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Concurrency Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation framework uses extensive concurrency to maximize throughput, but concurrency bugs can cause performance degradation or correctness issues that are difficult to diagnose.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadlock detection</strong>: Monitor for situations where evaluation progress stops completely despite no obvious errors. This often indicates deadlocks between components waiting for each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource contention analysis</strong>: Identify cases where concurrent operations compete for shared resources (cache locks, file handles, API rate limits) and cause performance degradation.</p>\n<p><strong>Batch size optimization</strong>: Different evaluation scenarios require different optimal batch sizes. Too small batches waste overhead on API calls and coordination; too large batches cause memory issues and reduce parallelism benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Load balancing effectiveness</strong>: When using multiple LLM providers, monitor whether load is distributed evenly and whether failover logic works correctly under different failure scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation

upon the foundational capabilities established across dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting &amp; analysis (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-features\">Advanced Features</h3>\n<p>Think of the current evaluation framework as a solid foundation — like a well-built house with strong bones, plumbing, and electrical systems. The advanced features are sophisticated additions that transform this functional house into a smart home with automation, predictive maintenance, and seamless integration with the broader neighborhood infrastructure. Each advanced feature leverages the core capabilities we&#39;ve built while extending them in ways that weren&#39;t feasible to include in the initial design due to complexity constraints.</p>\n<p>The advanced features fall into three categories: <strong>enhanced evaluation capabilities</strong> that make assessments more sophisticated and nuanced, <strong>intelligent automation</strong> that reduces manual oversight and intervention, and <strong>scale optimization</strong> that enables evaluation of massive datasets and complex model architectures. Each category builds incrementally on the existing system without requiring fundamental architectural changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multi-modal-evaluation-support\">Multi-Modal Evaluation Support</h4>\n<p>The current framework focuses exclusively on text-to-text evaluation, but modern LLM applications increasingly involve multi-modal inputs and outputs. Think of this extension as adding support for evaluating a conversation that includes not just words, but also images, audio, and structured data — like assessing how well an AI assistant can analyze a medical image, interpret a patient&#39;s spoken symptoms, and generate both a written diagnosis and a visual explanation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-Modal Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Modern LLMs handle text, images, audio, and structured data, but current evaluation framework only supports text inputs and outputs</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Separate evaluation frameworks for each modality</li>\n<li>Universal evaluation interface with modality-specific implementations</li>\n<li>Pipeline-based evaluation with modality conversion stages</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Universal evaluation interface with modality-specific metric implementations</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maintains consistent evaluation semantics while allowing specialized handling of different data types; enables cross-modal evaluation scenarios</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires extending <code>TestCase</code> schema and developing modality-specific metrics, but preserves existing evaluation workflow</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The multi-modal extension introduces several new components that integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture. The <code>MultiModalTestCase</code> extends the current <code>TestCase</code> structure to handle different input and output modalities while maintaining backward compatibility with text-only evaluations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Integration Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>MultiModalTestCase</code></td>\n<td>Test case supporting images, audio, video inputs</td>\n<td>Extends existing <code>TestCase</code> with modality fields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ModalityProcessor</code></td>\n<td>Converts between different data formats</td>\n<td>Plugs into preprocessing pipeline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CrossModalMetric</code></td>\n<td>Measures alignment between different modalities</td>\n<td>Implements <code>BaseMetric</code> interface</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ModalityCache</code></td>\n<td>Caches expensive modality conversions</td>\n<td>Extends existing caching infrastructure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The evaluation workflow adapts naturally to handle multi-modal data. When a test case contains an image input, the <code>ModalityProcessor</code> converts it to embeddings or other representations that metrics can consume. For example, evaluating an image captioning model involves comparing generated text against reference captions using semantic similarity, while also checking whether the caption accurately describes visual elements present in the image.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Evaluation Type</th>\n<th>Input Modality</th>\n<th>Output Modality</th>\n<th>Metric Examples</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Image Captioning</td>\n<td>Image</td>\n<td>Text</td>\n<td>CLIP similarity, object detection accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audio Transcription</td>\n<td>Audio</td>\n<td>Text</td>\n<td>Word error rate, speaker identification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Visual Question Answering</td>\n<td>Image + Text</td>\n<td>Text</td>\n<td>Answer accuracy, visual grounding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Document Analysis</td>\n<td>PDF/Image</td>\n<td>Structured JSON</td>\n<td>Field extraction accuracy, layout preservation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"adaptive-evaluation-strategies\">Adaptive Evaluation Strategies</h4>\n<p>Current evaluation runs all test cases through the same metrics regardless of case difficulty or characteristics. An adaptive evaluation system acts like an experienced teacher who adjusts questioning strategy based on student performance — easy questions get quick verification, while challenging cases receive deeper analysis with multiple evaluation approaches.</p>\n<p>The adaptive strategy engine analyzes test case metadata, model confidence scores, and historical performance patterns to dynamically select appropriate metrics and evaluation depth. This significantly reduces evaluation cost while maintaining accuracy for cases that require detailed assessment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Adaptive Metric Selection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Running expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation on every test case is costly, but some cases need minimal verification while others require deep analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Static metric assignment based on test case tags</li>\n<li>Model confidence-based metric selection</li>\n<li>Multi-stage evaluation with escalation rules</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Multi-stage evaluation with confidence-based escalation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances cost and accuracy by using cheap metrics first, escalating to expensive evaluation only when needed</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires confidence scoring infrastructure and escalation rule engine, but can reduce evaluation costs by 60-80%</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The adaptive evaluation pipeline operates in three stages. <strong>Stage 1</strong> applies fast, deterministic metrics like exact match and BLEU scores to all test cases. <strong>Stage 2</strong> escalates cases with low confidence or conflicting signals to semantic similarity evaluation. <strong>Stage 3</strong> applies expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation only to cases where automated metrics provide insufficient signal.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Stage</th>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Metrics Applied</th>\n<th>Cost Factor</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stage 1</td>\n<td>All cases</td>\n<td>Exact match, BLEU, ROUGE</td>\n<td>1x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage 2</td>\n<td>Confidence &lt; 0.8 OR conflicting signals</td>\n<td>Semantic similarity, embedding-based</td>\n<td>10x</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stage 3</td>\n<td>High-stakes cases OR ambiguous results</td>\n<td>LLM-as-judge, human-in-loop</td>\n<td>100x</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The escalation rules are configurable and can incorporate domain-specific knowledge. For instance, mathematical reasoning problems might escalate based on numerical accuracy, while creative writing tasks might escalate based on semantic diversity from the reference answer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"continuous-learning-from-evaluation-results\">Continuous Learning from Evaluation Results</h4>\n<p>Think of this feature as giving the evaluation system a memory and learning capability — like a quality assurance inspector who gets better at spotting defects by analyzing patterns in past inspections. The continuous learning system analyzes evaluation results over time to improve metric calibration, detect evaluation blind spots, and recommend dataset improvements.</p>\n<p>The learning system operates on three timescales. <strong>Real-time learning</strong> adjusts metric weights and thresholds during evaluation runs based on observed score distributions. <strong>Session learning</strong> analyzes completed evaluation runs to identify systematic biases or metric inconsistencies. <strong>Historical learning</strong> examines long-term trends to suggest dataset evolution and metric retirement strategies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Learning Type</th>\n<th>Timescale</th>\n<th>Adaptation Target</th>\n<th>Example Improvement</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Real-time</td>\n<td>During evaluation</td>\n<td>Metric thresholds, batch sizing</td>\n<td>Adjust semantic similarity threshold based on score distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session</td>\n<td>Post-evaluation</td>\n<td>Metric correlations, failure patterns</td>\n<td>Identify metrics that consistently disagree and investigate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Historical</td>\n<td>Weekly/monthly</td>\n<td>Dataset composition, metric retirement</td>\n<td>Recommend new test cases for under-represented failure modes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The learning system maintains a <code>MetricPerformanceHistory</code> that tracks metric reliability, correlation patterns, and prediction accuracy over time. This data feeds into automatic recalibration algorithms and human-readable improvement recommendations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hierarchical-evaluation-taxonomies\">Hierarchical Evaluation Taxonomies</h4>\n<p>Current evaluation treats all test cases uniformly, but real-world applications have hierarchical skill requirements. Think of this like academic assessment — you need to master basic arithmetic before attempting calculus, and evaluation should reflect these skill dependencies. The hierarchical evaluation system organizes test cases into skill trees and provides detailed breakdowns of model capabilities across different competency levels.</p>\n<p>The taxonomy system introduces <code>SkillNode</code> entities that represent different capabilities and their dependencies. A language model&#39;s performance on &quot;mathematical reasoning&quot; might depend on its mastery of &quot;numerical calculation,&quot; &quot;logical inference,&quot; and &quot;word problem parsing.&quot; The evaluation system tracks performance at each skill level and identifies capability gaps.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Skill Level</th>\n<th>Dependencies</th>\n<th>Evaluation Focus</th>\n<th>Progression Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Basic Skills</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Fundamental capabilities</td>\n<td>95%+ accuracy on core tasks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermediate</td>\n<td>2-3 basic skills</td>\n<td>Skill combination</td>\n<td>85%+ accuracy with reasoning trace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Advanced</td>\n<td>Multiple intermediate</td>\n<td>Complex problem solving</td>\n<td>70%+ accuracy on novel problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expert</td>\n<td>All prerequisite skills</td>\n<td>Domain specialization</td>\n<td>Human-level performance on expert tasks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The hierarchical analysis generates <strong>skill gap reports</strong> that identify which foundational capabilities need improvement before attempting more complex evaluations. This is particularly valuable for model training guidance and capability assessment for production deployment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"distributed-evaluation-infrastructure\">Distributed Evaluation Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>As datasets grow to millions of test cases and models become more expensive to query, evaluation needs to scale horizontally across multiple machines and regions. Think of this as transforming evaluation from a single powerful workstation to a distributed computing cluster — like moving from a master craftsman&#39;s workshop to a modern factory with specialized stations and assembly lines.</p>\n<p>The distributed evaluation system introduces a <strong>coordinator-worker architecture</strong> where a central coordinator partitions datasets and distributes work to evaluation workers running on different machines. Workers can be heterogeneous — some optimized for fast exact match computation, others equipped with GPUs for semantic similarity, and specialized workers for expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Scaling Characteristics</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>EvaluationCoordinator</code></td>\n<td>Work distribution, result aggregation</td>\n<td>Single instance with failover</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EvaluationWorker</code></td>\n<td>Metric computation, LLM queries</td>\n<td>Horizontally scalable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ResultAggregator</code></td>\n<td>Statistical analysis, report generation</td>\n<td>CPU-intensive, vertically scalable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CacheCluster</code></td>\n<td>Distributed result caching</td>\n<td>Horizontally scalable with sharding</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The distributed system maintains <strong>evaluation consistency</strong> through deterministic work partitioning and result checksums. If a worker fails, its assigned test cases are redistributed to healthy workers with automatic deduplication to prevent double-evaluation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Work Distribution Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Large evaluations need to distribute work across multiple machines while maintaining result consistency and handling worker failures</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Static work assignment based on test case hash</li>\n<li>Dynamic load balancing with work stealing</li>\n<li>Hierarchical distribution with regional coordinators</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Dynamic load balancing with consistent hashing for cache locality</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Adapts to heterogeneous worker capabilities and provides natural cache affinity while handling failures gracefully</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires sophisticated coordinator logic but provides optimal resource utilization and fault tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"real-time-evaluation-monitoring\">Real-Time Evaluation Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Production LLM applications need continuous evaluation as they serve live traffic, similar to how modern web applications use real-user monitoring (RUM) to track performance. The real-time evaluation system samples live model responses, applies lightweight evaluation metrics, and alerts when quality degrades below acceptable thresholds.</p>\n<p>The monitoring system operates with <strong>configurable sampling rates</strong> to balance evaluation coverage with computational overhead. High-confidence responses get minimal evaluation, while responses showing uncertainty indicators receive more thorough assessment. This creates a continuous feedback loop that can detect model degradation, prompt injection attacks, or training distribution drift.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Monitoring Type</th>\n<th>Sampling Rate</th>\n<th>Latency Tolerance</th>\n<th>Alert Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Quality Drift</td>\n<td>1-5% of traffic</td>\n<td>&lt; 100ms additional latency</td>\n<td>10% degradation over 1 hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety Violations</td>\n<td>100% of flagged responses</td>\n<td>&lt; 50ms additional latency</td>\n<td>Any detected violation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Regression</td>\n<td>0.1% of traffic</td>\n<td>&lt; 1s additional latency</td>\n<td>Statistical significance test</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The real-time system integrates with the existing evaluation infrastructure by treating live traffic as a continuously updating dataset. Evaluation results feed into the same reporting and analysis pipeline, enabling unified views of both batch evaluation and production performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-points\">Integration Points</h3>\n<p>The evaluation framework&#39;s true power emerges when it integrates seamlessly with the broader machine learning infrastructure ecosystem. Think of these integration points as diplomatic relationships between neighboring countries — each system maintains its sovereignty and core competencies while establishing protocols for collaboration, data exchange, and mutual support.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mlops-pipeline-integration\">MLOps Pipeline Integration</h4>\n<p>Modern machine learning development follows DevOps principles with continuous integration, automated testing, and staged deployments. The evaluation framework integrates into this pipeline as a <strong>quality gate</strong> — automated evaluation runs must pass before model deployments can proceed to production. This prevents degraded models from reaching users while maintaining development velocity.</p>\n<p>The MLOps integration operates through standardized interfaces and event-driven communication. When a new model version is committed to the model registry, it triggers an automated evaluation run against the comprehensive test suite. The evaluation results feed into deployment decision logic that can automatically promote models that exceed quality thresholds or flag models requiring human review.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pipeline Stage</th>\n<th>Evaluation Trigger</th>\n<th>Pass Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Development</td>\n<td>Code commit with model changes</td>\n<td>Basic functionality tests pass</td>\n<td>Block merge request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Staging</td>\n<td>Model registry update</td>\n<td>Comprehensive evaluation &gt; baseline</td>\n<td>Hold deployment, notify team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Production</td>\n<td>Scheduled evaluation</td>\n<td>No regression detected</td>\n<td>Automatic rollback to previous version</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Post-deployment</td>\n<td>Live traffic monitoring</td>\n<td>Quality metrics within bounds</td>\n<td>Alert and gradual traffic reduction</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The integration provides <strong>evaluation-aware deployment strategies</strong> that can gradually shift traffic to new model versions while continuously monitoring quality metrics. If evaluation detects degradation, the system can automatically roll back or reduce traffic to the problematic model version.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Deployment Integration Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Model deployments need automated quality gates without blocking development velocity or requiring manual intervention for routine deployments</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Blocking evaluation that prevents deployment until completion</li>\n<li>Asynchronous evaluation with post-deployment rollback</li>\n<li>Staged deployment with continuous evaluation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Staged deployment with continuous evaluation and automatic traffic management</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances safety with velocity by detecting issues in production while limiting impact through controlled traffic exposure</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires sophisticated traffic management and rollback capabilities but provides maximum protection with minimal development friction</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"model-registry-integration\">Model Registry Integration</h4>\n<p>The model registry serves as the central repository for trained models, their metadata, and versioning information. The evaluation framework integrates deeply with the registry to provide <strong>evaluation-aware model management</strong> — every model version includes comprehensive evaluation results, and models can be queried based on performance characteristics rather than just chronological order.</p>\n<p>The integration automatically tags model versions with evaluation metadata including overall scores, per-category breakdowns, and regression analysis results. This enables sophisticated model selection strategies that consider not just overall performance but specific capability requirements for different use cases.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Model Metadata</th>\n<th>Source</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Overall evaluation score</td>\n<td>Comprehensive evaluation run</td>\n<td>Model ranking and selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Per-category performance</td>\n<td>Tag-based evaluation breakdown</td>\n<td>Domain-specific model selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regression analysis</td>\n<td>Comparison with baseline models</td>\n<td>Deployment risk assessment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Evaluation confidence</td>\n<td>Statistical analysis of results</td>\n<td>Decision threshold adjustment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource requirements</td>\n<td>Evaluation runtime profiling</td>\n<td>Cost-aware model selection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registry integration enables <strong>capability-based model queries</strong> where applications can request models meeting specific performance criteria. For example, a customer service application might require models with &gt;0.9 accuracy on &quot;customer_intent_classification&quot; and &gt;0.8 on &quot;response_empathy&quot; metrics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"experimentation-platform-integration\">Experimentation Platform Integration</h4>\n<p>A/B testing platforms manage controlled experiments that compare different model versions or prompt strategies with live user traffic. The evaluation framework integrates with these platforms to provide <strong>offline evaluation correlation</strong> with online performance metrics. This helps validate that offline evaluation accurately predicts real-world performance and identifies when offline metrics become unreliable.</p>\n<p>The integration operates through shared experiment identifiers that link offline evaluation runs with online experiment results. Statistical analysis compares offline evaluation predictions with observed user satisfaction, task completion rates, and business metrics to continuously calibrate evaluation accuracy.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Point</th>\n<th>Data Flow</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Experiment Design</td>\n<td>Evaluation results → Experiment variants</td>\n<td>Use evaluation to pre-filter experimental candidates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Online Monitoring</td>\n<td>Live metrics → Evaluation correlation analysis</td>\n<td>Validate offline evaluation accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Result Analysis</td>\n<td>Combined offline/online results</td>\n<td>Comprehensive performance assessment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Model Selection</td>\n<td>Correlated metrics → Production deployment</td>\n<td>Choose models optimized for real-world performance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The platform provides <strong>evaluation-guided experimentation</strong> that uses offline evaluation results to inform experiment design. Instead of randomly testing model variants, the system can design experiments that focus on cases where offline evaluation showed uncertainty or disagreement between metrics.</p>\n<h4 id=\"data-pipeline-integration\">Data Pipeline Integration</h4>\n<p>Modern ML systems process continuous streams of training data, user interactions, and feedback signals. The evaluation framework integrates with data pipelines to enable <strong>continuous dataset evolution</strong> — new test cases are automatically generated from production data, golden examples are identified from high-confidence interactions, and dataset composition adapts to emerging use patterns.</p>\n<p>The data pipeline integration monitors live system interactions to identify evaluation gaps. When users consistently encounter scenarios not covered in the existing test suite, the system flags these for potential inclusion in future dataset versions. This creates a feedback loop that keeps evaluation datasets current with real-world usage patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Data Source</th>\n<th>Processing</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>User interactions</td>\n<td>Pattern analysis, quality filtering</td>\n<td>Candidate test cases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Human feedback</td>\n<td>Confidence scoring, consensus detection</td>\n<td>Golden examples</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error logs</td>\n<td>Failure pattern analysis</td>\n<td>Stress test scenarios</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance metrics</td>\n<td>Correlation analysis</td>\n<td>Evaluation validation data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The integration provides <strong>automated dataset curation</strong> that reduces the manual effort required to maintain comprehensive evaluation coverage. The system can automatically propose new test cases, identify outdated examples, and suggest dataset rebalancing based on observed performance patterns.</p>\n<h4 id=\"monitoring-and-alerting-integration\">Monitoring and Alerting Integration</h4>\n<p>Production monitoring systems track system health, performance metrics, and business KPIs. The evaluation framework integrates with these systems to provide <strong>quality-aware alerting</strong> that can distinguish between system performance issues and model quality degradation. This prevents false alerts when response times are normal but output quality has declined.</p>\n<p>The monitoring integration establishes evaluation metrics as first-class observability signals alongside traditional infrastructure metrics. Quality degradation alerts include context about which specific capabilities have declined and recommended remediation actions based on historical patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Alert Type</th>\n<th>Trigger Condition</th>\n<th>Context Provided</th>\n<th>Recommended Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Quality Regression</td>\n<td>Statistical significance test failure</td>\n<td>Affected categories, magnitude</td>\n<td>Model rollback or retraining</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety Violation</td>\n<td>Any harmful content detection</td>\n<td>Specific safety category</td>\n<td>Immediate human review</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Drift</td>\n<td>Gradual decline over time window</td>\n<td>Trend analysis, root cause hints</td>\n<td>Dataset refresh or fine-tuning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Evaluation System Health</td>\n<td>Evaluation pipeline failures</td>\n<td>Component status, error patterns</td>\n<td>Infrastructure investigation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The integration enables <strong>proactive quality management</strong> where teams receive early warning of potential issues before they impact user experience significantly. Combined with automated remediation capabilities, this creates a self-healing evaluation and deployment system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>Building these advanced features requires careful architectural planning and incremental development. The key principle is extending the existing system&#39;s interfaces rather than replacing core components, which maintains backward compatibility while adding sophisticated new capabilities.</p>\n<h4

Just as medical professionals need precise definitions for terms like &quot;tachycardia&quot; or &quot;myocardial infarction&quot; to communicate effectively, LLM evaluation practitioners need shared understanding of concepts like &quot;semantic similarity&quot; or &quot;LLM-as-judge.&quot; Without consistent terminology, a team member&#39;s &quot;fuzzy matching&quot; might mean something completely different from another&#39;s, leading to implementation confusion and architectural misalignment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-evaluation-concepts\">Core Evaluation Concepts</h3>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Excellence</strong>: The overarching philosophy of delivering superior evaluation capabilities that provide reliable, actionable insights into LLM performance. This goes beyond simple accuracy measurement to encompass comprehensive understanding of model strengths, weaknesses, and behavioral patterns. Evaluation excellence requires statistical rigor, reproducible methodologies, and clear communication of results to both technical and business stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Case Schema</strong>: The structured format that defines evaluation test cases with comprehensive metadata. Each test case follows a consistent schema that includes the input prompt, expected output, categorization tags, difficulty level, and extensible metadata fields. The schema ensures that evaluation datasets remain interoperable across different evaluation runs and can be processed consistently by all metrics.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>case_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier for the test case within the dataset</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>prompt</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Input text or query that will be sent to the LLM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expected_output</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Reference answer or expected response for comparison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tags</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Categorical labels for grouping and filtering test cases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>difficulty</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Complexity level indicator (easy, medium, hard, expert)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict</code></td>\n<td>Extensible key-value pairs for additional test case information</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Golden Examples</strong>: High-quality reference cases specifically curated for calibrating evaluators, particularly LLM-as-judge systems. Golden examples represent the gold standard for expected model behavior and are typically created through expert review or consensus among multiple human evaluators. These examples serve as anchor points for establishing consistent evaluation criteria and are often used to validate that automated metrics are producing reasonable scores.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Golden examples are like the master craftsman&#39;s reference pieces in a workshop - they define what excellence looks like and help calibrate all other evaluation tools to maintain consistent standards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Results Model</strong>: The comprehensive data structure that captures complete evaluation outcomes, including not just scores but also metadata about the evaluation process itself. This model preserves full traceability from input test case through metric computation to final aggregated results.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>case_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Reference to the original test case identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>model_response</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Actual output generated by the LLM under evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>response_metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict</code></td>\n<td>Information about response generation (tokens, latency, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metric_results</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict</code></td>\n<td>Per-metric scores and detailed evaluation information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>overall_score</code></td>\n<td><code>float</code></td>\n<td>Weighted combination of all applicable metric scores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>evaluation_time</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when evaluation was completed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>error_info</code></td>\n<td><code>Optional[str]</code></td>\n<td>Error details if evaluation failed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"dataset-management-terminology\">Dataset Management Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Dataset Versioning</strong>: A git-like tracking system for changes to evaluation datasets that maintains complete history and enables rollback to previous states. This system tracks not only which test cases were added, removed, or modified, but also preserves the full context of why changes were made through commit messages and change summaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Version Diff</strong>: A detailed comparison showing the specific changes between two dataset versions, including added cases, modified cases, removed cases, and field-level changes within individual test cases. Version diffs enable reviewers to understand the impact of dataset updates and ensure that changes align with evaluation objectives.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>from_version</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Source version identifier in the comparison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>to_version</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Target version identifier in the comparison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>added_cases</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Test case IDs that exist only in the target version</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>modified_cases</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Test case IDs with content changes between versions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>removed_cases</code></td>\n<td><code>List[str]</code></td>\n<td>Test case IDs that exist only in the source version</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>case_changes</code></td>\n<td><code>Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]</code></td>\n<td>Field-level changes for each modified test case</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Content Hash</strong>: A cryptographic hash function output that serves as a unique identifier based on dataset content rather than arbitrary version numbers. Content hashing ensures data integrity by detecting any unauthorized modifications and enables content-addressable storage where identical datasets share the same hash regardless of their creation time or source.</p>\n<p><strong>Merge Conflict</strong>: A situation that occurs when the same test case has been modified differently in parallel branches of dataset development, requiring manual resolution to determine the canonical version. The system detects conflicts by comparing field-level changes and provides tools for reviewers to make informed decisions about conflict resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Stratified Sampling</strong>: A statistical sampling technique that preserves the proportional representation of different subgroups when splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets. For evaluation datasets, stratification typically occurs across difficulty levels, topic categories, or other meaningful dimensions to ensure that each subset remains representative of the overall population.</p>\n<h3 id=\"metrics-and-scoring-terminology\">Metrics and Scoring Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Semantic Similarity</strong>: A measurement technique that compares the meaning similarity between model output and reference text using embedding vectors rather than surface-level text comparison. This approach captures conceptual similarity even when the exact wording differs, making it particularly valuable for evaluating tasks where multiple valid phrasings exist.</p>\n<p><strong>LLM-as-Judge</strong>: An evaluation methodology that uses language models to assess the quality of other language model outputs, typically by providing structured prompts that ask the judge model to score responses according to specific criteria. This approach enables evaluation of complex, subjective qualities that are difficult to capture with traditional metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuzzy Matching</strong>: Approximate string matching that applies various normalization techniques (whitespace removal, case normalization, punctuation handling) before comparison to reduce the impact of trivial formatting differences on evaluation scores. Fuzzy matching bridges the gap between overly strict exact matching and computationally expensive semantic similarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Metric Applicability</strong>: Rules and logic that determine which metrics should be applied to evaluate specific test cases, based on test case metadata, tags, or content characteristics. Not all metrics are meaningful for all types of evaluation tasks, so applicability rules prevent inappropriate metric application and ensure evaluation results remain interpretable.</p>\n<p><strong>Score Normalization</strong>: The process of mapping diverse metric outputs to a standardized 0.0-1.0 range to enable meaningful aggregation and comparison across different metric types. Normalization preserves the relative ranking of results while ensuring that metrics with different natural scales can be combined effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Judge Prompt Template</strong>: A structured format for creating consistent prompts when using LLM-as-judge evaluation, including standardized sections for task description, evaluation criteria, output format specifications, and example demonstrations. Templates ensure that judge evaluations remain consistent across different test cases and evaluation runs.</p>\n<p><strong>Consistency Control</strong>: Mechanisms implemented to improve the reliability and repeatability of LLM-as-judge evaluations, such as temperature control, multiple sampling with majority voting, or chain-of-thought reasoning requirements. These controls help mitigate the inherent variability in language model outputs.</p>\n<p><strong>Calibration</strong>: The process of mapping raw similarity scores or other metric outputs to meaningful evaluation scores that align with human judgment or established quality standards. Calibration involves analyzing the distribution of raw scores against known-good examples and establishing thresholds that correspond to different quality levels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"execution-and-processing-terminology\">Execution and Processing Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Batch Processing</strong>: A processing strategy that groups test cases into batches for parallel execution, optimizing throughput while respecting resource constraints and API rate limits. Batch processing enables efficient utilization of computational resources and helps manage the trade-off between evaluation speed and system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Result Caching</strong>: A storage system that persists LLM responses and computed metric results to avoid redundant computation when the same inputs are evaluated multiple times. Caching is particularly valuable for expensive operations like LLM API calls and embedding computations.</p>\n<p><strong>Content-Addressable Cache</strong>: A caching system where cache keys are derived from the content being cached rather than arbitrary identifiers, ensuring that identical content always maps to the same cache entry regardless of when or how it was generated. This approach maximizes cache hit rates and eliminates duplicate storage.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpointing</strong>: The practice of periodically saving evaluation progress to persistent storage, enabling recovery and resumption after system failures or interruptions. Checkpoints include both the current state of the evaluation and enough metadata to resume processing from the exact point of interruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Write-Ahead Log (WAL)</strong>: A transaction logging mechanism that records intended operations before executing them, providing a reliable foundation for crash recovery. The WAL ensures that no evaluation progress is lost even if the system crashes in the middle of processing a batch of test cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Progress Tracking</strong>: Real-time monitoring and reporting of evaluation completion status, including completed case counts, estimated time remaining, error rates, and performance metrics. Progress tracking provides visibility into long-running evaluations and helps identify performance bottlenecks.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Batch Sizing</strong>: A dynamic optimization technique that adjusts batch sizes based on observed performance characteristics, increasing batch sizes when the system is performing well and reducing them when errors or slowdowns are detected. This approach maximizes throughput while maintaining system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Control mechanisms that regulate the frequency of API requests to prevent overwhelming external services and avoid triggering rate limit responses. Rate limiting includes both simple request counting and more sophisticated algorithms like token bucket or sliding window approaches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"analysis-and-reporting-terminology\">Analysis and Reporting Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Score Aggregation</strong>: The process of computing statistical summaries across evaluation results, including measures of central tendency (mean, median), variability (standard deviation, percentiles), and group-based breakdowns by tags, categories, or other metadata dimensions.</p>\n<p><strong>Statistical Significance</strong>: A statistical concept that quantifies the likelihood that an observed difference between two sets of evaluation results is due to genuine performance differences rather than random variation. Statistical significance testing helps distinguish meaningful changes from noise in evaluation comparisons.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect Size</strong>: A measure of the practical magnitude of performance differences that is independent of sample size, providing insight into whether statistically significant differences are also meaningfully large. Effect size helps prioritize which performance changes deserve attention and resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Regression Detection</strong>: Automated identification of performance degradation compared to established baseline measurements, using statistical techniques to distinguish genuine regressions from normal variation. Regression detection enables proactive identification of quality issues before they impact production systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Changepoint Detection</strong>: Statistical analysis that identifies moments in time when the fundamental performance characteristics of a model shift, indicating potential changes in model behavior, data distribution, or evaluation methodology. Changepoint detection helps understand the timeline of model performance evolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure Analysis</strong>: Systematic examination of evaluation failures to identify common patterns, root causes, and remediation opportunities. Failure analysis involves clustering similar failures, analyzing error patterns, and generating actionable recommendations for model improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Semantic Clustering</strong>: The process of grouping evaluation failures or results based on meaning similarity using embedding-based approaches, enabling identification of thematic patterns that might not be apparent through simple keyword-based analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>: A systematic process for tracing failure patterns back to their underlying model limitations, training data issues, or architectural problems, providing actionable insights for model improvement rather than just symptom identification.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseline Management</strong>: The practice of maintaining reference performance levels for comparison purposes, including policies for when baselines should be updated and how to handle the evolution of evaluation standards over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Comparison Correction</strong>: Statistical adjustments applied when testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously to control the overall probability of false discoveries. This is particularly important when comparing performance across many different categories or metrics within a single evaluation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-architecture-and-infrastructure\">System Architecture and Infrastructure</h3>\n<p><strong>Plugin System</strong>: An extensible architecture that allows users to register custom metrics, processors, or analysis functions while maintaining system stability and security through well-defined interfaces and resource limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>Metric Registry</strong>: A centralized system for metric discovery, registration, and management that provides a unified interface for accessing both built-in and custom metrics while handling version compatibility and dependency management.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker</strong>: A failure isolation pattern that monitors the health of external dependencies (like LLM APIs) and automatically stops sending requests when failure rates exceed acceptable thresholds, preventing cascade failures and resource exhaustion.</p>\n<p><strong>Backpressure Handling</strong>: Mechanisms for preventing fast-producing components from overwhelming slower consumers by implementing flow control, buffering strategies, and graceful degradation when system capacity is exceeded.</p>\n<p><strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>: A system design approach where components communicate through asynchronous event notifications rather than direct method calls, enabling loose coupling, better scalability, and more resilient failure handling.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed Tracing</strong>: The practice of tracking requests and operations across component boundaries using correlation IDs and structured logging, enabling diagnosis of complex issues that span multiple system components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"error-handling-and-recovery\">Error Handling and Recovery</h3>\n<p><strong>Error Boundaries</strong>: Isolation mechanisms that contain failures within specific components or operations, preventing errors from cascading through the entire system and enabling partial functionality during degraded conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Graceful Degradation</strong>: System behavior that maintains partial functionality when some components or capabilities are unavailable, such as falling back to simpler metrics when advanced evaluators fail or using cached results when APIs are unreachable.</p>\n<p><strong>Exponential Backoff</strong>: A retry strategy where the delay between retry attempts increases exponentially with each failure, helping to avoid overwhelming already-stressed systems while still providing reasonable recovery times.</p>\n<p><strong>Recovery Strategies</strong>: Systematic approaches for handling different categories of failures, including automatic retry with backoff, failover to alternative providers, degraded mode operation, and manual intervention escalation paths.</p>\n<p><strong>State Reconstruction</strong>: The process of rebuilding consistent system state after data corruption or partial failures, using techniques like write-ahead logs, checksums, and redundant storage to ensure data integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Thundering Herd</strong>: A failure pattern where multiple processes simultaneously attempt to access a recovered service, potentially overwhelming it again.

Document","markdown":"# LLM Evaluation Framework: Design Document\n\n\n## Overview\n\nA comprehensive system for evaluating Large Language Model applications through automated test case management, multi-metric scoring, and statistical analysis. The key architectural challenge is building a scalable, extensible evaluation pipeline that handles diverse metrics while maintaining result reproducibility and providing actionable insights for model performance optimization.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - Understanding the evaluation challenge is foundational to all components\n\n### The LLM Evaluation Challenge\n\nThink of evaluating a large language model like trying to grade a creative writing exam where the test questions are open-ended essays, there are multiple valid answers to each question, and the grading criteria themselves are subjective and context-dependent. Unlike traditional software testing where you can assert that `add(2, 3) == 5`, evaluating language models requires measuring qualities like coherence, factual accuracy, helpfulness, and style—none of which have simple binary answers.\n\nThe fundamental challenge stems from the **generative and probabilistic nature** of language models. Traditional software systems are deterministic: given the same input, they produce the same output every time. This makes testing straightforward—you define expected outputs and compare actual results. Language models, however, are designed to be creative and varied in their responses. The same prompt can yield dozens of different but equally valid answers, each with subtle differences in tone, structure, and approach.\n\n**Statistical evaluation** becomes necessary because individual test cases don't provide reliable signals about model quality. A model might fail spectacularly on one carefully crafted prompt while excelling on a hundred similar ones. The evaluation system must aggregate results across large datasets to identify genuine patterns versus random variation. This requires sophisticated statistical analysis, confidence intervals, and significance testing—concepts foreign to traditional software QA processes.\n\nThe **multi-dimensional nature of language quality** adds another layer of complexity. A single response might be factually accurate but poorly written, or beautifully crafted but misleading. Traditional metrics like exact string matching are inadequate. Evaluation frameworks must simultaneously measure multiple aspects: factual correctness, grammatical quality, coherence, relevance, helpfulness, safety, and alignment with instructions. Each dimension may require different measurement approaches and may conflict with others.\n\n**Context dependency** makes evaluation even more challenging. The quality of a language model response depends heavily on the specific use case, domain, and user expectations. A response that's excellent for a creative writing assistant might be terrible for a medical information system. The evaluation framework must support domain-specific metrics, configurable quality criteria, and the ability to slice results by different contexts and use cases.\n\n**Scale and efficiency** concerns emerge quickly in production environments. Comprehensive evaluation might involve thousands of test cases across dozens of metrics, each requiring expensive API calls to language models. The evaluation process itself often uses LLMs as judges, multiplying the computational cost. The framework must handle batch processing, parallel execution, caching, and graceful degradation when API limits are reached.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Unlike traditional software where bugs are binary (the code works or it doesn't), language model evaluation deals with degrees of quality across multiple subjective dimensions. This requires statistical thinking, not deterministic assertions.\n\nThe **reproducibility challenge** is particularly acute for LLM evaluation. Language models are often non-deterministic by design, using temperature settings and sampling to introduce controlled randomness. External API-based models may change their behavior over time as providers update their systems. Evaluation results must be reproducible despite these sources of variation, requiring careful control of randomness, model versioning, and baseline management.\n\n**Human alignment** presents the ultimate evaluation challenge. The goal isn't just technical correctness but alignment with human judgment and preferences. This requires expensive human annotation to establish ground truth, sophisticated techniques like LLM-as-judge evaluation where models evaluate other models, and continuous calibration against human preferences. The framework must support both automated metrics and human-in-the-loop evaluation workflows.\n\n### Current Evaluation Landscape\n\nThe current landscape of LLM evaluation tools reveals a fragmented ecosystem with significant gaps that prevent comprehensive, production-ready evaluation at scale. Understanding these limitations is crucial for designing an evaluation framework that addresses real-world needs rather than repeating existing mistakes.\n\n**Academic benchmarks and leaderboards** dominate the current evaluation landscape, but they suffer from fundamental limitations when applied to production systems. Benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and BIG-bench focus on narrow task-specific performance metrics that don't translate well to real-world applications. These benchmarks typically measure performance on standardized datasets with pre-defined metrics, but production LLM applications often require custom evaluation criteria that reflect specific business requirements and user needs.\n\nThe **static nature** of academic benchmarks creates additional problems. Models can be specifically optimized for benchmark performance without improving general capability, leading to Goodhart's law effects where \"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\" Furthermore, benchmark datasets become contaminated over time as they're included in model training data, making historical comparisons unreliable. Production evaluation requires dynamic test suites that can evolve with the application and resist gaming.\n\n**Existing evaluation platforms** like LangSmith, Weights & Biases, and various open-source tools provide pieces of the evaluation puzzle but lack comprehensive solutions. These tools typically excel in specific areas while leaving significant gaps in others.\n\n| Platform Category | Strengths | Limitations | Production Readiness |\n|-------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Academic Benchmarks | Standardized, reproducible, broad research adoption | Static datasets, narrow metrics, gaming susceptibility | Low - research focus |\n| LangSmith/LangChain | Good dataset management, LLM integration, versioning | Limited metric types, vendor lock-in, scaling issues | Medium - emerging platform |\n| W&B/MLOps Platforms | Excellent experiment tracking, visualization, collaboration | Generic ML focus, limited LLM-specific features | Medium - requires customization |\n| Open Source Tools | Customizable, transparent, community-driven | Fragmented, maintenance burden, limited support | Low - requires significant investment |\n| Custom Solutions | Perfect fit for specific needs, full control | High development cost, maintenance burden, expertise required | High - but expensive |\n\n**Metric limitations** represent another critical gap in the current landscape. Most existing tools rely heavily on traditional NLP metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which measure surface-level text similarity but poorly capture semantic meaning, factual accuracy, or task-specific quality. While newer approaches like BERTScore and semantic similarity using embeddings show promise, they lack calibration and interpretability. Practitioners struggle to understand what constitutes a \"good\" semantic similarity score for their specific use case.\n\nThe **LLM-as-judge** approach has emerged as a popular solution for more nuanced evaluation, where language models evaluate the outputs of other language models. However, current implementations suffer from inconsistency, bias, and lack of proper calibration. Different judge models can produce dramatically different scores for the same content, and there's insufficient tooling for ensuring judge reliability, detecting judge bias, or calibrating judge scores against human preferences.\n\n**Scalability and cost management** represent practical barriers that existing tools inadequately address. Comprehensive evaluation can require thousands of API calls, quickly becoming expensive and slow. Most tools lack sophisticated caching, batching, and rate limiting capabilities. They also struggle with the checkpoint and resume functionality necessary for large-scale evaluations that may be interrupted by API failures or resource constraints.\n\n**Integration and workflow challenges** prevent many organizations from adopting systematic evaluation practices. Existing tools often require significant integration work to fit into production workflows. They lack the CI/CD integration, automated regression detection, and reporting capabilities necessary for embedding evaluation into software development processes. Many tools assume data scientists will manually run evaluations rather than supporting automated, continuous evaluation pipelines.\n\n> **Decision: Build Comprehensive Framework Rather Than Extend Existing Tools**\n> - **Context**: Organizations need production-ready evaluation capabilities that current tools don't provide comprehensively\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Extend existing open-source tools with missing capabilities\n>   2. Integrate multiple existing tools into a unified workflow\n>   3. Build new comprehensive framework from scratch\n> - **Decision**: Build new framework with clean architecture and comprehensive feature set\n> - **Rationale**: Existing tools have fundamental architectural limitations that prevent adding missing capabilities without major rewrites. Integration approaches create maintenance nightmares and still leave capability gaps. A purpose-built framework can address all requirements with consistent architecture.\n> - **Consequences**: Higher initial development cost but better long-term maintainability, feature completeness, and user experience. Avoids vendor lock-in and technical debt from working around existing tool limitations.\n\n**Data management and versioning** capabilities in existing tools are often inadequate for production needs. While tools like LangSmith provide basic dataset versioning, they lack the sophisticated diff, merge, and rollback capabilities necessary for managing evolving test suites in collaborative environments. They also struggle with large datasets, lacking efficient storage, querying, and sampling capabilities.\n\n**Statistical rigor** is notably absent from most existing evaluation tools. They provide basic aggregation (mean, median) but lack the statistical testing, confidence intervals, and significance analysis necessary for making reliable comparisons between models or detecting genuine performance regressions versus random variation. This limitation prevents organizations from making data-driven decisions about model deployments and improvements.\n\nThe **reporting and analysis** capabilities of current tools focus primarily on displaying individual scores rather than providing actionable insights. They lack sophisticated failure analysis, error clustering, and root cause analysis capabilities. Reports are often generic rather than tailored to specific stakeholders' needs (engineers vs. product managers vs. executives).\n\n**Customization and extensibility** represent final major limitations. While most tools claim to support custom metrics, the reality is often clunky plugin systems, limited documentation, and poor integration with the broader evaluation workflow. Organizations end up building significant custom tooling anyway, defeating the purpose of using existing platforms.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Evaluation Tool Selection Based on Demos Rather Than Production Needs**\nMany organizations select evaluation tools based on impressive demos or marketing materials without thoroughly evaluating production requirements. They discover limitations only after significant integration work, leading to tool abandonment or expensive workarounds. Always evaluate tools against comprehensive production checklists including scale, customization, integration, and statistical capabilities.\n\nThe market clearly needs a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines the dataset management capabilities of platforms like LangSmith, the statistical rigor of academic research tools, the scalability requirements of production systems, and the customization capabilities that organizations require for their specific use cases. This framework must be architecturally designed from the ground up to handle the unique challenges of LLM evaluation rather than adapting tools designed for traditional machine learning workflows.\n\nThe **emergence of foundation model evaluation** as a distinct discipline requires specialized tooling that understands the unique characteristics of language models: their probabilistic outputs, multi-dimensional quality criteria, context dependency, and the need for both automated and human evaluation. Current tools approach LLM evaluation as an extension of traditional ML evaluation, missing opportunities for LLM-specific optimizations and capabilities.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe complexity of LLM evaluation requires careful technology selection and implementation planning. This guidance provides concrete recommendations for building a production-ready evaluation framework that addresses the challenges identified above.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n**Python Development Environment:**\n- Use `python -m venv venv` to create isolated environment for dependencies\n- Install development dependencies: `pip install pytest pytest-asyncio black isort mypy`\n- Use `black` for code formatting: `black --line-length 88 src/`\n- Use `mypy` for type checking: `mypy src/ --strict`\n- Use `pytest-asyncio` for testing async functions: `@pytest.mark.asyncio`\n\n**Async/Await Patterns:**\n- Always use `async def` for functions that make API calls or I/O operations\n- Use `asyncio.gather()` for running multiple coroutines concurrently\n- Use `asyncio.Semaphore(n)` to limit concurrent operations to `n`\n- Use `aiohttp.ClientSession()` for HTTP requests instead of `requests`\n- Handle `asyncio.TimeoutError` and `aiohttp.ClientError` exceptions\n\n**Error Handling Best Practices:**\n- Create custom exception hierarchy in `src/llm_eval/core/exceptions.py`\n- Use specific exception types: `DatasetValidationError`, `MetricComputationError`, etc.\n- Always include original error in exception chains: `raise NewError() from original_error`\n- Log errors with structured data: `logger.error(\"Metric failed\", extra={\"test_case_id\": case_id, \"metric\": metric_name})`\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\n- Use `functools.lru_cache()` for expensive pure functions\n- Use `asyncio.create_task()` to start background tasks early\n- Batch API requests when possible rather than making individual calls\n- Use generators for large datasets: `yield` instead of building large lists\n- Profile with `cProfile` and `py-spy` to identify bottlenecks\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoints:**\n\n**After Understanding Context (Current Milestone):**\n- **Verification Command**: Review existing evaluation tools in your domain\n- **Expected Understanding**: Clear grasp of why LLM evaluation differs from traditional testing\n- **Manual Check**: Can you explain to a colleague why BLEU score isn't sufficient for chatbot evaluation?\n- **Red Flags**: If you think evaluation is \"just comparing strings,\" revisit the statistical evaluation concepts\n\n**Before Starting Implementation:**\n- **Setup Verification**: `python -c \"import asyncio, aiohttp, pandas, numpy; print('Dependencies OK')\"`\n- **Architecture Check**: Draw the four-layer architecture from memory (Dataset → Metrics → Runner → Reports)\n- **Concept Check**: Can you list 5 different types of evaluation metrics and when to use each?\n\nThe foundation established in this context section is crucial for making informed decisions throughout the implementation. The challenges identified here will resurface in every component design, and the landscape analysis informs the architectural choices made in subsequent sections.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - Goal definition drives design decisions across dataset management, metrics, evaluation execution, and reporting\n\n### Primary Goals\n\nThink of this evaluation framework as a **comprehensive testing laboratory** for language models. Just as a medical laboratory provides standardized tests with reliable results that doctors can trust for diagnosis, our framework must provide standardized evaluation protocols that AI engineers can trust for model assessment. The laboratory analogy extends further: we need proper sample handling (dataset management), various diagnostic tests (metrics), efficient processing (parallel evaluation), and clear reports that enable actionable decisions.\n\nThe framework's **primary responsibility** is to transform the chaotic, ad-hoc process of LLM evaluation into a systematic, reproducible, and scalable workflow. Currently, most teams evaluate their language models through manual spot-checking or simple accuracy calculations on small samples. This approach fails catastrophically as applications grow in complexity and scale. Our framework bridges this gap by providing enterprise-grade evaluation infrastructure that maintains scientific rigor while remaining accessible to practitioners.\n\n#### Core Evaluation Capabilities\n\nThe framework must deliver **comprehensive evaluation coverage** across the full spectrum of language model applications. This means supporting both objective metrics like exact string matching and subjective metrics that require semantic understanding. The system treats evaluation as a multi-dimensional problem where different aspects of model performance require different measurement approaches.\n\n**Objective measurement capabilities** form the foundation of the evaluation system. The framework implements exact match scoring with configurable normalization options, allowing teams to specify whether whitespace, capitalization, or punctuation differences should be considered errors. Fuzzy matching extends this capability by using edit distance algorithms to measure how close model outputs are to expected results, with configurable similarity thresholds.\n\n**Semantic evaluation capabilities** address the fundamental challenge that language allows multiple correct expressions of the same meaning. The framework implements semantic similarity scoring using embedding models to compare the meaning of model outputs against reference answers. This approach captures cases where the model produces a correct answer using different words or phrasing than the expected output.\n\n**Statistical evaluation robustness** ensures that evaluation results are scientifically sound and actionable. The framework computes confidence intervals for all metrics, performs significance testing when comparing model versions, and adjusts for multiple comparisons to prevent false discoveries. This statistical rigor transforms evaluation from guesswork into evidence-based decision making.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The key architectural decision here is treating metrics as first-class plugins rather than hardcoded functions. This enables teams to implement domain-specific evaluation criteria while leveraging the framework's infrastructure for execution, caching, and reporting.\n\n| Evaluation Capability | Implementation Approach | Supported Use Cases | Quality Assurance |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Exact Match | Character-by-character comparison with normalization options | Structured output validation, code generation, factual QA | Configurable whitespace/case handling |\n| Fuzzy Match | Edit distance with configurable similarity thresholds | Natural language answers with minor variations | Threshold calibration against human judgment |\n| Semantic Similarity | Embedding cosine similarity with multiple embedding models | Open-ended responses, paraphrasing tasks | Cross-validation against human evaluators |\n| LLM-as-Judge | Structured prompting of judge models with consistency controls | Complex reasoning, creativity, subjective quality | Multi-judge consensus and calibration |\n| Custom Metrics | Plugin architecture with standardized interfaces | Domain-specific evaluation criteria | Validation against ground truth samples |\n\n#### Dataset Management and Versioning\n\n**Dataset management** operates like a version control system specifically designed for evaluation data. Think of it as \"Git for test cases\" where every change to the evaluation dataset is tracked, reversible, and auditable. This versioning capability is crucial because evaluation datasets evolve continuously as teams discover edge cases, add new test scenarios, or refine expected outputs based on model behavior.\n\nThe framework implements **immutable dataset versioning** where each version represents a complete snapshot of the evaluation data at a specific point in time. This approach prevents the common problem of evaluation drift, where gradual changes to test cases make it impossible to compare model performance across time periods. Teams can confidently compare a model's performance today against its performance six months ago using the exact same evaluation criteria.\n\n**Dataset splitting capabilities** ensure proper train/test separation with stratified sampling across important dimensions like difficulty level, topic category, or input length. The framework prevents data leakage by maintaining strict boundaries between training and evaluation data, with cryptographic hashing to detect any overlap between splits.\n\n| Dataset Management Feature | Technical Implementation | Prevents Common Problem | Audit Capability |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Version Control | Content-addressable storage with merkle trees | Evaluation drift over time | Full change history with diffs |\n| Dataset Splitting | Stratified sampling with configurable ratios | Biased evaluation samples | Reproducible splits with fixed seeds |\n| Schema Validation | JSON Schema with custom validators | Malformed test cases | Validation error reports |\n| Import/Export | Multi-format support with automatic mapping | Data format lock-in | Provenance tracking |\n| Golden Examples | Quality-weighted sampling for calibration | Inconsistent evaluation standards | Human annotation tracking |\n\n#### Scalable Execution Infrastructure\n\nThe evaluation runner operates as a **distributed task execution engine** optimized for language model API calls. Think of it as a specialized job scheduler that understands the unique characteristics of LLM evaluation: high latency, rate limits, variable response times, and expensive API calls that should never be repeated unnecessarily.\n\n**Parallel execution capabilities** maximize throughput while respecting API rate limits through intelligent backoff strategies and request queuing. The framework automatically distributes evaluation work across available resources, scaling from single-machine development environments to distributed cloud deployments.\n\n**Caching and checkpointing** transform evaluation from a fragile, all-or-nothing process into a robust, resumable workflow. The framework caches all model responses using content-based hashing, ensuring that re-running evaluations with identical inputs skips expensive API calls. Checkpoint files enable recovery from failures without losing progress, critical for large-scale evaluations that may take hours or days to complete.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The caching strategy uses content-addressable storage where the cache key combines the model configuration, prompt, and generation parameters. This approach automatically invalidates cached results when any evaluation parameter changes while maximizing cache hits for identical requests.\n\n#### Comprehensive Reporting and Analysis\n\nThe reporting system transforms raw evaluation scores into **actionable insights** that guide model improvement decisions. Rather than simply presenting aggregate scores, the framework performs statistical analysis to identify performance patterns, flag significant changes, and highlight areas needing attention.\n\n**Regression detection** automatically compares current evaluation results against historical baselines, flagging metrics that have degraded beyond statistical significance thresholds. This capability enables continuous integration workflows where model changes that significantly harm performance trigger alerts or block deployments.\n\n**Failure analysis** clusters common error patterns and identifies the test cases where models struggle most. This analysis helps teams understand whether model failures are concentrated in specific domains, input types, or difficulty levels, enabling targeted improvement efforts.\n\n> **Decision: Comprehensive Goal Scope**\n> - **Context**: LLM evaluation spans many different use cases, from simple classification to complex reasoning tasks, each requiring different measurement approaches\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Focus on a narrow set of metrics for simplicity\n>   2. Build a comprehensive framework supporting diverse evaluation needs\n>   3. Create a minimal core with extensive plugin architecture\n> - **Decision**: Comprehensive framework with plugin architecture for extensibility\n> - **Rationale**: Production AI systems require diverse evaluation approaches, and teams need a single platform that grows with their sophistication rather than multiple specialized tools\n> - **Consequences**: Higher initial complexity but significantly better long-term adoption and utility across different use cases\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nSetting clear boundaries prevents **scope creep** that could compromise the framework's core mission. Think of these non-goals as **architectural guardrails** that maintain focus on evaluation excellence rather than expanding into adjacent but distinct problem domains.\n\n#### Model Training and Fine-Tuning\n\nThe framework explicitly **does not implement model training capabilities**. While evaluation results inform training decisions, the framework treats model training as a separate concern handled by specialized ML training platforms. This separation maintains clean architectural boundaries and prevents the framework from becoming an unwieldy all-in-one ML platform.\n\n**Training data preparation** falls outside the framework's scope, even though evaluation datasets might inform training data selection. Teams use external tools for data cleaning, augmentation, and training set preparation, then import the results into the evaluation framework for assessment.\n\n**Hyperparameter optimization** represents another boundary. While evaluation results guide hyperparameter selection, the framework does not implement automated hyperparameter search algorithms. Teams integrate the framework with external optimization tools when needed.\n\n> **Design Insight**: This boundary prevents the common antipattern of evaluation frameworks becoming bloated ML platforms that do many things poorly instead of doing evaluation exceptionally well.\n\n#### Real-Time Model Serving\n\nThe framework **does not provide model serving infrastructure** for production deployments. Evaluation runs in batch mode against pre-trained models accessed through APIs or local inference, but the framework does not implement real-time serving, load balancing, or production monitoring capabilities.\n\n**Production monitoring** represents a related but separate concern. While the framework can evaluate production model outputs in batch mode, it does not provide real-time monitoring, alerting, or performance dashboards for live systems.\n\n#### Data Collection and Annotation\n\nThe framework **assumes evaluation datasets already exist** and focuses on their efficient utilization rather than their creation. While the framework supports importing datasets from various formats, it does not provide data collection tools, annotation interfaces, or crowd-sourcing capabilities.\n\n**Human evaluation interfaces** fall outside the scope, even though human judgment often provides ground truth for evaluation metrics. Teams use external annotation tools and import the results into the framework for systematic evaluation.\n\n#### Model Development and Architecture\n\nThe framework maintains **complete agnosticism** about model architectures, training methodologies, and deployment strategies. It evaluates models purely through their inputs and outputs, treating them as black boxes regardless of their internal implementation.\n\n**Model optimization recommendations** exceed the framework's scope. While evaluation results highlight performance weaknesses, the framework does not suggest specific model architecture changes, training strategies, or optimization techniques.\n\n| Non-Goal Category | Specific Exclusions | Rationale | Integration Approach |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| Model Training | Training loops, optimization algorithms, gradient computation | Specialized ML training platforms handle this better | Import trained models for evaluation |\n| Real-Time Serving | API endpoints, load balancing, latency optimization | Production serving has different requirements | Evaluate served models through their APIs |\n| Data Collection | Web scraping, annotation tools, crowd-sourcing platforms | Data collection needs domain-specific tools | Import collected datasets for evaluation |\n| Model Architecture | Architecture design, layer optimization, compression | Model development is a separate discipline | Evaluate models regardless of architecture |\n| Production Monitoring | Real-time dashboards, alerting, log analysis | Monitoring systems have different performance requirements | Run evaluations on production data batches |\n\n#### Advanced ML Research Capabilities\n\nThe framework **does not implement cutting-edge research techniques** that are still experimental or require specialized expertise. This includes advanced uncertainty quantification, causal inference methods, or novel evaluation paradigms that lack established best practices.\n\n**Research experiment management** falls outside the scope. While the framework supports systematic evaluation, it does not provide experiment tracking, research collaboration tools, or academic publication workflows beyond basic report generation.\n\n#### Enterprise Authentication and Authorization\n\nThe framework implements **basic security practices** but does not provide enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, or compliance features. Teams deploying in enterprise environments integrate the framework with their existing security infrastructure rather than expecting comprehensive access control within the evaluation system.\n\n**Compliance reporting** for regulations like GDPR or industry standards exceeds the framework's scope. While the framework maintains audit trails of evaluation activities, it does not generate compliance reports or implement data governance workflows.\n\n> **Decision: Focused Scope Boundaries**\n> - **Context**: LLM evaluation intersects with many adjacent domains like model training, production serving, and enterprise security\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Build a comprehensive ML platform including all adjacent capabilities\n>   2. Focus exclusively on core evaluation with minimal integration points\n>   3. Provide excellent evaluation with clean integration interfaces to external systems\n> - **Decision**: Focused evaluation excellence with clean integration interfaces\n> - **Rationale**: Specialized tools excel in their domains, and users benefit more from best-in-class evaluation that integrates well than from mediocre all-in-one solutions\n> - **Consequences**: Requires integration work for complete workflows but delivers superior evaluation capabilities and maintains long-term architectural flexibility\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Scope Creep During Implementation**\nTeams frequently expand the framework's scope during development, adding training capabilities, real-time serving, or comprehensive ML platform features. This dilutes focus and compromises the core evaluation mission. The solution is maintaining strict architectural reviews that reject features outside the defined scope, regardless of how useful they might seem.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Under-Scoped Metric Support**\nConversely, teams sometimes define goals too narrowly, supporting only exact match or simple accuracy metrics. This forces users to implement complex evaluation logic outside the framework, defeating its purpose. The solution is comprehensive metric support within the evaluation domain while maintaining clear boundaries around non-evaluation concerns.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Integration Planning**\nFocusing exclusively on core evaluation without considering integration needs creates isolated tools that don't fit real workflows. The solution is designing clean integration interfaces for external systems while avoiding direct implementation of those systems' capabilities.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Goal Tracking | Markdown documentation with manual updates | Structured goal definitions in YAML with automated validation |\n| Scope Validation | Code review checklists | Automated architectural decision record (ADR) generation |\n| Boundary Enforcement | Manual design reviews | Automated dependency analysis to detect scope violations |\n| Integration Planning | Documentation of external system interfaces | API specification generation with contract testing |\n\n#### Goal Definition Structure\n\nThe framework implements goal tracking through structured configuration files that make scope boundaries explicit and enforceable:\n\n```python\n# evaluation_framework/core/goals.py\n\"\"\"\nGoal definition and scope validation for the LLM evaluation framework.\nProvides structured goal tracking and automated scope boundary enforcement.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Set, Optional\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass GoalCategory(Enum):\n    \"\"\"Categories of framework capabilities.\"\"\"\n    DATASET_MANAGEMENT = \"dataset_management\"\n    METRICS_ENGINE = \"metrics_engine\" \n    EVALUATION_EXECUTION = \"evaluation_execution\"\n    REPORTING_ANALYSIS = \"reporting_analysis\"\n\nclass ScopeViolationType(Enum):\n    \"\"\"Types of scope boundary violations.\"\"\"\n    MODEL_TRAINING = \"model_training\"\n    REAL_TIME_SERVING = \"real_time_serving\"\n    DATA_COLLECTION = \"data_collection\"\n    ENTERPRISE_AUTH = \"enterprise_auth\"\n    \n@dataclass\nclass PrimaryGoal:\n    \"\"\"Definition of a primary framework goal.\"\"\"\n    category: GoalCategory\n    description: str\n    acceptance_criteria: List[str]\n    success_metrics: Dict[str, str]\n    implementation_milestones: List[str]\n    \n    def validate_scope(self) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Validate that goal stays within framework scope boundaries.\"\"\"\n        #

Stakeholder review: Validate that primary goals cover all critical evaluation use cases for your organization\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - The high-level architecture establishes the foundation for dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting (Milestone 4)\n\n![System Architecture Overview](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\n### System Components\n\nThink of the LLM evaluation framework as a **scientific laboratory** designed for language model experimentation. Just as a laboratory has specialized equipment for different phases of research—sample preparation, measurement instruments, experimental procedures, and results analysis—our evaluation framework has four specialized layers that work together to transform raw test cases into actionable insights about model performance.\n\nThe architecture follows a **layered pipeline design** where each layer has a distinct responsibility and communicates through well-defined interfaces. This separation allows each layer to evolve independently while maintaining system integrity. Data flows unidirectionally from dataset management through metrics computation and evaluation execution to final reporting, with cross-cutting concerns like caching and error handling managed at the appropriate abstraction level.\n\n#### Dataset Management Layer\n\nThe **Dataset Management Layer** serves as the foundation of our evaluation laboratory, functioning like a sophisticated specimen repository. This layer handles the entire lifecycle of evaluation data, from initial ingestion through versioning and organization. Think of it as a combination of a scientific sample library and a version control system—it maintains the integrity and traceability of your evaluation datasets while providing efficient access patterns for downstream components.\n\nThe dataset management layer consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive data governance:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Key Interfaces | Storage Backend |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| `DatasetLoader` | Import and validate test cases from external formats | `load_from_csv()`, `load_from_json()`, `validate_schema()` | File system, object storage |\n| `TestCaseRegistry` | Manage individual test cases with metadata | `add_test_case()`, `get_by_tags()`, `update_metadata()` | Structured database |\n| `VersionManager` | Track dataset changes with git-like semantics | `create_version()`, `diff_versions()`, `rollback_to()` | Version graph database |\n| `DatasetSplitter` | Create train/test/validation partitions | `train_test_split()`, `stratified_split()`, `cross_validation_split()` | Computed dynamically |\n| `GoldenExampleManager` | Curate high-quality reference cases | `mark_as_golden()`, `get_golden_set()`, `validate_quality()` | Specialized metadata store |\n\n> **Decision: Layered Dataset Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Test cases need multiple access patterns—by tags, by difficulty, by version, and by quality level—while maintaining data consistency and enabling efficient queries\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Single flat file storage with in-memory indexing\n>   2. Relational database with normalized schema\n>   3. Layered architecture with specialized components\n> - **Decision**: Implemented layered architecture with component specialization\n> - **Rationale**: Each access pattern has different performance characteristics and consistency requirements. Golden examples need high-quality curation, while bulk loading needs throughput optimization. Version management requires graph-like operations that don't map well to tabular schemas.\n> - **Consequences**: Higher initial complexity but better separation of concerns, independent component optimization, and easier testing of individual subsystems\n\nThe `Dataset` data structure serves as the primary data container for this layer:\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Validation Rules |\n|-------|------|-------------|------------------|\n| `name` | `str` | Human-readable dataset identifier | Must be unique, alphanumeric with underscores |\n| `test_cases` | `List[TestCase]` | Collection of individual evaluation cases | Must contain at least one test case |\n| `version` | `str` | Version identifier following semantic versioning | Format: major.minor.patch (e.g., \"1.2.3\") |\n| `description` | `str` | Human-readable description of dataset purpose | Required for documentation and discovery |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp of dataset creation | Auto-generated, immutable |\n| `parent_version` | `Optional[str]` | Version this dataset was derived from | Null for initial version, enables version graph |\n| `split_config` | `Dict[str, float]` | Train/test/validation split ratios | Must sum to 1.0, all values positive |\n| `golden_ratio` | `float` | Percentage of cases marked as golden examples | Between 0.1 and 0.3 (10-30% recommended) |\n\n#### Metrics Engine Layer\n\nThe **Metrics Engine Layer** functions as the measurement instrumentation of our evaluation laboratory. Just as scientists use different instruments to measure different properties of their specimens—microscopes for structure, spectrometers for composition, scales for mass—our metrics engine provides different evaluation instruments for different aspects of language model performance.\n\nThis layer implements a **plugin architecture** that allows metrics to be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The core insight is that different evaluation scenarios require fundamentally different measurement approaches, yet all metrics must integrate seamlessly into the evaluation pipeline and produce comparable results.\n\nThe metrics engine revolves around the `BaseMetric` abstract interface, which standardizes how all metrics integrate with the evaluation system:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description | Implementation Requirements |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| `compute()` | `model_output: str`, `expected_output: str`, `test_case: TestCase` | `MetricResult` | Calculate score for single test case | Must handle edge cases (empty strings, None values) |\n| `is_applicable()` | `test_case: TestCase` | `bool` | Check if metric applies to test case | Use test case tags and metadata for filtering |\n| `get_name()` | None | `str` | Return metric identifier | Must be unique across all registered metrics |\n| `get_description()` | None | `str` | Return human-readable description | Used for documentation and report generation |\n| `validate_config()` | `config: Dict[str, Any]` | `List[str]` | Validate metric-specific configuration | Return list of validation errors, empty if valid |\n\nThe `MetricResult` structure provides a standardized container for metric outputs:\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Validation Rules |\n|-------|------|-------------|------------------|\n| `score` | `float` | Numerical score between 0.0 and 1.0 | Enforced range, NaN values rejected |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Metric-specific additional information | JSON-serializable values only |\n| `explanation` | `Optional[str]` | Human-readable scoring rationale | Especially important for LLM-as-judge metrics |\n| `confidence` | `Optional[float]` | Metric's confidence in the score | Between 0.0 and 1.0, None if not applicable |\n| `computation_time` | `float` | Milliseconds required to compute score | Used for performance monitoring and optimization |\n\n> **Decision: Plugin Architecture for Metrics**\n> - **Context**: Different evaluation scenarios require different metrics (exact match for factual questions, semantic similarity for creative tasks, LLM-as-judge for nuanced evaluation), and users need to add custom metrics without modifying core code\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Hardcoded metrics with conditional logic\n>   2. Strategy pattern with factory registration\n>   3. Plugin system with dynamic loading\n> - **Decision**: Implemented plugin system with registry-based discovery\n> - **Rationale**: Plugin architecture provides maximum flexibility for custom metrics while maintaining type safety through the abstract base class. Registry pattern enables metrics to be discovered and validated at runtime without requiring core system changes.\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex initialization but dramatically improved extensibility, easier testing of individual metrics, and better separation between core evaluation logic and domain-specific scoring\n\nThe metrics engine supports four primary categories of evaluation metrics, each optimized for different assessment scenarios:\n\n**Exact Match Metrics**: Designed for scenarios where precision is paramount—factual questions, code generation, structured data extraction. These metrics compare outputs character-by-character or after applying normalization rules like whitespace trimming and case conversion.\n\n**Semantic Similarity Metrics**: Utilize embedding models to measure meaning similarity rather than surface text similarity. Critical for creative tasks, summarization, and scenarios where multiple valid outputs exist. The embedding comparison uses cosine similarity in high-dimensional vector space.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge Metrics**: Employ language models to evaluate other language model outputs using natural language criteria. Particularly valuable for nuanced evaluation scenarios like creativity, helpfulness, or adherence to complex guidelines that are difficult to encode algorithmically.\n\n**Custom Domain Metrics**: User-defined metrics that implement domain-specific evaluation logic. Examples include code compilation success for programming tasks, factual accuracy for knowledge-based questions, or safety compliance for content generation.\n\n#### Evaluation Runner Layer\n\nThe **Evaluation Runner Layer** serves as the orchestration engine of our evaluation laboratory—think of it as a sophisticated automated laboratory that can run hundreds of experiments simultaneously while maintaining precise control over experimental conditions. This layer coordinates the complex dance between dataset management, metrics computation, and external LLM APIs while ensuring reliability, performance, and reproducibility.\n\nThe evaluation runner implements a **batch processing architecture** with sophisticated concurrency control, caching, and fault tolerance. The core challenge is managing the inherent unpredictability of external API calls (latency spikes, rate limits, transient failures) while providing predictable performance and reliable progress tracking.\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Concurrency Model | Failure Handling |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| `BatchProcessor` | Organize test cases into efficient processing batches | Thread pool with configurable size | Retry failed batches with exponential backoff |\n| `LLMProviderManager` | Abstract differences between LLM APIs | Connection pooling per provider | Circuit breaker pattern for failing providers |\n| `ResultCache` | Store and retrieve previously computed responses | Read-through cache with LRU eviction | Cache corruption detection and automatic rebuild |\n| `ProgressTracker` | Monitor and report evaluation progress | Thread-safe progress updates | Persist checkpoint data for crash recovery |\n| `CheckpointManager` | Enable recovery from interruptions | Periodic state serialization | Detect incomplete evaluations and resume processing |\n\nThe `EvaluationConfig` structure centralizes all configuration needed for evaluation execution:\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Default Value |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------------|\n| `dataset_storage_path` | `Path` | Root directory for dataset storage | `./datasets` |\n| `max_concurrent_evaluations` | `int` | Maximum parallel LLM API calls | `10` |\n| `llm_providers` | `Dict[str, LLMProviderConfig]` | Configuration for each LLM provider | Empty dict (must be configured) |\n| `cache_storage_path` | `Path` | Directory for result caching | `./cache` |\n| `checkpoint_interval` | `int` | Seconds between progress checkpoints | `30` |\n| `batch_size` | `int` | Test cases processed per batch | `50` |\n| `timeout_seconds` | `int` | Maximum time to wait for API response | `120` |\n| `retry_attempts` | `int` | Number of retries for failed API calls | `3` |\n\n> **Decision: Asynchronous Batch Processing with Checkpointing**\n> - **Context**: Evaluations can involve thousands of test cases and multiple LLM providers with varying response times and rate limits. A single evaluation might run for hours, making crash recovery essential.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Synchronous sequential processing\n>   2. Simple multithreading with shared result storage\n>   3. Asynchronous batch processing with persistent checkpoints\n> - **Decision**: Implemented asynchronous batch processing with checkpoint-based recovery\n> - **Rationale**: LLM API calls have high latency variance (50ms to 30+ seconds) and unpredictable failures. Batch processing amortizes the overhead of API setup, while checkpointing ensures that hours of work aren't lost to transient failures. Asynchronous processing maximizes throughput when some APIs are slow.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation requiring careful state management, but dramatically improved throughput (10x typical improvement) and reliability for long-running evaluations\n\nThe evaluation execution follows a sophisticated pipeline that balances throughput, reliability, and resource utilization:\n\n1. **Test Case Batching**: The system organizes test cases into batches based on their computational requirements and LLM provider compatibility, optimizing for both API efficiency and memory usage.\n\n2. **Provider Load Balancing**: When multiple LLM providers are available, the system distributes load based on provider capacity, current response times, and failure rates.\n\n3. **Concurrent Execution**: Within each batch, individual test cases are processed concurrently up to the configured concurrency limit, with sophisticated rate limiting to avoid overwhelming APIs.\n\n4. **Result Aggregation**: As individual test case results complete, they are immediately aggregated and stored, allowing partial results to be available even during long-running evaluations.\n\n5. **Progress Monitoring**: The system maintains detailed progress tracking with estimated completion times, current throughput metrics, and failure rate monitoring.\n\n#### Reporting and Analysis Layer\n\nThe **Reporting and Analysis Layer** functions as the analytical laboratory where raw evaluation data is transformed into actionable insights. Think of it as combining a statistical analysis workbench with a scientific publishing system—it takes numerical scores and model responses and produces comprehensive reports that guide model improvement decisions.\n\nThis layer implements a **multi-stage analytical pipeline** that applies statistical methods, detects performance patterns, and generates visualizations. The key insight is that different stakeholders need different views of the same evaluation data—data scientists need detailed statistical breakdowns, engineers need regression detection, and managers need high-level performance summaries.\n\n| Component | Analysis Type | Output Format | Statistical Methods |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| `ScoreAggregator` | Descriptive statistics by category | Summary tables with confidence intervals | Mean, median, percentiles, standard deviation |\n| `RegressionDetector` | Performance change detection | Alert reports with significance testing | T-tests, Mann-Whitney U, effect size calculation |\n| `FailureAnalyzer` | Error pattern identification | Clustered failure reports | Text similarity clustering, frequency analysis |\n| `TrendAnalyzer` | Performance trends over time | Time series visualizations | Moving averages, trend line fitting |\n| `ReportGenerator` | Multi-format report compilation | HTML, PDF, JSON exports | Template rendering, chart generation |\n\nThe reporting layer processes evaluation results through several analytical stages, each building upon the previous stage's outputs:\n\n**Statistical Aggregation**: Raw scores are grouped by test case tags, difficulty levels, and model configurations, then summarized using descriptive statistics. The system computes confidence intervals for all aggregate metrics to provide uncertainty quantification.\n\n**Regression Detection**: Current evaluation results are compared against stored baseline evaluations using statistical significance testing. The system automatically flags metrics that have degraded beyond configurable thresholds while controlling for multiple comparison problems.\n\n**Failure Analysis**: Test cases with low scores are analyzed to identify common failure patterns. The system clusters similar failures using semantic similarity and provides representative examples of each failure category.\n\n**Trend Analysis**: When multiple evaluation runs are available, the system analyzes performance trends over time, identifying gradual improvements or degradations that might not trigger regression detection thresholds.\n\n**Insight Generation**: The final stage synthesizes findings from all previous analyses to generate actionable recommendations for model improvement, highlighting the most promising areas for development focus.\n\n### Data Flow Overview\n\nThe evaluation framework implements a **unidirectional data flow architecture** with clearly defined transformation stages and well-controlled side effects. Think of the data flow as a scientific experiment protocol—raw materials (test cases) enter at one end, undergo a series of controlled transformations (evaluation and scoring), and produce refined outputs (insights and reports) at the other end.\n\nUnderstanding the data flow is crucial for debugging issues, optimizing performance, and extending the system. Each transformation stage has specific input requirements, output guarantees, and error propagation characteristics that must be respected by all components.\n\n#### Primary Data Flow Pipeline\n\nThe main evaluation pipeline processes data through five distinct stages, each with specific transformation responsibilities:\n\n1. **Dataset Ingestion and Validation**\n   - **Input**: Raw files in CSV, JSON, or JSONL format\n   - **Transformation**: Schema validation, format normalization, metadata extraction\n   - **Output**: Validated `TestCase` objects stored in versioned `Dataset` containers\n   - **Side Effects**: Error logging for invalid cases, automatic backup creation\n   - **Error Handling**: Malformed cases are quarantined with detailed error descriptions\n\n2. **Test Case Preparation and Batching**\n   - **Input**: `Dataset` with filtered test cases based on evaluation criteria\n   - **Transformation**: Batch organization, provider assignment, cache key generation\n   - **Output**: `EvaluationBatch` objects ready for parallel processing\n   - **Side Effects**: Cache lookup for previously computed results\n   - **Error Handling**: Invalid test cases are skipped with warnings\n\n3. **Model Invocation and Response Collection**\n   - **Input**: `EvaluationBatch` with prepared prompts and provider configurations\n   - **Transformation**: LLM API calls with timeout and retry handling\n   - **Output**: `ModelResponse` objects containing outputs and metadata\n   - **Side Effects**: Response caching, rate limit tracking, checkpoint creation\n   - **Error Handling**: Failed API calls are retried with exponential backoff\n\n4. **Metric Computation and Score Aggregation**\n   - **Input**: `ModelResponse` and corresponding `TestCase` for comparison\n   - **Transformation**: Applicable metrics are computed and results are aggregated\n   - **Output**: `EvaluationResult` objects with scores and explanations\n   - **Side Effects**: Metric-specific intermediate results are cached\n   - **Error Handling**: Metric computation failures are logged but don't halt evaluation\n\n5. **Analysis and Report Generation**\n   - **Input**: Complete set of `EvaluationResult` objects for the evaluation run\n   - **Transformation**: Statistical analysis, regression detection, visualization creation\n   - **Output**: Formatted reports in HTML, PDF, and JSON formats\n   - **Side Effects**: Baseline comparison results, trend analysis updates\n   - **Error Handling**: Report generation continues with warnings for missing data\n\n#### Data Persistence and Caching Strategy\n\nThe system implements a **multi-tier storage strategy** optimized for different data access patterns and durability requirements:\n\n| Data Type | Storage Tier | Access Pattern | Retention Policy | Backup Strategy |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| `TestCase` definitions | Primary database | Frequent read, infrequent write | Permanent with versioning | Daily incremental |\n| `ModelResponse` cache | Fast SSD cache | High read, write-once | LRU eviction after 30 days | No backup (regeneratable) |\n| `EvaluationResult` summaries | Primary database | Moderate read/write | Permanent for trending | Daily incremental |\n| Intermediate computations | Memory cache | High read/write during evaluation | Session lifetime only | No persistence |\n| Generated reports | Object storage | Infrequent read | 90 days, configurable | Weekly full backup |\n\n> **Decision: Hierarchical Caching with Selective Persistence**\n> - **Context**: Different evaluation data has vastly different cost/benefit ratios for storage and recomputation. Model responses are expensive to generate but cheap to store, while intermediate metric computations are cheap to regenerate but numerous.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Uniform storage approach for all data types\n>   2. Memory-only caching with full recomputation\n>   3. Tiered storage matched to data characteristics\n> - **Decision**: Implemented tiered storage with data-specific policies\n> - **Rationale**: Model API calls are the most expensive operation (time and money), so response caching provides maximum value. Metric computations are CPU-intensive but deterministic, so memory caching during evaluation run is sufficient. Report generation is infrequent but valuable for historical analysis.\n> - **Consequences**: Complex storage management but optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency for large-scale evaluations\n\n#### Cross-Cutting Data Concerns\n\nSeveral data flow concerns span multiple components and require coordinated handling across the system:\n\n**Data Consistency**: The system maintains strong consistency for dataset versions and evaluation configurations while accepting eventual consistency for caching layers. Version conflicts are resolved using timestamp-based ordering with manual intervention for complex cases.\n\n**Error Propagation**: Errors are classified into recoverable (retry with backoff) and non-recoverable (skip and continue) categories. Each component maintains error counts and implements circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures.\n\n**Progress Tracking**: Data flow progress is tracked at multiple granularities—overall evaluation progress, per-batch completion, and individual test case status. Progress information is persisted to enable accurate resume after interruption.\n\n**Data Lineage**: The system maintains complete provenance tracking from input datasets through final reports, enabling detailed debugging and reproducibility verification. Each generated artifact includes metadata linking it to its source data and processing configuration.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides practical guidance for implementing the four-layer architecture with technology recommendations and starter code that bridges the gap between design concepts and working software.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Trade-offs |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Dataset Storage | SQLite with JSON columns | PostgreSQL with specialized indexing | SQLite: easier setup, single-file. PostgreSQL: better concurrency, advanced querying |\n| Result Caching | File-based cache with pickle | Redis with compression | File cache: no external dependencies.

Environment: 12-factor compliance, simpler deployment |\n\n#### Recommended Project Structure\n\nUnderstanding the file organization is crucial for maintaining clean separation between the architectural layers:\n\n```\nllm-evaluation-framework/\n├── src/llm_eval/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── core/                          # Core interfaces and base classes\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── interfaces.py               # BaseMetric, DatasetInterface definitions\n│   │   └── exceptions.py               # Framework-specific exceptions\n│   ├── dataset/                       # Dataset Management Layer\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── loader.py                   # DatasetLoader implementation\n│   │   ├── models.py                   # TestCase, Dataset data classes\n│   │   ├── versioning.py               # VersionManager implementation\n│   │   └── splitter.py                 # DatasetSplitter implementation\n│   ├── metrics/                       # Metrics Engine Layer\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── registry.py                 # MetricRegistry implementation\n│   │   ├── exact_match.py              # Built-in exact match metrics\n│   │   ├── semantic.py                 # Semantic similarity metrics\n│   │   ├── llm_judge.py                # LLM-as-judge metrics\n│   │   └── base.py                     # BaseMetric abstract class\n│   ├── runner/                        # Evaluation Runner Layer\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── executor.py                 # Main evaluation orchestration\n│   │   ├── batch_processor.py          # BatchProcessor implementation\n│   │   ├── cache.py                    # Result caching system\n│   │   ├── providers/                  # LLM provider integrations\n│   │   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   │   ├── openai_provider.py      # OpenAI API integration\n│   │   │   ├── anthropic_provider.py   # Anthropic API integration\n│   │   │   └── base_provider.py        # Provider interface\n│   │   └── checkpoint.py               # Checkpoint and recovery\n│   ├── reporting/                     # Reporting and Analysis Layer\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── aggregator.py               # Score aggregation logic\n│   │   ├── analyzer.py                 # Statistical analysis\n│   │   ├── generator.py                # Report generation\n│   │   └── templates/                  # Report templates\n│   └── utils/                         # Shared utilities\n│       ├── __init__.py\n│       ├── config.py                   # Configuration management\n│       └── logging.py                  # Logging setup\n├── tests/                             # Test suite\n│   ├── unit/                          # Unit tests per component\n│   ├── integration/                   # Cross-component tests\n│   └── fixtures/                      # Test data and mocks\n├── examples/                          # Usage examples\n├── docs/                              # Documentation\n├── config/                            # Configuration files\n└── requirements.txt                   # Python dependencies\n```\n\n#### Core Infrastructure Components\n\nThese infrastructure components provide essential functionality that all layers depend on. Use these as-is to focus on the evaluation-specific logic:\n\n**Configuration Management (Complete Implementation)**:\n```python\n# src/llm_eval/utils/config.py\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nimport yaml\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, validator\n\nclass LLMProviderConfig(BaseModel):\n    provider: str\n    api_key: str\n    model: str\n    max_tokens: int = 1000\n    temperature: float = 0.0\n    \n    @validator('temperature')\n    def validate_temperature(cls, v):\n        if not 0.0 <= v <= 2.0:\n            raise ValueError('Temperature must be between 0.0 and 2.0')\n        return v\n\nclass EvaluationConfig(BaseModel):\n    dataset_storage_path: Path = Path(\"./datasets\")\n    max_concurrent_evaluations: int = 10\n    llm_providers: Dict[str, LLMProviderConfig] = {}\n    cache_storage_path: Path = Path(\"./cache\")\n    checkpoint_interval: int = 30\n    batch_size: int = 50\n    timeout_seconds: int = 120\n    retry_attempts: int = 3\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def from_file(cls, config_path: Path) -> 'EvaluationConfig':\n        with open(config_path, 'r') as f:\n            config_data = yaml.safe_load(f)\n        return cls(**config_data)\n    \n    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        return self.dict()\n```\n\n**Rate Limiter (Complete Implementation)**:\n```python\n# src/llm_eval/utils/rate_limiter.py\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom typing import Dict\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass RateLimiter:\n    def __init__(self, max_requests: int, time_window: int):\n        self.max_requests = max_requests\n        self.time_window = time_window\n        self._requests: deque = deque()\n        self._lock = asyncio.Lock()\n    \n    async def acquire(self) -> None:\n        async with self._lock:\n            current_time = time.time()\n            \n            # Remove requests outside the time window\n            while self._requests and self._requests[0] < current_time - self.time_window:\n                self._requests.popleft()\n            \n            # If we're at the limit, wait until the oldest request expires\n            if len(self._requests) >= self.max_requests:\n                sleep_time = self._requests[0] + self.time_window - current_time\n                if sleep_time > 0:\n                    await asyncio.sleep(sleep_time)\n                    return await self.acquire()  # Recurse to try again\n            \n            # Record this request\n            self._requests.append(current_time)\n```\n\n#### Core Logic Skeletons\n\nThese provide the structure for implementing the main architectural components. Each TODO maps to specific algorithm steps from the design:\n\n**Dataset Management Core Logic**:\n```python\n# src/llm_eval/dataset/loader.py\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\nfrom .models import TestCase, Dataset\n\nclass DatasetLoader:\n    def load_from_csv(self, file_path: Path, column_mapping: Dict[str, str] = None) -> Dataset:\n        \"\"\"Load dataset from CSV file with automatic column mapping.\"\"\"\n        #

In a lab, researchers maintain detailed records of experiments, specimens, procedures, and results. Each experiment has a specific protocol (like our test cases), produces measurable outcomes (like our evaluation results), and gets catalogued in a versioned system where changes are tracked over time (like our dataset versioning). Just as lab notebooks must be precise, reproducible, and auditable, our data model ensures that every evaluation can be exactly reproduced and compared across time.\n\nThe data model forms the backbone of our LLM evaluation framework, defining how test cases, evaluation results, metrics, and dataset versions are structured, stored, and related. This foundation enables reproducible evaluations, reliable comparisons, and comprehensive analysis across different models and time periods.\n\n### Test Case Schema\n\nThe `TestCase` represents the atomic unit of evaluation - a single prompt-response pair with associated metadata that defines one specific test of model behavior. Think of each test case as a carefully crafted scientific hypothesis: we present a specific input (the prompt) and define what constitutes a correct or acceptable response (the expected output), along with contextual information that helps us understand when and how to apply this test.\n\n**Core Design Philosophy**\n\nThe test case schema balances simplicity with extensibility. Every test case must have the essential components needed for evaluation (prompt and expected output), while the metadata system provides unlimited flexibility for adding domain-specific information without changing the core schema. This design ensures that the framework can handle diverse evaluation scenarios - from simple question-answering tasks to complex multi-turn conversations - without requiring schema migrations as requirements evolve.\n\n**Test Case Structure**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `case_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the test case, used for caching and tracking | `\"tc_001_basic_math\"` |\n| `prompt` | `str` | The input text sent to the language model for evaluation | `\"What is 2 + 2?\"` |\n| `expected_output` | `str` | The reference answer or ideal response for comparison | `\"4\"` |\n| `tags` | `List[str]` | Categorical labels for organizing and filtering test cases | `[\"math\", \"arithmetic\", \"basic\"]` |\n| `difficulty` | `str` | Complexity level using standardized scale | `\"easy\"` \\| `\"medium\"` \\| `\"hard\"` |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Flexible key-value storage for domain-specific information | `{\"topic\": \"arithmetic\", \"grade_level\": 2}` |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The `case_id` serves dual purposes - it provides stable references for caching (avoiding re-evaluation when test cases haven't changed) and enables precise tracking of results across dataset versions. Without stable IDs, changing the order of test cases would invalidate cached results.\n\n**Metadata Extensibility**\n\nThe metadata dictionary enables domain-specific extensions without schema changes. Common metadata patterns include:\n\n| Metadata Key | Type | Purpose | Example Value |\n|--------------|------|---------|---------------|\n| `topic` | `str` | Subject matter classification | `\"customer_support\"` |\n| `complexity` | `int` | Numeric difficulty score (1-10) | `7` |\n| `source` | `str` | Origin of the test case | `\"human_written\"` |\n| `rubric` | `Dict[str, str]` | Detailed scoring criteria | `{\"accuracy\": \"Must be mathematically correct\", \"format\": \"Single number only\"}` |\n| `context_length` | `int` | Token count of the prompt | `150` |\n| `expected_tokens` | `int` | Expected length of response | `5` |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Flexible Metadata vs. Typed Fields**\n> - **Context**: Need to support diverse evaluation domains without constant schema changes\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fixed schema with predefined fields for all possible use cases\n>   2. Completely unstructured data with no required fields\n>   3. Core required fields plus flexible metadata dictionary\n> - **Decision**: Core required fields plus flexible metadata dictionary\n> - **Rationale**: Ensures every test case has the minimum viable information for evaluation while allowing unlimited domain-specific extensions. Fixed schemas become obsolete quickly in ML contexts, while completely unstructured data makes tooling and validation impossible.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rapid iteration and domain adaptation, but requires careful metadata documentation to avoid inconsistencies across teams.\n\n**Validation Rules**\n\nTest case validation ensures data quality and consistency across the evaluation pipeline:\n\n1. **Required Field Validation**: `case_id`, `prompt`, `expected_output`, and `tags` must be non-empty\n2. **ID Uniqueness**: `case_id` must be unique within a dataset to prevent cache conflicts\n3. **Difficulty Standardization**: `difficulty` must be one of `[\"easy\", \"medium\", \"hard\"]` for consistent filtering\n4. **Tag Normalization**: Tags are converted to lowercase and whitespace-trimmed to prevent duplicates\n5. **Metadata Type Checking**: Metadata values must be JSON-serializable for storage and transmission\n\n**Common Test Case Patterns**\n\nDifferent evaluation scenarios require specific test case structures:\n\n| Pattern | Description | Prompt Format | Expected Output Format |\n|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| **Question-Answer** | Factual questions with single correct answers | `\"What is the capital of France?\"` | `\"Paris\"` |\n| **Classification** | Category assignment tasks | `\"Classify sentiment: I love this product!\"` | `\"positive\"` |\n| **Generation** | Creative or open-ended outputs | `\"Write a haiku about coding\"` | `\"Bugs in my code flow\\nDebugging through the long night\\nFinally it works!\"` |\n| **Reasoning** | Multi-step logical problems | `\"If A > B and B > C, what can we conclude?\"` | `\"A > C\"` |\n| **Conversation** | Multi-turn dialogue simulation | JSON with conversation history | Expected next response |\n\n### Evaluation Results Model\n\nThe evaluation results model captures the complete outcome of running a single test case through the evaluation pipeline. Think of it as the laboratory report that documents not just what happened during an experiment, but also the conditions under which it occurred, the measurements taken, and any observations that might be relevant for future analysis.\n\n**Results Architecture**\n\nEvaluation results follow a hierarchical structure that mirrors the evaluation process:\n\n| Entity | Purpose | Scope | Lifetime |\n|--------|---------|-------|----------|\n| `EvaluationRun` | Groups all results from a single evaluation session | Entire evaluation batch | Permanent (for historical comparison) |\n| `EvaluationResult` | Outcome of one test case within a run | Single test case | Permanent |\n| `MetricResult` | Score from one metric applied to one test case | Single metric calculation | Permanent |\n| `ModelResponse` | Raw output from the language model | Single LLM call | Cached for performance |\n\n**EvaluationRun Schema**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `run_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for this evaluation session | `\"run_2024_01_15_14_30_gpt4\"` |\n| `dataset_name` | `str` | Name of the dataset being evaluated | `\"customer_support_v2\"` |\n| `dataset_version` | `str` | Specific version hash of the dataset | `\"sha256:abc123...\"` |\n| `model_config` | `LLMProviderConfig` | Complete model configuration used | See LLMProviderConfig schema |\n| `metrics_config` | `List[str]` | List of metrics applied during evaluation | `[\"exact_match\", \"semantic_similarity\"]` |\n| `started_at` | `datetime` | Evaluation start timestamp | `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z` |\n| `completed_at` | `Optional[datetime]` | Evaluation completion timestamp (None if failed) | `2024-01-15T15:45:30Z` |\n| `status` | `str` | Current status of the evaluation run | `\"completed\"` \\| `\"running\"` \\| `\"failed\"` |\n| `results` | `List[EvaluationResult]` | All individual test case results | Array of EvaluationResult objects |\n| `summary_stats` | `Dict[str, float]` | Aggregated metrics across all test cases | `{\"mean_score\": 0.85, \"std_dev\": 0.12}` |\n\n**EvaluationResult Schema**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `case_id` | `str` | Reference to the test case that was evaluated | `\"tc_001_basic_math\"` |\n| `model_response` | `str` | Raw text output from the language model | `\"The answer is 4.\"` |\n| `response_metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Model response details (tokens, latency, etc.) | `{\"tokens\": 6, \"latency_ms\": 245}` |\n| `metric_results` | `Dict[str, MetricResult]` | Scores from each applied metric | `{\"exact_match\": MetricResult(...)}` |\n| `overall_score` | `float` | Weighted average of all metric scores | `0.92` |\n| `evaluation_time` | `datetime` | When this specific test case was evaluated | `2024-01-15T14:35:22Z` |\n| `error_info` | `Optional[str]` | Error message if evaluation failed | `None` or `\"API timeout after 30s\"` |\n\n**MetricResult Schema**\n\nThe `MetricResult` encapsulates the outcome of applying a single metric to a model response, providing not just a numeric score but also explanation and debugging information.\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `score` | `float` | Numeric score between 0.0 and 1.0 | `0.85` |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Metric-specific calculation details | `{\"similarity_method\": \"cosine\", \"embedding_model\": \"ada-002\"}` |\n| `explanation` | `Optional[str]` | Human-readable description of the score | `\"High semantic similarity despite different wording\"` |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Detailed Result Storage vs. Aggregated Summaries**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance storage efficiency with debugging capability and future analysis needs\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Store only final aggregated scores to minimize storage\n>   2. Store complete evaluation traces including intermediate calculations\n>   3. Store structured results with configurable detail levels\n> - **Decision**: Store complete structured results with all intermediate data\n> - **Rationale**: Storage costs are minimal compared to re-evaluation costs, and detailed results enable debugging, analysis, and future metric development. Aggregated-only storage makes it impossible to understand why evaluations failed or to apply new metrics to historical runs.\n> - **Consequences**: Higher storage requirements, but enables powerful debugging, historical analysis, and metric experimentation without re-running expensive evaluations.\n\n**Response Metadata Patterns**\n\nModel response metadata captures operational information essential for performance analysis and debugging:\n\n| Metadata Key | Type | Purpose | Example |\n|--------------|------|---------|---------|\n| `token_count` | `int` | Number of tokens in the response | `127` |\n| `latency_ms` | `int` | Response time in milliseconds | `1250` |\n| `api_version` | `str` | Version of the model API used | `\"gpt-4-turbo-2024-01-01\"` |\n| `temperature` | `float` | Sampling temperature used | `0.7` |\n| `finish_reason` | `str` | Why the model stopped generating | `\"stop\"` \\| `\"length\"` \\| `\"content_filter\"` |\n| `cost_usd` | `float` | Estimated API cost for this call | `0.0024` |\n\n**Result Storage Patterns**\n\nEvaluation results are stored with multiple access patterns in mind:\n\n1. **By Run ID**: Fast retrieval of complete evaluation sessions for reporting\n2. **By Case ID**: Historical tracking of how specific test cases perform over time\n3. **By Metric Type**: Analysis of metric-specific trends across evaluations\n4. **By Time Range**: Temporal analysis of model performance evolution\n\n### Dataset Versioning Model\n\nDataset versioning provides git-like change tracking for evaluation datasets, enabling reproducible experiments and collaborative dataset development. Think of it as version control for scientific datasets - just as software engineers need to track code changes to understand when bugs were introduced or features were added, ML practitioners need to track dataset changes to understand when evaluation results changed and why.\n\n**Versioning Philosophy**\n\nThe versioning system treats datasets as living documents that evolve through collaborative improvement. Each change is tracked with full provenance information, enabling teams to understand not just what changed, but who made the change, why it was made, and what impact it had on evaluation results. This is crucial for maintaining trust in evaluation results, especially when different team members contribute test cases or when datasets are updated based on model failure analysis.\n\n**Version Entity Schema**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `version_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for this specific version | `\"v1.2.3\"` or SHA hash |\n| `dataset_name` | `str` | Name of the dataset being versioned | `\"customer_support_eval\"` |\n| `parent_version` | `Optional[str]` | Previous version this is based on | `\"v1.2.2\"` |\n| `created_by` | `str` | User or system that created this version | `\"alice@company.com\"` |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | When this version was created | `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z` |\n| `commit_message` | `str` | Description of changes in this version | `\"Added 50 edge cases for numeric reasoning\"` |\n| `change_summary` | `Dict[str, int]` | Statistics about what changed | `{\"added\": 50, \"modified\": 3, \"removed\": 1}` |\n| `test_cases` | `List[TestCase]` | Complete set of test cases in this version | Array of TestCase objects |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Version-specific information | `{\"review_status\": \"approved\", \"quality_score\": 0.95}` |\n\n**Change Tracking**\n\nThe versioning system tracks changes at the individual test case level, providing detailed diff information:\n\n| Change Type | Description | Tracking Method | Impact Analysis |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Added** | New test cases introduced | Track case_id in added_cases list | Increases dataset coverage |\n| **Modified** | Existing test cases changed | Store before/after snapshots | May invalidate cached results |\n| **Removed** | Test cases deleted | Track case_id in removed_cases list | Reduces dataset coverage |\n| **Reordered** | Test case order changed | Compare position mappings | No impact on results |\n\n**Version Diff Schema**\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Example |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `from_version` | `str` | Starting version for comparison | `\"v1.2.1\"` |\n| `to_version` | `str` | Ending version for comparison | `\"v1.2.2\"` |\n| `added_cases` | `List[str]` | Case IDs that were added | `[\"tc_051\", \"tc_052\"]` |\n| `modified_cases` | `List[str]` | Case IDs that were changed | `[\"tc_010\", \"tc_023\"]` |\n| `removed_cases` | `List[str]` | Case IDs that were deleted | `[\"tc_007\"]` |\n| `case_changes` | `Dict[str, Dict]` | Detailed field-level changes | See below for structure |\n\n**Field-Level Change Tracking**\n\nFor modified test cases, the system tracks exactly which fields changed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tc_010\": {\n    \"changed_fields\": [\"expected_output\", \"tags\"],\n    \"changes\": {\n      \"expected_output\": {\n        \"old\": \"The answer is 4\",\n        \"new\": \"4\"\n      },\n      \"tags\": {\n        \"old\": [\"math\", \"basic\"],\n        \"new\": [\"math\", \"arithmetic\", \"basic\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Full Snapshots vs. Delta Storage**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance storage efficiency with query performance for dataset versioning\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Store only deltas between versions (like git objects)\n>   2. Store complete snapshots of each version\n>   3. Hybrid approach with snapshots every N versions and deltas in between\n> - **Decision**: Store complete snapshots with computed deltas for diffs\n> - **Rationale**: Evaluation datasets are typically small (thousands, not millions of test cases), making storage costs negligible. Complete snapshots enable fast queries and simple backup/restore, while computed deltas provide detailed change analysis. Delta-only storage would require complex reconstruction logic.\n> - **Consequences**: Higher storage usage, but dramatically simplified queries and reliable data access. Enables instant dataset checkout to any version.\n\n**Branching and Merging**\n\nThe versioning system supports git-like branching for parallel dataset development:\n\n| Operation | Purpose | Implementation | Conflict Resolution |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Branch** | Create parallel development line | Copy current version with new branch name | N/A |\n| **Merge** | Combine changes from two branches | Three-way merge using common ancestor | Manual resolution required |\n| **Cherry-pick** | Apply specific test cases from another branch | Copy test cases while preserving history | Automatic if no conflicts |\n| **Revert** | Undo specific changes | Create new version excluding specified changes | Automatic |\n\n**Merge Conflict Resolution**\n\nWhen merging branches that modified the same test cases, conflicts must be resolved:\n\n| Conflict Type | Detection Method | Resolution Strategy | Example |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Same Case Modified** | Compare case_id across branches | Present side-by-side diff for manual resolution | Both branches changed expected_output |\n| **Case Added/Removed** | Check for case_id existence conflicts | Automatic (additions win, removals lose unless explicit) | One branch adds tc_100, other removes it |\n| **Tag Conflicts** | Compare tag lists for same cases | Union of all tags unless explicitly conflicting | Branch A adds \"easy\", Branch B adds \"difficult\" |\n\n**Dataset Lineage Tracking**\n\nThe versioning system maintains complete lineage information for audit trails and impact analysis:\n\n| Lineage Data | Purpose | Storage Format | Query Patterns |\n|--------------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Creation Path** | Track how each test case was created | `{\"source\": \"human_authored\", \"author\": \"alice\", \"date\": \"2024-01-15\"}` | Find all cases by author |\n| **Modification History** | Track all changes to each case | List of change records with timestamps | Audit trail for specific cases |\n| **Usage Tracking** | Record which evaluations used which versions | Evaluation run → dataset version mapping | Impact analysis for version changes |\n| **Quality Metrics** | Track dataset quality over time | Version → quality score mapping | Quality trend analysis |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Case ID Generation**\nMany implementations generate case IDs based on content hashes or array indices, leading to instability when test cases are reordered or slightly modified. This breaks caching and makes it impossible to track the same logical test case across dataset versions. Instead, use stable, human-meaningful IDs like `\"customer_support_billing_001\"` that persist even when content changes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unvalidated Metadata Schemas**\nTeams often treat the metadata dictionary as completely unstructured, leading to inconsistent keys, incompatible value types, and broken analysis tools. Establish metadata conventions early and use validation schemas to ensure consistency. For example, always use `snake_case` for keys and document expected value types.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Evaluation Context**\nStoring results without capturing the exact model configuration, dataset version, and environmental conditions makes it impossible to reproduce evaluations or debug score changes. Always store complete context, including API versions, model parameters, and system configuration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Change Tracking**\nSimple version numbers without detailed change tracking make it impossible to understand why evaluation scores changed between runs. Implement comprehensive diff tracking that shows exactly which test cases were added, modified, or removed, and how those changes impacted overall scores.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Storage Schema Evolution**\nHardcoding data structures without considering future extensions leads to painful migrations when new fields are needed. Design schemas with extension points (like metadata dictionaries) and use backward-compatible serialization formats that can handle missing fields gracefully.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe data model implementation requires careful consideration of serialization, validation, and storage patterns to ensure data integrity and performance across the evaluation pipeline.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Serialization** | JSON with Pydantic models | Protocol Buffers with schema evolution |\n| **Validation** | Pydantic BaseModel with validators | JSON Schema with custom validation rules |\n| **Storage** | File-based JSON/JSONL | SQLite with indexed queries |\n| **Versioning** | Directory structure with manifest files | Git-based storage with LFS for large datasets |\n| **Caching** | In-memory dictionaries | Redis with TTL and compression |\n\n**File Structure**\n\n```\nevaluation_framework/\n  data/\n    models/\n      __init__.py              ← Export all data model classes\n      test_case.py             ← TestCase class with validation\n      evaluation.py            ← EvaluationRun and EvaluationResult classes\n      metrics.py               ← MetricResult and related classes\n      versioning.py            ← Dataset versioning classes\n      serialization.py         ← JSON/dict conversion utilities\n    storage/\n      __init__.py\n      dataset_storage.py       ← Dataset persistence layer\n      results_storage.py       ← Evaluation results persistence\n      version_storage.py       ← Version control implementation\n  tests/\n    test_data_models.py        ← Unit tests for all data model classes\n    test_serialization.py     ← Serialization round-trip tests\n    test_versioning.py        ← Version control functionality tests\n```\n\n**Core Data Model Infrastructure**\n\n```python\n# data/models/test_case.py -

The `BaseModel` class provides automatic validation, JSON serialization, and IDE support.\n- **Type Hints**: Use comprehensive type hints for all fields and methods. This enables better IDE support and catches errors early.\n- **Datetime Handling**: Always use UTC timestamps and ISO format strings for datetime serialization to avoid timezone issues.\n- **File Locking**: Use `fcntl.flock()` on Unix or `msvcrt.locking()` on Windows when writing dataset files to prevent corruption from concurrent access.\n- **Path Handling**: Use `pathlib.Path` instead of string manipulation for cross-platform file operations.\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint**\n\nAfter implementing the data model:\n\n1. **Run validation tests**: `python -m pytest tests/test_data_models.py -v`\n2. **Test serialization**: Create a TestCase, serialize to JSON, deserialize, and verify equality\n3. **Verify versioning**: Create two dataset versions, compute their diff, and check the change summary\n4. **Test storage**: Save a dataset version to disk and reload it, ensuring all data is preserved\n\nExpected behavior:\n- All Pydantic validation rules should work correctly (try creating invalid test cases)\n- JSON serialization should handle datetimes and nested objects properly\n- Version diffs should accurately identify changes at the field level\n- Storage operations should be atomic and handle concurrent access gracefully\n\nSigns of problems:\n- **Serialization errors**: Check datetime handling and ensure all objects have `to_dict()` methods\n- **Validation failures**: Verify Pydantic validators are correctly implemented\n- **Storage corruption**: Implement proper file locking and atomic write operations\n- **Performance issues**: Use efficient data structures and avoid deep copying large datasets unnecessarily\n\n\n## Dataset Management System\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Dataset Management) - This section covers the complete dataset lifecycle from import through versioning and splitting\n\nThe dataset management system serves as the foundation of our evaluation framework, much like how a well-organized laboratory manages its test specimens and experimental protocols. Just as a laboratory needs rigorous sample tracking, versioning of experimental procedures, and systematic organization of test conditions, our evaluation framework requires sophisticated dataset management to ensure reproducible, reliable, and scalable LLM evaluations.\n\nThink of the dataset management system as a specialized version control system combined with a data warehouse, specifically designed for evaluation workloads. Unlike traditional databases that optimize for transactional operations, or standard version control systems that handle text files, our system must handle the unique characteristics of evaluation datasets: structured test cases with rich metadata, semantic relationships between similar test cases, and the need for both content-based versioning and temporal tracking of dataset evolution.\n\nThe system handles three fundamental responsibilities: ingesting evaluation data from various sources with automatic schema validation, maintaining a complete history of dataset changes with diff capabilities, and organizing datasets into training and evaluation splits that preserve statistical properties. These capabilities work together to provide the data foundation that enables all other components in the evaluation pipeline.\n\n![Dataset Lifecycle State Machine](./diagrams/dataset-lifecycle.svg)\n\n### Dataset Loader\n\nThe dataset loader functions as the primary ingestion engine, transforming raw evaluation data from multiple formats into our standardized `TestCase` schema. Think of it as a sophisticated data translator that not only converts between formats but also validates, enriches, and normalizes the incoming data to ensure consistency across all evaluation workflows.\n\nThe loader supports three primary input formats: CSV files for tabular data export from spreadsheets and databases, JSON files for structured data with complex nested fields, and JSONL (JSON Lines) format for streaming large datasets efficiently. Each format requires different parsing strategies and validation approaches, but all must produce identical `TestCase` objects that conform to our evaluation schema.\n\n**Decision: Multi-Format Support with Automatic Schema Detection**\n- **Context**: Evaluation teams work with diverse data sources including spreadsheets, databases, annotation tools, and API exports, each producing different file formats\n- **Options Considered**: \n  1. Support only JSON format and require manual conversion\n  2. Support multiple formats with manual schema mapping configuration\n  3. Support multiple formats with automatic schema detection and mapping\n- **Decision**: Implement automatic schema detection with fallback to manual configuration\n- **Rationale**: Automatic detection reduces friction for evaluation teams while maintaining flexibility for edge cases. Manual conversion creates unnecessary barriers, and requiring configuration for every import slows down evaluation iteration cycles\n- **Consequences**: Increases loader complexity but dramatically improves user experience. Requires robust error handling for ambiguous schema detection cases\n\nThe automatic schema mapping system analyzes input files to identify columns or fields that correspond to our core `TestCase` schema. For CSV files, it uses heuristics based on column names (case-insensitive matching for variations like \"prompt\", \"input\", \"question\") and content analysis (detecting which columns contain long text versus short categorical values). For JSON formats, it performs recursive field analysis to locate nested structures that match our expected schema patterns.\n\n| Schema Field | CSV Detection Heuristics | JSON Detection Patterns | Fallback Behavior |\n|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| `prompt` | Column names: prompt, input, question, query | Root or nested field matching: prompt, input, text | Use first text column >50 chars avg |\n| `expected_output` | Column names: expected, answer, output, target | Fields: expected, answer, output, label | Use second text column if available |\n| `tags` | Column names: tags, categories, labels | Array fields or comma-separated strings | Split on common delimiters (comma, semicolon) |\n| `difficulty` | Column names: difficulty, level, complexity | String or numeric fields with difficulty keywords | Default to \"medium\" if not detected |\n| `case_id` | Column names: id, case_id, test_id | Unique identifier fields | Generate UUID if missing |\n\nThe validation engine ensures that all loaded test cases conform to the required schema constraints before accepting them into the dataset. This includes checking that essential fields like `prompt` and `expected_output` are non-empty, validating that `tags` contain meaningful categorical information rather than noise, and ensuring that `difficulty` levels map to our standardized taxonomy.\n\n> The key insight is that schema validation must happen at ingestion time, not during evaluation execution. Finding malformed test cases during a long-running evaluation wastes computational resources and breaks the evaluation pipeline at the worst possible moment.\n\n**Data Structure: TestCase Schema**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description | Validation Rules |\n|------------|------|-------------|------------------|\n| `case_id` | str | Unique identifier for the test case | Must be unique within dataset, auto-generated if missing |\n| `prompt` | str | Input text sent to the language model | Non-empty, length between 1-10000 characters |\n| `expected_output` | str | Reference answer or expected response | Non-empty, used for scoring and comparison |\n| `tags` | List[str] | Categorical metadata for grouping and analysis | At least one tag, each tag 1-50 characters |\n| `difficulty` | str | Complexity level: \"easy\", \"medium\", \"hard\", \"expert\" | Must match predefined difficulty taxonomy |\n| `metadata` | Dict[str, Any] | Additional structured data for specialized metrics | JSON-serializable values only |\n\nThe loader implements a streaming architecture for handling large datasets that exceed available memory. Rather than loading entire files into memory, it processes them in configurable chunks (default 1000 test cases), validates each chunk, and incrementally builds the complete dataset. This enables processing of datasets with millions of test cases on standard development machines.\n\n**Loader Interface Methods**\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `load_csv` | file_path: Path, schema_mapping: Optional[Dict] | Dataset | Load CSV file with optional manual schema mapping |\n| `load_json` | file_path: Path, test_case_path: Optional[str] | Dataset | Load JSON file with optional JSONPath for test cases array |\n| `load_jsonl` | file_path: Path, chunk_size: int = 1000 | Dataset | Stream JSONL file processing in chunks |\n| `auto_detect_schema` | file_path: Path | Dict[str, str] | Analyze file and return detected schema mapping |\n| `validate_test_cases` | test_cases: List[Dict] | List[str] | Return validation errors for test case list |\n\n### Version Control System\n\nThe version control system provides git-like versioning capabilities specifically optimized for evaluation datasets. Think of it as Git for structured data, where instead of tracking line-by-line changes in text files, we track test case additions, modifications, and deletions with semantic understanding of what each change means for evaluation validity.\n\nUnlike traditional version control systems that operate on file contents, our system versions the semantic structure of datasets. When a test case's expected output changes, the system recognizes this as a potentially significant modification that could affect evaluation results, not just a text edit. This semantic awareness enables powerful features like impact analysis and intelligent merging of concurrent dataset modifications.\n\n**Decision: Content-Based Versioning with Semantic Diff**\n- **Context**: Evaluation datasets evolve continuously as teams discover edge cases, fix incorrect expected outputs, and add new test scenarios\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Simple timestamp-based versioning without change tracking\n  2. File-based versioning treating datasets as binary blobs\n  3. Content-based versioning with test case level diff tracking\n- **Decision**: Implement content-based versioning with semantic diff capabilities\n- **Rationale**: Semantic diffs enable impact analysis, rollback of specific changes, and intelligent conflict resolution. Simple versioning loses change context, while file-based versioning can't identify which specific test cases changed\n- **Consequences**: Requires sophisticated diff algorithms and more complex storage, but enables advanced dataset management workflows\n\nThe versioning system maintains a complete history of dataset evolution using a directed acyclic graph structure similar to Git's commit history. Each `DatasetVersion` represents a snapshot of the dataset at a specific point in time, with references to parent versions enabling branch and merge operations.\n\n**Data Structure: DatasetVersion Schema**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description | Usage |\n|------------|------|-------------|-------|\n| `version_id` | str | Content-based hash of the dataset state | Unique identifier, enables deduplication |\n| `dataset_name` | str | Human-readable dataset identifier | Groups related versions together |\n| `parent_version` | Optional[str] | Reference to immediate parent version | Enables history traversal and branching |\n| `created_by` | str | User or system that created this version | Audit trail and responsibility tracking |\n| `created_at` | datetime | Timestamp of version creation | Temporal ordering and history navigation |\n| `commit_message` | str | Human-readable description of changes | Documents intent behind modifications |\n| `change_summary` | Dict[str, int] | Count of added, modified, removed test cases | Quick impact assessment |\n| `test_cases` | List[TestCase] | Complete set of test cases in this version | Full dataset state for this version |\n| `metadata` | Dict[str, Any] | Version-specific metadata and tags | Extensible attributes for specialized workflows |\n\nThe content-based versioning system generates version identifiers by computing cryptographic hashes of the complete dataset contents. This approach ensures that identical datasets always receive identical version IDs, enabling automatic deduplication when multiple users independently create the same dataset state. The hash includes not just the test case contents but also their ordering and metadata, ensuring that semantically different datasets receive different version IDs.\n\n**Version Control Operations**\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `save_dataset_version` | version: DatasetVersion | str | Persist version and return content hash |\n| `load_dataset_version` | dataset_name: str, version_id: str | DatasetVersion | Retrieve specific dataset version |\n| `list_versions` | dataset_name: str | List[str] | Get all versions sorted by creation time |\n| `compute_diff` | from_version: str, to_version: str | VersionDiff | Calculate changes between versions |\n| `merge_versions` | base: str, branch_a: str, branch_b: str | DatasetVersion | Three-way merge of dataset versions |\n| `rollback_changes` | version_id: str, changes: List[str] | DatasetVersion | Create new version with specific changes reverted |\n\nThe diff computation system performs semantic comparison of test cases across versions, identifying additions, modifications, and deletions at the individual test case level. Unlike text-based diffs that show character or line changes, our semantic diffs understand the structure of test cases and can provide meaningful change descriptions.\n\n**Data Structure: VersionDiff Schema**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description | Usage |\n|------------|------|-------------|-------|\n| `from_version` | str | Source version identifier | Version being compared from |\n| `to_version` | str | Target version identifier | Version being compared to |\n| `added_cases` | List[str] | Test case IDs that were added | New test cases in target version |\n| `modified_cases` | List[str] | Test case IDs that were changed | Existing test cases with modifications |\n| `removed_cases` | List[str] | Test case IDs that were deleted | Test cases removed from source version |\n| `case_changes` | Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] | Detailed field-level changes for each modified case | Specific modifications within test cases |\n\nThe system tracks changes at multiple granularities: coarse-grained changes (test case added/modified/removed) for quick impact assessment, and fine-grained changes (specific field modifications) for detailed analysis. This dual-level tracking enables both high-level dataset evolution understanding and precise debugging of evaluation differences across versions.\n\n> The critical insight is that evaluation datasets require semantic versioning, not just content versioning. A single character change in an expected output can fundamentally alter evaluation results, so the versioning system must understand and track these semantic changes explicitly.\n\n### Dataset Splitting\n\nThe dataset splitting system provides sophisticated algorithms for dividing datasets into training, testing, and validation subsets while preserving important statistical properties. Think of it as a scientific sampling system that ensures each subset remains representative of the overall population, preventing evaluation bias that could lead to incorrect conclusions about model performance.\n\nTraditional random splitting works adequately for homogeneous datasets, but evaluation datasets often contain structured heterogeneity: different difficulty levels, topic categories, input formats, and edge case patterns. Simple random splitting might accidentally concentrate all difficult cases in the training set or place all examples from specific categories in the validation set, leading to unreliable evaluation results.\n\n**Decision: Stratified Sampling with Multi-Attribute Support**\n- **Context**: Evaluation datasets contain multiple categorical and continuous attributes that affect test case difficulty and model performance patterns\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Simple random splitting ignoring test case attributes\n  2. Stratified sampling on a single attribute (e.g., difficulty)\n  3. Multi-attribute stratified sampling with proportional allocation\n- **Decision**: Implement multi-attribute stratified sampling with configurable stratification keys\n- **Rationale**: Multi-attribute stratification ensures representative splits across all important dimensions, preventing evaluation bias. Single-attribute stratification misses interactions between attributes, while random splitting provides no guarantees about subset representativeness\n- **Consequences**: Requires more complex splitting algorithms and may not always achieve exact split ratios, but provides much more reliable evaluation results\n\nThe stratified sampling algorithm works by creating strata (groups) based on combinations of categorical attributes, then sampling from each stratum proportionally to maintain the overall distribution. For example, if the original dataset contains 30% easy cases, 50% medium cases, and 20% hard cases, each split will maintain approximately the same proportions.\n\n**Stratified Splitting Algorithm**\n\n1. **Analyze the dataset** to identify all unique combinations of stratification attributes, creating a stratum for each combination\n2. **Calculate target proportions** for each stratum based on their frequency in the complete dataset\n3. **Determine target sizes** for each split (train/test/validation) based on the configured split ratios\n4. **Allocate test cases** from each stratum to splits proportionally, ensuring minimum representation thresholds are met\n5. **Handle remainder cases** when proportional allocation doesn't divide evenly by using randomized assignment weighted by stratum size\n6. **Validate split quality** by computing distribution statistics and flagging splits that deviate significantly from target proportions\n\n**Dataset Splitting Interface**\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `train_test_split` | test_size: float, stratify_by: List[str] | Tuple[Dataset, Dataset] | Split into training and testing datasets |\n| `train_test_val_split` | test_size: float, val_size: float, stratify_by: List[str] | Tuple[Dataset, Dataset, Dataset] | Three-way split with validation set |\n| `k_fold_split` | k: int, stratify_by: List[str] | List[Tuple[Dataset, Dataset]] | Generate k training/validation pairs for cross-validation |\n| `temporal_split` | split_date: datetime | Tuple[Dataset, Dataset] | Split based on test case creation timestamps |\n| `validate_split_quality` | splits: List[Dataset], stratify_by: List[str] | Dict[str, float] | Compute distribution similarity metrics |\n\nThe system supports both proportional and absolute split specifications. Proportional splits specify percentages (e.g., 70% train, 20% test, 10% validation), while absolute splits specify exact counts (e.g., 1000 test cases, remainder for training). This flexibility accommodates different evaluation scenarios: research experiments often use proportional splits, while production evaluations may require fixed-size test sets.\n\n**Split Quality Validation Metrics**\n\n| Metric Name | Formula | Interpretation | Threshold |\n|-------------|---------|----------------|-----------|\n| Chi-Square Statistic | Σ((observed - expected)² / expected) | Distribution similarity between splits | < 0.05 for good splits |\n| Jensen-Shannon Divergence | Symmetric KL divergence variant | Information-theoretic distribution distance | < 0.1 for similar distributions |\n| Cramér's V | √(χ² / (n × min(k-1, r-1))) | Effect size of distribution differences | < 0.3 for acceptable splits |\n| Minimum Stratum Size | min(count per stratum per split) | Ensures adequate representation | ≥ 5 cases per stratum per split |\n\nThe temporal splitting capability handles datasets where test cases have creation timestamps, enabling evaluation of model performance over time. This is crucial for detecting concept drift or evaluating how models perform on newer types of questions that weren't available during training dataset creation.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Dataset Splitting**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Stratification Attributes**\nMany teams perform simple random splits without considering test case attributes, leading to biased evaluation results. For example, if all \"expert\" difficulty cases randomly end up in the training set, the test set won't properly evaluate model performance on difficult cases. Always identify the key attributes that affect model performance and stratify on those attributes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Stratum Representation**\nWhen stratifying on multiple attributes, some attribute combinations may have very few test cases, leading to strata with only 1-2 examples. These cases can't be split meaningfully across train/test sets. The system should either merge small strata with similar ones or flag datasets that don't have sufficient diversity for the desired split configuration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Temporal Leakage in Time-Series Data**\nFor datasets containing temporal information, random splitting can create temporal leakage where test cases from earlier time periods are used to evaluate models on later time periods. Always use temporal splitting for time-sensitive evaluation scenarios, placing earlier cases in training and later cases in testing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Validating Split Quality**\nTeams often assume that split algorithms produce representative subsets without verification. Always compute and review split quality metrics, especially for datasets with complex attribute distributions. Poor splits can invalidate entire evaluation studies.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| File Parsing | Python `csv` + `json` modules | `pandas` with `pyarrow` backend for performance |\n| Schema Validation | Manual validation with `jsonschema` | `pydantic` models with automatic validation |\n| Content Hashing | `hashlib.sha256` with JSON serialization | `xxhash` with custom serialization for speed |\n| Data Storage | File-based with `pickle` serialization | `sqlite` database with JSON columns |\n| Stratified Sampling | Custom implementation with `random` | `scikit-learn.model_selection.train_test_split` |\n\n**Recommended File Structure**\n```\nevaluation_framework/\n  dataset_management/\n    __init__.py                    ← Public API exports\n    loader.py                      ← Dataset loading and validation\n    version_control.py             ← Versioning and diff computation  \n    splitting.py                   ← Train/test/validation splits\n    storage.py                     ← Persistence layer\n    schemas.py                     ← Data model definitions\n    exceptions.py                  ← Custom exception classes\n  tests/\n    test_loader.py                 ← Unit tests for loader\n    test_version_control.py        ← Version control tests\n    test_splitting.py              ← Split quality tests\n    fixtures/                      ← Sample datasets for testing\n      sample.csv\n      sample.json\n      sample.jsonl\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code**\n\n```python\n# schemas.py - Complete data model definitions\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional\nimport hashlib\nimport json\nimport uuid\n\n@dataclass\nclass TestCase:\n    \"\"\"Individual test case with all required evaluation metadata.\"\"\"\n    case_id: str\n    prompt: str\n    expected_output: str\n    tags: List[str]\n    difficulty: str\n    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)\n    \n    def __post_init__(self):\n        \"\"\"Validate test case after creation.\"\"\"\n        if not self.case_id:\n            self.case_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        if not self.prompt.strip():\n            raise ValueError(\"Test case prompt cannot be empty\")\n        if not self.expected_output.strip():\n            raise ValueError(\"Test case expected_output cannot be empty\")\n        if not self.tags:\n            raise ValueError(\"Test case must have at least one tag\")\n        if self.difficulty not in [\"easy\", \"medium\", \"hard\", \"expert\"]:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid difficulty: {self.difficulty}\")\n    \n    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        \"\"\"Serialize to dictionary for storage and hashing.\"\"\"\n        return {\n            \"case_id\": self.case_id,\n            \"prompt\": self.prompt,\n            \"expected_output\": self.expected_output,\n            \"tags\": self.tags,\n            \"difficulty\": self.difficulty,\n            \"metadata\": self.metadata\n        }\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def from_dict(cls, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> 'TestCase':\n        \"\"\"Deserialize from dictionary.\"\"\"\n        return cls(**data)\n\n@dataclass\nclass Dataset:\n    \"\"\"Collection of test cases with metadata.\"\"\"\n    name: str\n    test_cases: List[TestCase]\n    version: str\n    description: str\n    created_at: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)\n    \n    def add_test_case(self, test_case: TestCase):\n        \"\"\"Add a test case to the dataset.\"\"\"\n        #

Think of the metrics engine as a sophisticated grading system, similar to how a university might evaluate student essays using multiple criteria: some assignments get scored by exact answer matching (like math problems), others by semantic understanding (like literature analysis), and still others by expert human judgment (like creative writing). Our engine mirrors this flexibility by supporting multiple evaluation approaches within a unified, extensible architecture.\n\nThe core architectural challenge lies in creating a system that can seamlessly handle vastly different metric types - from simple string comparison to complex neural embedding calculations to LLM-powered evaluation - while maintaining consistent interfaces, reliable caching, and meaningful score aggregation. Each metric type has unique computational requirements, error modes, and performance characteristics, yet they must integrate smoothly into the same evaluation pipeline.\n\n![Metric Processing Pipeline](./diagrams/metric-processing.svg)\n\n### Metric Interface Design\n\nThe foundation of our extensible metrics system rests on a common interface that abstracts the scoring process while accommodating the diverse computational patterns of different metric types. Think of this interface as a universal translator that allows metrics as different as exact string matching and neural similarity computation to speak the same language within our evaluation framework.\n\n**BaseMetric Abstract Class**\n\nEvery metric in our system inherits from `BaseMetric`, which defines the essential contract for score computation. The interface design balances simplicity for implementers with sufficient flexibility to handle the computational complexity of modern evaluation approaches.\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `compute` | `model_output: str, expected_output: str, test_case: TestCase` | `MetricResult` | Core scoring logic that compares model output against expected result |\n| `is_applicable` | `test_case: TestCase` | `bool` | Determines if this metric should run for the given test case based on tags/metadata |\n| `get_name` | None | `str` | Returns unique identifier for this metric type |\n| `get_description` | None | `str` | Human-readable description of what this metric measures |\n| `requires_preprocessing` | None | `bool` | Whether metric needs text normalization before scoring |\n| `get_preprocessing_steps` | None | `List[str]` | List of preprocessing operations (e.g., \"normalize_whitespace\", \"lowercase\") |\n\nThe `compute` method serves as the primary entry point, receiving the model's actual output, the expected reference output, and the complete test case context. This design enables metrics to access rich metadata like difficulty level, content tags, and custom annotations that might influence scoring behavior.\n\n> **Decision: Three-Parameter Compute Interface**\n> - **Context**: Metrics need different amounts of context - some only need output strings, others need test case metadata\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Simple two-parameter interface (output, expected)\n>   2. Three-parameter interface (output, expected, test_case)\n>   3. Context object with all evaluation data\n> - **Decision**: Three-parameter interface with explicit test_case parameter\n> - **Rationale**: Provides necessary context without excessive coupling, makes dependencies explicit\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex interface but enables context-aware metrics and future extensibility\n\n**MetricResult Data Structure**\n\nThe standardized return type encapsulates all information from a single metric evaluation, designed to support both simple numeric scores and rich explanatory metadata that aids in debugging and analysis.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `score` | `float` | Primary numeric score, normalized to 0.0-1.0 range for consistency |\n| `metadata` | `Dict[str, Any]` | Additional metric-specific data (confidence, intermediate values, etc.) |\n| `explanation` | `Optional[str]` | Human-readable explanation of how the score was derived |\n| `computation_time` | `float` | Milliseconds spent computing this metric for performance monitoring |\n| `error_info` | `Optional[str]` | Error details if computation failed (score set to 0.0 on failure) |\n| `preprocessing_applied` | `List[str]` | Record of text transformations applied before scoring |\n\nThe score normalization to 0.0-1.0 range enables meaningful aggregation across different metric types. A semantic similarity metric computing cosine distances and an exact match metric returning binary values can both contribute equally to overall evaluation scores.\n\n**Metric Applicability System**\n\nThe `is_applicable` method implements a sophisticated filtering system that determines which metrics should evaluate which test cases. This prevents inappropriate metric application (like running code-execution metrics on creative writing prompts) and enables targeted evaluation strategies.\n\n| Applicability Pattern | Implementation Strategy | Example Use Case |\n|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Tag-based filtering | Check for required tags in `test_case.tags` | Semantic similarity only for \"reasoning\" tasks |\n| Difficulty-based filtering | Compare against `test_case.difficulty` level | Complex metrics skip \"easy\" baseline cases |\n| Content-type filtering | Inspect expected output format/structure | Code metrics require valid syntax in expected output |\n| Metadata-driven filtering | Custom logic based on `test_case.metadata` | LLM-as-judge only when reference answer exists |\n\n> The applicability system serves as quality gates, ensuring metrics only run where they provide meaningful signal rather than noise.\n\n**Preprocessing Pipeline Integration**\n\nMany metrics benefit from text normalization before scoring - removing extra whitespace, standardizing case, or stripping formatting artifacts. The interface design makes preprocessing explicit and trackable rather than hidden within metric implementations.\n\nStandard preprocessing operations include:\n\n1. **Whitespace normalization**: Convert multiple spaces/tabs/newlines to single spaces\n2. **Case normalization**: Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n3. **Punctuation handling**: Remove or normalize punctuation marks\n4. **Unicode normalization**: Handle different Unicode representations of same characters\n5. **Format stripping**: Remove markdown, HTML, or other formatting artifacts\n\nEach applied preprocessing step gets recorded in the `MetricResult.preprocessing_applied` field, enabling debugging when preprocessing changes affect scores unexpectedly.\n\n### Built-in Metrics\n\nOur framework provides a comprehensive suite of built-in metrics that handle the most common evaluation scenarios. Each metric represents years of research in computational linguistics and has been battle-tested across diverse AI applications.\n\n**Exact Match Scorer**\n\nThe exact match metric serves as the foundation for deterministic evaluation scenarios where precision matters more than flexibility. Think of it as a spelling test - either the answer is exactly correct, or it isn't.\n\nThe implementation supports multiple matching modes to handle common real-world variations:\n\n| Matching Mode | Preprocessing Applied | Use Case |\n|---------------|----------------------|----------|\n| `strict` | None | Code generation, formal mathematical expressions |\n| `normalized` | Whitespace + case normalization | Natural language with formatting variations |\n| `fuzzy` | Full preprocessing pipeline | Human-written reference answers with inconsistent formatting |\n\n```python\nclass ExactMatchMetric(BaseMetric):\n    def compute(self, model_output: str, expected_output: str, test_case: TestCase) -> MetricResult:\n        # Implementation handles three matching modes based on test case configuration\n```\n\nThe exact match metric also implements **substring matching** for scenarios where the correct answer appears within a longer model response. This proves essential for evaluating models that tend to provide explanatory context alongside their core answers.\n\n**BLEU Score Calculator**\n\nBLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) measures n-gram overlap between model output and reference text, originally developed for machine translation but widely applicable to text generation tasks. Think of BLEU as measuring how many \"phrases\" the model got right, where phrases can be single words (1-grams), word pairs (2-grams), or longer sequences.\n\n| N-gram Level | Weight | Contribution | Example |\n|--------------|--------|-------------|---------|\n| 1-gram (unigrams) | 0.25 | Word-level overlap | \"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\" |\n| 2-gram (bigrams) | 0.25 | Phrase-level accuracy | \"the cat\", \"cat sat\" |\n| 3-gram (trigrams) | 0.25 | Short phrase fluency | \"the cat sat\" |\n| 4-gram (4-grams) | 0.25 | Sentence-level structure | \"the cat sat on\" |\n\nThe BLEU calculation incorporates a **brevity penalty** that prevents gaming the metric by generating very short outputs that achieve high precision but low recall. The penalty function exponentially reduces scores for outputs significantly shorter than the reference text.\n\nOur implementation handles multiple reference answers by computing BLEU against each reference and taking the maximum score, reflecting the common scenario where multiple valid answers exist for the same prompt.\n\n**ROUGE Score Implementation**\n\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) focuses on recall rather than precision, measuring what fraction of the reference content appears in the model output. This proves especially valuable for summarization and information extraction tasks where completeness matters more than brevity.\n\n| ROUGE Variant | Measurement Focus | Calculation Method | Best Use Case |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| ROUGE-N | N-gram recall | Count of matching n-grams / total n-grams in reference | Content coverage assessment |\n| ROUGE-L | Longest common subsequence | LCS length / reference length | Structural similarity evaluation |\n| ROUGE-W | Weighted longest common subsequence | Weighted LCS with gap penalties | Order-sensitive content evaluation |\n| ROUGE-S | Skip-gram matching | Co-occurrence patterns allowing gaps | Flexible content matching |\n\nThe ROUGE-L variant proves particularly valuable for evaluating structured outputs like lists or step-by-step procedures, where the order and completeness of information matter more than exact wording.\n\n**Semantic Similarity Scorer**\n\nSemantic similarity metrics move beyond surface-level text comparison to evaluate meaning preservation. Think of this as the difference between a human teacher who understands that \"large\" and \"big\" convey the same concept versus a simple string matcher that sees them as completely different.\n\nOur implementation supports multiple embedding approaches:\n\n| Embedding Model | Dimension | Strengths | Computational Cost |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Sentence-BERT | 384-768 | General purpose, fast inference | Low |\n| OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | Strong semantic understanding | Medium |\n| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | Highest quality semantic representation | High |\n| Domain-specific fine-tuned | Variable | Specialized vocabulary understanding | Variable |\n\nThe scoring process follows a multi-step pipeline:\n\n1. **Text preprocessing**: Remove formatting artifacts that could skew embeddings\n2. **Embedding generation**: Convert both texts to dense vector representations\n3. **Similarity computation**: Calculate cosine similarity between embedding vectors\n4. **Score normalization**: Map similarity values to 0.0-1.0 range with appropriate thresholds\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Raw cosine similarity scores require calibration - a score of 0.8 might indicate strong similarity in one domain but weak similarity in another. Our implementation includes domain-specific threshold tuning.\n\n**Calibration and Threshold Management**\n\nEach semantic similarity model requires careful calibration to produce meaningful scores. We implement an automated calibration system that analyzes score distributions across golden examples to establish domain-specific thresholds.\n\n| Similarity Range | Semantic Interpretation | Score Mapping | Confidence Level |\n|------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| 0.95-1.0 | Nearly identical meaning | 1.0 | Very High |\n| 0.85-0.94 | Strong semantic overlap | 0.8-1.0 | High |\n| 0.70-0.84 | Moderate similarity | 0.6-0.8 | Medium |\n| 0.55-0.69 | Weak similarity | 0.3-0.6 | Low |\n| 0.0-0.54 | Little to no similarity | 0.0-0.3 | Very Low |\n\n### LLM-as-Judge System\n\nThe LLM-as-judge approach represents the frontier of evaluation methodology, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of advanced language models to assess outputs that resist traditional automated scoring. Think of this as recruiting an expert human evaluator who never gets tired, maintains consistent standards, and can process thousands of evaluations per hour.\n\nThis approach excels in scenarios where rule-based metrics fail: evaluating creativity, assessing argument quality, checking factual accuracy, or measuring adherence to complex style guidelines. However, it introduces new challenges around consistency, cost, and potential bias that require careful system design.\n\n**Judge Model Selection and Configuration**\n\nThe effectiveness of LLM-as-judge evaluation depends heavily on selecting appropriate judge models and configuring them for consistent, reliable scoring. Different judge models excel in different evaluation domains.\n\n| Judge Model | Strengths | Optimal Use Cases | Consistency Rating |\n|-------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|\n| GPT-4 | Strong reasoning, broad knowledge | Complex reasoning, factual accuracy | High |\n| Claude-3-Opus | Careful analysis, nuanced judgment | Creative writing, ethical reasoning | High |\n| GPT-3.5-turbo | Fast, cost-effective | Basic quality assessment, format checking | Medium |\n| Llama-2-70B | Open source, customizable | Domain-specific evaluation with fine-tuning | Medium |\n\nThe judge configuration includes several critical parameters that significantly impact evaluation quality:\n\n| Parameter | Recommended Value | Impact on Evaluation | Tuning Strategy |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| `temperature` | 0.1-0.2 | Lower values increase consistency | Start at 0.1, increase if responses too rigid |\n| `max_tokens` | 200-500 | Allows detailed explanations | Balance between explanation quality and cost |\n| `top_p` | 0.9 | Controls response diversity | Keep high to allow nuanced reasoning |\n| `frequency_penalty` | 0.0 | Prevent repetitive language | Usually unnecessary for evaluation tasks |\n\n**Prompt Engineering for Consistent Evaluation**\n\nThe quality of LLM-as-judge evaluation depends critically on prompt design. Effective evaluation prompts must provide clear criteria, consistent formatting, and appropriate examples while avoiding bias or leading the judge toward particular scores.\n\nOur prompt template follows a structured format:\n\n1. **Role definition**: Establish the judge's expertise and evaluation perspective\n2. **Criteria specification**: Define specific, measurable evaluation dimensions\n3. **Scoring rubric**: Provide clear numerical scale with behavioral anchors\n4. **Output format**: Specify exact format for score and explanation\n5. **Examples**: Include 2-3 golden examples showing excellent evaluation\n\n**Consistency Control Mechanisms**\n\nLLM judges can exhibit inconsistency across evaluation runs due to their probabilistic nature. We implement several mechanisms to improve consistency and detect when judge reliability degrades.\n\n| Consistency Mechanism | Implementation | Reliability Improvement | Performance Impact |\n|----------------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Multi-judge consensus | Run 3-5 judges, take median score | High - reduces individual judge variance | 3-5x compute cost |\n| Repeated evaluation | Same judge evaluates twice, flag large differences | Medium - detects unstable judgments | 2x compute cost |\n| Calibration examples | Include reference cases in each prompt | Medium - anchors judge expectations | 10-20% prompt length increase |\n| Confidence scoring | Request confidence level with each score | Low - helps identify uncertain cases | Minimal |\n\n> **Critical Design Decision**: We default to single-judge evaluation with calibration examples for cost efficiency, but enable multi-judge consensus for high-stakes evaluations where accuracy justifies additional expense.\n\n**Judge Prompt Template System**\n\nOur system supports multiple prompt templates optimized for different evaluation scenarios. Each template has been refined through extensive testing to maximize inter-judge agreement and correlation with human expert evaluation.\n\n| Template Type | Evaluation Focus | Prompt Structure | Validation Method |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| `accuracy_focused` | Factual correctness, logical consistency | Claim verification checklist | Expert fact-checker agreement |\n| `creativity_focused` | Originality, creative expression | Multi-dimensional creativity rubric | Human creativity assessment correlation |\n| `helpfulness_focused` | User utility, practical value | Task completion effectiveness | User satisfaction surveys |\n| `safety_focused` | Harmful content, bias detection | Risk assessment framework | Safety expert review |\n\n**Bias Detection and Mitigation**\n\nLLM judges can exhibit systematic biases that skew evaluation results. Our framework includes automated bias detection and mitigation strategies to ensure fair evaluation across different content types and demographic groups.\n\nCommon bias patterns we monitor include:\n\n1. **Length bias**: Systematically preferring longer or shorter responses\n2. **Style bias**: Favoring particular writing styles or formats  \n3. **Content bias**: Higher scores for certain topics or viewpoints\n4. **Demographic bias**: Different scoring patterns for content mentioning different groups\n5. **Recency bias**: Score drift over long evaluation runs\n\n**Error Handling and Fallback Strategies**\n\nLLM-as-judge evaluation introduces new failure modes that require robust error handling. The system must gracefully handle API failures, malformed responses, and judge responses that don't follow the specified format.\n\n| Error Type | Detection Method | Fallback Strategy | Recovery Action |\n|------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| API timeout | Request timeout after 30s | Retry with exponential backoff | Queue for later retry |\n| Malformed score | Regex validation of response | Extract numeric values, flag for review | Use partial score if extractable |\n| Missing explanation | Check for explanation field | Request explanation in follow-up call | Mark explanation as missing |\n| Inconsistent scoring | Compare with score distribution | Flag as outlier for manual review | Include in analysis with warning |\n| Rate limiting | 429 HTTP status code | Exponential backoff with jitter | Automatic retry after delay |\n\n### Custom Metric Plugin System\n\nThe plugin system enables users to extend our evaluation framework with domain-specific metrics while maintaining the consistency and reliability of our core architecture. Think of this as a standardized electrical outlet system - plugins can provide vastly different functionality (powering a lamp vs. a computer) while conforming to a universal interface that ensures safe, predictable operation.\n\n**Plugin Architecture Design**\n\nThe plugin system balances flexibility for metric developers with safety and performance requirements for production evaluation pipelines. Plugins operate within a controlled sandbox environment that prevents system compromise while providing access to necessary evaluation resources.\n\n> **Decision: Sandboxed Plugin Execution**\n> - **Context**: Custom metrics might contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or resource leaks\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Direct in-process execution\n>   2. Subprocess isolation with resource limits\n>   3. Container-based sandboxing\n> - **Decision**: Subprocess isolation with resource limits\n> - **Rationale**: Balances security with performance - prevents system compromise while avoiding container overhead\n> - **Consequences**: Some performance overhead but robust isolation and resource control\n\n**Plugin Registration and Discovery**\n\nThe `MetricRegistry` provides a centralized system for plugin discovery, validation, and lifecycle management. Plugins can be registered programmatically, loaded from configuration files, or discovered automatically from designated directories.\n\n| Registration Method | Use Case | Validation Level | Loading Time |\n|-------------------|----------|------------------|--------------|\n| Programmatic | Built-in metrics, test scenarios | Full validation | Immediate |\n| Configuration file | Deployment-specific metrics | Schema validation | Application startup |\n| Directory scanning | Development, experimentation | Runtime validation | First use |\n| Package installation | Third-party metric libraries | Package signature validation | Import time |\n\nThe registration process includes comprehensive validation to catch common plugin development errors before they impact evaluation runs:\n\n1. **Interface compliance**: Verify all required methods are implemented\n2. **Score range validation**: Confirm scores stay within 0.0-1.0 bounds\n3. **Resource usage limits**: Check memory and CPU consumption on sample inputs\n4. **Error handling**: Verify graceful handling of malformed inputs\n5. **Thread safety**: Validate safe concurrent execution\n\n**Plugin Development Framework**\n\nTo simplify custom metric development, we provide a comprehensive development framework with templates, testing utilities, and debugging tools. Plugin developers can focus on their scoring logic rather than infrastructure concerns.\n\n**Basic Plugin Template Structure:**\n\n| Component | Purpose | Developer Responsibility | Framework Provides |\n|-----------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Scoring logic | Core metric computation | Implement domain-specific algorithm | Input validation, error handling |\n| Applicability rules | Test case filtering | Define when metric applies | Tag matching utilities, metadata access |\n| Configuration | Runtime parameters | Define tunable parameters | Parameter validation, type checking |\n| Testing | Validation and regression | Provide test cases | Test runner, performance benchmarks |\n\n**Plugin Resource Management**\n\nCustom metrics run within controlled resource limits to prevent runaway plugins from impacting system stability. The resource management system monitors and enforces limits on memory usage, CPU time, and external API calls.\n\n| Resource Type | Default Limit | Monitoring Method | Enforcement Action |\n|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Memory usage | 100MB per metric | Process memory tracking | Kill subprocess, mark as failed |\n| CPU time | 10 seconds per evaluation | Process CPU time | Interrupt execution, return timeout error |\n| API calls | 5 calls per evaluation | HTTP request interception | Block additional calls, log warning |\n| File system | Read-only access | System call filtering | Deny write operations |\n| Network access | Configurable whitelist | Network policy enforcement | Block unauthorized connections |\n\n**Plugin Testing and Validation Framework**\n\nThe framework provides comprehensive testing utilities that help plugin developers create reliable, consistent metrics. The testing system validates both functional correctness and non-functional requirements like performance and thread safety.\n\n| Test Category | Validation Focus | Automated Checks | Manual Verification |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Functional | Correct score computation | Reference input/output pairs | Domain expert review |\n| Performance | Resource usage, latency | Benchmark against limits | Scalability testing |\n| Reliability | Error handling, edge cases | Malformed input testing | Stress testing |\n| Consistency | Score stability across runs | Multiple evaluation runs | Inter-rater reliability |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Score Range Violations**\nCustom metrics sometimes return scores outside the required 0.0-1.0 range, breaking aggregation logic. This typically happens when developers use raw similarity scores or count-based metrics without normalization. The framework validates score ranges and raises exceptions for violations, but plugin developers should implement explicit normalization in their metrics rather than relying on framework validation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Semantic Similarity Threshold Misunderstanding**\nMany developers assume that high cosine similarity scores (like 0.8) automatically indicate strong semantic similarity, but embedding models have different score distributions. A 0.8 similarity might represent strong similarity in one model but weak similarity in another. Always calibrate thresholds using golden examples from your specific domain and embedding model combination.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: LLM Judge Prompt Instability**\nSmall changes in judge prompts can cause dramatic score distribution shifts that appear as false performance regressions. This happens because LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt wording, format, and example selection. Implement prompt versioning, validate prompts on calibration datasets before production use, and monitor judge score distributions for unexpected shifts.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Preprocessing Order Dependency**\nThe order of text preprocessing steps significantly affects final scores, but many developers treat preprocessing as a simple pipeline. For example, removing punctuation before lowercasing produces different results than lowercasing before removing punctuation. Make preprocessing order explicit and consistent across metrics, and test different orderings on your specific data to identify the most appropriate sequence.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Plugin Resource Leaks**\nCustom metrics that make external API calls or load large models often fail to clean up resources properly, leading to memory leaks or connection pool exhaustion during long evaluation runs. Always implement proper resource cleanup in plugin code using context managers or try/finally blocks, and test plugins under extended execution scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Metric Applicability Over-Filtering**\nOverly restrictive applicability rules can result in test cases being evaluated by too few metrics, reducing the comprehensiveness of evaluation. This often happens when developers create highly specific tag requirements. Prefer inclusive applicability rules and let aggregation handle metric diversity rather than restricting which metrics can evaluate which test cases.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints**\n\n- **Embedding computation**: Use `sentence-transformers` for fast local embeddings or OpenAI API for higher quality. Always implement caching to avoid recomputing embeddings for the same text.\n- **Cosine similarity**: Use `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity()` or implement with NumPy: `np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))`\n- **LLM API calls**: Always implement retry logic with exponential backoff using `tenacity` library. Set reasonable timeouts (30-60 seconds) for judge evaluations.\n- **Text preprocessing**: Use `re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip()` for whitespace normalization. Consider `unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', text)` for Unicode normalization.\n- **Plugin system**: Use `importlib.import_module()` for dynamic loading. Implement resource limits with `resource.setrlimit()` and subprocess execution.\n- **Score validation**: Always validate that metric scores are in [0.0, 1.0] range: `assert 0.0 <= score <= 1.0, f\"Invalid score: {score}\"`\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint**\n\nAfter implementing the metrics engine:\n\n- **Test command**: `python -m pytest tests/test_metrics_engine.py -v`\n- **Expected output**: All built-in metrics pass validation tests, custom metric registration works, LLM judge produces consistent scores\n- **Manual verification**: \n  1. Create a simple test case: prompt=\"What is 2+2?\", expected=\"4\"\n  2. Run exact match metric - should score 1.0 for exact match, 0.0 for \"four\"\n  3. Run semantic similarity - should score high (>0.8) for \"four\", medium for \"2 plus 2 equals 4\"\n  4. Run LLM judge with creativity prompt - should provide detailed explanation with score\n- **Performance check**: Metrics should process 100 test cases in under 30 seconds (excluding LLM API calls)\n- **Signs of problems**: \n  - Scores outside 0.0-1.0 range indicate normalization bugs\n  - High variance in repeated LLM judge evaluations suggests prompt instability\n  - Memory leaks during large batch processing indicate resource cleanup issues\n\n\n## Evaluation Runner\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3 (Evaluation Runner) - This section covers the complete evaluation execution system including batch processing, concurrency control, result caching, checkpointing, and progress tracking\n\nThe evaluation runner is the orchestration engine that coordinates the execution of large-scale evaluations across thousands of test cases. Think of it as a sophisticated job scheduler for a distributed computing system - it needs to balance throughput, reliability, and resource efficiency while providing visibility into progress and handling inevitable failures gracefully.\n\nThe core challenge is managing the inherent unpredictability of LLM API calls. Unlike traditional batch processing where each task has predictable execution time and failure modes, LLM evaluation involves network requests with variable latency, rate limits that change dynamically, and API responses that may be malformed or incomplete. The evaluation runner must handle these uncertainties while maintaining high throughput and providing reliable progress estimates.\n\n![Evaluation Execution Flow](./diagrams/evaluation-flow.svg)\n\nThe evaluation runner operates on a four-layer architecture: the execution engine manages batch processing and concurrency, the caching system eliminates redundant API calls, the checkpoint system ensures crash recovery, and the progress tracking system provides real-time visibility. Each layer has distinct responsibilities but must coordinate closely to achieve optimal performance.\n\n### Execution Engine\n\nThe execution engine is the heart of the evaluation runner, responsible for orchestrating parallel evaluation across potentially thousands of test cases while respecting API rate limits and resource constraints. Think of it as an air traffic control system - it needs to coordinate many concurrent operations safely while maximizing overall throughput.\n\nThe fundamental challenge is balancing concurrency for speed against stability and rate limiting. Too much concurrency overwhelms APIs and causes cascade failures. Too little concurrency leaves performance on the table. The execution engine dynamically adjusts concurrency based on observed API response times and error rates.\n\n> **Decision: Adaptive Batch Processing Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Large evaluation datasets (10K+ test cases) require parallel processing for reasonable completion times, but LLM APIs have complex rate limiting and reliability characteristics\n> - **Options Considered**: Fixed batch sizes, dynamic batch sizing based on API latency, per-provider adaptive concurrency\n> - **Decision**: Implement adaptive batch processing with per-provider concurrency control and exponential backoff\n> - **Rationale**: Fixed approaches fail under varying API conditions. Adaptive sizing allows the system to automatically optimize for current API performance while preventing overload\n> - **Consequences**: Enables high throughput under good conditions while maintaining stability during API degradation, but requires more complex monitoring and tuning logic\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Key Interfaces | Error Handling |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|\n| `BatchProcessor` | Divides test cases into optimally-sized batches | `process_batch(items, processor_func)` | Retries failed batches with exponential backoff |\n| `ConcurrencyManager` | Controls parallel evaluation threads per API provider | `acquire_slot(provider)`, `release_slot(provider)` | Blocks new requests when provider error rate exceeds threshold |\n| `RateLimiter` | Enforces API rate limits to prevent rejection | `acquire()`, `get_wait_time()` | Implements token bucket algorithm with provider-specific limits |\n| `ProviderRouter` | Routes evaluation requests to appropriate LLM providers | `route_request(test_case)`, `get_healthy_providers()` | Fails over to backup providers when primary is unavailable |\n\nThe execution engine processes evaluations in three phases: preparation, execution, and aggregation. During preparation, it analyzes the dataset to determine optimal batching strategy based on test case complexity and estimated execution time. The execution phase processes batches in parallel while continuously monitoring API health and adjusting concurrency. The aggregation phase combines results from all batches and computes final statistics.\n\n**Batch Size Optimization Algorithm:**\n\n1. The system starts with a conservative baseline batch size (typically 10-20 test cases) based on the configured concurrency limits\n2. It measures the actual processing time for each completed batch, including API latency, metric computation, and result serialization\n3. For each LLM provider, it maintains a rolling average of successful batch completion times over the last 50 batches\n4. If the average completion time is below the target threshold (e.g., 30 seconds), the system increases batch size by 25%\n5. If completion times exceed the threshold or error rates rise above 5%, batch size is reduced by 50%\n6. The system maintains separate batch size settings for each provider since their performance characteristics differ significantly\n7. Batch sizes are bounded between a minimum of 5 (to handle degraded conditions) and maximum of 100 (to prevent excessive memory usage)\n\nThe concurrency manager implements a sophisticated slot-based system where each LLM provider has a dedicated pool of execution slots. This prevents one slow provider from blocking evaluation progress with other providers. The slot allocation is dynamic - providers with better performance characteristics receive more slots during peak processing.\n\n> The critical insight is that batch processing for LLM evaluation must be adaptive rather than static. API performance varies dramatically based on time of day, model load, and provider infrastructure changes. A system optimized for peak performance will crash during degraded conditions, while one optimized for reliability will be unnecessarily slow during good conditions.\n\n**Provider Health Monitoring:**\n\nThe execution engine continuously monitors each LLM provider's health using multiple metrics. Response latency is tracked using exponential moving averages with recent responses weighted more heavily. Error rates are computed over sliding windows to detect both sudden failures and gradual degradation. The system maintains separate health scores for different types of errors - transient network issues are treated differently from authentication failures or rate limit rejections.\n\n| Health Metric | Measurement Window | Healthy Threshold | Degraded Threshold | Recovery Criteria |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Response Latency | 50 requests | < 5 seconds | > 15 seconds | 20 consecutive requests < 8 seconds |\n| Error Rate | 100 requests | < 2% | > 10% | Error rate < 1% for 5 minutes |\n| Rate Limit Hits | 10 minutes | < 1 per minute | > 5 per minute | No rate limits for 15 minutes |\n| Timeout Rate | 50 requests | < 5% | > 20% | Timeout rate < 3% for 10 minutes |\n\nWhen a provider enters degraded state, the execution engine reduces its concurrency allocation and begins routing new requests to healthy providers. If all providers are degraded, the system enters backoff mode where it processes requests sequentially with increasing delays between attempts.\n\n### Result Caching System\n\nThe result caching system eliminates redundant API calls by storing LLM responses keyed by prompt content and provider configuration. Think of it as a sophisticated memoization layer - it remembers previous computations so identical requests can be answered instantly without expensive API calls.\n\nThe challenge with caching LLM responses is determining when two prompts are \"identical\" enough to return cached results. Simple string equality is too restrictive since minor formatting differences shouldn't invalidate the cache. However, semantic equivalence is too expensive to compute at query time. The caching system uses a hybrid approach with content-based hashing and configurable normalization rules.\n\n> **Decision: Content-Addressable Cache with Layered Keys**\n> - **Context**: LLM API calls are expensive (time and cost) and many evaluation runs contain duplicate or near-duplicate test cases\n> - **Options Considered**: Simple prompt hash, semantic similarity clustering, multi-level cache hierarchy\n> - **Decision**: Content-addressable storage using normalized prompt hash as primary key with provider config hash as secondary key\n> - **Rationale**: Provides exact match caching with predictable performance while allowing cache hits across different evaluation runs\n> - **Consequences**: Eliminates redundant API calls for identical prompts but misses opportunities for semantic similarity caching\n\n| Cache Component | Purpose | Key Structure | Storage Backend | TTL Policy |\n|-----------------|---------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| `PromptCache` | Stores LLM responses by prompt content | `sha256(normalized_prompt + provider_config)` | SQLite with WAL mode | 30 days for successful responses |\n| `EmbeddingCache` | Caches embeddings for semantic similarity metrics | `sha256(text + embedding_model)` | HDF5 files with compression | 90 days (embeddings more stable) |\n| `MetricCache` | Caches computed metric results | `sha256(model_response + expected_output + metric_config)` | Memory-mapped files | Session-only (metrics change frequently) |\n\nThe prompt normalization process is configurable but typically includes whitespace normalization, consistent line ending conversion, and removal of non-semantic formatting. The normalization must be deterministic and reversible to ensure cache consistency across different execution environments.\n\n**Cache Key Generation Algorithm:**\n\n1. The system extracts the core prompt content from the `TestCase`, excluding metadata fields like `case_id` and `tags` that don't affect the LLM response\n2. It applies configured normalization rules: strip leading/trailing whitespace, normalize line endings to `\\n`, collapse multiple consecutive spaces to single spaces\n3. The provider configuration is serialized to a canonical JSON representation with keys sorted alphabetically\n4. A composite string is formed by concatenating normalized prompt, provider config JSON, and a cache version identifier\n5. The final cache key is computed as `sha256(composite_string)` and encoded as a hex string for storage\n6. Secondary keys are generated for provider-specific optimizations and cache invalidation patterns\n\nThe caching system implements a write-through policy where responses are stored immediately after successful API calls. This ensures cache consistency even if the evaluation process crashes partway through. Cache hits are validated by checking response metadata for completeness and comparing timestamps against configured TTL policies.\n\n**Cache Invalidation Strategy:**\n\nCache invalidation is triggered by several events: provider configuration changes, cache version updates, and explicit invalidation requests. The system uses a tombstone approach where invalidated entries are marked as deleted rather than immediately removed, allowing for cache statistics and debugging.\n\n| Invalidation Trigger | Scope | Implementation | Recovery Time |\n|---------------------|-------|----------------|---------------|\n| Provider Config Change | All entries for affected provider | Mark with tombstone, lazy cleanup | Immediate for new requests |\n| Cache Version Update | Global cache invalidation | Rename cache directory, create fresh | Next evaluation run startup |\n| Explicit Request | User-specified patterns | Pattern matching on cache keys | Immediate |\n| TTL Expiration | Individual entries based on age | Background cleanup process | Continuous |\n\nThe cache provides detailed statistics including hit rates, storage utilization, and performance impact. These metrics help optimize cache policies and troubleshoot evaluation performance issues.\n\n### Checkpoint and Recovery\n\nThe checkpoint and recovery system ensures that large evaluation runs can survive crashes, API outages, and other interruptions without losing progress. Think of it as a database transaction log - it records the system's state at regular intervals so recovery can resume from the last known good checkpoint rather than starting over.\n\nThe fundamental challenge is balancing checkpoint frequency against performance overhead. Frequent checkpoints minimize lost work but slow down overall execution. Infrequent checkpoints reduce overhead but risk losing significant progress. The system uses adaptive checkpointing that increases frequency during unstable conditions and reduces it during smooth operation.\n\n> **Decision: Hierarchical Checkpointing with Incremental Updates**\n> - **Context**: Large evaluation runs can take hours to complete, and various failures (API outages, crashes, network issues) can interrupt progress\n> - **Options Considered**: Full state snapshots at fixed intervals, incremental checkpoints with transaction logs, distributed checkpointing across workers\n> - **Decision**: Hierarchical checkpointing with fast incremental updates and periodic full snapshots\n> - **Rationale**: Combines fast recovery (incremental) with guaranteed consistency (full snapshots) while minimizing I/O overhead during normal operation\n> - **Consequences**: Enables sub-minute recovery times with minimal performance impact, but requires more complex checkpoint management logic\n\n| Checkpoint Type | Frequency | Content | Storage Size | Recovery Time |\n|-----------------|-----------|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| Incremental | Every 10 completed evaluations | Result deltas and progress counters | < 1MB typically | < 10 seconds |\n| Batch Complete | End of each batch | Full batch results and updated statistics | 5-50MB per batch | 30-60 seconds |\n| Full Snapshot | Every 500 evaluations or 30 minutes | Complete evaluation state | 50-500MB | 2-5 minutes |\n| Emergency | Before shutdown or on error | Current progress with error context | Variable | < 5 seconds |\n\nThe checkpoint system maintains a write-ahead log (WAL) of all evaluation state changes. Each entry in the WAL includes a sequence number, timestamp, operation type, and the affected data. This allows the recovery process to replay operations in the correct order and detect any inconsistencies.\n\n**Checkpoint State Management:**\n\nThe checkpointing system tracks multiple categories of state that must be preserved across crashes. Evaluation progress includes completed test cases, pending batches, and provider health metrics. Configuration state includes dataset version, metric configurations, and runtime parameters. Error state includes failed test cases, retry counts, and error classifications.\n\n1. Before starting any evaluation batch, the system writes a BATCH_START record to the WAL with batch ID and test case IDs\n2. As individual test cases complete, EVALUATION_COMPLETE records are written with results and timing information\n3. When a full batch completes successfully, a BATCH_COMPLETE record summarizes the batch results and updates overall progress\n4. Every 500 completed evaluations, a FULL_SNAPSHOT record captures the complete evaluation state\n5. If an error occurs, an ERROR_RECORD captures the failure context and marks affected test cases for retry\n6. The WAL is fsynced to disk after each write to ensure durability even during hard crashes\n7. Old WAL entries are pruned after successful full snapshots to prevent unbounded growth\n\nThe recovery process scans the WAL from the most recent full snapshot forward, replaying operations to reconstruct the evaluation state. It validates each operation for consistency and handles gaps or corruption by falling back to the previous consistent state.\n\n**Recovery Process Algorithm:**\n\nRecovery begins by scanning the checkpoint directory for the most recent full snapshot and corresponding WAL files. The system validates the snapshot integrity using stored checksums and begins WAL replay from the snapshot's sequence number.\n\n| Recovery Phase | Actions Taken | Validation Checks | Fallback Strategy |\n|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Snapshot Load | Deserialize evaluation state from snapshot file | Checksum validation, schema version compatibility | Try previous snapshot if current is corrupted |\n| WAL Replay | Apply operations from WAL in sequence order | Sequence number gaps, operation consistency | Stop at first inconsistency, use partial recovery |\n| State Validation | Verify recovered state matches expected invariants | Progress counters, result consistency, provider health | Reset inconsistent components to safe defaults |\n| Resume Preparation | Identify incomplete batches and failed test cases | Check for pending operations, validate retry counts | Mark uncertain test cases for re-evaluation |\n\n> The key insight for checkpoint recovery is that partial progress is better than no progress. Even if some test cases must be re-evaluated due to uncertainty, preserving the majority of completed work provides significant time savings for large evaluation runs.\n\n**Crash Recovery Scenarios:**\n\nThe checkpoint system handles various failure modes with different recovery strategies. Hard crashes (power loss, kill -9) rely on WAL replay from the last fsynced checkpoint. Soft crashes (exceptions, API failures) can use in-memory state for faster recovery. Network partitions may leave some results in uncertain states that require re-evaluation.\n\n### Progress Tracking\n\nThe progress tracking system provides real-time visibility into evaluation execution with accurate time estimates and detailed performance metrics. Think of it as a sophisticated dashboard for a complex manufacturing process - it needs to show not just overall progress but also bottlenecks, quality metrics, and predictive estimates for completion.\n\nThe challenge with progress tracking for LLM evaluation is that execution time per test case varies dramatically based on prompt complexity, API provider performance, and metric computation requirements. Simple linear extrapolation gives poor time estimates. The tracking system uses statistical modeling based on historical performance to provide accurate completion estimates.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Modal Progress Estimation with Confidence Intervals**\n> - **Context**: Users need accurate progress estimates for evaluation runs that can take hours, but LLM API response times are highly variable and unpredictable\n> - **Options Considered**: Linear extrapolation from average times, exponential smoothing of recent performance, machine learning models based on test case features\n> - **Decision**: Statistical modeling using test case complexity features and provider performance history with confidence intervals\n> - **Rationale**: Provides more accurate estimates than simple averages while giving users realistic expectations about estimate uncertainty\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more sophisticated tracking infrastructure but delivers significantly better user experience for long-running evaluations\n\n| Progress Dimension | Measurement Approach | Update Frequency | Accuracy Target |\n|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Overall Completion | Count of completed vs total test cases | Real-time | ±2% of actual progress |\n| Time Remaining | Statistical model based on test case complexity | Every 10 completions | ±20% for 80% of estimates |\n| Provider Performance | Response time percentiles and error rates | Per API call | Real-time health indicators |\n| Quality Metrics | Score distributions and failure analysis | Per completed batch | Batch-level accuracy |\n\nThe progress tracking system maintains detailed statistics about evaluation performance that inform both real-time estimates and post-evaluation analysis. It tracks not just completion counts but also error patterns, performance bottlenecks, and quality trends.\n\n**Complexity-Based Time Estimation:**\n\nThe progress tracker analyzes each test case to estimate its execution complexity based on multiple factors. Prompt length affects API response time. Expected output length influences metric computation time. The number of applicable metrics determines total scoring overhead. Provider health status affects retry likelihood.\n\n1. For each test case, extract complexity features: prompt token count, expected output token count, number of applicable metrics, provider assignment\n2. Look up historical performance data for similar test cases using k-nearest neighbors matching on the feature vector\n3. Compute base time estimate as weighted average of similar cases, with more recent examples weighted more heavily\n4. Apply provider-specific adjustments based on current health status and observed latency patterns\n5. Add metric computation overhead based on the configured metric types (exact match is fast, semantic similarity requires embeddings, LLM-as-judge needs additional API calls)\n6. Generate confidence intervals using the variance in historical performance for similar test cases\n7. Update estimates continuously as new performance data becomes available\n\nThe estimation model is retrained periodically using completed evaluation data to improve accuracy. The system maintains separate models for different providers and metric combinations to capture their distinct performance characteristics.\n\n**Real-Time Performance Monitoring:**\n\nProgress tracking goes beyond simple completion counts to provide detailed performance insights. The system monitors throughput trends, identifies bottlenecks, and predicts potential issues before they cause significant delays.\n\n| Performance Metric | Calculation Method | Normal Range | Alert Threshold | Diagnostic Value |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Evaluations/Minute | Rolling average over 5-minute window | Varies by provider | 50% below historical average | Identifies throughput degradation |\n| API Response Time | P95 latency over recent 100 requests | < 10 seconds typical | > 30 seconds | Detects provider performance issues |\n| Error Rate | Failed requests / total requests over 10 minutes | < 2% | > 10% | Indicates API or configuration problems |\n| Queue Depth | Pending evaluations waiting for available slots | < 50 typical | > 200 | Shows concurrency bottlenecks |\n| Cache Hit Rate | Cache hits / total requests over evaluation run | 10-30% typical | < 5% | Indicates caching effectiveness |\n\nThe monitoring system generates automatic alerts when performance metrics deviate significantly from expected ranges. These alerts include suggested diagnostic actions and potential remediation strategies.\n\n**Progress Visualization and Reporting:**\n\nThe progress tracking system generates multiple views of evaluation progress optimized for different audiences. Developers need detailed technical metrics and error diagnostics. Project managers need high-level completion estimates and risk assessments. The system provides both real-time dashboards and periodic summary reports.\n\nReal-time progress display includes overall completion percentage, estimated time remaining with confidence intervals, current throughput rate, and provider health status. A detailed breakdown shows progress by test case category, metric type, and difficulty level. Error summary highlights the most common failure patterns and affected test cases.\n\n> The critical insight for progress tracking is that uncertainty is as important as the estimate itself. Users make better decisions when they understand not just that an evaluation will complete in \"2 hours\" but that the estimate has a 90% confidence interval of \"1.5 to 3 hours\" based on current performance trends.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Linear Extrapolation for Time Estimates**\nSimple progress calculations like `(total_cases - completed_cases) * average_time_per_case` give misleading estimates because LLM API performance varies dramatically. Early test cases may complete quickly while later complex ones take much longer. Use statistical models based on test case complexity and provider performance history instead.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Provider Health in Batch Sizing**\nFixed batch sizes that work well under normal conditions can cause cascade failures when API providers are degraded. Always incorporate provider health metrics into batch size calculations and reduce concurrency when error rates increase.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cache Keys That Miss Obvious Duplicates**\nUsing raw prompt strings as cache keys misses opportunities to cache results for semantically identical prompts with minor formatting differences. Implement prompt normalization that strips non-semantic differences while preserving meaning.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Checkpoint Corruption During Shutdown**\nWriting checkpoints during system shutdown can result in incomplete or corrupted state files that prevent successful recovery. Use atomic write operations (write to temporary file, then rename) and validate checkpoint integrity before cleanup.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Progress Estimates Without Confidence Intervals**\nGiving users precise time estimates like \"2 hours 37 minutes remaining\" without indicating uncertainty leads to frustration when estimates change. Always provide confidence intervals that reflect the inherent uncertainty in LLM evaluation timing.\n\n![Error Handling and Recovery Flow](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Batch Processing | `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` | `asyncio` with `aiohttp` for async API calls |\n| Result Caching | `sqlite3` with pickle serialization | Redis with JSON serialization and TTL |\n| Progress Tracking | Simple console output with `tqdm` | Web dashboard with WebSocket updates |\n| Checkpointing | JSON files with atomic writes | SQLite WAL mode with transactions |\n| Rate Limiting | `time.sleep()` with token bucket | `aiohttp_retry` with exponential backoff |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\nevaluation_framework/\n  evaluation_runner/\n    __init__.py\n    execution_engine.py       ← BatchProcessor, ConcurrencyManager\n    caching.py               ← PromptCache, EmbeddingCache  \n    checkpointing.py         ← CheckpointManager, WALWriter\n    progress_tracking.py     ← ProgressTracker, TimeEstimator\n    rate_limiting.py         ← RateLimiter, ProviderHealthMonitor\n  tests/\n    test_execution_engine.py\n    test_caching.py\n    test_checkpointing.py\n    test_progress_tracking.py\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code (Complete Rate Limiter):**\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import Dict, Optional\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass RateLimitConfig:\n    max_requests: int\n    time_window: int  # seconds\n    burst_limit: int = None  # allow short bursts\n    \nclass RateLimiter:\n    \"\"\"Token bucket rate limiter with per-provider limits.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, provider_configs: Dict[str, RateLimitConfig]):\n        self.provider_configs = provider_configs\n        self._tokens: Dict[str, int] = {}\n        self._last_refill: Dict[str, float] = {}\n        self._request_times: Dict[str, deque] = {}\n        self._lock = threading.Lock()\n        \n        # Initialize token buckets\n        for provider, config in provider_configs.items():\n            self._tokens[provider] = config.max_requests\n            self._last_refill[provider] = time.time()\n            self._request_times[provider] = deque()\n    \n    def acquire(self, provider: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"Acquire a rate limit token.

Think of it as a **data scientist's workbench** built into the evaluation pipeline: it doesn't just show you numbers, but automatically surfaces patterns, detects problems, and generates hypotheses about what's working and what needs attention.\n\nUnlike traditional software testing where pass/fail is binary, LLM evaluation produces rich, multidimensional data that requires sophisticated analysis to be meaningful. A single evaluation run might generate thousands of scored responses across dozens of metrics and categories. The reporting system must synthesize this complexity into clear, actionable insights while preserving the statistical rigor needed for confident decision-making.\n\nThe analysis engine operates on four levels of insight generation: **descriptive statistics** that summarize current performance, **comparative analysis** that detects changes over time, **diagnostic analysis** that identifies failure patterns, and **prescriptive insights** that suggest improvement directions. Each level builds on the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of model performance.\n\n![Reporting and Analysis Pipeline](./diagrams/reporting-pipeline.svg)\n\n> **Decision: Automated Statistical Analysis vs Manual Report Building**\n> - **Context**: Organizations need to process evaluation results at scale without requiring statistical expertise from every user\n> - **Options Considered**: Manual analysis with raw data exports, template-based reporting, fully automated statistical analysis\n> - **Decision**: Fully automated statistical analysis with configurable thresholds and customizable report templates\n> - **Rationale**: Manual analysis doesn't scale and requires statistical expertise. Template-based reporting lacks the sophistication needed for LLM evaluation complexity. Automated analysis ensures consistent methodology while remaining accessible to non-statisticians.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rapid insight generation and reduces time-to-decision. Requires sophisticated statistical algorithms and careful handling of edge cases like small sample sizes.\n\n### Score Aggregation\n\n**Score aggregation** transforms individual metric results into meaningful statistical summaries that reveal performance patterns across different dimensions of the evaluation dataset. Think of it as creating a **multidimensional performance map** — instead of looking at thousands of individual scores, you get clear views of performance by category, difficulty level, and other meaningful groupings.\n\nThe aggregation system must handle the inherent complexity of LLM evaluation data: different metrics have different scales and interpretations, test cases belong to multiple overlapping categories, and statistical significance varies dramatically with sample size. The goal is to provide both high-level summaries for quick decision-making and detailed breakdowns for deep analysis.\n\nThe aggregation engine processes evaluation results through multiple statistical lenses simultaneously. **Overall performance metrics** provide system-wide health indicators, while **category-based breakdowns** reveal strengths and weaknesses in specific areas. **Tag-based analysis** enables fine-grained performance investigation, and **difficulty-stratified results** help understand model capabilities across different challenge levels.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Level Aggregation vs Flat Summarization**\n> - **Context**: Evaluation results need to be interpretable at different levels of granularity for different stakeholders\n> - **Options Considered**: Single overall score, hierarchical breakdown by tags/categories, configurable aggregation dimensions\n> - **Decision**: Multi-level hierarchical aggregation with automatic statistical significance testing\n> - **Rationale**: Different stakeholders need different views — executives want overall trends, engineers need category-specific insights, researchers need tag-level details. Statistical significance testing prevents over-interpretation of small sample results.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides comprehensive insights but requires careful statistical methodology and clear presentation of confidence levels.\n\nThe **statistical foundation** of score aggregation rests on robust descriptive statistics that account for the unique characteristics of evaluation data. Each aggregation level computes central tendency measures (mean, median), variability measures (standard deviation, interquartile range), and distributional characteristics (skewness, outlier detection). The system automatically adjusts statistical methods based on sample size and distribution properties.\n\n| Statistical Measure | Purpose | Calculation Method | Interpretation Guidelines |\n|---------------------|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Mean Score | Central tendency | Arithmetic mean with outlier handling | Primary performance indicator, sensitive to extreme values |\n| Median Score | Robust central tendency | 50th percentile | Less affected by outliers, better for skewed distributions |\n| Standard Deviation | Variability measure | Population standard deviation | Indicates consistency, higher values suggest uneven performance |\n| Confidence Interval | Uncertainty bounds | Bootstrap or t-distribution based | 95% CI for mean score, wider intervals indicate less certainty |\n| Sample Size | Statistical power | Count of valid results | Minimum 30 for reliable statistics, flag small samples |\n| Percentile Breakdown | Distribution shape | 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th percentiles | Reveals distribution characteristics and outlier patterns |\n\n**Category-based aggregation** organizes results according to the natural structure of the evaluation dataset. The system automatically discovers categories from test case tags and metadata, then computes comprehensive statistics for each category. This enables identification of systematic strengths and weaknesses — for example, consistently high performance on factual questions but poor performance on creative tasks.\n\nThe aggregation algorithm handles **overlapping categories** intelligently. Since test cases can belong to multiple categories (e.g., both \"medical\" and \"factual\"), the system avoids double-counting while still providing complete category-specific insights. Each test case contributes to all applicable category statistics, with clear tracking of overlap patterns for transparency.\n\n| Aggregation Level | Scope | Statistical Measures | Use Cases |\n|-------------------|-------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Overall | All test cases | Mean, median, std dev, CI, percentiles | System health monitoring, executive dashboards |\n| Category | Test cases by category tags | Per-category stats, category comparison | Domain-specific performance analysis |\n| Tag | Test cases by individual tags | Tag-specific performance, tag correlation | Fine-grained debugging, feature analysis |\n| Difficulty | Test cases by difficulty level | Performance vs difficulty curve | Capability assessment, training prioritization |\n| Temporal | Results over time windows | Trend analysis, change detection | Performance monitoring, regression tracking |\n\n**Score normalization and weighting** ensures meaningful comparisons across different metrics and categories. The system applies configurable normalization schemes to handle metrics with different scales and distributions. **Equal weighting** treats all metrics as equally important, while **custom weighting** allows domain experts to emphasize critical evaluation dimensions.\n\nThe **temporal aggregation** component tracks performance changes over time by computing rolling statistics and trend indicators. This enables detection of gradual performance changes that might be missed in single-evaluation snapshots. The system maintains statistical baselines and computes change significance to distinguish real trends from random fluctuation.\n\n> **Key Insight: Statistical Significance in Practice**\n> Small sample sizes plague many LLM evaluations, making statistical significance testing crucial. The aggregation system automatically flags results with insufficient statistical power and adjusts confidence intervals accordingly. This prevents over-interpretation of results based on too little data.\n\n**Aggregation Configuration** allows customization of the statistical analysis to match organizational needs and domain requirements. Users can specify minimum sample sizes for reliable statistics, choose statistical methods appropriate for their data characteristics, and configure alerting thresholds for performance changes.\n\n| Configuration Parameter | Purpose | Default Value | Impact |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------------|---------|\n| `min_sample_size` | Minimum cases for reliable statistics | 30 | Controls statistical significance flags |\n| `confidence_level` | Confidence interval width | 0.95 | Affects uncertainty bound calculations |\n| `outlier_threshold` | Standard deviations for outlier detection | 2.5 | Balances outlier sensitivity vs false positives |\n| `normalization_method` | Score normalization approach | \"min_max\" | Determines cross-metric comparison validity |\n| `weighting_scheme` | Metric importance weighting | \"equal\" | Controls relative metric influence |\n| `temporal_window` | Time window for trend analysis | 30 days | Balances trend sensitivity vs noise |\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Score Aggregation\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Simpson's Paradox in Category Aggregation**\nWhen aggregating scores across categories, the overall average can show improvement while all individual categories show decline (or vice versa) due to changing category composition. The aggregation system addresses this by tracking category distribution changes and flagging potential Simpson's paradox cases with detailed composition analysis.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Statistical Significance with Multiple Comparisons**\nWhen computing statistics for dozens of categories simultaneously, random chance will produce apparently significant results even when no real differences exist. The system applies multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni or FDR) when flagging category differences and clearly indicates adjusted vs unadjusted significance levels.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Metric Scale Incompatibility**\nAggregating metrics with fundamentally different scales (0-1 probabilities vs 0-100 BLEU scores) without proper normalization produces meaningless results. The system enforces metric metadata requirements that specify scale and distribution characteristics, then applies appropriate normalization before aggregation.\n\n### Regression Detection\n\n**Regression detection** serves as the evaluation framework's **early warning system**, automatically identifying when model performance has degraded compared to established baselines. Think of it as a **continuous integration system for AI quality** — just as CI catches code regressions before they reach production, this system catches performance regressions before they impact users.\n\nThe challenge of regression detection in LLM evaluation goes far beyond simple metric comparison. Performance can degrade in subtle ways that affect only specific categories or edge cases, changes can be gradual rather than sudden, and statistical noise can mask real degradation or create false alarms. The detection system must distinguish meaningful performance changes from random variation while being sensitive enough to catch important regressions early.\n\n**Baseline management** forms the foundation of effective regression detection. The system maintains multiple types of baselines: **golden baselines** representing the best-ever performance, **production baselines** reflecting current deployed model performance, and **development baselines** tracking progress during model iteration. Each baseline includes not just aggregate scores but complete distributional characteristics needed for rigorous statistical comparison.\n\n> **Decision: Statistical Testing vs Threshold-Based Detection**\n> - **Context**: Need to distinguish real performance changes from random variation in noisy evaluation metrics\n> - **Options Considered**: Simple threshold comparison, statistical hypothesis testing, machine learning anomaly detection\n> - **Decision**: Statistical hypothesis testing with configurable significance levels and effect size thresholds\n> - **Rationale**: Thresholds alone can't account for natural variation in evaluation metrics. Statistical testing provides principled uncertainty quantification. ML anomaly detection adds complexity without clear benefits for this use case.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables confident regression detection with quantified uncertainty. Requires careful statistical methodology and clear interpretation guidelines.\n\nThe **statistical testing framework** applies appropriate hypothesis tests based on data characteristics and comparison requirements. For normally distributed metrics, the system uses **t-tests** or **Welch's t-test** when variances differ. For non-normal distributions, it applies **Mann-Whitney U tests** or other non-parametric alternatives. The framework automatically selects appropriate tests based on data distribution analysis and sample size considerations.\n\n| Comparison Type | Statistical Test | Requirements | Interpretation |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Single metric, normal distribution | Two-sample t-test | n > 30, normality confirmed | p-value < α indicates significant change |\n| Single metric, non-normal | Mann-Whitney U test | No distribution assumptions | Rank-based comparison, robust to outliers |\n| Multiple metrics | Multivariate Hotelling T² | Correlated metrics | Tests for overall performance vector change |\n| Time series | Changepoint detection | Sequential data | Identifies when performance regime shifted |\n| Category-specific | Stratified analysis | Sufficient per-category samples | Detects localized performance changes |\n\n**Effect size estimation** ensures that statistically significant changes are also practically meaningful. A large evaluation dataset might detect tiny performance differences that are statistically significant but practically irrelevant. The system computes **Cohen's d** for metric differences and flags only changes that exceed both statistical significance and practical significance thresholds.\n\nThe **multi-dimensional regression analysis** simultaneously monitors performance across all evaluation dimensions to detect subtle degradations that might be missed by overall metrics. This includes category-specific regressions, tag-level changes, and difficulty-stratified analysis. The system applies multiple comparison corrections to control false discovery rates when testing many dimensions simultaneously.\n\n| Regression Detection Dimension | Analysis Method | Alert Criteria | Action Recommended |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Overall Performance | Global metric comparison | p < 0.05, effect size > 0.2 | Immediate investigation |\n| Category-Specific | Per-category statistical tests | FDR-corrected p < 0.05 | Domain expert review |\n| Tag-Level | Fine-grained tag analysis | Multiple tags affected | Pattern analysis |\n| Difficulty-Stratified | Performance vs difficulty | Slope change > threshold | Capability assessment |\n| Temporal Pattern | Trend analysis | Significant negative slope | Long-term monitoring |\n| Distribution Shape | Kolmogorov-Smirnov test | Distribution shift detected | Data quality investigation |\n\n**Changepoint detection algorithms** identify when performance characteristics fundamentally shift, even if the change is gradual. The system applies **CUSUM (Cumulative Sum)** control charts and **Bayesian changepoint detection** to identify the specific evaluation run when performance regime changed. This enables precise timing of regression onset and correlation with model changes or data updates.\n\nThe **adaptive baseline system** automatically updates baseline expectations as models improve, preventing false regression alerts when the current model significantly outperforms historical baselines. However, it maintains **golden standard baselines** that represent the best-ever performance to detect any retreat from peak capabilities.\n\n> **Key Insight: The Baseline Staleness Problem**\n> Baselines become less relevant over time as evaluation datasets evolve and model capabilities advance. The system addresses this by maintaining multiple baseline types with different update policies: recent baselines for short-term regression detection and stable baselines for long-term capability tracking.\n\n**Regression alert configuration** allows teams to customize detection sensitivity based on their risk tolerance and evaluation methodology. High-stakes production systems might require very sensitive detection with low significance thresholds, while research environments might prefer higher thresholds to reduce alert fatigue.\n\n| Configuration Parameter | Purpose | Typical Values | Trade-off |\n|-------------------------|---------|----------------|-----------|\n| `significance_threshold` | p-value threshold for statistical significance | 0.01, 0.05, 0.10 | Lower = fewer false positives, more missed regressions |\n| `effect_size_threshold` | Minimum effect size for practical significance | 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 | Higher = fewer trivial alerts, might miss subtle issues |\n| `baseline_update_policy` | How frequently baselines are updated | \"manual\", \"monthly\", \"best_ever\" | More frequent = fewer false alerts, less sensitivity |\n| `multiple_comparison_correction` | Method for adjusting p-values | \"bonferroni\", \"fdr\", \"none\" | Stricter = fewer false discoveries, more missed detections |\n| `temporal_sensitivity` | Lookback period for trend detection | 7, 14, 30 days | Longer = smoother trends, slower detection |\n\n### Failure Analysis\n\n**Failure analysis** transforms individual evaluation failures into systematic insights about model limitations and improvement opportunities. Think of it as **forensic analysis for AI systems** — instead of just knowing that some test cases failed, you understand the underlying patterns, root causes, and specific areas where the model struggles.\n\nThe challenge lies in the sheer volume and diversity of failure modes in LLM evaluation. A single evaluation run might produce hundreds of incorrect responses across dozens of categories and failure types. Manual analysis of this scale is impractical, yet automated analysis must preserve the nuanced understanding that human experts bring to failure interpretation.\n\nThe **failure clustering algorithm** groups similar failures to reveal systematic patterns rather than treating each failure as an isolated incident. The system applies **semantic clustering** using embedding representations of failed responses, **error type classification** based on rubric violations, and **root cause analysis** that traces failures back to likely model limitations.\n\n> **Decision: Semantic Clustering vs Rule-Based Classification**\n> - **Context**: Need to group diverse failure modes into meaningful categories for analysis\n> - **Options Considered**: Manual categorization, rule-based error classification, semantic similarity clustering\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach combining semantic clustering with rule-based classification and human validation\n> - **Rationale**: Pure rule-based systems miss novel failure modes. Pure clustering produces clusters that aren't interpretable. Hybrid approach provides both comprehensiveness and interpretability.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables discovery of unexpected failure patterns while maintaining interpretable categories. Requires more sophisticated implementation and occasional human calibration.\n\n**Semantic failure clustering** uses embedding representations to group failures with similar semantic characteristics, even when surface-level responses differ significantly. For example, all instances where the model provides factually incorrect medical information might cluster together regardless of the specific medical domain or question format.\n\nThe clustering algorithm applies **hierarchical clustering** with **cosine similarity** on response embeddings, automatically determining the optimal number of clusters using **silhouette analysis** and **gap statistic** methods. Each cluster receives automatic labeling based on common keywords and patterns in the clustered failures.\n\n| Clustering Dimension | Method | Purpose | Output |\n|---------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Semantic Content | Embedding cosine similarity | Groups failures by meaning | \"Medical misinformation\", \"Math calculation errors\" |\n| Error Type | Rule-based classification | Groups by error category | \"Hallucination\", \"Refusal\", \"Format violation\" |\n| Input Characteristics | Feature-based clustering | Groups by input properties | \"Long prompts\", \"Multi-step reasoning\", \"Domain-specific\" |\n| Response Quality | Quality metric clustering | Groups by degradation type | \"Partial answers\", \"Completely wrong\", \"Right fact, wrong context\" |\n\n**Root cause analysis** attempts to trace failure patterns back to likely model limitations or training data issues. The system analyzes failure clusters in context of input characteristics, expected outputs, and model training information to generate **actionable hypotheses** about improvement strategies.\n\nThe analysis engine maintains a **failure taxonomy** that categorizes common LLM failure modes and maps them to potential remediation approaches. This enables not just failure description but specific recommendations for addressing systematic issues.\n\n| Failure Category | Characteristics | Likely Root Cause | Suggested Remediation |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Factual Hallucination | Confident incorrect facts | Training data gaps or retrieval issues | Knowledge base enhancement, retrieval augmentation |\n| Reasoning Chain Breaks | Correct start, wrong conclusion | Multi-step reasoning limitations | Chain-of-thought training, reasoning verification |\n| Context Confusion | Right info, wrong context | Context window or attention issues | Context management training, prompt engineering |\n| Format Violations | Correct content, wrong format | Instruction following weaknesses | Format-specific fine-tuning, template training |\n| Refusal Over-caution | Unnecessary refusal to answer | Safety training over-generalization | Balanced safety training, edge case examples |\n| Inconsistent Responses | Different answers to same question | Training data inconsistencies | Data deduplication, consistency training |\n\n**Failure impact analysis** quantifies the business or user impact of different failure types to prioritize improvement efforts. The system weighs failure frequency against severity and user-facing consequences to generate **improvement priority rankings**.\n\nThe **comparative failure analysis** compares failure patterns across different model versions, configurations, or time periods to identify trends and measure improvement progress. This enables tracking whether specific interventions successfully addressed targeted failure modes.\n\n| Analysis Dimension | Comparison Method | Insight Type | Application |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Temporal Trends | Failure rate over time | Improving vs degrading categories | Progress tracking |\n| Model Comparison | Side-by-side failure analysis | Relative strengths/weaknesses | Model selection |\n| Configuration Impact | A/B failure pattern comparison | Configuration effectiveness | Hyperparameter optimization |\n| Dataset Evolution | Failure rates on dataset versions | Data quality impact | Dataset improvement |\n\n**Interactive failure exploration** enables human experts to dive deep into specific failure clusters, examine representative examples, and provide human insights that enhance automated analysis. The system presents failure clusters with representative examples, similarity explanations, and hypothesized root causes for expert validation and refinement.\n\n> **Key Insight: The Long Tail of Failure Modes**\n> LLM failures follow a power law distribution — a few failure modes account for most failures, but the long tail of rare failure modes can be critically important for specific use cases. The failure analysis system balances attention between high-frequency failures and potentially high-impact rare failures.\n\n### Report Generation\n\n**Report generation** synthesizes all analysis outputs into comprehensive, actionable documents that serve different stakeholder needs within the organization. Think of it as creating a **personalized data story** for each audience — the same underlying evaluation data becomes an executive summary for leadership, a technical deep-dive for engineers, and a research report for model developers.\n\nThe report generation system must handle multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, interactive dashboards), different levels of technical detail, and various time horizons (single evaluation reports, longitudinal studies, comparative analyses). Most critically, reports must be **actionable** — they should not just present information but guide specific decisions and improvement actions.\n\n**Multi-audience report generation** creates tailored views of the same evaluation results. **Executive summaries** focus on high-level trends, business impact, and strategic recommendations. **Engineering reports** emphasize actionable failure patterns, performance breakdowns, and implementation recommendations. **Research reports** provide detailed statistical analyses, methodological notes, and detailed failure case studies.\n\n> **Decision: Template-Based vs Dynamic Report Generation**\n> - **Context**: Need to generate professional reports quickly while maintaining flexibility for different use cases\n> - **Options Considered**: Fixed report templates, completely custom generation, hybrid template system with dynamic sections\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid template system with customizable sections and dynamic content generation\n> - **Rationale**: Fixed templates are too rigid for diverse use cases. Completely custom generation requires too much manual work. Hybrid approach provides professional formatting with content flexibility.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rapid report generation with professional appearance and customizable content. Requires template maintenance and dynamic content generation logic.\n\nThe **executive report format** distills complex evaluation results into business-focused insights with clear recommendations. These reports emphasize trends over absolute numbers, focus on user impact over technical metrics, and provide specific next steps rather than detailed analysis.\n\n| Executive Report Section | Content Focus | Visualization Type | Key Messages |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Performance Summary | Overall trends, key changes | Trend lines, scorecards | \"Is performance improving?\" |\n| Business Impact | User-facing implications | Impact matrices, priority charts | \"What matters most to users?\" |\n| Risk Assessment | Potential issues, degradation areas | Risk heat maps, alert summaries | \"What should we worry about?\" |\n| Recommendations | Specific next steps | Priority lists, roadmap views | \"What should we do next?\" |\n| Resource Requirements | Investment needed for improvements | Resource allocation charts | \"What will it cost to improve?\" |\n\n**Technical engineering reports** provide the detailed analysis that development teams need for specific improvement actions. These reports emphasize failure patterns, performance bottlenecks, and implementation-specific recommendations with sufficient detail for immediate action.\n\nThe technical report format includes **code-level recommendations** where appropriate, **specific test cases** that illustrate issues, and **quantitative improvement targets** based on observed performance gaps.\n\n| Technical Report Section | Content Focus | Detail Level | Actionability |\n|-------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Performance Analysis | Metric breakdowns, statistical significance | Detailed statistics, confidence intervals | Specific optimization targets |\n| Failure Deep-Dive | Clustered failures, root cause analysis | Individual examples, pattern analysis | Specific fixes to implement |\n| Regression Analysis | Performance changes, degradation areas | Statistical tests, effect sizes | Rollback or improvement decisions |\n| Category Performance | Domain-specific insights | Per-category detailed analysis | Domain-specific improvement strategies |\n| Implementation Guide | Specific next steps, code recommendations | Step-by-step instructions | Immediately actionable tasks |\n\n**Interactive report features** enable stakeholders to explore results beyond the static report content. Web-based reports include **drill-down capabilities** that allow exploration from high-level summaries to individual test case results, **filter controls** for focusing on specific categories or time periods, and **comparison tools** for side-by-side analysis of different evaluation runs.\n\nThe **visualization system** automatically selects appropriate chart types based on data characteristics and stakeholder needs. **Distribution plots** reveal performance patterns, **trend lines** show changes over time, **heat maps** highlight category-specific issues, and **scatter plots** reveal correlations between different metrics.\n\n| Visualization Type | Data Type | Use Case | Interactive Features |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n| Score Distribution | Metric scores | Performance spread analysis | Histogram bins, outlier highlighting |\n| Trend Analysis | Time series | Performance over time | Date range selection, metric filtering |\n| Category Heatmap | Category × Metric | Systematic strength/weakness identification | Category drill-down, metric selection |\n| Regression Scatter | Current vs baseline | Change magnitude visualization | Point details, regression line toggle |\n| Failure Sunburst | Hierarchical failure categories | Failure pattern exploration | Category expansion, sample selection |\n| Comparison Matrix | Multiple evaluation runs | Side-by-side performance comparison | Run selection, metric highlighting |\n\n**Report customization** enables organizations to adapt report formats to their specific needs, branding requirements, and stakeholder preferences. The system provides **template customization** for consistent organizational branding, **section configuration** for including only relevant analyses, and **metric selection** for focusing on business-critical measurements.\n\nThe **automated report scheduling** system generates and distributes reports on configurable schedules, ensuring stakeholders receive timely updates without manual intervention. Reports can be triggered by evaluation completion, scheduled at regular intervals, or generated on-demand for specific analysis needs.\n\n> **Key Insight: The Actionability Principle**\n> Every element in a report should either inform a decision or suggest a specific action. If a chart, table, or analysis doesn't lead to actionable insights, it creates noise rather than value. The report generation system applies this filter ruthlessly to ensure maximum utility.\n\n**Report validation and quality control** ensures that generated reports are accurate, complete, and professionally presented. The system validates data consistency across report sections, checks for sufficient statistical power before making claims, and applies formatting consistency rules for professional appearance.\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Reporting and Analysis\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-Interpretation of Noisy Data**\nLLM evaluation metrics are inherently noisy, and small changes can appear significant when viewed in isolation. The reporting system addresses this by always presenting confidence intervals, requiring minimum sample sizes for strong claims, and prominently displaying uncertainty indicators in all analyses.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Chart Junk and Information Overload**\nComplex evaluation results can lead to cluttered visualizations that obscure rather than illuminate insights. The system applies strict information design principles: every visual element must serve a specific analytical purpose, color is used strategically to highlight important information, and complexity is progressively disclosed through interactive features.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Static Analysis of Dynamic Systems**\nLLM models and evaluation datasets both evolve over time, making point-in-time reports potentially misleading. The system addresses this by incorporating temporal context in all analyses, highlighting when historical comparisons may not be valid due to dataset changes, and providing guidance on when baseline updates are needed.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe reporting and analysis system requires sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities combined with flexible report generation. The implementation balances statistical rigor with practical usability for different stakeholder audiences.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Statistical Analysis | scipy.stats + numpy for basic statistics | statsmodels + scipy for advanced statistical testing |\n| Visualization | matplotlib + seaborn for static charts | plotly + dash for interactive visualizations |\n| Report Generation | jinja2 templates + weasyprint for PDF | full web framework with dynamic content generation |\n| Data Processing | pandas for tabular data analysis | polars for high-performance data processing |\n| Clustering | scikit-learn for basic clustering | custom embedding-based clustering with sentence-transformers |\n\n#### File Structure\n\n```\nreporting/\n  __init__.py\n  aggregation/\n    __init__.py\n    score_aggregator.py      ← Statistical aggregation engine\n    baseline_manager.py      ← Baseline management and comparison\n    significance_testing.py  ← Statistical hypothesis testing\n  regression/\n    __init__.py\n    detector.py             ← Regression detection algorithms\n    changepoint.py          ← Changepoint detection methods\n    alerts.py              ← Alert generation and configuration\n  failure_analysis/\n    __init__.py\n    clustering.py          ← Failure clustering algorithms\n    root_cause.py         ← Root cause analysis engine\n    taxonomy.py           ← Failure classification system\n  report_generation/\n    __init__.py\n    template_engine.py    ← Report template management\n    visualizations.py     ← Chart and graph generation\n    export_formats.py     ← PDF, HTML, dashboard export\n  templates/\n    executive_summary.html ← Executive report template\n    technical_report.html  ← Engineering report template\n    research_analysis.html ← Detailed research template\n  tests/\n    test_aggregation.py\n    test_regression.py\n    test_failure_analysis.py\n    test_report_generation.py\n```\n\n#### Score Aggregation Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nimport pandas as pd\n\n@dataclass\nclass AggregationConfig:\n    \"\"\"Configuration for statistical aggregation analysis.\"\"\"\n    min_sample_size: int = 30\n    confidence_level: float = 0.95\n    outlier_threshold: float = 2.5\n    normalization_method: str = \"min_max\"  #

Verify reports contain expected sections, visualizations render correctly, and PDF export works.\n\n4. **End-to-End Analysis**: Run a complete evaluation followed by full analysis: `python -m evaluation_framework evaluate --dataset sample_data --generate-reports`. Check that insights are actionable and statistically sound.\n\nExpected outcomes:\n- Score aggregation produces statistician-validated results with proper confidence intervals\n- Regression detection catches intentional performance degradation with appropriate p-values\n- Failure analysis clusters reveal interpretable patterns in synthetic failure data\n- Generated reports are professionally formatted and contain actionable recommendations\n- Interactive visualizations work correctly in web browsers\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------|-----|\n| Statistical significance tests always fail | Insufficient sample size or identical distributions | Check sample sizes, plot distributions | Increase data collection or adjust significance thresholds |\n| Failure clustering produces too many tiny clusters | Embedding similarity threshold too strict | Examine silhouette scores, visualize embeddings | Adjust clustering parameters or use different similarity metric |\n| Reports render with missing visualizations | JavaScript/plotting library errors | Check browser console, validate chart data | Fix data serialization or chart configuration |\n| PDF export fails silently | HTML/CSS incompatible with PDF renderer | Test HTML in browser, check weasyprint logs | Simplify CSS, use PDF-compatible styling |\n| Regression detection produces false alarms | Natural variation mistaken for regression | Examine baseline stability, check effect sizes | Increase effect size threshold or stabilize baselines |\n\n\n## Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - This section describes how components from all milestones interact to complete a full evaluation, from dataset loading (Milestone 1) through metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and final reporting (Milestone 4)\n\nThink of the evaluation framework as a sophisticated manufacturing assembly line. Raw materials (test cases) enter at one end, pass through multiple processing stations (validation, execution, scoring, analysis), and emerge as finished products (reports with actionable insights). Each station has specific responsibilities, clear input/output contracts, and well-defined handoff protocols. Just as a factory manager needs to understand the entire flow to optimize production, developers need to understand how evaluation data flows through the system to debug issues and optimize performance.\n\nThe **evaluation sequence** represents the complete journey from dataset loading to report generation, while **component communication** defines the precise contracts between processing stations. Understanding these interactions is crucial for debugging evaluation issues, optimizing performance, and extending the framework with new capabilities.\n\n### Evaluation Sequence\n\nThe evaluation sequence represents the complete orchestrated workflow that transforms raw test cases into actionable insights. Think of this as the \"main program\" that coordinates all framework components to deliver evaluation results.\n\n![System Architecture Overview](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\n![Evaluation Execution Flow](./diagrams/evaluation-flow.svg)\n\n#### Phase 1: Dataset Preparation and Validation\n\nThe evaluation begins with dataset preparation, where the system ensures data quality and consistency before proceeding with expensive LLM API calls. This phase acts as a quality gate to catch issues early.\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Validation | Error Handling |\n|------|-----------|---------|------------|----------------|\n| 1 | `DatasetLoader` | Parse input file format (CSV/JSON/JSONL) | Schema validation against `TestCase` structure | Reject malformed files with detailed error messages |\n| 2 | `DatasetVersionControl` | Create new version or load existing version | Content hash verification for integrity | Recovery from corrupted versions using parent fallback |\n| 3 | `DatasetSplitter` | Apply train/test/validation splits if requested | Stratified sampling validation for balanced splits | Regenerate splits if stratification fails due to insufficient samples |\n| 4 | Dataset Validator | Validate test case completeness and consistency | Check required fields (`prompt`, `expected_output`, `tags`) | Flag incomplete cases for manual review or automatic exclusion |\n\nThe dataset preparation phase establishes the evaluation foundation by ensuring data quality and creating a versioned snapshot. The system performs deep validation at this stage because fixing data issues early prevents cascading failures during expensive evaluation execution.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Dataset validation happens before metric loading to fail fast on data issues. It's much cheaper to reject malformed test cases than to discover formatting problems after running hundreds of LLM API calls.\n\n#### Phase 2: Metric Discovery and Configuration\n\nThe metrics engine discovers applicable evaluation methods and prepares the scoring pipeline. This phase determines what measurements will be taken during evaluation execution.\n\n| Step | Component | Action | Configuration | Dependencies |\n|------|-----------|---------|---------------|--------------|\n| 1 | `MetricRegistry` | Discover registered metrics via plugin scanning | Load metric configurations from evaluation config | Built-in metrics (exact match, BLEU, semantic similarity) |\n| 2 | Metric Validators | Check metric applicability against test cases | Validate that each metric can process the dataset schema | LLM provider APIs for LLM-as-judge metrics |\n| 3 | `TextPreprocessor` | Initialize preprocessing pipelines per metric | Configure normalization rules (whitespace, case, punctuation) | No external dependencies |\n| 4 | `EmbeddingProvider` | Initialize embedding models for semantic metrics | Load embedding models and warm up the cache | Embedding model files (sentence-transformers) |\n\nThe metric configuration phase creates the evaluation measurement apparatus. The system validates that all requested metrics can actually process the dataset schema and that required dependencies (LLM APIs, embedding models) are available before beginning expensive evaluation execution.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Metric Applicability Checking**\n> **Decision: Pre-flight Metric Validation**\n> - **Context**: Some metrics only apply to specific test case types (e.g., code generation metrics need code outputs)\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Skip incompatible metrics silently during execution\n>   - Validate applicability during metric registration\n>   - Check applicability before evaluation execution starts\n> - **Decision**: Check applicability before evaluation execution starts\n> - **Rationale**: Failing fast prevents wasted computation and gives users clear feedback about misconfigured evaluations\n> - **Consequences**: Enables early error reporting but requires metrics to declare their applicability requirements\n\n#### Phase 3: Evaluation Execution and Result Collection\n\nThe core evaluation phase processes test cases through parallel execution pipelines, collecting model responses and computing scores. This is the most resource-intensive phase involving LLM API calls and metric computations.\n\nThe `BatchProcessor` orchestrates parallel execution while respecting rate limits and resource constraints:\n\n1. The batch processor reads test cases from the prepared dataset and organizes them into execution batches based on the configured `max_concurrent_evaluations` limit\n2. For each batch, the system generates cache keys based on the prompt content and LLM provider configuration to check the `PromptCache` for existing responses\n3. Cache misses trigger LLM API calls through the configured provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local inference), with the `RateLimiter` enforcing request frequency limits\n4. The system stores successful LLM responses in the prompt cache with configurable TTL values to avoid redundant API calls in future evaluations\n5. Each model response flows through the metrics pipeline, where applicable metrics compute scores and generate `MetricResult` objects with detailed metadata\n6. The `CheckpointManager` periodically writes evaluation progress to the write-ahead log, enabling recovery from crashes or API failures\n7. The `ProgressTracker` updates completion statistics and provides real-time ETA estimates based on historical processing rates\n\n| Execution Stage | Input | Processing | Output | Checkpointing |\n|-----------------|-------|------------|--------|---------------|\n| Batch Formation | `List[TestCase]` | Group by batch size and provider | `List[Batch]` | Initial batch plan |\n| LLM Invocation | `TestCase` + provider config | API call with caching and rate limiting | Model response string | After each batch |\n| Metric Computation | Model response + expected output | Parallel metric evaluation | `Dict[str, MetricResult]` | After metric completion |\n| Result Aggregation | Individual metric results | Compute overall scores and metadata | `EvaluationResult` | After each test case |\n\nThe evaluation execution phase implements sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms. The `CheckpointManager` maintains a write-ahead log that records evaluation intentions before executing them, enabling precise recovery after crashes.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Checkpointing happens after metric computation rather than after LLM API calls because metric computation is deterministic and cheap to recompute, while LLM responses are expensive and non-deterministic.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Execution Phase**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Rate Limit Cascade Failures**\nWhen one LLM provider hits rate limits, naive implementations often retry immediately, causing more rate limit violations and eventually exhausting all providers. This creates a cascade failure where the entire evaluation stops making progress.\n\n**How to Avoid**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter and provider health monitoring. The `RateLimiter` should track per-provider error rates and automatically reduce request frequency when rate limits are detected. The system should also distribute load across multiple providers when available.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Exhaustion with Large Datasets**\nLoading entire evaluation results into memory causes out-of-memory errors with large datasets. This is especially problematic when evaluation results contain large text fields or extensive metadata.\n\n**How to Avoid**: Stream results to disk during evaluation and maintain only working set in memory. The `CheckpointManager` should write completed results to disk immediately and provide iterator interfaces for downstream processing.\n\n#### Phase 4: Statistical Analysis and Insight Generation\n\nThe analysis phase transforms raw evaluation results into statistical insights and actionable recommendations. This phase implements the sophisticated analytics that differentiate the evaluation framework from simple scoring systems.\n\nThe analysis pipeline processes evaluation results through multiple analytical stages:\n\n1. **Score Aggregation**: The `ScoreAggregator` computes comprehensive statistical summaries including means, medians, confidence intervals, and percentile distributions across different groupings (overall, per-tag, per-difficulty)\n2. **Regression Detection**: The `RegressionDetector` compares current results against stored baselines using statistical significance testing and effect size calculations to identify performance degradation\n3. **Failure Analysis**: The `FailureAnalyzer` clusters similar failure patterns using semantic similarity and identifies root cause hypotheses for systematic errors\n4. **Trend Analysis**: The system analyzes performance trends over time when historical evaluation data is available, detecting changepoints where model behavior fundamentally shifted\n\n| Analysis Component | Input Data | Statistical Methods | Output Insights | Confidence Measures |\n|--------------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| `ScoreAggregator` | `List[EvaluationResult]` | Mean, median, std dev, percentiles | `AggregationResult` per category | Confidence intervals, sample sizes |\n| `RegressionDetector` | Current + baseline results | T-tests, effect size (Cohen's d) | `List[RegressionAlert]` | P-values, statistical power |\n| `FailureAnalyzer` | Failed evaluation results | K-means clustering on embeddings | `List[FailureCluster]` | Cluster coherence scores |\n| Trend Analyzer | Historical evaluation runs | Changepoint detection, regression | Trend summaries and forecasts | R-squared, prediction intervals |\n\nThe statistical analysis phase implements rigorous statistical methods to provide reliable insights. The system addresses multiple comparison problems by applying Bonferroni correction when testing many hypotheses simultaneously, and it reports confidence intervals alongside point estimates to communicate uncertainty.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Baseline Management Strategy**\n> **Decision: Automatic Baseline Updates with Human Approval**\n> - **Context**: Baselines need to evolve as models improve, but automatic updates could mask regressions\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Manual baseline updates only\n>   - Automatic baseline updates after N successful runs\n>   - Automatic updates with human approval workflows\n> - **Decision**: Automatic updates with human approval workflows\n> - **Rationale**: Balances baseline freshness with regression detection reliability, prevents baseline drift\n> - **Consequences**: Requires approval infrastructure but provides best balance of automation and safety\n\n#### Phase 5: Report Generation and Export\n\nThe final phase transforms analytical insights into consumable reports tailored for different audiences. The reporting system generates both executive summaries for stakeholders and detailed technical reports for engineers.\n\nThe `ReportGenerator` orchestrates multi-format report creation:\n\n1. **Executive Report Generation**: Creates business-focused summaries emphasizing overall performance trends, regression alerts, and high-level recommendations without technical implementation details\n2. **Technical Report Generation**: Produces engineering-focused analysis with detailed metric breakdowns, failure cluster analysis, statistical test results, and specific improvement recommendations\n3. **Interactive Visualization**: Generates web-based dashboards with drill-down capabilities, allowing users to explore results by filtering tags, difficulty levels, and time ranges\n4. **Export Processing**: Converts HTML reports to PDF format for offline sharing and archival, maintaining formatting and embedded visualizations\n\n| Report Type | Target Audience | Key Content | Format Options | Update Frequency |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Executive Summary | Business stakeholders | Trends, alerts, ROI impact | PDF, HTML email | Weekly/monthly |\n| Technical Report | Engineers, researchers | Detailed metrics, failure analysis | Interactive HTML, PDF | Per evaluation run |\n| Comparison Report | All audiences | Before/after analysis, A/B testing | Side-by-side HTML, PDF | On-demand |\n| Trend Dashboard | Product managers | Historical trends, forecasting | Interactive web dashboard | Real-time |\n\nThe reporting phase implements sophisticated visualization generation using statistical graphics best practices. Charts include error bars for uncertainty, use colorblind-friendly palettes, and provide alternative text descriptions for accessibility.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Reports are generated from the same analytical data but with different narrative structures and visual emphasis. Executive reports emphasize business impact and trends, while technical reports focus on actionable engineering improvements.\n\n### Component Communication\n\nThe component communication layer defines precise contracts and message formats that enable reliable interaction between framework subsystems. Think of this as the \"API specification\" that each component must implement to participate in the evaluation workflow.\n\n#### Inter-Component Message Formats\n\nComponents communicate through well-defined message structures that enable loose coupling and testability. Each message type includes both data payload and metadata for debugging and auditing.\n\n| Message Type | Sender | Receiver | Payload Schema | Acknowledgment Required |\n|--------------|--------|----------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| `DatasetLoadRequest` | Evaluation Coordinator | Dataset Manager | `{dataset_path: str, format: str, validation_level: str}` | Yes - with validation results |\n| `DatasetLoadResponse` | Dataset Manager | Evaluation Coordinator | `{dataset: Dataset, validation_errors: List[str], content_hash: str}` | No |\n| `MetricConfigRequest` | Evaluation Coordinator | Metrics Engine | `{metric_names: List[str], test_case_schema: Dict}` | Yes - with applicability check |\n| `MetricConfigResponse` | Metrics Engine | Evaluation Coordinator | `{applicable_metrics: List[str], configuration_errors: List[str]}` | No |\n| `EvaluationBatch` | Evaluation Coordinator | Batch Processor | `{test_cases: List[TestCase], provider_config: LLMProviderConfig, metrics: List[str]}` | Yes - after completion |\n| `BatchResults` | Batch Processor | Evaluation Coordinator | `{results: List[EvaluationResult], batch_stats: BatchStats, errors: List[str]}` | No |\n| `AnalysisRequest` | Evaluation Coordinator | Analysis Engine | `{evaluation_run: EvaluationRun, baseline_run_id: Optional[str]}` | Yes - with analysis completion |\n| `AnalysisResponse` | Analysis Engine | Evaluation Coordinator | `{aggregation_results: Dict, regression_alerts: List[RegressionAlert], failure_clusters: List[FailureCluster]}` | No |\n\n#### Error Propagation and Recovery Protocols\n\nThe framework implements structured error propagation that preserves context and enables automated recovery. Each component follows consistent error handling patterns that facilitate debugging and system resilience.\n\n**Error Classification and Handling Strategy**\n\n| Error Category | Examples | Recovery Action | Escalation Threshold |\n|----------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Transient API Errors | Rate limits, temporary network failures | Exponential backoff retry with jitter | 3 consecutive failures |\n| Data Validation Errors | Malformed test cases, schema mismatches | Skip invalid cases with detailed logging | 10% of dataset affected |\n| Resource Exhaustion | Out of memory, disk space full | Reduce batch size, trigger garbage collection | Immediate escalation |\n| Configuration Errors | Invalid API keys, missing model files | Fail fast with clear error messages | Immediate escalation |\n| Dependency Failures | External service outages, model loading failures | Failover to alternative providers/models | Service-specific thresholds |\n\nThe error handling system maintains an **error context chain** that tracks the complete failure path from root cause to user-visible symptom. This enables precise debugging and automated error resolution.\n\n```\nError Context Chain Example:\nRoot Cause: OpenAI API rate limit exceeded\n→ LLM Provider Error: HTTP 429 response with retry-after header\n→ Batch Processor Error: Failed to process 5/10 test cases in batch\n→ Evaluation Runner Error: Batch processing interrupted, resuming from checkpoint\n→ User-Visible: Evaluation paused for rate limit cooldown, resuming in 60 seconds\n```\n\n**Component Health Monitoring and Circuit Breakers**\n\nEach major component implements health monitoring that tracks error rates, response times, and resource utilization. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing components.\n\n| Component | Health Metrics | Circuit Breaker Threshold | Recovery Verification |\n|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| LLM Providers | Success rate, response latency, rate limit frequency | 50% error rate over 1 minute | 3 consecutive successful requests |\n| Embedding Provider | Cache hit rate, computation time, model availability | Model loading failures | Successful embedding generation |\n| Database Storage | Query success rate, connection pool health | Connection failures > 50% | Successful read/write operations |\n| Metrics Engine | Computation time, plugin crashes | Plugin crash rate > 10% | Successful metric computation |\n\n**Recovery and Checkpoint Protocols**\n\nThe framework implements comprehensive recovery protocols that ensure evaluation progress is never lost, even during catastrophic failures. The recovery system operates at multiple granularities to optimize restart performance.\n\nThe `CheckpointManager` maintains three levels of recovery state:\n\n1. **Transaction Log (Write-Ahead Log)**: Records every intended operation before execution, enabling precise replay after crashes\n2. **Incremental Checkpoints**: Periodic snapshots of completed work that reduce recovery time by avoiding full replay\n3. **Full State Snapshots**: Complete evaluation state dumps for major recovery points and debugging\n\n| Recovery Scenario | Detection Method | Recovery Action | Data Loss Risk |\n|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Process Crash | Process monitoring, health checks | Resume from latest incremental checkpoint | None - all operations logged |\n| API Provider Outage | Circuit breaker activation | Switch to backup provider or pause evaluation | None - requests cached/queued |\n| Storage Corruption | Content hash validation | Restore from backup, replay transaction log | Minimal - recent transactions only |\n| Memory Exhaustion | Resource monitoring | Reduce batch size, trigger garbage collection | None - checkpoint before OOM |\n| Network Partition | Timeout detection, connectivity checks | Local processing mode, sync after recovery | None - eventual consistency |\n\nThe recovery system prioritizes **evaluation continuity** over performance. When in doubt, the system chooses the safer option that preserves work and enables recovery, even if it means slower execution.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The checkpoint granularity balances recovery speed against storage overhead. Too frequent checkpointing slows normal execution, while too infrequent checkpointing lengthens recovery time. The system uses adaptive checkpointing that increases frequency during unstable periods.\n\n#### Asynchronous Communication Patterns\n\nThe evaluation framework employs asynchronous communication patterns to maximize throughput while maintaining system responsiveness. Components communicate through message queues and event streams rather than synchronous request-response patterns.\n\n**Event-Driven Architecture for Evaluation Progress**\n\n| Event Type | Publisher | Subscribers | Event Data | Processing Guarantees |\n|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------------|\n| `TestCaseCompleted` | Batch Processor | Progress Tracker, Checkpoint Manager | `{case_id: str, results: EvaluationResult, processing_time: float}` | At-least-once delivery |\n| `BatchProcessed` | Batch Processor | Evaluation Coordinator, Analysis Engine | `{batch_id: str, success_count: int, error_count: int, batch_stats: BatchStats}` | Exactly-once delivery |\n| `MetricComputationFailed` | Metrics Engine | Error Handler, Evaluation Coordinator | `{case_id: str, metric_name: str, error: str, retry_count: int}` | At-least-once delivery |\n| `RegressionDetected` | Analysis Engine | Report Generator, Alert Manager | `{alert: RegressionAlert, affected_metrics: List[str], confidence: float}` | Exactly-once delivery |\n| `EvaluationCompleted` | Evaluation Coordinator | Report Generator, Result Store | `{run_id: str, final_results: EvaluationRun, generation_timestamp: datetime}` | Exactly-once delivery |\n\nThe asynchronous communication system implements **backpressure handling** to prevent fast producers from overwhelming slow consumers. When downstream components cannot keep up with evaluation result generation, the system automatically reduces batch sizes and introduces delays.\n\n**Message Ordering and Consistency Guarantees**\n\nThe framework provides different consistency guarantees depending on the criticality of the communication:\n\n- **Strong Consistency**: Dataset versioning operations and baseline updates require strong consistency to prevent conflicting modifications\n- **Eventual Consistency**: Progress tracking and monitoring can tolerate temporary inconsistencies for better performance\n- **Causal Consistency**: Evaluation results must be processed in causal order (test case completion before batch completion before evaluation completion)\n\n| Communication Pattern | Consistency Level | Ordering Requirement | Failure Handling |\n|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Dataset Modification | Strong | Global ordering | Two-phase commit |\n| Evaluation Execution | Causal | Per-test-case ordering | Checkpoint and retry |\n| Progress Reporting | Eventual | No ordering required | Best-effort delivery |\n| Error Notifications | Strong | Timestamp ordering | Guaranteed delivery |\n| Report Generation | Causal | Results before analysis | Transaction boundaries |\n\n#### API Contracts and Interface Specifications\n\nEach component exposes well-defined interfaces that specify preconditions, postconditions, and error conditions. These contracts enable independent component development and comprehensive testing.\n\n**Dataset Manager Interface Contract**\n\n| Method Signature | Preconditions | Postconditions | Error Conditions |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| `load_dataset(path, format, validation_level)` | File exists and is readable | Dataset object with validated test cases | `FileNotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, `FormatError` |\n| `save_dataset_version(dataset, commit_message)` | Dataset contains valid test cases | Version created with unique ID | `DuplicateVersionError`, `StorageError` |\n| `compute_diff(version_a, version_b)` | Both versions exist in storage | VersionDiff object with change details | `VersionNotFoundError`, `ComputationError` |\n| `create_train_test_split(dataset, test_size, stratify_by)` | Dataset has required stratification tags | Tuple of train/test datasets | `InsufficientSamplesError`, `StratificationError` |\n\n**Metrics Engine Interface Contract**\n\n| Method Signature | Preconditions | Postconditions | Error Conditions |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| `compute(metric_name, model_output, expected_output, test_case)` | Metric registered and applicable | MetricResult with score 0.0-1.0 | `MetricNotFoundError`, `ApplicabilityError`, `ComputationError` |\n| `register_metric(metric_instance)` | Metric implements BaseMetric interface | Metric available in registry | `DuplicateMetricError`, `InterfaceError` |\n| `get_applicable_metrics(test_case)` | Test case has required schema fields | List of applicable metric names | No errors (returns empty list if none applicable) |\n| `preprocess_text(text, preprocessing_config)` | Text is valid string, config is valid | Tuple of processed text and applied steps | `PreprocessingError`, `ConfigurationError` |\n\n**Evaluation Runner Interface Contract**\n\n| Method Signature | Preconditions | Postconditions | Error Conditions |\n|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| `run_evaluation(dataset, metrics, llm_config, eval_config)` | All components initialized and healthy | EvaluationRun with complete results | `ConfigurationError`, `ResourceExhaustionError`, `ProviderError` |\n| `resume_evaluation(run_id)` | Checkpoint exists for run_id | EvaluationRun resumed from checkpoint | `CheckpointNotFoundError`, `CorruptionError` |\n| `get_evaluation_status(run_id)` | Run exists in system | Status object with progress details | `RunNotFoundError` |\n| `cancel_evaluation(run_id)` | Run is in progress | Evaluation stopped gracefully | `CancellationError`, `StateError` |\n\n#### Performance Monitoring and Observability\n\nThe framework implements comprehensive observability that enables performance optimization and issue diagnosis. Each component emits structured metrics and logs that provide visibility into system behavior.\n\n**Performance Metrics Collection**\n\n| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Collection Method | Alerting Thresholds |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Throughput | Test cases per minute, API calls per minute, metrics computed per second | Counter increments | < 50% of baseline |\n| Latency | API response time, metric computation time, end-to-end evaluation time | Histogram tracking | P95 > 2x baseline |\n| Error Rates | API failures, metric computation failures, validation errors | Error counters | > 5% for any component |\n| Resource Usage | Memory consumption, CPU utilization, disk I/O | System monitoring | > 80% sustained |\n| Cache Performance | Hit rate, eviction rate, storage utilization | Cache statistics | Hit rate < 70% |\n\nThe observability system provides **distributed tracing** that tracks evaluation requests across component boundaries. Each trace includes timing information, error details, and context that enables performance bottleneck identification.\n\n**Debugging and Diagnostic Information**\n\nThe framework generates rich diagnostic information that facilitates rapid issue resolution:\n\n- **Request Tracing**: Complete trace of each test case evaluation from input through final scoring\n- **Component State Dumps**: Detailed snapshots of component internal state for debugging complex issues\n- **Performance Profiles**: CPU and memory profiles during evaluation execution to identify optimization opportunities\n- **Error Context**: Rich error messages that include the complete failure context and suggested remediation steps\n\n| Diagnostic Tool | Information Provided | Use Cases | Access Method |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Trace Viewer | Request flow across components | Performance debugging, error diagnosis | Web UI dashboard |\n| State Inspector | Component internal state | Configuration debugging, state corruption | Command-line tool |\n| Performance Profiler | CPU/memory hotspots | Optimization planning | Profiling API |\n| Error Analyzer | Error patterns and trends | System health monitoring | Automated reports |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe evaluation framework's interaction patterns require careful coordination between asynchronous components and robust error handling. This implementation guidance provides the essential infrastructure and coordination logic needed to build a reliable evaluation system.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component Communication | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Message Passing | Direct method calls with async/await | Redis pub/sub with message serialization |\n| Error Propagation | Exception chaining with context | Structured error objects with recovery hints |\n| Progress Tracking | Simple counters with periodic logging | Event streaming with real-time dashboards |\n| Checkpointing | JSON file snapshots | SQLite with write-ahead logging |\n| Health Monitoring | Basic logging with error counters | Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nevaluation_framework/\n├── coordination/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── evaluation_coordinator.py     ← Main orchestration logic\n│   ├── message_types.py              ← Message format definitions\n│   ├── error_handling.py             ← Error propagation and recovery\n│   └── health_monitor.py             ← Component health tracking\n├── communication/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── message_queue.py              ← Async message passing\n│   ├── event_bus.py                  ← Event-driven notifications\n│   └── circuit_breaker.py            ← Failure isolation\n├── checkpointing/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── checkpoint_manager.py         ← WAL and recovery\n│   ├── progress_tracker.py           ← Evaluation progress\n│   └── state_serialization.py       ← State persistence\n└── diagnostics/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    ├── trace_collector.py            ← Distributed tracing\n    ├── performance_monitor.py        ← Metrics collection\n    └── error_analyzer.py             ← Error pattern analysis\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n**Message Queue Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport json\nimport logging\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, asdict\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Dict, List, Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n@dataclass\nclass Message:\n    \"\"\"Base message structure for component communication.\"\"\"\n    message_type: str\n    payload: Dict[str, Any]\n    sender: str\n    timestamp: datetime\n    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None\n    retry_count: int = 0\n\nclass AsyncMessageQueue:\n    \"\"\"Simple async message queue for component communication.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, max_queue_size: int = 1000):\n        self._queues: Dict[str, asyncio.Queue] = defaultdict(lambda: asyncio.Queue(max_queue_size))\n        self._subscribers: Dict[str, List[Callable]] = defaultdict(list)\n        self._logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        self._running = False\n    \n    async def publish(self, topic: str, message: Message) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Publish message to topic.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            await self._queues[topic].put(message)\n            self._logger.debug(f\"Published {message.message_type} to {topic}\")\n        except asyncio.QueueFull:\n            self._logger.error(f\"Queue full for topic {topic}, dropping message\")\n            raise\n    \n    def subscribe(self, topic: str, handler: Callable[[Message], None]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Subscribe to messages on topic.\"\"\"\n        self._subscribers[topic].append(handler)\n        self._logger.info(f\"Subscribed to topic {topic}\")\n    \n    async def start(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Start message processing.\"\"\"\n        self._running = True\n        tasks = [\n            asyncio.create_task(self._process_topic(topic))\n            for topic in self._subscribers.keys()\n        ]\n        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n    \n    async def stop(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Stop message processing gracefully.\"\"\"\n        self._running = False\n    \n    async def _process_topic(self, topic: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Process messages for a specific topic.\"\"\"\n        queue = self._queues[topic]\n        handlers = self._subscribers[topic]\n        \n        while self._running:\n            try:\n                message = await asyncio.wait_for(queue.get(), timeout=1.0)\n                for handler in handlers:\n                    try:\n                        await handler(message)\n                    except Exception as e:\n                        self._logger.error(f\"Handler error for {topic}: {e}\")\n                queue.task_done()\n            except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n                continue\n            except Exception as e:\n                self._logger.error(f\"Topic processing error for {topic}: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Optional\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nclass CircuitState(Enum):\n    CLOSED = \"closed\"      #

Just as a hospital must handle everything from minor cuts to multi-organ failures while keeping essential services running, our evaluation framework must gracefully handle diverse failure scenarios—from network hiccups to complete dataset corruption—while maintaining the integrity of ongoing evaluations and preserving partial progress.\n\nThe challenge in LLM evaluation systems is that errors can cascade across multiple domains simultaneously. A single API rate limit can trigger timeout exceptions, which can cause batch processing failures, which can corrupt checkpoint files, which can make evaluation recovery impossible. Unlike traditional software where errors often have local scope, evaluation framework errors tend to propagate through the entire system workflow, requiring sophisticated isolation and recovery mechanisms.\n\nOur comprehensive error handling strategy operates on three levels: **prevention through design** (using circuit breakers, rate limiting, and validation), **graceful degradation** (failing partially while maintaining core functionality), and **recovery mechanisms** (checkpointing, retry logic, and state reconstruction). Each component maintains its own error boundaries while participating in system-wide error coordination through structured message passing and health monitoring.\n\n![Error Handling and Recovery Flow](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\n### Failure Modes\n\nUnderstanding failure modes requires thinking like a detective—we must anticipate not just what can go wrong, but how multiple failures can interact to create cascade effects. Each failure mode has distinct characteristics in terms of **detectability** (how quickly we notice), **scope** (what gets affected), **recoverability** (whether we can fix it automatically), and **data impact** (whether we lose information).\n\n#### Infrastructure Failures\n\nInfrastructure failures represent the foundation layer where everything else depends on external services and system resources. These failures often have the highest blast radius because they affect multiple components simultaneously.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Impact Scope | Recovery Strategy | Data Loss Risk |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| LLM API Rate Limiting | HTTP 429 response codes | Single provider | Exponential backoff + provider failover | None if cached |\n| LLM API Service Outage | Connection timeouts, DNS failures | Provider-wide | Circuit breaker + alternative providers | High without caching |\n| Network Intermittency | Socket timeouts, packet loss | Variable by connection | Retry with jitter + connection pooling | Medium |\n| Disk Space Exhaustion | OS errno ENOSPC | System-wide writes | Cleanup + compression + external storage | Low |\n| Memory Exhaustion | OOM killer, allocation failures | Process-level | Reduce batch sizes + garbage collection | High for in-flight work |\n| Permission Denied | OS errno EACCES | File/directory specific | Permission repair + fallback locations | None |\n\n**LLM API failures** are particularly complex because they exhibit both predictable patterns (quota limits reset daily) and unpredictable behavior (model deployments causing temporary outages). Our `CircuitBreaker` component tracks failure patterns and automatically switches to alternative providers when primary services degrade.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Provider Fallback Strategy**\n> - **Context**: LLM APIs have different availability patterns, rate limits, and performance characteristics\n> - **Options Considered**: Single provider with retry, round-robin across providers, intelligent failover based on health monitoring\n> - **Decision**: Intelligent failover with health monitoring and provider-specific circuit breakers\n> - **Rationale**: Different providers excel in different scenarios (OpenAI for speed, Anthropic for reasoning, local models for privacy), and their outages rarely correlate\n> - **Consequences**: Requires provider capability mapping and consistent response formatting, but dramatically improves evaluation reliability\n\n**Resource exhaustion failures** require predictive detection rather than reactive handling. Our `ResourceMonitor` tracks disk usage, memory consumption, and file descriptor counts, triggering cleanup procedures before hard limits are reached.\n\n#### Data Corruption and Validation Failures\n\nData corruption represents a particularly insidious class of failures because corrupted data often appears valid until it propagates through the system and causes downstream failures. Think of data corruption like a virus—by the time symptoms appear, the infection has often spread to multiple components.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Impact Scope | Recovery Strategy | Prevention Method |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Malformed JSON in Dataset | Schema validation failure | Single dataset load | Skip invalid records + error report | Pre-validation + type checking |\n| Encoding Issues (UTF-8) | Decode exceptions | Text processing pipeline | Fallback encoding detection + normalization | Character set validation |\n| Missing Required Fields | Field access exceptions | Test case processing | Default value substitution + warnings | Comprehensive schema validation |\n| Circular References in Data | Infinite recursion detection | Serialization/deserialization | Reference breaking + linearization | DAG validation during construction |\n| Corrupted Cache Files | Checksum mismatches | Cache-dependent operations | Cache invalidation + rebuilding | Content-addressable storage + checksums |\n| Version Conflicts | Merge conflict detection | Dataset versioning | Manual resolution + conflict markers | Optimistic locking + change detection |\n\nOur `DataValidator` implements a multi-stage validation pipeline that catches corruption early. The first stage performs structural validation (JSON syntax, required fields), the second stage validates semantic constraints (score ranges, reference consistency), and the third stage performs cross-reference validation (foreign key integrity, circular dependency detection).\n\n```\nValidation Pipeline Flow:\n1. Raw data ingestion with format detection\n2. Structural validation against JSON schema\n3. Field-level validation with type coercion\n4. Semantic validation with business rules\n5. Cross-reference validation with dependency checking\n6. Repair attempts for recoverable errors\n7. Error aggregation and reporting\n```\n\n**Schema evolution failures** occur when new versions of the evaluation framework encounter datasets created with older schemas. Our `SchemaUpgrader` maintains migration paths between schema versions, automatically transforming legacy data formats while preserving semantic meaning.\n\n#### Concurrency and State Management Failures\n\nConcurrency failures in evaluation systems are particularly challenging because long-running evaluations involve complex state coordination between multiple asynchronous processes. Unlike web applications where requests are short-lived, evaluation workflows can run for hours or days, creating extended windows for race conditions and state inconsistencies.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Impact Scope | Recovery Strategy | Prevention Method |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Race Conditions in Batch Processing | Inconsistent results, data races | Batch-level | Idempotent operations + retry | Pessimistic locking |\n| Deadlock in Resource Allocation | Timeout detection, dependency cycles | Multi-resource operations | Deadlock detection + resource ordering | Lock hierarchy enforcement |\n| Stale Cache Invalidation | Cache hit/miss ratio anomalies | Cached computations | TTL expiration + version tagging | Cache coherence protocols |\n| Checkpoint File Corruption | Checksum validation failures | Evaluation recovery | Checkpoint rollback + partial replay | Write-ahead logging |\n| Transaction Log Corruption | Sequential read failures | Persistent state | Log repair + state reconstruction | Redundant logging |\n| Lost Updates in Concurrent Writes | Version mismatch detection | Shared state modifications | Optimistic concurrency control | Compare-and-swap operations |\n\nOur `CheckpointManager` implements a sophisticated write-ahead logging system that ensures evaluation state remains consistent even during system failures. Each state modification is logged before being applied, creating a recoverable transaction history.\n\n> **Decision: Write-Ahead Logging for Checkpoints**\n> - **Context**: Long-running evaluations need crash recovery without losing hours of progress\n> - **Options Considered**: Periodic full snapshots, incremental deltas, write-ahead logging with snapshots\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with write-ahead logging and periodic full snapshots\n> - **Rationale**: WAL provides fine-grained recovery capability while snapshots bound recovery time by limiting replay length\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher I/O overhead during normal operation, but dramatically faster recovery times and stronger consistency guarantees\n\n#### Evaluation Logic Failures\n\nEvaluation logic failures represent semantic errors in the evaluation process itself—cases where the system operates correctly from a technical perspective but produces meaningless or misleading results. These failures are often the most dangerous because they can go undetected while corrupting the entire evaluation outcome.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Impact Scope | Recovery Strategy | Prevention Method |\n|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Metric Computation Overflow | NaN/infinity detection | Individual metric results | Fallback to alternative computation | Input range validation |\n| Division by Zero in Statistics | Exception catching | Aggregation computations | Zero-sample handling + warnings | Sample size validation |\n| Embedding Dimensionality Mismatch | Shape validation errors | Semantic similarity metrics | Model compatibility checking | Provider validation |\n| LLM Judge Inconsistency | Score variance analysis | LLM-as-judge evaluations | Multiple judge consensus + calibration | Judge prompt validation |\n| Preprocessing Pipeline Errors | Text corruption detection | Text normalization | Pipeline stage isolation + rollback | Stage-by-stage validation |\n| Custom Metric Plugin Crashes | Exception isolation | Plugin metric computation | Sandboxed execution + fallback scoring | Resource limit enforcement |\n\n**LLM-as-judge inconsistency** is particularly challenging because it represents a fundamental reliability issue with using language models to evaluate language models. Our `JudgeCalibrator` maintains consistency by using golden examples to detect judge drift and automatically recalibrating scoring rubrics.\n\nThe **metric computation pipeline** implements defensive programming techniques where each metric computation is wrapped in error handling that provides sensible fallbacks. For example, if semantic similarity computation fails due to embedding API issues, the system falls back to fuzzy string matching with appropriate confidence scoring.\n\n### Recovery Strategies\n\nRecovery strategies operate like a medical triage system—we must quickly assess the severity of each failure, prioritize response efforts, and apply the most effective treatment while minimizing collateral damage. The key insight is that different failure types require fundamentally different recovery approaches, from immediate retry (for transient network issues) to complete evaluation restart (for corrupted state).\n\n#### Immediate Recovery Patterns\n\nImmediate recovery patterns handle transient failures that are likely to resolve quickly without human intervention. These patterns prioritize speed of recovery over comprehensive diagnosis, making them suitable for infrastructure hiccups and temporary resource constraints.\n\n**Exponential Backoff with Jitter** forms the foundation of our retry logic. When an operation fails, we don't immediately retry—instead, we wait an exponentially increasing duration with random jitter to prevent thundering herd effects. The algorithm adapts the backoff parameters based on failure patterns, learning the optimal retry timing for different types of operations.\n\n| Retry Attempt | Base Wait Time | Jitter Range | Max Wait | Circuit Breaker Check |\n|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------------|\n| 1 | 1 second | ±200ms | 1.2s | Closed → Continue |\n| 2 | 2 seconds | ±400ms | 2.4s | Closed → Continue |\n| 3 | 4 seconds | ±800ms | 4.8s | Half-Open → Test |\n| 4 | 8 seconds | ±1.6s | 9.6s | Open → Fail Fast |\n| 5+ | 16 seconds | ±3.2s | 19.2s | Open → Alternative Provider |\n\nOur `RetryManager` maintains separate retry policies for different operation types. API calls use aggressive retry with circuit breaker integration, while file I/O operations use conservative retry with filesystem health checks. Database operations use intermediate retry with transaction isolation validation.\n\n**Circuit Breaker Integration** prevents retry storms when downstream services are genuinely unavailable. The circuit breaker tracks failure rates over sliding time windows and automatically transitions between closed (normal operation), open (fast-fail mode), and half-open (testing recovery) states.\n\n```\nCircuit Breaker State Transitions:\n1. CLOSED: Normal operation, requests pass through\n2. Failure rate exceeds threshold → transition to OPEN\n3. OPEN: All requests fail immediately, preventing load on struggling service\n4. After timeout period → transition to HALF_OPEN\n5. HALF_OPEN: Single test request allowed through\n6. Test request succeeds → CLOSED, test request fails → OPEN\n```\n\n**Provider Failover** implements intelligent routing across multiple LLM providers based on real-time health monitoring. When the primary provider fails, the system automatically routes requests to healthy alternatives while maintaining response format consistency.\n\n| Provider Status | Routing Decision | Fallback Chain | Quality Impact |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Primary Healthy | Route to primary | N/A | Baseline quality |\n| Primary Degraded | Load balance across healthy | Secondary → Tertiary | Minimal impact |\n| Primary Failed | Route to best alternative | Health-ranked providers | Possible quality variation |\n| All Providers Degraded | Queue requests + batch retry | Local model fallback | Significant impact |\n\n#### Graceful Degradation Strategies\n\nGraceful degradation ensures that partial failures don't bring down the entire evaluation system. Instead of treating any failure as a complete system failure, we identify which functionality can continue operating and which needs to be temporarily disabled.\n\n**Partial Evaluation Continuation** allows evaluations to proceed even when some metrics fail or some test cases encounter errors. The system maintains a detailed error log while computing results for all successful operations, providing maximum value from partially successful runs.\n\nOur `EvaluationCoordinator` implements a sophisticated dependency analysis system that determines which operations can proceed independently. If semantic similarity metrics fail due to embedding API issues, exact match and LLM-as-judge metrics can continue operating normally. The final report clearly indicates which results are complete and which are partial.\n\n| Component Failure | Continuing Operations | Degraded Operations | User Notification |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Embedding API Down | Exact match, LLM-as-judge | Semantic similarity disabled | Warning in report header |\n| Primary LLM Provider Failed | Exact match, semantic similarity | LLM-as-judge using secondary provider | Provider switch notification |\n| Disk Nearly Full | All metrics computation | Caching disabled, reporting limited | Resource constraint warning |\n| Network Intermittent | Cached operations | Real-time API calls queued | Network status indicator |\n\n**Metric Fallback Hierarchies** provide alternative scoring methods when primary metrics fail. For instance, if semantic similarity computation fails, the system can fall back to fuzzy string matching with appropriate confidence adjustments. Each fallback is clearly marked in the results to maintain evaluation transparency.\n\n**Checkpointed Progress Preservation** ensures that even catastrophic failures don't result in complete work loss. The system continuously saves progress checkpoints that allow evaluation resumption from the last successful batch, minimizing re-computation requirements.\n\n> **Decision: Granular Checkpoint Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Long-running evaluations need fine-grained recovery without excessive I/O overhead\n> - **Options Considered**: Checkpoint after every test case, checkpoint after every batch, checkpoint only at major milestones\n> - **Decision**: Adaptive checkpointing based on evaluation progress and system health\n> - **Rationale**: Frequent checkpoints during unstable periods, less frequent during stable operation, balancing recovery granularity with performance overhead\n> - **Consequences**: More complex checkpoint management logic, but optimal balance between recovery capability and system performance\n\n#### State Reconstruction and Repair\n\nState reconstruction handles scenarios where system state has become corrupted or inconsistent, requiring careful analysis and repair procedures. Unlike immediate recovery patterns that assume the system is fundamentally healthy, state reconstruction acknowledges that something has gone fundamentally wrong and needs to be fixed.\n\n**Transaction Log Replay** reconstructs consistent system state from write-ahead logs when checkpoint files become corrupted. The replay process validates each logged operation before applying it, skipping corrupted or inconsistent entries while maintaining referential integrity.\n\nThe replay algorithm operates in several phases:\n\n1. **Log Validation Phase**: Scan the entire transaction log to identify corrupted entries, missing sequences, and consistency violations\n2. **Checkpoint Selection Phase**: Identify the latest valid checkpoint that can serve as a replay starting point\n3. **Incremental Replay Phase**: Apply logged operations in strict chronological order, validating preconditions before each operation\n4. **Consistency Verification Phase**: Verify that the reconstructed state satisfies all system invariants and cross-reference constraints\n5. **Reconciliation Phase**: Handle any remaining inconsistencies through conflict resolution rules or user intervention prompts\n\n**Cache Coherence Restoration** handles scenarios where cached results have become inconsistent with their underlying data sources. Our cache system maintains content-addressable storage where cache keys are derived from input hashes, but cache corruption can still occur due to file system issues or concurrent access problems.\n\n| Cache Inconsistency Type | Detection Method | Repair Strategy | Prevention Update |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Stale Embeddings | Embedding model version mismatch | Batch recomputation + versioning | Model version tracking |\n| Corrupted Response Cache | Checksum validation failure | Entry eviction + API retry | Atomic write operations |\n| Orphaned Cache Entries | Reference counting audit | Garbage collection + compaction | Reference tracking |\n| Cache Size Explosion | Disk usage monitoring | LRU eviction + size limits | Proactive cleanup policies |\n\n**Dataset Version Reconciliation** resolves conflicts when multiple users simultaneously modify evaluation datasets. Our version control system detects conflicts at the test case level and provides structured conflict resolution tools.\n\nWhen merge conflicts occur, the system presents users with a three-way diff view showing the base version, both conflicting modifications, and suggested resolutions. For automated resolution, we implement conflict resolution rules:\n\n- Content conflicts (same test case modified differently) require manual resolution\n- Addition conflicts (same case_id added with different content) prioritize the modification with more comprehensive metadata\n- Tag conflicts (same test case tagged differently) merge tag sets with conflict annotations\n- Metadata conflicts (same test case with different difficulty/category) use most recent timestamp\n\n#### Error Propagation and Isolation\n\nError propagation control prevents single component failures from cascading throughout the entire system. We implement bulkhead patterns that isolate different types of operations while maintaining coordinated error reporting and recovery.\n\n**Component Isolation Boundaries** ensure that failures in one component don't directly affect others. Each major component (Dataset Manager, Metrics Engine, Evaluation Runner, Reporter) operates with its own error handling context and resource limits.\n\nOur `ErrorBoundary` system intercepts exceptions at component boundaries and translates them into structured error messages that other components can understand and respond to appropriately. This prevents the error handling logic of one component from needing deep knowledge about the internal failure modes of other components.\n\n| Component | Isolation Mechanism | Error Translation | Recovery Coordination |\n|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Dataset Manager | Process isolation + file locks | Dataset operation errors → structured messages | Version rollback coordination |\n| Metrics Engine | Thread pools + resource limits | Metric computation errors → score invalidation | Partial result aggregation |\n| Evaluation Runner | Async task isolation + timeouts | Execution errors → batch failure notifications | Checkpoint coordination |\n| Reporter | Memory isolation + temp files | Report generation errors → partial output | Alternative format generation |\n\n**Structured Error Context Propagation** ensures that when errors do cross component boundaries, they carry sufficient context for intelligent handling decisions. Each error includes not just the immediate failure reason, but also the evaluation context, attempted recovery actions, and suggested next steps.\n\nOur `ErrorContext` data structure captures:\n\n- **Failure Classification**: Transient vs. permanent, local vs. systemic, recoverable vs. fatal\n- **Operational Context**: Which evaluation run, which test cases, which metrics, which providers\n- **Environmental Context**: System resources, network conditions, concurrent operations\n- **Recovery History**: What recovery attempts have been made, what worked, what failed\n- **Impact Assessment**: What functionality is affected, what can continue, what must stop\n\nThis rich error context enables sophisticated recovery decision making. For example, if embedding API failures are detected during semantic similarity computation, the error context indicates whether this affects a small subset of test cases (continue with warnings) or the majority of the evaluation (pause and retry with different provider).\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling implementation bridges robust theoretical design with practical engineering realities. Junior developers often struggle with error handling because it requires thinking about all the ways things can go wrong—which requires experience they don't yet have.

Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis Method | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|------------------|-----|\n| Evaluation hangs indefinitely | Deadlock in resource allocation or infinite retry loop | Check thread dumps, examine lock acquisition order, review retry configuration | Implement timeout limits, enforce lock ordering hierarchy, add circuit breaker to retry logic |\n| Partial results lost after crash | Checkpoint frequency too low or WAL not syncing to disk | Check checkpoint timestamps, verify fsync calls in WAL writing | Increase checkpoint frequency during unstable

|\n\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - Testing strategy spans dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting analysis (Milestone 4)\n\nTesting an LLM evaluation framework presents unique challenges compared to traditional software testing. Think of it like quality assurance for a quality assurance system - we need to verify that our system correctly measures the quality of something inherently subjective and probabilistic. Unlike testing a calculator where 2+2 always equals 4, we're testing a system where \"good\" output depends on context, domain expertise, and often human judgment. Our testing strategy must therefore balance mathematical precision with the inherent fuzziness of language evaluation.\n\nThe testing approach follows a **test pyramid architecture** with three distinct layers, each serving different validation purposes. At the foundation, unit tests verify individual components work correctly in isolation - can our exact match metric correctly identify identical strings? In the middle, integration tests verify components work together properly - does our metrics engine correctly orchestrate multiple metrics and aggregate their results? At the apex, end-to-end tests verify the complete evaluation workflow produces reliable, actionable insights for real-world scenarios.\n\nEach milestone introduces specific testing challenges that require specialized approaches. Dataset management testing must verify data integrity across versions and formats. Metrics testing must validate both deterministic scoring (exact match) and probabilistic scoring (semantic similarity, LLM-as-judge). Evaluation runner testing must verify correct behavior under concurrency, failures, and resource constraints. Reporting testing must validate statistical computations and ensure insights are mathematically sound.\n\n### Test Pyramid\n\nThe test pyramid organizes our testing strategy into three layers with different scopes, speeds, and purposes. This structure ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining fast feedback cycles for developers and reliable validation for production deployments.\n\n**Unit Tests** form the pyramid base and focus on individual component correctness. These tests run in milliseconds, use no external dependencies, and verify core business logic through deterministic inputs and outputs. Unit tests answer the question: \"Does this component implement its contract correctly?\" They use mocked dependencies, synthetic data, and focus on edge cases that might be rare in integration scenarios but could cause system failures.\n\n**Integration Tests** form the pyramid middle and focus on component interaction correctness. These tests run in seconds, may use lightweight external dependencies (like embedded databases), and verify that components correctly communicate through their interfaces. Integration tests answer the question: \"Do these components work together correctly?\" They use realistic data flows, test error propagation between components, and verify that the system maintains consistency across component boundaries.\n\n**End-to-End Tests** form the pyramid apex and focus on complete workflow correctness. These tests run in minutes, use production-like environments with real LLM APIs, and verify that the entire system delivers value to users. End-to-end tests answer the question: \"Does the complete system solve the user's problem correctly?\" They use real datasets, actual LLM providers, and validate the full evaluation lifecycle from dataset loading through final report generation.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The pyramid shape reflects both the number of tests at each level and their execution frequency. We need many fast unit tests running continuously, fewer integration tests running on commits, and even fewer end-to-end tests running before releases. This balance provides confidence without creating development friction.\n\n#### Unit Test Organization\n\nUnit tests focus on individual class and method correctness with comprehensive coverage of business logic, edge cases, and error conditions. Each component follows a consistent testing structure that makes tests readable, maintainable, and comprehensive.\n\n**Dataset Management Unit Tests** verify core data structures and operations work correctly in isolation. These tests validate test case creation, dataset operations, version control logic, and data format conversions without touching the file system or external dependencies.\n\n| Test Category | Test Purpose | Example Test Cases |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Test Case Validation | Verify `TestCase` schema compliance | Valid test case creation, missing required fields, invalid field types |\n| Dataset Operations | Verify `Dataset` manipulation methods | Add test case, remove test case, dataset merging, duplicate handling |\n| Version Control Logic | Verify versioning algorithms | Content hash computation, diff generation, merge conflict detection |\n| Data Format Conversion | Verify import/export correctness | CSV to `TestCase` conversion, JSON schema validation, malformed data handling |\n\nThe dataset loader unit tests use synthetic data that covers edge cases rarely seen in real datasets but critical for robustness. For example, testing CSV files with embedded commas, JSON with nested quotes, and malformed Unicode characters. These tests verify the loader's resilience without requiring actual external files.\n\n**Metrics Engine Unit Tests** verify scoring algorithms produce correct results across the full range of inputs. These tests are particularly critical because metric correctness directly impacts evaluation quality, and bugs in scoring logic can invalidate entire evaluation runs.\n\n| Test Category | Test Purpose | Example Test Cases |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Exact Match Logic | Verify string comparison accuracy | Identical strings, whitespace differences, case sensitivity, Unicode normalization |\n| Fuzzy Match Logic | Verify normalization pipeline | Character normalization, punctuation removal, stop word handling, custom patterns |\n| Semantic Similarity | Verify embedding-based scoring | Synonymous phrases, contradictory statements, embedding cache behavior, threshold calibration |\n| LLM-as-Judge | Verify judge prompt generation | Prompt template rendering, response parsing, error handling, consistency controls |\n| Score Aggregation | Verify statistical computations | Mean/median calculation, confidence intervals, outlier detection, weighted averages |\n\nMetrics unit tests use carefully crafted test cases with known expected outputs. For semantic similarity, this includes word pairs with established similarity ratings from linguistic datasets. For LLM-as-judge, this includes mock responses with various score formats to verify parsing robustness.\n\n**Evaluation Runner Unit Tests** verify execution orchestration logic without actually calling LLM APIs or performing expensive operations. These tests focus on batch processing logic, concurrency control, caching behavior, and error handling using mock implementations.\n\n| Test Category | Test Purpose | Example Test Cases |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Batch Processing | Verify batching algorithms | Batch size adaptation, load balancing, completion tracking, partial batch handling |\n| Concurrency Control | Verify thread safety | Rate limiting accuracy, resource pool management, deadlock prevention, fair scheduling |\n| Caching Logic | Verify cache behavior | Cache hit/miss logic, TTL expiration, cache eviction, content-based keying |\n| Progress Tracking | Verify progress calculations | ETA computation, throughput measurement, failure rate tracking, statistical smoothing |\n| Checkpoint/Recovery | Verify state persistence | Incremental checkpointing, WAL integrity, state reconstruction, corruption detection |\n\n**Reporting Unit Tests** verify statistical computations and report generation logic using synthetic evaluation results with known statistical properties. These tests ensure mathematical correctness and validate that insights are statistically sound.\n\n| Test Category | Test Purpose | Example Test Cases |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Statistical Analysis | Verify computation accuracy | Mean/variance calculation, confidence intervals, significance testing, effect size computation |\n| Regression Detection | Verify change detection | Performance degradation detection, statistical significance, false positive rates, baseline management |\n| Failure Analysis | Verify clustering logic | Similarity-based grouping, representative selection, root cause hypotheses, improvement recommendations |\n| Report Generation | Verify output formatting | HTML generation, chart rendering, PDF export, template processing |\n\n#### Integration Test Organization\n\nIntegration tests verify component interactions work correctly by testing realistic data flows through multiple components simultaneously. These tests use lightweight infrastructure (in-memory databases, mock HTTP servers) to simulate external dependencies while maintaining fast execution.\n\n**Cross-Component Data Flow Tests** verify that data structures pass correctly between components and that interface contracts are properly implemented. These tests catch mismatches between what one component produces and what another component expects.\n\n| Integration Scenario | Components Tested | Validation Focus |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Dataset to Metrics | `DatasetLoader` + `MetricRegistry` | Test case schema compatibility, metadata preservation, error propagation |\n| Metrics to Runner | `MetricRegistry` + `BatchProcessor` | Metric configuration, result aggregation, concurrent execution |\n| Runner to Analysis | `BatchProcessor` + `ScoreAggregator` | Result format consistency, statistical input validation, progress tracking |\n| Analysis to Reporting | `ScoreAggregator` + `ReportGenerator` | Statistical output format, visualization data preparation, template compatibility |\n\n**End-to-End Component Chains** test complete workflows through multiple components to verify the system maintains data consistency and error handling across component boundaries. These tests use realistic datasets and configurations while mocking expensive external calls.\n\n**Error Propagation Tests** verify that errors are correctly detected, contextualized, and propagated through the component stack. These tests simulate various failure scenarios and verify that error information is preserved and actionable.\n\n| Error Scenario | Component Chain | Expected Behavior |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Invalid Dataset Format | `DatasetLoader` → `MetricRegistry` | Validation error with specific field information, graceful degradation |\n| Metric Computation Failure | `MetricRegistry` → `BatchProcessor` | Error contextualization with test case ID, partial result handling |\n| API Rate Limiting | `BatchProcessor` → `ProgressTracker` | Backoff behavior, progress preservation, automatic retry |\n| Statistical Computation Error | `ScoreAggregator` → `ReportGenerator` | Insufficient data detection, alternative analysis methods, user guidance |\n\n**Configuration Integration Tests** verify that configuration changes propagate correctly through all components and that invalid configurations are detected early with clear error messages.\n\n#### End-to-End Test Organization\n\nEnd-to-end tests validate complete evaluation workflows using real external dependencies and production-like configurations. These tests run against actual LLM APIs, real datasets, and verify that the system produces valuable insights for practitioners.\n\n**Complete Evaluation Workflows** test the full evaluation lifecycle from dataset loading through final report generation. These tests use representative datasets and verify that all system components work together to produce consistent, actionable results.\n\n| Workflow Scenario | Dataset Type | Evaluation Focus | Success Criteria |\n|-------------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Small Dataset Evaluation | 50 test cases, mixed difficulty | Correctness and completeness | All test cases processed, all metrics computed, statistical summary generated |\n| Large Dataset Evaluation | 1000+ test cases | Performance and reliability | Completion within time limits, resource usage within bounds, accurate progress tracking |\n| Multi-Metric Evaluation | Exact match + semantic similarity + LLM-as-judge | Metric orchestration | All metrics applied appropriately, scores properly aggregated, no metric interference |\n| Regression Detection | Current vs. baseline results | Change detection accuracy | Significant changes detected, false positives minimized, actionable recommendations |\n\n**Production Readiness Tests** verify the system performs correctly under production-like conditions including realistic datasets, actual LLM API latency and failure rates, and resource constraints.\n\n**User Acceptance Tests** verify that the system produces insights that are actually valuable for LLM application developers. These tests use real-world datasets from various domains and verify that evaluation results help identify genuine model strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nEach development milestone includes specific verification criteria that validate both functional correctness and system integration.

Debugging techniques are essential throughout dataset management (Milestone 1), metrics computation (Milestone 2), evaluation execution (Milestone 3), and reporting (Milestone 4)\n\nThink of debugging an LLM evaluation framework like being a detective investigating a crime scene. You have symptoms (the evaluation failed or produced unexpected results), potential suspects (various components that could be malfunctioning), and evidence (logs, cached data, intermediate results). The key is knowing where to look first, what clues to gather, and how to systematically eliminate possibilities until you find the root cause.\n\nThe debugging challenge is particularly complex in evaluation systems because failures can cascade across multiple layers. A dataset loading error might not surface until metric computation, an embedding cache corruption might cause semantic similarity scores to drift silently, and API rate limiting might create intermittent failures that are difficult to reproduce. Understanding these interaction patterns is crucial for effective debugging.\n\n### Common Implementation Bugs\n\nThe most frequent bugs developers encounter when building and using the evaluation framework fall into predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns helps developers quickly identify and fix issues without extensive investigation.\n\n#### Dataset Management Bugs\n\n**Schema Validation Failures**\n\nThe most common dataset management bug involves schema validation failures that aren't immediately obvious. When the `DatasetLoader` attempts to map CSV columns to the `TestCase` schema, subtle mismatches can cause entire datasets to be rejected or partially loaded with corrupted data.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Case sensitivity mismatch | \"prompt\" column not found error | CSV has \"Prompt\" but loader expects \"prompt\" | Add case-insensitive column mapping |\n| Extra whitespace in headers | Random columns marked as missing | CSV headers have trailing spaces | Strip whitespace in column name normalization |\n| Unicode encoding issues | Garbled text in loaded test cases | CSV saved with different encoding than UTF-8 | Detect encoding automatically or force UTF-8 |\n| Missing required fields | Schema validation error after load | Some test cases lack expected_output | Add validation during load with clear error messages |\n| Tag parsing failures | Tags appear as strings instead of lists | JSON tags serialized as strings in CSV | Parse tag columns as JSON arrays with fallback |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Silent Schema Violations**\nMany developers assume that if `load_dataset()` returns successfully, all test cases are valid. However, the loader might skip invalid rows silently or apply default values that mask data quality issues. Always check the returned `Dataset.test_cases` count against the expected number of rows and validate a sample of loaded cases manually.\n\n**Version Control Conflicts**\n\nDataset versioning introduces merge conflicts that can corrupt the version history if not handled properly. The `DatasetVersionControl` system tracks changes using content hashes, but concurrent modifications can create inconsistent states.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Hash collision detection failure | Different datasets with same version ID | Weak hashing algorithm or insufficient content coverage | Use SHA-256 with complete test case serialization |\n| Merge conflict resolution | Lost changes after version merge | Automatic merge overwrites manual edits | Implement three-way merge with conflict markers |\n| Circular version references | Infinite loop during version traversal | Parent-child relationships create cycles | Validate version graph for cycles during creation |\n| Concurrent write corruption | Version metadata inconsistent | Multiple processes writing simultaneously | Use file locking or atomic rename operations |\n| Orphaned version cleanup | Disk space grows without bound | Old versions never garbage collected | Implement reference counting for version cleanup |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Version Drift**\nWhen multiple team members work on the same dataset, their local versions can diverge silently. The framework tracks content hashes, but developers often don't notice that their \"latest\" version differs from others. Always compare version IDs and change summaries before assuming you're working with the same dataset version.\n\n#### Metrics Engine Bugs\n\n**Embedding Cache Corruption**\n\nThe `EmbeddingCache` stores computed embeddings to avoid redundant API calls, but cache corruption can cause semantic similarity scores to become unreliable. This is particularly insidious because the corruption often affects only a subset of embeddings, making the problem appear intermittent.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Stale embedding retrieval | Semantic similarity scores don't match expected values | Cache returns old embeddings after model update | Include model version in cache key |\n| Partial cache corruption | Some similarity scores are obviously wrong (negative, >1.0) | Database corruption affects specific entries | Validate cached embeddings before use |\n| Memory pressure eviction | Embeddings cache hit rate drops unexpectedly | System memory pressure causes cache eviction | Monitor memory usage and implement cache size limits |\n| Concurrent access corruption | Random cache misses despite recent computation | Multiple processes writing to cache simultaneously | Use database transactions or file locking |\n| Text preprocessing inconsistency | Same text produces different embeddings | Text preprocessed differently during cache storage vs retrieval | Store preprocessing metadata with cached embeddings |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Silent Cache Poisoning**\nWhen the embedding model changes (e.g., upgrading from text-embedding-ada-002 to text-embedding-3-small), cached embeddings from the old model remain valid according to the cache logic but are semantically incompatible. This causes semantic similarity scores to drift gradually as cached and fresh embeddings get mixed. Always invalidate the cache when changing embedding models.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge Inconsistency**\n\nThe LLM-as-judge evaluation pattern is notoriously unreliable because language models can produce different scores for identical inputs. This non-determinism makes debugging particularly challenging since the same test might pass or fail on different runs.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Temperature sensitivity | Judge scores vary widely between runs | Non-zero temperature causes random sampling | Set temperature=0.0 for deterministic output |\n| Prompt engineering failures | Judge produces unparseable scores (\"Good\" instead of numbers) | Judge prompt doesn't constrain output format sufficiently | Add explicit format requirements and examples |\n| Context length overflow | Judge truncates long inputs silently | Model response or expected output exceeds context window | Implement chunking or fallback to exact match |\n| Model-specific biases | Judge consistently favors certain response patterns | Different judge models have different scoring tendencies | Calibrate score thresholds per judge model |\n| Parsing edge cases | Score extraction fails on valid judge responses | Regex or JSON parsing doesn't handle all output formats | Use robust parsing with multiple fallback strategies |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Judge Model Drift**\nCloud LLM providers occasionally update their models behind the same API endpoint, causing judge scoring to drift over time even with identical prompts and temperature settings. This breaks evaluation reproducibility. Always log the exact model version used for judging and monitor score distributions for unexpected changes.\n\n#### Evaluation Runner Bugs\n\n**Concurrency and Rate Limiting Issues**\n\nThe `EvaluationRunner` processes test cases in parallel to maximize throughput, but this introduces race conditions and rate limiting complications that can cause evaluations to fail or produce incorrect results.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Rate limit cascade failures | Evaluation fails completely after initial rate limit hit | No exponential backoff, all retries happen simultaneously | Implement jittered exponential backoff with per-provider limits |\n| Cache race conditions | Same prompt evaluated multiple times simultaneously | Multiple workers check cache, find miss, make same API call | Use atomic cache operations or request deduplication |\n| Memory exhaustion | Evaluation slows dramatically or crashes with OOM | Large result sets stored in memory without streaming | Implement result streaming and periodic memory cleanup |\n| Progress tracking corruption | Progress bar shows >100% or goes backwards | Concurrent updates to progress counters without synchronization | Use atomic operations or message passing for progress updates |\n| Checkpoint corruption | Recovery loads partial or inconsistent state | Checkpoint written while evaluation state is changing | Use copy-on-write or stop-the-world checkpointing |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Thundering Herd on Recovery**\nWhen an evaluation resumes from a checkpoint, all pending test cases often start processing simultaneously, overwhelming the LLM API and triggering rate limits immediately. This can make recovery slower than restarting from scratch. Implement gradual ramp-up after recovery, starting with small batch sizes and increasing as the system proves stable.\n\n**Result Caching Edge Cases**\n\nThe `PromptCache` stores LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls, but cache key generation and invalidation logic contains subtle bugs that can cause stale results to be served or cache misses where hits should occur.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Hash collision false positives | Different prompts return identical cached responses | Weak hash function causes different prompts to map to same key | Use cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of full prompt content |\n| Provider config ignored in key | Same prompt with different models/temperatures returns same cached result | Cache key doesn't include all provider configuration parameters | Include full `LLMProviderConfig` in cache key generation |\n| TTL inconsistency | Cache returns stale results after configured expiration | System clock drift or timezone issues affect TTL calculation | Use UTC timestamps and validate system clock synchronization |\n| Cache key encoding issues | Unicode prompts produce inconsistent cache keys | String encoding differences affect hash computation | Normalize all text to UTF-8 before hashing |\n| Large prompt truncation | Cache misses for prompts that should hit | Hash computation truncates very long prompts | Use streaming hash computation for large inputs |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Development vs Production Cache Differences**\nDevelopers often test with small datasets and see excellent cache hit rates, but production evaluations with larger, more diverse datasets experience much lower hit rates. This happens because development datasets often contain duplicate or very similar prompts, while production datasets are more varied. Always test caching performance with production-scale, production-diversity datasets.\n\n#### Reporting and Analysis Bugs\n\n**Statistical Analysis Errors**\n\nThe reporting system performs statistical analysis to detect regressions and generate insights, but statistical computations are prone to edge cases that can produce misleading or invalid results.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Small sample size inflation | Statistical significance detected with tiny effect sizes | Insufficient sample size makes noise appear significant | Enforce minimum sample size requirements before statistical tests |\n| Multiple comparison errors | False positive regression alerts | Testing many metrics simultaneously inflates Type I error rate | Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction for multiple comparisons |\n| Outlier contamination | Mean scores drastically affected by few extreme values | No outlier detection before computing summary statistics | Use robust statistics (median, IQR) or outlier removal |\n| Distribution assumption violations | t-tests applied to non-normal data | Statistical tests assume normality but scores are skewed | Use non-parametric tests or transform data to normality |\n| Missing data handling | Analysis excludes failed test cases without adjustment | Metrics computed only on successful cases bias results upward | Use intent-to-treat analysis or explicitly model failure rates |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Simpson's Paradox in Aggregation**\nWhen aggregating scores across different test case categories, overall performance can appear to improve even when every individual category got worse, or vice versa. This happens when the mix of test case types changes between evaluations. Always report both overall and per-category statistics, and investigate any cases where trends diverge.\n\n**Visualization and Export Failures**\n\nReport generation involves complex data transformations and external dependencies that can fail in hard-to-diagnose ways, often producing partially corrupt outputs that appear valid at first glance.\n\n| Bug Pattern | Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |\n|-------------|---------|------------|-----|\n| Chart rendering failures | Reports contain blank spaces where charts should appear | JavaScript errors in chart library or data format mismatches | Validate chart data schema and handle rendering exceptions |\n| PDF export corruption | Generated PDFs are unreadable or truncated | HTML to PDF conversion fails on complex layouts | Simplify CSS, avoid unsupported features, test with headless browser |\n| Unicode handling in exports | Special characters appear as boxes or question marks | Export pipeline doesn't preserve UTF-8 encoding | Ensure UTF-8 encoding throughout export pipeline |\n| Large dataset memory issues | Report generation fails or takes extremely long | Visualization libraries load entire dataset into memory | Implement data sampling or streaming for large reports |\n| Template variable injection | Report shows raw template syntax instead of values | Template rendering fails but error is silently ignored | Validate template variable binding and handle missing data |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Browser-Specific Rendering Differences**\nHTML reports often render correctly in one browser but break in others due to CSS compatibility issues or JavaScript differences. This is particularly problematic when stakeholders use different browsers than developers. Always test report rendering in multiple browsers and use progressive enhancement for advanced features.\n\n### Debugging Techniques\n\nEffective debugging of the evaluation framework requires systematic approaches tailored to the distributed, asynchronous nature of the system. The following techniques provide structured methodologies for diagnosing and resolving issues across all components.\n\n#### Structured Diagnostic Approach\n\n**Symptom Classification and Triage**\n\nWhen an evaluation fails or produces unexpected results, the first step is classifying the symptom to determine which diagnostic path to follow. Different symptom types require different investigation strategies and have different urgency levels.\n\n| Symptom Category | Examples | Investigation Priority | Initial Diagnostic Steps |\n|------------------|----------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Complete evaluation failure | Process crashes, no results generated | Critical - investigate immediately | Check process logs, validate dataset loading, verify API credentials |\n| Partial evaluation failure | Some test cases succeed, others fail | High - may indicate systematic issues | Analyze failure patterns by tags, difficulty, prompt length |\n| Score distribution anomalies | Unexpectedly high/low scores, narrow distributions | Medium - may indicate metric bugs | Compare score histograms with baselines, validate metric implementations |\n| Performance degradation | Evaluation takes much longer than expected | Medium - check for resource issues | Monitor CPU/memory usage, analyze batch processing efficiency |\n| Report generation issues | Missing charts, formatting problems, export failures | Low - functional but presentation problems | Validate data pipeline inputs, check template rendering |\n\n**Component Isolation Strategy**\n\nThe evaluation framework consists of multiple interacting components, making it challenging to determine which component is responsible for a given issue. Systematic component isolation helps narrow down the investigation scope.\n\n1. **Start with the outermost component**: Begin investigation at the point where you first observe the problem (usually the `EvaluationCoordinator` or report output).\n\n2. **Trace the data flow backwards**: Follow the data transformation chain in reverse, validating inputs and outputs at each stage.\n\n3. **Use component boundaries as checkpoints**: Each major component (`DatasetLoader`, `MetricRegistry`, `BatchProcessor`, etc.) should provide validation methods to check its internal state.\n\n4. **Isolate external dependencies**: Test with mock implementations of LLM APIs, file systems, and databases to determine if the issue is internal or external.\n\n5. **Reduce to minimal test case**: Create the smallest possible dataset and simplest possible configuration that reproduces the issue.\n\n**Log Analysis and Correlation**\n\nThe framework generates logs from multiple components that execute concurrently. Effective log analysis requires correlating events across components and extracting meaningful patterns from high-volume log streams.\n\n| Log Analysis Technique | When to Use | Implementation |\n|----------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Correlation ID tracking | Tracing requests across components | Include `correlation_id` in all log messages for a single evaluation run |\n| Timeline reconstruction | Understanding sequence of events leading to failure | Parse timestamps and reconstruct chronological event sequence |\n| Error pattern matching | Identifying systematic vs random failures | Group errors by message pattern and analyze frequency distributions |\n| Performance bottleneck analysis | Diagnosing slow evaluations | Extract timing information and identify longest-running operations |\n| Resource utilization correlation | Connecting performance issues to resource constraints | Correlate timing logs with system resource metrics |\n\n> **Key Insight**: The most valuable debugging information comes from the moments just before a failure occurs, not the failure itself. Configure logging to capture detailed state information during normal operation, not just error conditions.\n\n#### Interactive Debugging Tools\n\n**Evaluation State Inspection**\n\nThe framework provides programmatic interfaces for inspecting evaluation state at runtime, allowing developers to diagnose issues without restarting or modifying evaluations.\n\nThe `EvaluationCoordinator` exposes state inspection methods that can be called from a debugging interface or interactive Python session:\n\n| Inspection Method | Information Provided | Typical Use Cases |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| `get_active_evaluations()` | Currently running evaluations with progress stats | Checking if evaluation is stuck or making progress |\n| `get_component_health()` | Status of all major components (dataset loader, metrics, etc.) | Identifying which component is failing |\n| `get_cache_statistics()` | Hit rates, memory usage, error counts for all caches | Diagnosing cache-related performance issues |\n| `get_batch_statistics()` | Current batch sizes, processing rates, error rates | Optimizing concurrency and identifying bottlenecks |\n| `get_provider_health()` | API response times, error rates, rate limit status for each LLM provider | Diagnosing API-related failures |\n\n**Interactive Metric Testing**\n\nMetric bugs are often subtle and require testing with specific inputs to reproduce. The framework provides an interactive metric testing interface that allows developers to evaluate individual metrics with custom inputs and inspect intermediate computation steps.\n\nThe metric testing workflow follows this pattern:\n\n1. **Load a specific test case**: Select a failing test case or create a synthetic case that demonstrates the issue.\n\n2. **Execute metric in isolation**: Run the problematic metric alone, bypassing the normal evaluation pipeline.\n\n3. **Inspect preprocessing steps**: Examine how text preprocessing affects the inputs before metric computation.\n\n4. **Trace computation steps**: For complex metrics like semantic similarity, inspect embedding generation and similarity calculation separately.\n\n5. **Compare with expected behavior**: Run the same inputs through alternative implementations or manual calculations.\n\n**Cache and Storage Debugging**\n\nMany evaluation issues stem from corrupted or inconsistent cached data. The framework provides utilities for inspecting and repairing cache contents without losing valuable cached results.\n\n| Debugging Utility | Purpose | Usage Scenario |\n|-------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Cache validation scanner | Detect corrupted cache entries | Run after system crashes or storage issues |\n| Cache key collision detector | Find hash collisions causing incorrect cache hits | Investigate cases where different inputs return same results |\n| Embedding consistency checker | Verify embedding cache matches current model | Run after model updates or provider changes |\n| Dataset version integrity checker | Validate version history and detect corruption | Investigate version control issues |\n| Checkpoint recovery validator | Verify checkpoint data can be loaded correctly | Test recovery capabilities without actually crashing |\n\n#### Systematic Testing and Validation\n\n**Regression Testing Framework**\n\nAs the evaluation framework evolves, changes can introduce subtle bugs that only manifest under specific conditions. A comprehensive regression testing framework helps catch these issues before they affect production evaluations.\n\nThe regression testing strategy operates at multiple levels:\n\n**Unit-level regression tests** validate individual components with synthetic data that exercises edge cases and error conditions. These tests run quickly and provide immediate feedback during development.\n\n**Integration-level regression tests** use real datasets and LLM APIs to validate cross-component interactions. These tests take longer but catch issues that unit tests miss.\n\n**End-to-end regression tests** run complete evaluations with known datasets and verify that results match historical baselines within acceptable tolerance ranges.\n\n**Performance regression tests** measure evaluation throughput, memory usage, and API efficiency to detect performance degradations that might not affect correctness but impact user experience.\n\n> **Critical Principle**: Regression tests must be deterministic despite the non-deterministic nature of LLM APIs. Use fixed random seeds, cached responses, or mock providers to ensure test results are reproducible.\n\n**Baseline Management and Drift Detection**\n\nThe evaluation framework's primary purpose is detecting changes in model performance over time. However, the framework itself can introduce measurement drift that masquerades as model performance changes. Systematic baseline management helps distinguish real performance changes from measurement artifacts.\n\n**Baseline establishment** involves running the same evaluation multiple times with identical configurations to establish natural score variation ranges. This variation becomes the threshold for detecting real performance changes.\n\n**Drift detection** monitors evaluation results for systematic changes that might indicate framework bugs rather than model changes. Examples include gradual score inflation due to cache corruption or sudden score shifts due to API provider model updates.\n\n**Control group evaluation** runs a subset of test cases with a fixed, well-understood model (like GPT-3.5-turbo with fixed parameters) alongside production evaluations. Changes in control group scores indicate measurement issues rather than model performance changes.\n\n**Cross-validation with external tools** periodically validates framework results against other evaluation tools or manual assessment to detect systematic biases or calibration drift.\n\n#### Performance Profiling and Optimization\n\n**Resource Usage Monitoring**\n\nEvaluation performance issues often stem from resource bottlenecks that aren't immediately obvious. Systematic resource monitoring helps identify these bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.\n\n| Resource Type | Monitoring Approach | Common Bottlenecks | Optimization Strategies |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| CPU utilization | Profile CPU usage during batch processing | JSON parsing, text preprocessing, statistical computations | Optimize data structures, use compiled libraries, implement caching |\n| Memory consumption | Track memory growth during evaluation | Large datasets loaded entirely into memory, embedding cache growth | Implement streaming, add memory limits, use memory mapping |\n| Network bandwidth | Monitor API request/response sizes and frequencies | Large prompts, inefficient batching, redundant API calls | Compress requests, optimize batch sizes, improve caching |\n| Disk I/O | Profile file read/write patterns | Frequent checkpoint writes, large log files, cache thrashing | Use write-ahead logging, implement log rotation, optimize cache placement |\n| API quota usage | Track requests per minute across all providers | Inefficient retry logic, redundant requests, poor load balancing | Implement intelligent retry policies, improve caching, add provider failover |\n\n**Concurrency Optimization**\n\nThe evaluation framework uses extensive concurrency to maximize throughput, but concurrency bugs can cause performance degradation or correctness issues that are difficult to diagnose.\n\n**Deadlock detection**: Monitor for situations where evaluation progress stops completely despite no obvious errors. This often indicates deadlocks between components waiting for each other.\n\n**Resource contention analysis**: Identify cases where concurrent operations compete for shared resources (cache locks, file handles, API rate limits) and cause performance degradation.\n\n**Batch size optimization**: Different evaluation scenarios require different optimal batch sizes. Too small batches waste overhead on API calls and coordination; too large batches cause memory issues and reduce parallelism benefits.\n\n**Load balancing effectiveness**: When using multiple LLM providers, monitor whether load is distributed evenly and whether failover logic works correctly under different failure scenarios.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides practical tools and code templates for implementing comprehensive debugging capabilities in the evaluation framework.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Logging | Python `logging` module with structured JSON output | Distributed logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) |\n| Metrics Collection | Simple counters and timers in application code | Prometheus metrics with Grafana dashboards |\n| Error Tracking | File-based error logs with email alerts | Sentry for error aggregation and alerting |\n| Performance Profiling | `cProfile` and `py-spy` for CPU profiling | APM tools like New Relic or DataDog |\n| Interactive Debugging | Python debugger (pdb) with IPython integration | Remote debugging with PyCharm or VS Code |\n| Log Analysis | grep/awk for simple log parsing | Structured log analysis with Pandas or specialized tools |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nevaluation-framework/\n├── src/evaluation_framework/\n│   ├── debugging/\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── diagnostics.py          ← Main diagnostic utilities\n│   │   ├── interactive_tools.py    ← Interactive debugging interface\n│   │   ├── log_analyzer.py         ← Log parsing and analysis\n│   │   ├── performance_profiler.py ← Performance monitoring utilities\n│   │   └── regression_detector.py  ← Framework regression detection\n│   ├── common/\n│   │   ├── logging_config.py       ← Centralized logging configuration\n│   │   └── error_types.py          ← Common error definitions\n│   └── testing/\n│       ├── regression_tests/       ← Automated regression test suite\n│       ├── mock_providers.py       ← Mock LLM providers for testing\n│       └── test_data_factory.py    ← Utilities for generating test data\n├── tools/\n│   ├── debug_evaluation.py         ← Command-line debugging tool\n│   ├── analyze_logs.py             ← Log analysis script\n│   └── run_regression_tests.py     ← Regression test runner\n└── docs/\n    └── debugging_runbook.md        ← Operational debugging procedures\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Code: Logging and Diagnostics\n\n**Structured Logging Configuration**\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\nclass StructuredFormatter(logging.Formatter):\n    \"\"\"\n    Custom formatter that outputs structured JSON logs for easier parsing and analysis.\n    Includes correlation IDs, component names, and structured error information.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    def format(self, record: logging.LogRecord) -> str:\n        #

The advanced features are sophisticated additions that transform this functional house into a smart home with automation, predictive maintenance, and seamless integration with the broader neighborhood infrastructure. Each advanced feature leverages the core capabilities we've built while extending them in ways that weren't feasible to include in the initial design due to complexity constraints.\n\nThe advanced features fall into three categories: **enhanced evaluation capabilities** that make assessments more sophisticated and nuanced, **intelligent automation** that reduces manual oversight and intervention, and **scale optimization** that enables evaluation of massive datasets and complex model architectures. Each category builds incrementally on the existing system without requiring fundamental architectural changes.\n\n#### Multi-Modal Evaluation Support\n\nThe current framework focuses exclusively on text-to-text evaluation, but modern LLM applications increasingly involve multi-modal inputs and outputs. Think of this extension as adding support for evaluating a conversation that includes not just words, but also images, audio, and structured data — like assessing how well an AI assistant can analyze a medical image, interpret a patient's spoken symptoms, and generate both a written diagnosis and a visual explanation.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Modal Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Modern LLMs handle text, images, audio, and structured data, but current evaluation framework only supports text inputs and outputs\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Separate evaluation frameworks for each modality\n>   2. Universal evaluation interface with modality-specific implementations\n>   3. Pipeline-based evaluation with modality conversion stages\n> - **Decision**: Universal evaluation interface with modality-specific metric implementations\n> - **Rationale**: Maintains consistent evaluation semantics while allowing specialized handling of different data types; enables cross-modal evaluation scenarios\n> - **Consequences**: Requires extending `TestCase` schema and developing modality-specific metrics, but preserves existing evaluation workflow\n\nThe multi-modal extension introduces several new components that integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture. The `MultiModalTestCase` extends the current `TestCase` structure to handle different input and output modalities while maintaining backward compatibility with text-only evaluations.\n\n| Component | Purpose | Integration Point |\n|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| `MultiModalTestCase` | Test case supporting images, audio, video inputs | Extends existing `TestCase` with modality fields |\n| `ModalityProcessor` | Converts between different data formats | Plugs into preprocessing pipeline |\n| `CrossModalMetric` | Measures alignment between different modalities | Implements `BaseMetric` interface |\n| `ModalityCache` | Caches expensive modality conversions | Extends existing caching infrastructure |\n\nThe evaluation workflow adapts naturally to handle multi-modal data. When a test case contains an image input, the `ModalityProcessor` converts it to embeddings or other representations that metrics can consume. For example, evaluating an image captioning model involves comparing generated text against reference captions using semantic similarity, while also checking whether the caption accurately describes visual elements present in the image.\n\n| Evaluation Type | Input Modality | Output Modality | Metric Examples |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Image Captioning | Image | Text | CLIP similarity, object detection accuracy |\n| Audio Transcription | Audio | Text | Word error rate, speaker identification |\n| Visual Question Answering | Image + Text | Text | Answer accuracy, visual grounding |\n| Document Analysis | PDF/Image | Structured JSON | Field extraction accuracy, layout preservation |\n\n#### Adaptive Evaluation Strategies\n\nCurrent evaluation runs all test cases through the same metrics regardless of case difficulty or characteristics. An adaptive evaluation system acts like an experienced teacher who adjusts questioning strategy based on student performance — easy questions get quick verification, while challenging cases receive deeper analysis with multiple evaluation approaches.\n\nThe adaptive strategy engine analyzes test case metadata, model confidence scores, and historical performance patterns to dynamically select appropriate metrics and evaluation depth. This significantly reduces evaluation cost while maintaining accuracy for cases that require detailed assessment.\n\n> **Decision: Adaptive Metric Selection**\n> - **Context**: Running expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation on every test case is costly, but some cases need minimal verification while others require deep analysis\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Static metric assignment based on test case tags\n>   2. Model confidence-based metric selection\n>   3. Multi-stage evaluation with escalation rules\n> - **Decision**: Multi-stage evaluation with confidence-based escalation\n> - **Rationale**: Balances cost and accuracy by using cheap metrics first, escalating to expensive evaluation only when needed\n> - **Consequences**: Requires confidence scoring infrastructure and escalation rule engine, but can reduce evaluation costs by 60-80%\n\nThe adaptive evaluation pipeline operates in three stages. **Stage 1** applies fast, deterministic metrics like exact match and BLEU scores to all test cases. **Stage 2** escalates cases with low confidence or conflicting signals to semantic similarity evaluation. **Stage 3** applies expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation only to cases where automated metrics provide insufficient signal.\n\n| Stage | Criteria | Metrics Applied | Cost Factor |\n|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Stage 1 | All cases | Exact match, BLEU, ROUGE | 1x |\n| Stage 2 | Confidence < 0.8 OR conflicting signals | Semantic similarity, embedding-based | 10x |\n| Stage 3 | High-stakes cases OR ambiguous results | LLM-as-judge, human-in-loop | 100x |\n\nThe escalation rules are configurable and can incorporate domain-specific knowledge. For instance, mathematical reasoning problems might escalate based on numerical accuracy, while creative writing tasks might escalate based on semantic diversity from the reference answer.\n\n#### Continuous Learning from Evaluation Results\n\nThink of this feature as giving the evaluation system a memory and learning capability — like a quality assurance inspector who gets better at spotting defects by analyzing patterns in past inspections. The continuous learning system analyzes evaluation results over time to improve metric calibration, detect evaluation blind spots, and recommend dataset improvements.\n\nThe learning system operates on three timescales. **Real-time learning** adjusts metric weights and thresholds during evaluation runs based on observed score distributions. **Session learning** analyzes completed evaluation runs to identify systematic biases or metric inconsistencies. **Historical learning** examines long-term trends to suggest dataset evolution and metric retirement strategies.\n\n| Learning Type | Timescale | Adaptation Target | Example Improvement |\n|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Real-time | During evaluation | Metric thresholds, batch sizing | Adjust semantic similarity threshold based on score distribution |\n| Session | Post-evaluation | Metric correlations, failure patterns | Identify metrics that consistently disagree and investigate |\n| Historical | Weekly/monthly | Dataset composition, metric retirement | Recommend new test cases for under-represented failure modes |\n\nThe learning system maintains a `MetricPerformanceHistory` that tracks metric reliability, correlation patterns, and prediction accuracy over time. This data feeds into automatic recalibration algorithms and human-readable improvement recommendations.\n\n#### Hierarchical Evaluation Taxonomies\n\nCurrent evaluation treats all test cases uniformly, but real-world applications have hierarchical skill requirements. Think of this like academic assessment — you need to master basic arithmetic before attempting calculus, and evaluation should reflect these skill dependencies. The hierarchical evaluation system organizes test cases into skill trees and provides detailed breakdowns of model capabilities across different competency levels.\n\nThe taxonomy system introduces `SkillNode` entities that represent different capabilities and their dependencies. A language model's performance on \"mathematical reasoning\" might depend on its mastery of \"numerical calculation,\" \"logical inference,\" and \"word problem parsing.\" The evaluation system tracks performance at each skill level and identifies capability gaps.\n\n| Skill Level | Dependencies | Evaluation Focus | Progression Criteria |\n|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Basic Skills | None | Fundamental capabilities | 95%+ accuracy on core tasks |\n| Intermediate | 2-3 basic skills | Skill combination | 85%+ accuracy with reasoning trace |\n| Advanced | Multiple intermediate | Complex problem solving | 70%+ accuracy on novel problems |\n| Expert | All prerequisite skills | Domain specialization | Human-level performance on expert tasks |\n\nThe hierarchical analysis generates **skill gap reports** that identify which foundational capabilities need improvement before attempting more complex evaluations. This is particularly valuable for model training guidance and capability assessment for production deployment.\n\n#### Distributed Evaluation Infrastructure\n\nAs datasets grow to millions of test cases and models become more expensive to query, evaluation needs to scale horizontally across multiple machines and regions. Think of this as transforming evaluation from a single powerful workstation to a distributed computing cluster — like moving from a master craftsman's workshop to a modern factory with specialized stations and assembly lines.\n\nThe distributed evaluation system introduces a **coordinator-worker architecture** where a central coordinator partitions datasets and distributes work to evaluation workers running on different machines. Workers can be heterogeneous — some optimized for fast exact match computation, others equipped with GPUs for semantic similarity, and specialized workers for expensive LLM-as-judge evaluation.\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Scaling Characteristics |\n|-----------|----------------|------------------------|\n| `EvaluationCoordinator` | Work distribution, result aggregation | Single instance with failover |\n| `EvaluationWorker` | Metric computation, LLM queries | Horizontally scalable |\n| `ResultAggregator` | Statistical analysis, report generation | CPU-intensive, vertically scalable |\n| `CacheCluster` | Distributed result caching | Horizontally scalable with sharding |\n\nThe distributed system maintains **evaluation consistency** through deterministic work partitioning and result checksums. If a worker fails, its assigned test cases are redistributed to healthy workers with automatic deduplication to prevent double-evaluation.\n\n> **Decision: Work Distribution Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Large evaluations need to distribute work across multiple machines while maintaining result consistency and handling worker failures\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Static work assignment based on test case hash\n>   2. Dynamic load balancing with work stealing\n>   3. Hierarchical distribution with regional coordinators\n> - **Decision**: Dynamic load balancing with consistent hashing for cache locality\n> - **Rationale**: Adapts to heterogeneous worker capabilities and provides natural cache affinity while handling failures gracefully\n> - **Consequences**: Requires sophisticated coordinator logic but provides optimal resource utilization and fault tolerance\n\n#### Real-Time Evaluation Monitoring\n\nProduction LLM applications need continuous evaluation as they serve live traffic, similar to how modern web applications use real-user monitoring (RUM) to track performance. The real-time evaluation system samples live model responses, applies lightweight evaluation metrics, and alerts when quality degrades below acceptable thresholds.\n\nThe monitoring system operates with **configurable sampling rates** to balance evaluation coverage with computational overhead. High-confidence responses get minimal evaluation, while responses showing uncertainty indicators receive more thorough assessment. This creates a continuous feedback loop that can detect model degradation, prompt injection attacks, or training distribution drift.\n\n| Monitoring Type | Sampling Rate | Latency Tolerance | Alert Criteria |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Quality Drift | 1-5% of traffic | < 100ms additional latency | 10% degradation over 1 hour |\n| Safety Violations | 100% of flagged responses | < 50ms additional latency | Any detected violation |\n| Performance Regression | 0.1% of traffic | < 1s additional latency | Statistical significance test |\n\nThe real-time system integrates with the existing evaluation infrastructure by treating live traffic as a continuously updating dataset. Evaluation results feed into the same reporting and analysis pipeline, enabling unified views of both batch evaluation and production performance.\n\n### Integration Points\n\nThe evaluation framework's true power emerges when it integrates seamlessly with the broader machine learning infrastructure ecosystem. Think of these integration points as diplomatic relationships between neighboring countries — each system maintains its sovereignty and core competencies while establishing protocols for collaboration, data exchange, and mutual support.\n\n#### MLOps Pipeline Integration\n\nModern machine learning development follows DevOps principles with continuous integration, automated testing, and staged deployments. The evaluation framework integrates into this pipeline as a **quality gate** — automated evaluation runs must pass before model deployments can proceed to production. This prevents degraded models from reaching users while maintaining development velocity.\n\nThe MLOps integration operates through standardized interfaces and event-driven communication. When a new model version is committed to the model registry, it triggers an automated evaluation run against the comprehensive test suite. The evaluation results feed into deployment decision logic that can automatically promote models that exceed quality thresholds or flag models requiring human review.\n\n| Pipeline Stage | Evaluation Trigger | Pass Criteria | Failure Action |\n|----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Development | Code commit with model changes | Basic functionality tests pass | Block merge request |\n| Staging | Model registry update | Comprehensive evaluation > baseline | Hold deployment, notify team |\n| Production | Scheduled evaluation | No regression detected | Automatic rollback to previous version |\n| Post-deployment | Live traffic monitoring | Quality metrics within bounds | Alert and gradual traffic reduction |\n\nThe integration provides **evaluation-aware deployment strategies** that can gradually shift traffic to new model versions while continuously monitoring quality metrics. If evaluation detects degradation, the system can automatically roll back or reduce traffic to the problematic model version.\n\n> **Decision: Deployment Integration Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Model deployments need automated quality gates without blocking development velocity or requiring manual intervention for routine deployments\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Blocking evaluation that prevents deployment until completion\n>   2. Asynchronous evaluation with post-deployment rollback\n>   3. Staged deployment with continuous evaluation\n> - **Decision**: Staged deployment with continuous evaluation and automatic traffic management\n> - **Rationale**: Balances safety with velocity by detecting issues in production while limiting impact through controlled traffic exposure\n> - **Consequences**: Requires sophisticated traffic management and rollback capabilities but provides maximum protection with minimal development friction\n\n#### Model Registry Integration\n\nThe model registry serves as the central repository for trained models, their metadata, and versioning information. The evaluation framework integrates deeply with the registry to provide **evaluation-aware model management** — every model version includes comprehensive evaluation results, and models can be queried based on performance characteristics rather than just chronological order.\n\nThe integration automatically tags model versions with evaluation metadata including overall scores, per-category breakdowns, and regression analysis results. This enables sophisticated model selection strategies that consider not just overall performance but specific capability requirements for different use cases.\n\n| Model Metadata | Source | Usage |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Overall evaluation score | Comprehensive evaluation run | Model ranking and selection |\n| Per-category performance | Tag-based evaluation breakdown | Domain-specific model selection |\n| Regression analysis | Comparison with baseline models | Deployment risk assessment |\n| Evaluation confidence | Statistical analysis of results | Decision threshold adjustment |\n| Resource requirements | Evaluation runtime profiling | Cost-aware model selection |\n\nThe registry integration enables **capability-based model queries** where applications can request models meeting specific performance criteria. For example, a customer service application might require models with >0.9 accuracy on \"customer_intent_classification\" and >0.8 on \"response_empathy\" metrics.\n\n#### Experimentation Platform Integration\n\nA/B testing platforms manage controlled experiments that compare different model versions or prompt strategies with live user traffic. The evaluation framework integrates with these platforms to provide **offline evaluation correlation** with online performance metrics. This helps validate that offline evaluation accurately predicts real-world performance and identifies when offline metrics become unreliable.\n\nThe integration operates through shared experiment identifiers that link offline evaluation runs with online experiment results. Statistical analysis compares offline evaluation predictions with observed user satisfaction, task completion rates, and business metrics to continuously calibrate evaluation accuracy.\n\n| Integration Point | Data Flow | Purpose |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Experiment Design | Evaluation results → Experiment variants | Use evaluation to pre-filter experimental candidates |\n| Online Monitoring | Live metrics → Evaluation correlation analysis | Validate offline evaluation accuracy |\n| Result Analysis | Combined offline/online results | Comprehensive performance assessment |\n| Model Selection | Correlated metrics → Production deployment | Choose models optimized for real-world performance |\n\nThe platform provides **evaluation-guided experimentation** that uses offline evaluation results to inform experiment design. Instead of randomly testing model variants, the system can design experiments that focus on cases where offline evaluation showed uncertainty or disagreement between metrics.\n\n#### Data Pipeline Integration\n\nModern ML systems process continuous streams of training data, user interactions, and feedback signals. The evaluation framework integrates with data pipelines to enable **continuous dataset evolution** — new test cases are automatically generated from production data, golden examples are identified from high-confidence interactions, and dataset composition adapts to emerging use patterns.\n\nThe data pipeline integration monitors live system interactions to identify evaluation gaps. When users consistently encounter scenarios not covered in the existing test suite, the system flags these for potential inclusion in future dataset versions. This creates a feedback loop that keeps evaluation datasets current with real-world usage patterns.\n\n| Data Source | Processing | Output |\n|-------------|------------|---------|\n| User interactions | Pattern analysis, quality filtering | Candidate test cases |\n| Human feedback | Confidence scoring, consensus detection | Golden examples |\n| Error logs | Failure pattern analysis | Stress test scenarios |\n| Performance metrics | Correlation analysis | Evaluation validation data |\n\nThe integration provides **automated dataset curation** that reduces the manual effort required to maintain comprehensive evaluation coverage. The system can automatically propose new test cases, identify outdated examples, and suggest dataset rebalancing based on observed performance patterns.\n\n#### Monitoring and Alerting Integration\n\nProduction monitoring systems track system health, performance metrics, and business KPIs. The evaluation framework integrates with these systems to provide **quality-aware alerting** that can distinguish between system performance issues and model quality degradation. This prevents false alerts when response times are normal but output quality has declined.\n\nThe monitoring integration establishes evaluation metrics as first-class observability signals alongside traditional infrastructure metrics. Quality degradation alerts include context about which specific capabilities have declined and recommended remediation actions based on historical patterns.\n\n| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Context Provided | Recommended Action |\n|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Quality Regression | Statistical significance test failure | Affected categories, magnitude | Model rollback or retraining |\n| Safety Violation | Any harmful content detection | Specific safety category | Immediate human review |\n| Performance Drift | Gradual decline over time window | Trend analysis, root cause hints | Dataset refresh or fine-tuning |\n| Evaluation System Health | Evaluation pipeline failures | Component status, error patterns | Infrastructure investigation |\n\nThe integration enables **proactive quality management** where teams receive early warning of potential issues before they impact user experience significantly.

Just as medical professionals need precise definitions for terms like \"tachycardia\" or \"myocardial infarction\" to communicate effectively, LLM evaluation practitioners need shared understanding of concepts like \"semantic similarity\" or \"LLM-as-judge.\" Without consistent terminology, a team member's \"fuzzy matching\" might mean something completely different from another's, leading to implementation confusion and architectural misalignment.\n\n### Core Evaluation Concepts\n\n**Evaluation Excellence**: The overarching philosophy of delivering superior evaluation capabilities that provide reliable, actionable insights into LLM performance. This goes beyond simple accuracy measurement to encompass comprehensive understanding of model strengths, weaknesses, and behavioral patterns. Evaluation excellence requires statistical rigor, reproducible methodologies, and clear communication of results to both technical and business stakeholders.\n\n**Test Case Schema**: The structured format that defines evaluation test cases with comprehensive metadata. Each test case follows a consistent schema that includes the input prompt, expected output, categorization tags, difficulty level, and extensible metadata fields. The schema ensures that evaluation datasets remain interoperable across different evaluation runs and can be processed consistently by all metrics.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `case_id` | `str` | Unique identifier for the test case within the dataset |\n| `prompt` | `str` | Input text or query that will be sent to the LLM |\n| `expected_output` | `str` | Reference answer or expected response for comparison |\n| `tags` | `List[str]` | Categorical labels for grouping and filtering test cases |\n| `difficulty` | `str` | Complexity level indicator (easy, medium, hard, expert) |\n| `metadata` | `Dict` | Extensible key-value pairs for additional test case information |\n\n**Golden Examples**: High-quality reference cases specifically curated for calibrating evaluators, particularly LLM-as-judge systems. Golden examples represent the gold standard for expected model behavior and are typically created through expert review or consensus among multiple human evaluators. These examples serve as anchor points for establishing consistent evaluation criteria and are often used to validate that automated metrics are producing reasonable scores.\n\n> Golden examples are like the master craftsman's reference pieces in a workshop - they define what excellence looks like and help calibrate all other evaluation tools to maintain consistent standards.\n\n**Evaluation Results Model**: The comprehensive data structure that captures complete evaluation outcomes, including not just scores but also metadata about the evaluation process itself. This model preserves full traceability from input test case through metric computation to final aggregated results.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `case_id` | `str` | Reference to the original test case identifier |\n| `model_response` | `str` | Actual output generated by the LLM under evaluation |\n| `response_metadata` | `Dict` | Information about response generation (tokens, latency, etc.) |\n| `metric_results` | `Dict` | Per-metric scores and detailed evaluation information |\n| `overall_score` | `float` | Weighted combination of all applicable metric scores |\n| `evaluation_time` | `datetime` | Timestamp when evaluation was completed |\n| `error_info` | `Optional[str]` | Error details if evaluation failed |\n\n### Dataset Management Terminology\n\n**Dataset Versioning**: A git-like tracking system for changes to evaluation datasets that maintains complete history and enables rollback to previous states. This system tracks not only which test cases were added, removed, or modified, but also preserves the full context of why changes were made through commit messages and change summaries.\n\n**Version Diff**: A detailed comparison showing the specific changes between two dataset versions, including added cases, modified cases, removed cases, and field-level changes within individual test cases. Version diffs enable reviewers to understand the impact of dataset updates and ensure that changes align with evaluation objectives.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `from_version` | `str` | Source version identifier in the comparison |\n| `to_version` | `str` | Target version identifier in the comparison |\n| `added_cases` | `List[str]` | Test case IDs that exist only in the target version |\n| `modified_cases` | `List[str]` | Test case IDs with content changes between versions |\n| `removed_cases` | `List[str]` | Test case IDs that exist only in the source version |\n| `case_changes` | `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` | Field-level changes for each modified test case |\n\n**Content Hash**: A cryptographic hash function output that serves as a unique identifier based on dataset content rather than arbitrary version numbers. Content hashing ensures data integrity by detecting any unauthorized modifications and enables content-addressable storage where identical datasets share the same hash regardless of their creation time or source.\n\n**Merge Conflict**: A situation that occurs when the same test case has been modified differently in parallel branches of dataset development, requiring manual resolution to determine the canonical version. The system detects conflicts by comparing field-level changes and provides tools for reviewers to make informed decisions about conflict resolution.\n\n**Stratified Sampling**: A statistical sampling technique that preserves the proportional representation of different subgroups when splitting datasets into training, validation, and test sets. For evaluation datasets, stratification typically occurs across difficulty levels, topic categories, or other meaningful dimensions to ensure that each subset remains representative of the overall population.\n\n### Metrics and Scoring Terminology\n\n**Semantic Similarity**: A measurement technique that compares the meaning similarity between model output and reference text using embedding vectors rather than surface-level text comparison. This approach captures conceptual similarity even when the exact wording differs, making it particularly valuable for evaluating tasks where multiple valid phrasings exist.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge**: An evaluation methodology that uses language models to assess the quality of other language model outputs, typically by providing structured prompts that ask the judge model to score responses according to specific criteria. This approach enables evaluation of complex, subjective qualities that are difficult to capture with traditional metrics.\n\n**Fuzzy Matching**: Approximate string matching that applies various normalization techniques (whitespace removal, case normalization, punctuation handling) before comparison to reduce the impact of trivial formatting differences on evaluation scores. Fuzzy matching bridges the gap between overly strict exact matching and computationally expensive semantic similarity.\n\n**Metric Applicability**: Rules and logic that determine which metrics should be applied to evaluate specific test cases, based on test case metadata, tags, or content characteristics. Not all metrics are meaningful for all types of evaluation tasks, so applicability rules prevent inappropriate metric application and ensure evaluation results remain interpretable.\n\n**Score Normalization**: The process of mapping diverse metric outputs to a standardized 0.0-1.0 range to enable meaningful aggregation and comparison across different metric types. Normalization preserves the relative ranking of results while ensuring that metrics with different natural scales can be combined effectively.\n\n**Judge Prompt Template**: A structured format for creating consistent prompts when using LLM-as-judge evaluation, including standardized sections for task description, evaluation criteria, output format specifications, and example demonstrations. Templates ensure that judge evaluations remain consistent across different test cases and evaluation runs.\n\n**Consistency Control**: Mechanisms implemented to improve the reliability and repeatability of LLM-as-judge evaluations, such as temperature control, multiple sampling with majority voting, or chain-of-thought reasoning requirements. These controls help mitigate the inherent variability in language model outputs.\n\n**Calibration**: The process of mapping raw similarity scores or other metric outputs to meaningful evaluation scores that align with human judgment or established quality standards. Calibration involves analyzing the distribution of raw scores against known-good examples and establishing thresholds that correspond to different quality levels.\n\n### Execution and Processing Terminology\n\n**Batch Processing**: A processing strategy that groups test cases into batches for parallel execution, optimizing throughput while respecting resource constraints and API rate limits. Batch processing enables efficient utilization of computational resources and helps manage the trade-off between evaluation speed and system stability.\n\n**Result Caching**: A storage system that persists LLM responses and computed metric results to avoid redundant computation when the same inputs are evaluated multiple times. Caching is particularly valuable for expensive operations like LLM API calls and embedding computations.\n\n**Content-Addressable Cache**: A caching system where cache keys are derived from the content being cached rather than arbitrary identifiers, ensuring that identical content always maps to the same cache entry regardless of when or how it was generated. This approach maximizes cache hit rates and eliminates duplicate storage.\n\n**Checkpointing**: The practice of periodically saving evaluation progress to persistent storage, enabling recovery and resumption after system failures or interruptions. Checkpoints include both the current state of the evaluation and enough metadata to resume processing from the exact point of interruption.\n\n**Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**: A transaction logging mechanism that records intended operations before executing them, providing a reliable foundation for crash recovery. The WAL ensures that no evaluation progress is lost even if the system crashes in the middle of processing a batch of test cases.\n\n**Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring and reporting of evaluation completion status, including completed case counts, estimated time remaining, error rates, and performance metrics. Progress tracking provides visibility into long-running evaluations and helps identify performance bottlenecks.\n\n**Adaptive Batch Sizing**: A dynamic optimization technique that adjusts batch sizes based on observed performance characteristics, increasing batch sizes when the system is performing well and reducing them when errors or slowdowns are detected. This approach maximizes throughput while maintaining system stability.\n\n**Rate Limiting**: Control mechanisms that regulate the frequency of API requests to prevent overwhelming external services and avoid triggering rate limit responses. Rate limiting includes both simple request counting and more sophisticated algorithms like token bucket or sliding window approaches.\n\n### Analysis and Reporting Terminology\n\n**Score Aggregation**: The process of computing statistical summaries across evaluation results, including measures of central tendency (mean, median), variability (standard deviation, percentiles), and group-based breakdowns by tags, categories, or other metadata dimensions.\n\n**Statistical Significance**: A statistical concept that quantifies the likelihood that an observed difference between two sets of evaluation results is due to genuine performance differences rather than random variation. Statistical significance testing helps distinguish meaningful changes from noise in evaluation comparisons.\n\n**Effect Size**: A measure of the practical magnitude of performance differences that is independent of sample size, providing insight into whether statistically significant differences are also meaningfully large. Effect size helps prioritize which performance changes deserve attention and resources.\n\n**Regression Detection**: Automated identification of performance degradation compared to established baseline measurements, using statistical techniques to distinguish genuine regressions from normal variation. Regression detection enables proactive identification of quality issues before they impact production systems.\n\n**Changepoint Detection**: Statistical analysis that identifies moments in time when the fundamental performance characteristics of a model shift, indicating potential changes in model behavior, data distribution, or evaluation methodology. Changepoint detection helps understand the timeline of model performance evolution.\n\n**Failure Analysis**: Systematic examination of evaluation failures to identify common patterns, root causes, and remediation opportunities. Failure analysis involves clustering similar failures, analyzing error patterns, and generating actionable recommendations for model improvement.\n\n**Semantic Clustering**: The process of grouping evaluation failures or results based on meaning similarity using embedding-based approaches, enabling identification of thematic patterns that might not be apparent through simple keyword-based analysis.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**: A systematic process for tracing failure patterns back to their underlying model limitations, training data issues, or architectural problems, providing actionable insights for model improvement rather than just symptom identification.\n\n**Baseline Management**: The practice of maintaining reference performance levels for comparison purposes, including policies for when baselines should be updated and how to handle the evolution of evaluation standards over time.\n\n**Multiple Comparison Correction**: Statistical adjustments applied when testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously to control the overall probability of false discoveries. This is particularly important when comparing performance across many different categories or metrics within a single evaluation.\n\n### System Architecture and Infrastructure\n\n**Plugin System**: An extensible architecture that allows users to register custom metrics, processors, or analysis functions while maintaining system stability and security through well-defined interfaces and resource limitations.\n\n**Metric Registry**: A centralized system for metric discovery, registration, and management that provides a unified interface for accessing both built-in and custom metrics while handling version compatibility and dependency management.\n\n**Circuit Breaker**: A failure isolation pattern that monitors the health of external dependencies (like LLM APIs) and automatically stops sending requests when failure rates exceed acceptable thresholds, preventing cascade failures and resource exhaustion.\n\n**Backpressure Handling**: Mechanisms for preventing fast-producing components from overwhelming slower consumers by implementing flow control, buffering strategies, and graceful degradation when system capacity is exceeded.\n\n**Event-Driven Architecture**: A system design approach where components communicate through asynchronous event notifications rather than direct method calls, enabling loose coupling, better scalability, and more resilient failure handling.\n\n**Distributed Tracing**: The practice of tracking requests and operations across component boundaries using correlation IDs and structured logging, enabling diagnosis of complex issues that span multiple system components.\n\n### Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Error Boundaries**: Isolation mechanisms that contain failures within specific components or operations, preventing errors from cascading through the entire system and enabling partial functionality during degraded conditions.\n\n**Graceful Degradation**: System behavior that maintains partial functionality when some components or capabilities are unavailable, such as falling back to simpler metrics when advanced evaluators fail or using cached results when APIs are unreachable.\n\n**Exponential Backoff**: A retry strategy where the delay between retry attempts increases exponentially with each failure, helping to avoid overwhelming already-stressed systems while still providing reasonable recovery times.\n\n**Recovery Strategies**: Systematic approaches for handling different categories of failures, including automatic retry with backoff, failover to alternative providers, degraded mode operation, and manual intervention escalation paths.\n\n**State Reconstruction**: The process of rebuilding consistent system state after data corruption or partial failures, using techniques like write-ahead logs, checksums, and redundant storage to ensure data integrity.\n\n**Thundering Herd**: A failure pattern where multiple processes simultaneously attempt to access a recovered service, potentially overwhelming it again. Prevention strategies include jittered delays, circuit breakers, and gradual traffic ramping.\n\n### Quality Assurance and Testing\n\n**Test Pyramid**: A testing strategy that emphasizes fast, isolated unit tests at the base, integration tests for component interactions in the middle, and comprehensive end-to-end tests at the apex, balancing thorough coverage with execution speed.\n\n**Milestone Checkpoints**: Specific verification criteria and success indicators defined for each development milestone, providing clear progress markers and quality gates throughout the implementation process.\n\n**Mock Providers**: Test implementations of external dependencies (like LLM APIs) that provide predictable, controllable responses for isolated testing without incurring costs or depending on external service availability.\n\n**Regression Testing**: Systematic testing to ensure that changes don't break existing functionality, particularly important for evaluation systems where subtle changes can significantly impact result interpretation.\n\n**Test Data Factory**: Utilities for generating realistic test data with consistent characteristics, enabling reproducible testing across different scenarios while maintaining data quality and representativeness.\n\n### Debugging and Diagnostics\n\n**Symptom Classification**: The systematic categorization of evaluation issues based on observable behaviors, enabling efficient diagnosis by narrowing the potential root causes before beginning detailed investigation.\n\n**Component Isolation**: Debugging techniques that systematically narrow down which system component is responsible for observed issues, using controlled testing and dependency injection to isolate problematic areas.\n\n**Correlation ID Tracking**: The practice of assigning unique identifiers to requests and operations that persist across all log entries and system interactions, enabling complete trace reconstruction for debugging complex distributed operations.\n\n**Structured Logging**: A logging approach that produces machine-readable, consistently formatted log entries with standardized fields, enabling automated analysis

system efficiency as workloads scale.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nUnderstanding these terms is crucial for implementing a robust LLM evaluation framework, but terminology alone isn't sufficient. The concepts must be properly operationalized through careful system design and implementation.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations for Terminology Management\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Documentation | Markdown files with glossary | Sphinx with automated term linking |\n| Term Validation | Manual review during PR process | Automated terminology checking in CI/CD |\n| Cross-References | Manual markdown links | Automated cross-reference generation |\n| Version Control | Git for documentation | Specialized terminology management tools |\n\n#### Recommended Documentation Structure\n\nWhen implementing the evaluation framework, organize terminology documentation to support both learning and operational use:\n\n```\ndocs/\n  glossary/\n    core-concepts.md          ← Fundamental evaluation terminology\n    dataset-management.md     ← Dataset-specific terms\n    metrics-scoring.md        ← Metrics and scoring terminology  \n    execution-processing.md   ← Runtime and processing terms\n    analysis-reporting.md     ← Statistical and reporting terms\n    system-architecture.md    ← Infrastructure terminology\n    cross-references.md       ← Term relationships and dependencies\n  examples/\n    terminology-usage.md      ← Concrete examples of term usage\n    common-mistakes.md        ← Frequently misused terms\n```\n\n#### Terminology Validation Infrastructure\n\nImplement systematic validation to ensure consistent terminology usage across the codebase:\n\n```python\n# terminology_validator.py - Complete infrastructure starter code\nimport re\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass TermDefinition:\n    \"\"\"Definition of a standardized term with validation rules.\"\"\"\n    term: str\n    definition: str\n    category: str\n    aliases: List[str]\n    deprecated_alternatives: List[str]\n    usage_examples: List[str]\n\nclass TerminologyValidator:\n    \"\"\"Validates consistent terminology usage across documentation and code.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, glossary_path: Path):\n        self.glossary_path = glossary_path\n        self.standard_terms: Dict[str, TermDefinition] = {}\n        self.load_standard_terminology()\n    \n    def load_standard_terminology(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Load standard terminology definitions from glossary files.\"\"\"\n        # TODO: Implement glossary parsing from markdown files\n        # TODO: Extract term definitions, aliases, and deprecated alternatives  \n        # TODO: Build lookup indexes for efficient validation\n        # TODO: Validate glossary consistency (no conflicting definitions)\n        pass\n    \n    def validate_document(self, doc_path: Path) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Validate terminology usage in a documentation file.\"\"\"\n        violations = []\n        \n        # TODO: Read document content and extract terminology usage\n        # TODO: Check for deprecated terms and suggest replacements\n        # TODO: Verify that technical terms are properly defined\n        # TODO: Ensure consistent capitalization and spelling\n        # TODO: Check for undefined terms that should be in glossary\n        \n        return violations\n    \n    def validate_code_comments(self, code_path: Path) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Validate terminology in code comments and docstrings.\"\"\"\n        violations = []\n        \n        # TODO: Extract comments and docstrings from source code\n        # TODO: Apply same validation rules as documentation\n        # TODO: Check that API documentation uses standard terms\n        # TODO: Verify that error messages use consistent terminology\n        \n        return violations\n    \n    def generate_term_usage_report(self, project_root: Path) -> Dict[str, int]:\n        \"\"\"Generate report of terminology usage frequency across project.\"\"\"\n        # TODO: Scan all documentation and code files\n        # TODO: Count usage frequency for each standard term\n        # TODO: Identify unused terms that might be candidates for removal\n        # TODO: Find commonly used terms not in the standard glossary\n        \n        return {}\n\n# Automated terminology checking for CI/CD pipeline\ndef check_terminology_compliance(project_root: Path) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check project-wide terminology compliance for CI/CD integration.\"\"\"\n    validator = TerminologyValidator(project_root / \"docs\" / \"glossary\")\n    \n    violations = []\n    \n    # Check all documentation files\n    for doc_file in (project_root / \"docs\").rglob(\"*.md\"):\n        violations.extend(validator.validate_document(doc_file))\n    \n    # Check code comments and docstrings\n    for code_file in project_root.rglob(\"*.py\"):\n        violations.extend(validator.validate_code_comments(code_file))\n    \n    if violations:\n        print(\"Terminology violations found:\")\n        for violation in violations:\n            print(f\"  - {violation}\")\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n#### Core Logic Skeleton for Term Management\n\nFor teams implementing glossary management as part of their evaluation framework:\n\n```python\nclass GlossaryManager:\n    \"\"\"Manages glossary definitions and cross-references for evaluation framework.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, storage_path: Path):\n        self.storage_path = storage_path\n        self.terms: Dict[str, TermDefinition] = {}\n        self.cross_references: Dict[str, Set[str]] = {}\n    \n    def add_term_definition(self, term: str, definition: str, category: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Add a new term definition to the glossary.\"\"\"\n        # TODO: Validate that term doesn't already exist with different definition\n        # TODO: Extract cross-references to other terms mentioned in definition\n        # TODO: Update bidirectional cross-reference mappings\n        # TODO: Persist updated glossary to storage\n        # TODO: Validate definition completeness and clarity\n        pass\n    \n    def find_related_terms(self, term: str) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Find terms related to the given term through cross-references.\"\"\"\n        # TODO: Use cross-reference graph to find directly related terms\n        # TODO: Include terms that share the same category\n        # TODO: Find terms mentioned in the definition\n        # TODO: Return ordered list by relevance score\n        pass\n    \n    def validate_definition_completeness(self, term: str) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Validate that a term definition meets completeness criteria.\"\"\"\n        issues = []\n        \n        # TODO: Check that definition exists and is non-empty\n        # TODO: Verify that definition doesn't use undefined terms\n        # TODO: Ensure definition provides sufficient context\n        # TODO: Check for circular definitions\n        # TODO: Validate that examples are helpful and accurate\n        \n        return issues\n    \n    def generate_glossary_html(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate interactive HTML glossary with cross-references.\"\"\"\n        # TODO: Create HTML template with term navigation\n        # TODO: Add cross-reference links between related terms\n        # TODO: Include search functionality for finding terms\n        # TODO: Organize terms by category with filtering\n        # TODO: Add examples and usage guidance for each term\n        pass\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Implementation Hints\n\nWhen implementing terminology management in Python:\n\n- Use `dataclasses` for term definitions to get automatic equality and serialization\n- Use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform file handling in documentation processing\n- Use `re` module for extracting terminology patterns from text\n- Use `typing` annotations extensively for clear interfaces\n- Use `json` or `yaml` for persisting glossary data with version control\n- Use `sphinx` for advanced documentation generation with term linking\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint: Terminology Consistency\n\nAfter implementing terminology management:\n\n**Validation Commands:**\n```bash\npython terminology_validator.py --check-project .\npython -m pytest tests/test_terminology.py -v\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- All standard terms should be consistently used across documentation\n- No deprecated terminology should appear in new code or documentation  \n- Cross-references between related terms should be automatically maintained\n- Glossary should be searchable and well-organized by category\n\n**Signs of Issues:**\n- Inconsistent capitalization of technical terms across files\n- Use of deprecated alternatives instead of standard terminology\n- Missing definitions for commonly used technical terms\n- Broken cross-references in generated documentation\n\n#### Debugging Terminology Issues\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----------|-----|\n| Term used inconsistently | No standard definition | Search codebase for variations | Add to standard glossary |\n| Cross-references broken | Definition moved or renamed | Check glossary update history | Update all references |\n| Glossary feels incomplete | Terms used but not defined | Run terminology extraction | Add missing definitions |\n| Definitions are circular | Poor definition structure | Analyze definition dependencies | Rewrite with clear hierarchy |\n| Users confused by terms | Definitions too technical | Review with target audience | Simplify with examples |\n\nThe glossary serves as the foundation for clear communication throughout the LLM evaluation framework implementation. By establishing precise, consistent terminology, teams can avoid the confusion and misalignment that often derail complex technical projects. The investment in terminology management pays dividends through improved code quality, better documentation, and more effective collaboration.\n"}
