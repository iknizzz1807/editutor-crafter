{"html":"<h1 id=\"load-balancer-design-document\">Load Balancer: Design Document</h1>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>This system implements an HTTP application load balancer that distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers using various algorithms like round-robin, weighted distribution, and least connections. The key architectural challenge is maintaining high availability and even traffic distribution while handling backend failures gracefully through health checking and automatic failover.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) — this establishes the foundational understanding needed throughout the project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-restaurant-host\">Mental Model: Restaurant Host</h3>\n<p>Think of a <strong>load balancer</strong> as a restaurant host who greets customers at the entrance and decides where to seat them. When diners arrive, they don&#39;t randomly wander around looking for empty tables — that would create chaos, with some sections overwhelmed while others sit empty. Instead, the host has a clear view of the entire restaurant, knows which tables are available, which servers are busy, and how to distribute customers evenly for the best dining experience.</p>\n<p>The host uses different strategies depending on the situation. During quiet periods, they might simply rotate between sections in order — the <strong>round-robin</strong> approach. When one section gets backed up because a server called in sick, the host routes new customers elsewhere — this is <strong>health-aware routing</strong>. For VIP customers who prefer their regular server, the host remembers their preference and seats them consistently — this is <strong>session affinity</strong>. If some servers handle large parties better than others, the host might send more customers to those sections — this is <strong>weighted distribution</strong>.</p>\n<p>Just like the restaurant host, a load balancer sits between clients (diners) and backend servers (restaurant sections). It receives incoming requests, chooses which backend should handle each one, and ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed while others remain idle. The load balancer must track which backends are healthy and responsive, maintain fairness in distribution, and gracefully handle situations where backends fail or become unavailable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight is that load balancing is fundamentally about <strong>coordination and optimization</strong> — taking a stream of independent requests and making intelligent routing decisions to maximize overall system performance and reliability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-distribution-challenge\">The Distribution Challenge</h3>\n<p>Building an effective load balancer requires solving several interconnected challenges that go beyond simply forwarding requests. Each challenge represents a fundamental problem in distributed systems that affects both performance and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Request Distribution Fairness</strong> represents the core algorithmic challenge. When requests arrive at unpredictable rates and backend servers have different processing capabilities, how do we ensure fair distribution? A naive approach might assign requests randomly, but this can lead to significant imbalances over short time periods. Some requests might be computationally expensive while others are simple database lookups, making simple request counting insufficient. The load balancer must implement algorithms that account for these variables while remaining efficient enough to route thousands of requests per second without becoming a bottleneck itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Failure Detection and Recovery</strong> introduces the reliability challenge. Backend servers fail in various ways — they might crash completely, become unreachable due to network partitions, or degrade slowly under load while still accepting connections. The load balancer must distinguish between temporary hiccups and genuine failures, avoiding the mistake of removing healthy backends due to transient network issues. Equally important is the recovery process: when should a previously failed backend be given another chance, and how can the system avoid overwhelming a recovering server with a sudden flood of traffic?</p>\n<p><strong>State Management Under Concurrency</strong> presents the consistency challenge. Modern load balancers handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests, each potentially requiring updates to shared state like backend health status, connection counts, or round-robin counters. Race conditions can lead to uneven distribution, incorrect health states, or even crashes. The challenge is maintaining consistency without introducing locks that could serialize request processing and destroy throughput. Atomic operations, lock-free data structures, and careful state design become critical for high-performance operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Graceful Degradation During Failures</strong> defines the availability challenge. What happens when all backends in a pool become unhealthy? Should the load balancer return errors immediately, attempt to route to unhealthy backends anyway, or maintain some form of circuit breaker? The system must fail gracefully rather than catastrophically, providing meaningful error responses to clients while continuing to monitor for backend recovery. This requires sophisticated error handling that distinguishes between different failure modes and responds appropriately to each.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Challenge</th>\n<th>Impact</th>\n<th>Key Considerations</th>\n<th>Common Failure Modes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Distribution</td>\n<td>Performance, Fairness</td>\n<td>Algorithm choice, Request characteristics, Backend capacity</td>\n<td>Hot spots, Uneven distribution, Algorithm bias</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Detection</td>\n<td>Availability, Reliability</td>\n<td>Health check frequency, False positive rate, Recovery timing</td>\n<td>Cascading failures, Premature removal, Thundering herd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Management</td>\n<td>Consistency, Throughput</td>\n<td>Concurrency control, Data races, Lock contention</td>\n<td>Race conditions, Stale state, Deadlocks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Graceful Degradation</td>\n<td>User Experience, System Stability</td>\n<td>Error responses, Fallback strategies, Circuit breaking</td>\n<td>Error storms, Resource exhaustion, Total outage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>The Observability Challenge</strong> emerges as systems scale. When request distribution becomes uneven or backends start failing, operators need visibility into the load balancer&#39;s decision-making process. Which algorithm is active? How are requests being distributed? What&#39;s the current health state of each backend? Are any backends consistently slower than others? Without proper logging and metrics, debugging load balancer issues becomes nearly impossible, especially under production load when problems manifest most acutely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"load-balancing-landscape\">Load Balancing Landscape</h3>\n<p>The load balancing ecosystem offers numerous approaches, each with distinct trade-offs that influence architecture decisions. Understanding these options helps contextualize our design choices and explains why certain approaches are better suited for different scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Hardware vs Software Load Balancers</strong> represents the fundamental deployment choice. Hardware load balancers like F5 BigIP or Citrix ADX offer dedicated processing power, specialized network interfaces, and vendor support, but they&#39;re expensive, difficult to scale horizontally, and create vendor lock-in. They excel in environments requiring extremely high throughput with predictable workloads and established budgets. Software load balancers like HAProxy, NGINX, or our implementation run on commodity hardware, offer greater flexibility, and integrate easily with modern deployment pipelines. They sacrifice some raw performance for operational agility and cost effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing</strong> defines the protocol awareness level. Layer 4 (transport layer) load balancers make routing decisions based on IP addresses and port numbers, operating at the TCP/UDP connection level. They&#39;re fast because they don&#39;t need to parse application protocols, but they can&#39;t make content-aware routing decisions. Layer 7 (application layer) load balancers understand HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and request content, enabling sophisticated routing rules based on user type, API version, or request characteristics. Our implementation operates at Layer 7, parsing HTTP requests to enable features like health checks via HTTP endpoints and potential future enhancements like path-based routing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Layer 7 HTTP Load Balancer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to choose the protocol layer at which our load balancer operates, balancing simplicity with functionality</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Layer 4 TCP proxy, Layer 7 HTTP proxy, Hybrid approach</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Layer 7 HTTP load balancer</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: HTTP awareness enables health checks via HTTP endpoints, better debugging through request logging, and extensibility for future features like path-based routing. The performance overhead is acceptable for learning purposes and typical application workloads</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex implementation due to HTTP parsing, but greater flexibility and observability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n<th>Features</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Use Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Layer 4</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>Basic routing, port-based</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>High throughput, simple routing needs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Layer 7</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Content-aware, rich routing</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Application load balancing, microservices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td>Best of both</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Complex applications with mixed requirements</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Sophistication</strong> varies dramatically across implementations. Simple algorithms like random selection or round-robin are easy to implement and understand but may not handle real-world traffic patterns well. Weighted algorithms account for server capacity differences. Least connections adapts to varying request processing times. Hash-based algorithms provide session affinity. Advanced algorithms like least response time or adaptive algorithms adjust to real-time performance metrics. Our implementation focuses on the most common algorithms that demonstrate key concepts while remaining implementable by intermediate developers.</p>\n<p><strong>Deployment Patterns</strong> influence architecture requirements. Reverse proxy deployment places the load balancer between clients and servers, typically in a DMZ or edge network. Direct server return (DSR) allows backends to respond directly to clients, reducing load balancer bandwidth requirements but complicating network configuration. Service mesh deployment integrates load balancing with service discovery and inter-service communication. Our design assumes reverse proxy deployment, the most common and straightforward pattern for application load balancing.</p>\n<p><strong>Existing Solutions Comparison</strong> helps position our implementation:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Solution</th>\n<th>Strengths</th>\n<th>Weaknesses</th>\n<th>Best For</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HAProxy</td>\n<td>High performance, feature rich, proven</td>\n<td>Complex configuration, steep learning curve</td>\n<td>Production environments, high throughput</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NGINX</td>\n<td>Web server integration, good performance</td>\n<td>Complex for pure load balancing, licensing costs</td>\n<td>Web applications, content serving</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cloud Load Balancers</td>\n<td>Managed service, auto-scaling, integration</td>\n<td>Vendor lock-in, cost, limited customization</td>\n<td>Cloud-native applications, managed operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Envoy Proxy</td>\n<td>Modern architecture, service mesh ready</td>\n<td>Complex, resource intensive</td>\n<td>Microservices, service mesh deployments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Our Implementation</td>\n<td>Educational focus, clear code, customizable</td>\n<td>Limited features, not production-hardened</td>\n<td>Learning, prototyping, custom requirements</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The load balancing landscape reveals a fundamental tension between <strong>simplicity and sophistication</strong>. Simple solutions are easier to understand, debug, and maintain, but they may not handle complex real-world scenarios effectively. Our implementation deliberately chooses educational clarity over feature completeness, providing a solid foundation for understanding core concepts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Configuration and Management</strong> approaches vary from static configuration files to dynamic service discovery integration. Static configuration is simple and predictable but requires manual updates when backends change. Dynamic configuration through APIs or service discovery systems enables automated scaling and deployment but introduces additional complexity and failure modes. Our design supports both approaches, starting with static configuration for simplicity while enabling API-based updates for operational flexibility.</p>\n<p>The choice of implementation language significantly impacts the final system&#39;s characteristics. Go offers excellent HTTP handling, built-in concurrency, and deployment simplicity. Python provides rapid development and extensive libraries but may have performance limitations under high load. JavaScript (Node.js) enables full-stack teams to maintain the load balancer but has different concurrency characteristics. Our primary Go implementation balances performance, clarity, and learning accessibility while supporting other languages for different learning objectives.</p>\n<h3

Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) — this section establishes the scope and boundaries that guide implementation decisions throughout the entire project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-construction-blueprint\">Mental Model: Construction Blueprint</h3>\n<p>Think of this section as the construction blueprint and building permit for our load balancer project. Just as a construction project needs clear specifications about what will be built (a three-story house with specific rooms) and what won&#39;t be built (no swimming pool or garage), our load balancer needs explicit boundaries. The blueprint prevents scope creep during construction — when the contractor suggests adding a hot tub, you can point to the blueprint and say &quot;that&#39;s not in scope.&quot; Similarly, when implementing the load balancer, clear goals prevent feature creep that could derail the learning objectives.</p>\n<p>The building permit analogy extends further: permits specify safety requirements (the building must withstand certain wind loads), quality standards (electrical work must meet code), and timeline expectations (completion within 6 months). Our quality requirements serve the same function — they define performance targets, reliability expectations, and maintainability standards that guide implementation decisions without getting lost in endless optimization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-requirements\">Functional Requirements</h3>\n<p>The functional requirements define the core capabilities that our load balancer must deliver to be considered complete and useful. These requirements map directly to the project milestones and represent the minimum viable functionality needed for a production-ready basic load balancer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-request-distribution\">Core Request Distribution</h4>\n<p>The load balancer must accept incoming HTTP requests on a configurable port and distribute them across multiple backend servers. This fundamental capability forms the foundation of all other features and establishes the reverse proxy pattern that enables traffic distribution.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Milestone</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Request Acceptance</td>\n<td>Accept and parse incoming HTTP requests</td>\n<td>All HTTP methods, headers, and body content preserved</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Forwarding</td>\n<td>Forward requests to backend servers</td>\n<td>Method, path, headers, and body transmitted unchanged</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Relay</td>\n<td>Return backend responses to clients</td>\n<td>Status code, headers, and response body preserved</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Header Enrichment</td>\n<td>Add proxy-specific headers</td>\n<td>X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers added</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Round Robin Distribution</td>\n<td>Cycle through backends sequentially</td>\n<td>Even distribution across healthy backends</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Pool Management</td>\n<td>Manage list of available backends</td>\n<td>Add, remove, and update backend configurations</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The request forwarding capability requires preserving the complete HTTP request context while adapting it for backend communication. This includes handling edge cases like chunked transfer encoding, WebSocket upgrade requests, and large request bodies that exceed memory limits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: HTTP/1.1 Focus</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Modern applications use various HTTP versions including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: HTTP/1.1 only, HTTP/2 support, Multi-version support</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Focus exclusively on HTTP/1.1</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: HTTP/1.1 provides sufficient complexity for learning reverse proxy concepts without the additional protocol complexity of multiplexing and stream management in HTTP/2</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Simplifies implementation and testing while covering 90% of real-world load balancer use cases</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"algorithm-flexibility\">Algorithm Flexibility</h4>\n<p>The load balancer must support multiple distribution algorithms to accommodate different application requirements and traffic patterns. Algorithm selection should be configurable at runtime without requiring service restart.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>round_robin</code></td>\n<td>Sequential selection</td>\n<td>Even load distribution</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>weighted_round_robin</code></td>\n<td>Proportional distribution</td>\n<td>Heterogeneous backend capacity</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>least_connections</code></td>\n<td>Connection-based selection</td>\n<td>Long-lived connections</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ip_hash</code></td>\n<td>Consistent client routing</td>\n<td>Session affinity requirements</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>random</code></td>\n<td>Random selection</td>\n<td>Stateless distribution</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Each algorithm must implement the <code>Algorithm</code> interface with a <code>SelectBackend</code> method that accepts a slice of healthy backends and returns the chosen backend. The selection logic must be thread-safe and handle edge cases like empty backend lists and concurrent access to shared state.</p>\n<p>The weighted round robin algorithm presents particular implementation challenges around smooth weight distribution. Rather than simple repetition (which creates bursts), it should use smooth weighted selection that distributes requests proportionally over time without clustering requests to high-weight backends.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-monitoring-system\">Health Monitoring System</h4>\n<p>Active health checking enables the load balancer to detect backend failures and automatically remove unhealthy servers from rotation. This capability transforms a simple request forwarder into a reliable traffic distribution system that maintains service availability during partial backend failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Check Feature</th>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Configuration Parameter</th>\n<th>Default Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Periodic Probes</td>\n<td>HTTP GET requests to health endpoint</td>\n<td><code>Interval time.Duration</code></td>\n<td>30 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Detection</td>\n<td>Mark unhealthy after consecutive failures</td>\n<td><code>UnhealthyThreshold int</code></td>\n<td>3 failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recovery Detection</td>\n<td>Restore after consecutive successes</td>\n<td><code>HealthyThreshold int</code></td>\n<td>2 successes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Probe Timeout</td>\n<td>Maximum time to wait for response</td>\n<td><code>Timeout time.Duration</code></td>\n<td>5 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Endpoint</td>\n<td>Configurable probe path</td>\n<td><code>Path string</code></td>\n<td>&quot;/health&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health checking system must operate independently of request processing to avoid blocking normal traffic flow. Health state changes should be atomic and immediately reflected in backend selection algorithms. The system must handle edge cases like all backends becoming unhealthy (continue serving with best-effort routing to least-recently-failed backends) and rapid state oscillation (implement dampening to prevent flapping).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Active vs Passive Health Checking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Health can be monitored by sending dedicated probes (active) or inferring from request success rates (passive)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Active only, Passive only, Hybrid approach</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement active health checking only</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Active checking provides predictable failure detection timing and clear pass/fail criteria, making it easier to reason about system behavior during failures</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Adds network overhead from health probes but ensures consistent failure detection regardless of traffic patterns</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"quality-requirements\">Quality Requirements</h3>\n<p>Quality requirements define the non-functional characteristics that make the load balancer suitable for production use. These requirements establish performance baselines, reliability expectations, and operational characteristics that guide implementation decisions throughout the project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"performance-characteristics\">Performance Characteristics</h4>\n<p>The load balancer must handle realistic traffic loads without becoming a bottleneck between clients and backend services. Performance requirements focus on throughput, latency, and resource utilization under normal and peak load conditions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Metric</th>\n<th>Target</th>\n<th>Measurement Method</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Throughput</td>\n<td>1000 requests/second</td>\n<td>Load testing with concurrent clients</td>\n<td>Handles typical web application traffic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Latency Overhead</td>\n<td>&lt;5ms median added latency</td>\n<td>Comparison with direct backend access</td>\n<td>Minimal impact on response times</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Usage</td>\n<td>&lt;100MB baseline</td>\n<td>Process memory monitoring</td>\n<td>Lightweight deployment footprint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Pooling</td>\n<td>Reuse backend connections</td>\n<td>Monitor connection count vs request rate</td>\n<td>Reduce connection establishment overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Selection Time</td>\n<td>&lt;1ms for backend selection</td>\n<td>Benchmark algorithm implementations</td>\n<td>No bottleneck in request path</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Performance testing should use realistic request patterns including varying request sizes, concurrent connections, and sustained load over extended periods. The load balancer should demonstrate consistent performance without memory leaks or degradation over time.</p>\n<p>Connection pooling efficiency significantly impacts performance characteristics. The reverse proxy component must maintain persistent connections to backend servers and reuse them across multiple client requests. Connection pool sizing should balance resource usage with the ability to handle traffic bursts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reliability-and-fault-tolerance\">Reliability and Fault Tolerance</h4>\n<p>The load balancer must continue operating effectively during various failure scenarios including backend server outages, network partitions, and partial system degradation. Reliability requirements define how the system behaves under stress and failure conditions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Reliability Requirement</th>\n<th>Behavior</th>\n<th>Recovery Expectation</th>\n<th>Implementation Need</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend Server Failure</td>\n<td>Remove failed backends from rotation</td>\n<td>Automatic restoration after recovery</td>\n<td>Health checking integration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All Backends Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Continue serving with degraded routing</td>\n<td>Route to least-recently-failed backends</td>\n<td>Graceful degradation logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Partition</td>\n<td>Timeout and retry failed requests</td>\n<td>Client receives 502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td>Timeout configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Reload</td>\n<td>Update settings without dropping connections</td>\n<td>Zero-downtime configuration changes</td>\n<td>Hot reload mechanism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High Load Handling</td>\n<td>Maintain service under traffic spikes</td>\n<td>Graceful performance degradation</td>\n<td>Backpressure and circuit breaking</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The system must implement graceful degradation strategies that maintain partial service availability rather than complete failure during adverse conditions. When all backends are unhealthy, the load balancer should attempt to route requests to the most recently healthy backends rather than rejecting all requests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Fail-Fast vs Circuit Breaker</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When backends fail, the load balancer can either immediately return errors (fail-fast) or temporarily stop trying failed backends (circuit breaker)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate failure responses, Simple circuit breaker, Adaptive circuit breaker</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement fail-fast with health check-based recovery</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Health checking provides the circuit breaker functionality with explicit recovery detection, avoiding the complexity of adaptive thresholds while ensuring failed backends are retried systematically</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Simpler implementation with predictable behavior, but may not handle transient failures as gracefully as adaptive circuit breakers</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"maintainability-and-observability\">Maintainability and Observability</h4>\n<p>The load balancer must provide sufficient operational visibility and maintainable code structure to support ongoing development and production operations. These requirements ensure the system can be debugged, monitored, and extended effectively.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Maintainability Aspect</th>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Logging</td>\n<td>Log all proxied requests with timing</td>\n<td>Structured logging with timestamp, method, path, backend, status</td>\n<td>Request tracing and debugging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Check Logging</td>\n<td>Log health state changes</td>\n<td>State transition logging with backend and reason</td>\n<td>Health debugging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Validation</td>\n<td>Validate config on load with clear errors</td>\n<td>Schema validation with specific error messages</td>\n<td>Prevent misconfiguration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Categorization</td>\n<td>Distinguish error types in responses</td>\n<td>Different HTTP status codes for different failures</td>\n<td>Client error handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Code Organization</td>\n<td>Separate concerns into focused modules</td>\n<td>Interface-based design with clear boundaries</td>\n<td>Easy testing and extension</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Logging must be structured and configurable to support both development debugging and production monitoring. Request logs should include sufficient information to trace request flow without overwhelming log storage. Health check logs should clearly indicate why state changes occurred to support operational troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>The code organization should follow Go package conventions with clear separation between HTTP handling, backend management, algorithm implementation, and health checking. Each component should have well-defined interfaces that enable independent testing and future extension.</p>\n<h3 id=\"out-of-scope\">Out of Scope</h3>\n<p>Explicitly defining features that are NOT included in this basic load balancer helps maintain focus on the core learning objectives and prevents scope creep during implementation. These exclusions represent functionality that would be added in a production load balancer but would complicate the learning experience.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ssltls-termination\">SSL/TLS Termination</h4>\n<p>The load balancer will NOT handle SSL/TLS encryption or certificate management.

The <strong>arrivals hall</strong> receives all incoming passengers (HTTP requests) and directs them to a <strong>central information desk</strong> (request router). The information desk consults the <strong>gate assignment board</strong> (backend manager) to determine which gate (backend server) should handle each passenger, using different strategies like sending passengers to the gate with the shortest line or rotating through gates in order.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, <strong>gate monitors</strong> (health checkers) continuously verify that each gate is operational and ready to accept passengers. If a gate closes for maintenance, the monitors immediately update the assignment board so no passengers are sent there. The <strong>traffic control algorithms</strong> (load balancing algorithms) determine the specific logic for choosing gates - whether it&#39;s simple rotation, sending passengers to the least crowded gate, or ensuring frequent flyers always go to their preferred gate.</p>\n<p>This mental model captures the key architectural insight: <strong>separation of concerns between request handling, backend management, health monitoring, and selection algorithms</strong>. Each component has a distinct responsibility but must coordinate seamlessly to provide a unified service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Load Balancer System Architecture\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"system-components\">System Components</h3>\n<p>The load balancer architecture consists of four core components that work together to provide reliable request distribution across multiple backend servers. Each component has clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces, enabling modular development and testing while maintaining loose coupling between subsystems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"http-reverse-proxy-component\">HTTP Reverse Proxy Component</h4>\n<p>The <strong>HTTP Reverse Proxy</strong> serves as the system&#39;s entry point, accepting incoming client connections and forwarding requests to selected backend servers. This component handles all the low-level HTTP protocol details, connection management, and request/response translation between clients and backends. It abstracts away the complexity of HTTP communication so other components can focus on their specific responsibilities.</p>\n<p>The reverse proxy maintains connection pools to backend servers for efficiency, implements request and response buffering to handle variable network speeds, and adds standard proxy headers like <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> to preserve client information. When backend selection fails or no healthy backends are available, the proxy generates appropriate HTTP error responses to clients.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Interface Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Acceptance</td>\n<td>Listen on configured port and accept HTTP connections</td>\n<td><code>ListenAndServe(port int) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Parsing</td>\n<td>Parse HTTP method, path, headers, and body</td>\n<td><code>parseRequest(*http.Request) (*ProxyRequest, error)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Communication</td>\n<td>Forward requests to selected backend servers</td>\n<td><code>forwardRequest(*ProxyRequest, *Backend) (*ProxyResponse, error)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Relay</td>\n<td>Return backend responses to original clients</td>\n<td><code>sendResponse(http.ResponseWriter, *ProxyResponse) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Management</td>\n<td>Handle keep-alive, timeouts, and connection pooling</td>\n<td><code>getConnection(*Backend) (*http.Client, error)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Response Generation</td>\n<td>Generate 502 Bad Gateway and other error responses</td>\n<td><code>sendErrorResponse(http.ResponseWriter, int, string) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"backend-pool-manager\">Backend Pool Manager</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Backend Pool Manager</strong> maintains the authoritative registry of all backend servers and their current operational state. This component tracks which backends are available, their configuration parameters like weights, and their real-time health status. It provides a clean interface for other components to query available backends without exposing internal state management complexity.</p>\n<p>The backend manager handles dynamic configuration updates, allowing backends to be added or removed without service interruption. It maintains thread-safe access to the backend pool since multiple goroutines will be selecting backends concurrently for different client requests. The manager also coordinates with the health checking system to update backend availability in real-time.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Interface Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend Registration</td>\n<td>Add and remove backends from the active pool</td>\n<td><code>AddBackend(config BackendConfig) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Management</td>\n<td>Track health status, weights, and connection counts</td>\n<td><code>UpdateBackendState(*Backend, *HealthResult) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Queries</td>\n<td>Provide filtered views of healthy/available backends</td>\n<td><code>GetHealthyBackends() []*Backend</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Updates</td>\n<td>Handle dynamic backend pool changes</td>\n<td><code>UpdatePool([]BackendConfig) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrency Safety</td>\n<td>Ensure thread-safe access to shared backend state</td>\n<td><code>lockBackends() *sync.RWMutex</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Statistics Tracking</td>\n<td>Maintain request counts and performance metrics</td>\n<td><code>GetBackendStats(*Backend) *BackendStats</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"health-checking-system\">Health Checking System</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Health Checking System</strong> runs as a background process that continuously monitors backend server availability through periodic HTTP health probes. This component implements the failure detection and recovery logic that automatically removes unhealthy backends from rotation and restores them when they recover. The health checker operates independently of request processing to provide consistent monitoring regardless of traffic patterns.</p>\n<p>The health checking system maintains separate state for each backend&#39;s health status, including consecutive failure counts, last check timestamps, and response time metrics. It implements configurable thresholds for marking backends as unhealthy (consecutive failures) and healthy (consecutive successes), providing tunable sensitivity to transient issues versus persistent failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Interface Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Periodic Probing</td>\n<td>Send HTTP health checks at configured intervals</td>\n<td><code>startHealthChecks(interval time.Duration) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Detection</td>\n<td>Count consecutive failures and mark backends unhealthy</td>\n<td><code>processHealthResult(*Backend, *HealthResult) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recovery Detection</td>\n<td>Detect recovered backends and restore to rotation</td>\n<td><code>checkRecovery(*Backend) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health State Updates</td>\n<td>Notify backend manager of health status changes</td>\n<td><code>updateHealthStatus(*Backend, bool) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Management</td>\n<td>Handle health check settings and endpoint changes</td>\n<td><code>UpdateHealthConfig(*HealthCheckConfig) error</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monitoring Integration</td>\n<td>Expose health metrics for operational visibility</td>\n<td><code>GetHealthMetrics() *HealthMetrics</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"load-balancing-algorithm-engines\">Load Balancing Algorithm Engines</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Algorithm Engines</strong> implement the various strategies for selecting which backend server should handle each incoming request. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate component that conforms to a common interface, enabling runtime algorithm switching and easy addition of new selection strategies. The algorithms operate on the filtered list of healthy backends provided by the backend manager.</p>\n<p>Different algorithms optimize for different goals: round robin provides even distribution, least connections minimizes server load, weighted algorithms allow capacity-based distribution, and hash-based algorithms provide session affinity.

The request processing pipeline involves multiple decision points where different failure scenarios can occur, requiring careful error handling and fallback logic at each stage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"normal-request-processing-flow\">Normal Request Processing Flow</h4>\n<p>The typical request flow begins when a client establishes an HTTP connection to the load balancer&#39;s listening port. The reverse proxy accepts the connection and parses the incoming HTTP request, extracting the method, path, headers, and body content. This parsing step validates that the request is well-formed and can be successfully forwarded to a backend server.</p>\n<p>Once the request is parsed, the reverse proxy consults the backend pool manager to obtain the current list of healthy, available backends. If no backends are available, the proxy immediately returns a 503 Service Unavailable response to the client without attempting backend selection. This fail-fast approach prevents unnecessary processing and provides clear error feedback.</p>\n<p>When healthy backends are available, the reverse proxy invokes the currently configured load balancing algorithm to select the specific backend that should handle this request. The algorithm receives the list of healthy backends and returns its selection based on the algorithm&#39;s internal logic and state. For example, round robin increments its counter and selects the next backend in sequence, while least connections examines the active connection count for each backend.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Processing Stage</th>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Error Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Accept</td>\n<td>HTTP Reverse Proxy</td>\n<td>Client TCP connection</td>\n<td>Parsed HTTP request</td>\n<td>Malformed HTTP, connection timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Pool Query</td>\n<td>Backend Pool Manager</td>\n<td>Health status filter</td>\n<td>List of healthy backends</td>\n<td>No healthy backends available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Selection</td>\n<td>Load Balancing Algorithm</td>\n<td>Healthy backend list</td>\n<td>Selected backend</td>\n<td>Algorithm state corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Forwarding</td>\n<td>HTTP Reverse Proxy</td>\n<td>Request + selected backend</td>\n<td>Backend HTTP response</td>\n<td>Backend connection failure, timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Relay</td>\n<td>HTTP Reverse Proxy</td>\n<td>Backend response</td>\n<td>Client receives response</td>\n<td>Client connection dropped</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"backend-selection-and-forwarding\">Backend Selection and Forwarding</h4>\n<p>After the algorithm selects a target backend, the reverse proxy establishes or reuses an HTTP connection to that backend server. The proxy modifies the original request by adding standard forwarding headers (<code>X-Forwarded-For</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code>) and potentially modifying the <code>Host</code> header to match the backend&#39;s expected hostname.</p>\n<p>The request forwarding process involves streaming the request body to the backend while handling potential network issues like slow clients or backends. The reverse proxy implements appropriate timeouts to prevent connections from hanging indefinitely and monitors for connection failures that indicate the backend has become unavailable.</p>\n<p>When the backend responds, the reverse proxy receives the HTTP response including status code, headers, and body. The response is then streamed back to the original client, preserving all headers and status information. Throughout this process, the proxy maintains connection state and updates any relevant metrics like active connection counts needed by the least connections algorithm.</p>\n<h4 id=\"error-handling-and-fallback-logic\">Error Handling and Fallback Logic</h4>\n<p>Multiple failure scenarios can occur during request processing, each requiring specific error handling logic. <strong>Connection failures</strong> occur when the selected backend is unreachable due to network issues or the backend service being down. In this case, the reverse proxy returns a 502 Bad Gateway response and may trigger an immediate health check to update the backend&#39;s status.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeout failures</strong> happen when a backend accepts the connection but takes too long to respond. The reverse proxy enforces configurable timeouts for connection establishment, request sending, and response reading. When timeouts occur, the proxy closes the backend connection and returns a 504 Gateway Timeout response to the client.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend unavailability</strong> occurs when no healthy backends are available to handle requests. This situation requires careful handling because it represents a complete service outage from the client&#39;s perspective. The reverse proxy returns a 503 Service Unavailable response with appropriate retry-after headers to guide client behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: The request flow must be designed to fail fast and provide clear error signals rather than hanging indefinitely. Each component should have bounded processing time and clear error propagation to prevent cascading failures that could affect other concurrent requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The request flow also handles <strong>partial failures</strong> where some backends are available but others are not. The load balancing algorithm automatically excludes unhealthy backends from selection, allowing the system to continue operating with reduced capacity. This graceful degradation is essential for maintaining service availability during backend maintenance or failures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"concurrency-and-thread-safety\">Concurrency and Thread Safety</h4>\n<p>Multiple client requests are processed concurrently, requiring careful coordination between components to maintain consistency. The backend pool manager uses read-write locks to allow concurrent read access to the backend list while serializing updates from health checks or configuration changes. Each load balancing algorithm implements its own thread safety mechanisms appropriate for its internal state.</p>\n<p>The reverse proxy creates separate goroutines for each client connection, enabling high concurrency without blocking. However, shared resources like connection pools and algorithm state require proper synchronization to prevent race conditions. The system uses atomic operations for simple counters and mutexes for more complex shared state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-project-structure\">Recommended Project Structure</h3>\n<p>Organizing the codebase into clear modules and packages is essential for managing the complexity of the load balancer system. The recommended structure separates concerns along component boundaries while providing clear interfaces between modules. This organization supports incremental development through the project milestones and makes testing individual components straightforward.</p>\n<h4 id=\"top-level-project-organization\">Top-Level Project Organization</h4>\n<p>The project follows Go&#39;s standard layout conventions with clearly separated packages for each major component.

established here supports HTTP proxy functionality (Milestone 1), request distribution across backends (Milestone 2), health checking implementation (Milestone 3), and multiple algorithm support (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-medical-patient-chart\">Mental Model: Medical Patient Chart</h3>\n<p>Think of the load balancer&#39;s data model like a comprehensive medical patient chart system. Each <strong>backend server</strong> is like a patient with a complete medical record — we track their identity (address, capabilities), current health status (vital signs), medical history (past health check results), and care instructions (weight for treatment priority). The <strong>health state model</strong> is like the vital signs monitoring system — it continuously tracks each patient&#39;s condition, records when they&#39;re healthy or sick, and maintains a timeline of their health changes. The <strong>configuration schema</strong> acts like the hospital&#39;s treatment protocols — it defines how often to check patients, what constitutes healthy vs unhealthy readings, which treatment algorithms to use, and how to prioritize care based on patient needs.</p>\n<p>Just as a hospital must maintain accurate, up-to-date records for each patient while following standardized protocols for care delivery, our load balancer maintains detailed state for each backend while following configurable rules for traffic distribution and health management. The data structures must be precise, consistent, and accessible to all components that need to make routing and health decisions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-data-architecture-challenge\">The Data Architecture Challenge</h3>\n<p>The load balancer&#39;s effectiveness hinges on maintaining accurate, consistent state about backend servers while supporting real-time decision making under high request volume. The primary data modeling challenges include:</p>\n<p><strong>State Consistency</strong>: Multiple goroutines simultaneously read backend health states for routing decisions while health checkers update the same state based on probe results. The data model must prevent race conditions while maintaining performance under concurrent access patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration Flexibility</strong>: The system must support runtime configuration changes without service interruption. This requires data structures that can be atomically swapped, validated incrementally, and merged with existing state while preserving ongoing connections and health check schedules.</p>\n<p><strong>Health State Accuracy</strong>: Health information becomes stale quickly in distributed systems. The data model must capture not just current health status, but health history, check timestamps, and transition patterns to enable sophisticated failure detection and recovery logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Extensibility</strong>: Different load balancing algorithms require different metadata about backends. Round robin needs simple ordering, weighted algorithms need numeric weights, least connections needs active connection counts, and hash-based algorithms need consistent identification. The backend model must accommodate these varied requirements without algorithm-specific coupling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model.svg\" alt=\"Core Data Structures\"></p>\n<p>The data model consists of three primary layers: the <strong>Backend Server Model</strong> that represents individual servers with all their associated state, the <strong>Health State Model</strong> that captures the current and historical health status of each backend, and the <strong>Configuration Schema</strong> that defines how the load balancer should operate. These models interact through well-defined interfaces that support both high-frequency read operations (request routing) and periodic write operations (health updates, configuration changes).</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-server-model\">Backend Server Model</h3>\n<p>The backend server model represents an individual application server that can receive proxied requests from the load balancer. This model must capture all information necessary for routing decisions, health tracking, connection management, and algorithm-specific metadata.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-backend-structure\">Core Backend Structure</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique identifier generated from URL, used for consistent hashing and logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>URL</td>\n<td>*url.URL</td>\n<td>Parsed backend server address including scheme, host, and port</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Relative weight for weighted round robin algorithms (default: 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ActiveConnections</td>\n<td>*int64</td>\n<td>Current number of active HTTP connections (atomic access required)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HealthState</td>\n<td>*HealthState</td>\n<td>Current health status and check history (pointer for atomic updates)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Timestamp when backend was added to pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastUsed</td>\n<td>*time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent request routing timestamp (atomic updates)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metadata</td>\n<td>map[string]interface{}</td>\n<td>Algorithm-specific data storage for extensibility</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>Backend</code> structure serves as the central representation of a backend server throughout its lifecycle in the load balancer. The ID field provides a stable identifier that persists across configuration reloads and enables consistent hash calculations for session affinity algorithms. The URL field stores the parsed destination address, eliminating repeated parsing during request forwarding.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Using atomic pointers for frequently updated fields like <code>ActiveConnections</code> and <code>LastUsed</code> prevents race conditions during concurrent request processing while maintaining read performance for routing decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The weight field supports proportional traffic distribution in weighted algorithms. A weight of 0 effectively disables the backend without removing it from the pool, while higher weights increase the backend&#39;s share of traffic proportionally. The metadata map provides an extension point for algorithms that need custom state without modifying the core backend structure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"connection-tracking-interface\">Connection Tracking Interface</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>IncrementConnections</td>\n<td>backend *Backend</td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Atomically increments active connection count and returns new value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DecrementConnections</td>\n<td>backend *Backend</td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Atomically decrements active connection count and returns new value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GetActiveConnections</td>\n<td>backend *Backend</td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Reads current active connection count atomically</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SetLastUsed</td>\n<td>backend *Backend, timestamp time.Time</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>Atomically updates the last request timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GetLastUsed</td>\n<td>backend *Backend</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Reads the last used timestamp atomically</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Connection tracking enables the least connections algorithm while providing observability into backend utilization.

This optimistic initialization allows new backends to receive traffic immediately while health checking begins in the background.</p>\n<p>The <code>Clone</code> method supports atomic backend pool updates during configuration reloads. Rather than modifying backends in-place, configuration changes create new backend instances and atomically swap the entire pool. This prevents partial state inconsistencies during updates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Implementation Detail</strong>: The <code>IsHealthy</code> method must read the health state atomically to prevent seeing partial health state updates during health check transitions.

For example, reading the <code>Healthy</code> boolean while another goroutine updates consecutive failure counts can see inconsistent state where a backend appears healthy but has high failure counts.</p>\n<p><em>Why it&#39;s wrong</em>: Concurrent access to shared state without synchronization causes data races that can lead to incorrect routing decisions, such as sending traffic to unhealthy backends or incorrectly marking healthy backends as failed.</p>\n<p><em>How to fix</em>: Use atomic operations for simple fields or protect the entire health state with a read-write mutex. Better yet, make health state immutable and use atomic pointer swaps for updates, ensuring readers always see consistent state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Configuration Validation After Startup</strong></p>\n<p>Some implementations only validate configuration during initial loading, allowing invalid configurations to be applied during runtime updates. This can cause the load balancer to fail when applying configuration changes, potentially leaving it in an inconsistent state.</p>\n<p><em>Why it&#39;s wrong</em>: Runtime configuration updates without validation can introduce invalid settings that crash the load balancer or cause subtle behavioral issues that are difficult to diagnose.</p>\n<p><em>How to fix</em>: Always validate configuration changes before applying them. Create a staging configuration, validate all fields and dependencies, then atomically swap to the new configuration only if validation succeeds. Keep the previous valid configuration as a rollback option.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Connection Tracking</strong></p>\n<p>Implementations often increment connection counters on request start but fail to decrement them on all exit paths (normal completion, client disconnect, backend failure). This causes connection counts to grow indefinitely, breaking the least connections algorithm.</p>\n<p><em>Why it&#39;s wrong</em>: Inaccurate connection counts cause traffic distribution problems and eventually integer overflow. The least connections algorithm becomes useless when counts don&#39;t reflect actual connections.</p>\n<p><em>How to fix</em>: Use defer statements or finally blocks to ensure connection counters are decremented on all exit paths. Implement connection count auditing that periodically verifies counts match actual connection states and resets counters if they diverge significantly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health State History Memory Growth</strong></p>\n<p>Storing unlimited health check history in the <code>StateChanges</code> slice causes memory usage to grow without bound over time, especially for backends with frequent state changes due to intermittent issues.</p>\n<p><em>Why it&#39;s wrong</em>: Unbounded memory growth eventually causes the load balancer to run out of memory, particularly in environments with many backends or frequent health state transitions.</p>\n<p><em>How to fix</em>: Limit the state change history to a fixed number of recent entries (e.g., last 100 changes) using a circular buffer or by trimming old entries when adding new ones. Archive detailed history to external monitoring systems if needed for analysis.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Backend ID Collisions</strong></p>\n<p>Generating backend IDs from URLs without proper normalization can create collisions when the same backend is specified with different URL formats (e.g., &quot;<a href=\"http://api.example.com\">http://api.example.com</a>&quot; vs &quot;<a href=\"http://api.example.com/\">http://api.example.com/</a>&quot;). This causes backends to overwrite each other during configuration updates.</p>\n<p><em>Why it&#39;s wrong</em>: Backend collisions result in lost configuration, unpredictable behavior during updates, and difficulty tracking specific backends in logs and metrics.</p>\n<p><em>How to fix</em>: Normalize URLs before generating IDs by parsing the URL, standardizing the scheme/host/port format, and removing trailing slashes. Use the normalized form consistently for ID generation and backend comparison.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology

id=\"http-reverse-proxy-component\">HTTP Reverse Proxy Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (HTTP Proxy Foundation) — this component implements the core reverse proxy functionality that forwards HTTP requests between clients and backend servers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-relay-runner\">Mental Model: Relay Runner</h3>\n<p>Think of the HTTP reverse proxy as a <strong>relay runner</strong> in a communication chain between two parties who cannot speak directly to each other. Imagine you&#39;re at an international conference where a client speaks only English and a backend server speaks only French. The reverse proxy acts as a bilingual interpreter who:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Receives the message</strong> from the English-speaking client, understanding exactly what they want to say</li>\n<li><strong>Translates and forwards</strong> the message to the French-speaking backend server, preserving all the nuances and context</li>\n<li><strong>Waits for the response</strong> from the backend server, maintaining the connection and context</li>\n<li><strong>Translates and relays</strong> the response back to the original client, ensuring nothing is lost in translation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The key insight is that the reverse proxy is <strong>transparent to both parties</strong> — the client thinks they&#39;re talking directly to the backend server, and the backend server thinks the proxy is the original client. This transparency is crucial because it allows the load balancer to sit invisibly between clients and servers, distributing traffic without either side needing to be aware of the load balancing happening.</p>\n<p>Unlike a forward proxy (which acts on behalf of clients), a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the servers. It&#39;s positioned at the server side of the network, accepting requests that clients think are going directly to the origin server, then deciding which actual backend server should handle each request.</p>\n<p>The relay runner analogy helps us understand the three critical responsibilities: <strong>message fidelity</strong> (preserving all headers, body content, and HTTP semantics), <strong>connection management</strong> (maintaining efficient communication channels), and <strong>error handling</strong> (gracefully managing situations when the backend server is unavailable or unresponsive).</p>\n<h3 id=\"request-forwarding-logic\">Request Forwarding Logic</h3>\n<p>The request forwarding logic forms the heart of the reverse proxy, responsible for accepting incoming HTTP requests and faithfully relaying them to selected backend servers. This process involves careful parsing, modification, and transmission of HTTP messages while preserving their semantic meaning and ensuring proper error handling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Frequest-flow.svg\" alt=\"Request Processing Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The request forwarding process follows a structured sequence of steps that ensures reliable message transmission:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Accept the incoming connection</strong> from the client on the configured proxy port, establishing a TCP connection that will carry the HTTP request</li>\n<li><strong>Parse the HTTP request</strong> using Go&#39;s built-in HTTP server capabilities, extracting the method, path, headers, and body into a structured request object</li>\n<li><strong>Select the target backend</strong> by consulting the backend manager and load balancing algorithm to determine which server should handle this request</li>\n<li><strong>Clone and modify the request</strong> by creating a new HTTP request object with the backend server&#39;s URL while preserving the original method, path, and body</li>\n<li><strong>Add proxy headers</strong> including <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> (client&#39;s IP address), <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> (original protocol), and <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> (original host header)</li>\n<li><strong>Establish backend connection</strong> using the HTTP client&#39;s connection pool, leveraging keep-alive connections when possible for efficiency</li>\n<li><strong>Forward the request</strong> by writing the modified request to the backend server, including all headers and streaming the body content</li>\n<li><strong>Handle connection errors</strong> by catching network failures, timeouts, and other transport-level issues that prevent request delivery</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The request forwarding mechanism must handle several critical aspects of HTTP semantics correctly. <strong>Method preservation</strong> ensures that GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods are forwarded exactly as received, maintaining the intended operation semantics. <strong>Header forwarding</strong> requires careful attention to which headers should be passed through unchanged, which should be modified, and which should be stripped or added by the proxy.</p>\n<p><strong>Body handling</strong> presents particular challenges because HTTP request bodies can be large and may arrive as streaming data. The proxy must efficiently forward body content without loading entire payloads into memory, using Go&#39;s <code>io.Copy</code> or similar streaming mechanisms to transfer data directly from the client connection to the backend connection.</p>\n<p>The forwarding logic maintains a <strong>request context</strong> throughout the process, allowing for proper timeout handling, cancellation propagation, and resource cleanup. This context carries deadlines from the original client request and enables the proxy to cancel backend requests if the client disconnects or times out.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Request Component</th>\n<th>Forwarding Behavior</th>\n<th>Modification Required</th>\n<th>Error Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Method</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Invalid methods return 400 Bad Request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Path</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Malformed paths return 400 Bad Request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Query Parameters</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Invalid encoding returns 400 Bad Request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Host Header</td>\n<td>Replace with backend host</td>\n<td>Set to backend server address</td>\n<td>Missing host returns 400 Bad Request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Content-Length</td>\n<td>Pass through if present</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Mismatched length returns 400 Bad Request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transfer-Encoding</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Unsupported encodings return 501 Not Implemented</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Invalid format passed to backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User-Agent</td>\n<td>Pass through unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Missing user agent is acceptable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>X-Forwarded-For</td>\n<td>Add or append client IP</td>\n<td>Append to existing or create new</td>\n<td>Network errors logged but not fatal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>X-Forwarded-Proto</td>\n<td>Set to original protocol</td>\n<td>Set to &quot;http&quot; or &quot;https&quot;</td>\n<td>Default to &quot;http&quot; if uncertain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>Strip and handle internally</td>\n<td>Remove hop-by-hop header</td>\n<td>Invalid values ignored</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: The proxy must act as a <strong>protocol translator</strong> while maintaining semantic fidelity. Every HTTP request has multiple layers of meaning — the transport layer (TCP connection), the HTTP protocol layer (methods, headers, status codes), and the application layer (body content, authentication tokens). The proxy must preserve meaning at all layers while translating between different network endpoints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection management</strong> during request forwarding requires careful attention to resource lifecycle. The proxy must track active requests to prevent resource leaks, implement appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging connections, and properly close connections when errors occur or requests complete.</p>\n<p>Error scenarios during request forwarding fall into several categories that require different handling strategies. <strong>Network connectivity errors</strong> occur when the backend server is unreachable, the connection is refused, or DNS resolution fails — these should result in a 502 Bad Gateway response. <strong>Timeout errors</strong> happen when backend servers accept connections but don&#39;t respond within configured limits — these also generate 502 responses but may trigger health check updates. <strong>Protocol errors</strong> arise from malformed HTTP responses or unexpected connection closures — these require careful error response generation to avoid leaving clients hanging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"response-processing\">Response Processing</h3>\n<p>Response processing handles the return path of the HTTP proxy flow, receiving responses from backend servers and relaying them back to the original clients. This process requires careful attention to HTTP status codes, header handling, body streaming, and error recovery to ensure clients receive complete and correct responses.</p>\n<p>The response processing workflow mirrors the request forwarding process but operates in reverse, with additional complexity around error response generation and connection cleanup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Receive the backend response</strong> by reading the HTTP response from the established backend connection, parsing status code, headers, and preparing for body streaming</li>\n<li><strong>Validate response integrity</strong> by checking for proper HTTP format, valid status codes, and consistent header values that indicate a well-formed response</li>\n<li><strong>Process response headers</strong> by forwarding most headers unchanged while stripping hop-by-hop headers and adding any proxy-specific headers needed by clients</li>\n<li><strong>Set response status</strong> by copying the backend&#39;s HTTP status code to the client response, ensuring proper status line formatting and reason phrase handling</li>\n<li><strong>Stream response body</strong> by efficiently copying the backend response body to the client connection without buffering large payloads in memory</li>\n<li><strong>Handle streaming errors</strong> by detecting network failures during body transfer and implementing appropriate error recovery or connection termination</li>\n<li><strong>Clean up connections</strong> by properly closing backend connections when appropriate and returning them to connection pools for reuse when possible</li>\n<li><strong>Log response completion</strong> by recording the final status, bytes transferred, and timing information for monitoring and debugging purposes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Response header processing requires understanding which headers are safe to forward and which require special handling. <strong>Content headers</strong> like <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code> must be forwarded exactly as received to ensure proper client interpretation. <strong>Caching headers</strong> including <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>ETag</code>, and <code>Expires</code> should be passed through to allow client-side and intermediate proxy caching to function correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Security-related headers</strong> such as <code>Set-Cookie</code>, <code>Authorization</code>, and custom authentication headers must be forwarded carefully to maintain application functionality while not exposing sensitive proxy internals. <strong>CORS headers</strong> including <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> and related directives should be passed through unchanged to preserve cross-origin request handling.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Header Category</th>\n<th>Forwarding Policy</th>\n<th>Modification Required</th>\n<th>Special Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Content Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Critical for proper client parsing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caching Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Enables downstream caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Required for authentication flows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CORS Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Needed for browser cross-origin requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>May reveal backend server information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Date Headers</td>\n<td>Forward unchanged</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Important for cache validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Headers</td>\n<td>Strip from response</td>\n<td>Remove hop-by-hop headers</td>\n<td>Proxy manages connections independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proxy Headers</td>\n<td>Add if configured</td>\n<td>May add Via or X-Forwarded headers</td>\n<td>Optional proxy identification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Response body streaming</strong> represents a critical performance and resource management concern. The proxy must handle response bodies of arbitrary size without consuming excessive memory, support various <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> formats including chunked encoding, and maintain streaming efficiency even for large payloads like file downloads or media content.</p>\n<p>The streaming implementation uses Go&#39;s <code>io.Copy</code> function or similar mechanisms to create a direct pipe between the backend response body reader and the client response writer. This approach avoids loading response content into proxy memory while maintaining high throughput and low latency.</p>\n<p><strong>Error response generation</strong> becomes necessary when backend servers fail to respond properly or when network errors occur during response processing. The proxy must generate appropriate HTTP error responses that inform clients about the failure while providing sufficient information for debugging without exposing sensitive backend details.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Scenario</th>\n<th>HTTP Status Code</th>\n<th>Response Body</th>\n<th>Client Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend connection refused</td>\n<td>502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td>&quot;Backend server unavailable&quot;</td>\n<td>Retry or use alternative endpoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend connection timeout</td>\n<td>502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td>&quot;Backend server timeout&quot;</td>\n<td>Retry with longer timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend returns invalid HTTP</td>\n<td>502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td>&quot;Invalid backend response&quot;</td>\n<td>Check backend server status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response body streaming error</td>\n<td>Connection closed</td>\n<td>Partial response already sent</td>\n<td>Client must handle incomplete response</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend returns 5xx error</td>\n<td>Forward status unchanged</td>\n<td>Forward backend error response</td>\n<td>Client handles backend application error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proxy internal error</td>\n<td>500 Internal Server Error</td>\n<td>&quot;Proxy processing error&quot;</td>\n<td>Contact proxy administrator</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Principle</strong>: Response processing must maintain <strong>streaming semantics</strong> to support real-time applications, large file transfers, and long-polling connections. Buffering entire responses in proxy memory would create scalability bottlenecks and increase latency, violating the transparency principle of reverse proxying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection lifecycle management</strong> during response processing involves coordinating between client and backend connections. When responses complete successfully, backend connections should be returned to the connection pool for reuse when using HTTP keep-alive. When errors occur, connections may need to be closed and discarded to prevent connection state corruption.</p>\n<p>The response processing logic must also handle <strong>partial response scenarios</strong> where backend connections fail or close unexpectedly after the response has started streaming to the client. In these cases, the proxy cannot send a different HTTP status code (since headers have already been sent) and must log the error while closing the client connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-pool-management\">Connection Pool Management</h3>\n<p>Connection pool management optimizes the reverse proxy&#39;s network efficiency by reusing HTTP connections to backend servers, reducing the overhead of establishing new TCP connections for each request. This component manages connection lifecycle, implements keep-alive functionality, and handles connection limits and timeouts to ensure reliable and performant backend communication.</p>\n<p>The connection pool operates as a <strong>shared resource manager</strong> that coordinates connection allocation across concurrent requests. When a request needs to communicate with a backend server, it requests a connection from the pool rather than establishing a new one. After the request completes, the connection returns to the pool for reuse by subsequent requests to the same backend.</p>\n<p>Go&#39;s built-in <code>http.Client</code> and <code>http.Transport</code> provide robust connection pooling capabilities that the reverse proxy leverages. The <code>http.Transport</code> automatically manages connection pools per backend server, implements HTTP/1.1 keep-alive semantics, and handles connection limits and timeouts according to configured parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection pool configuration</strong> requires balancing several competing concerns: <strong>connection reuse efficiency</strong> (higher limits reduce connection establishment overhead), <strong>resource consumption</strong> (connection pools consume memory and file descriptors), and <strong>backend server protection</strong> (too many connections can overwhelm backend servers).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Configuration Parameter</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Default Value</th>\n<th>Tuning Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>MaxIdleConns</td>\n<td>Total idle connections across all backends</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>Higher values reduce connection establishment but consume memory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxIdleConnsPerHost</td>\n<td>Idle connections per backend server</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Should match expected concurrency per backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxConnsPerHost</td>\n<td>Total connections per backend server</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n<td>Set to protect backend servers from connection exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IdleConnTimeout</td>\n<td>How long to keep idle connections</td>\n<td>90 seconds</td>\n<td>Longer timeouts improve reuse but consume resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLSHandshakeTimeout</td>\n<td>Timeout for TLS connection establishment</td>\n<td>10 seconds</td>\n<td>Shorter timeouts fail faster but may cause false failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ResponseHeaderTimeout</td>\n<td>Timeout for response headers</td>\n<td>0 (no timeout)</td>\n<td>Should be set to prevent hanging requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ExpectContinueTimeout</td>\n<td>Timeout for 100-continue responses</td>\n<td>1 second</td>\n<td>Affects POST/PUT request performance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The connection pool implements <strong>connection lifecycle management</strong> through several phases. <strong>Connection establishment</strong> occurs when no idle connections exist for a backend server, triggering TCP connection setup and any required TLS handshaking. <strong>Connection allocation</strong> assigns an available connection to an incoming request, removing it from the idle pool and marking it as active. <strong>Connection return</strong> happens when a request completes successfully with a reusable connection, returning it to the idle pool for future use. <strong>Connection expiry</strong> removes connections that exceed idle timeout limits or encounter errors that make them unsuitable for reuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Health-based connection management</strong> integrates with the load balancer&#39;s health checking system to prevent connection allocation to unhealthy backends. When a backend server is marked unhealthy, the connection pool should drain existing connections and refuse new connection allocations until the backend recovers.</p>\n<p>The connection pool must handle <strong>concurrent access patterns</strong> safely, as multiple goroutines will simultaneously request connections for different client requests. Go&#39;s <code>http.Transport</code> handles this concurrency internally, but the proxy must coordinate between connection pool operations and backend health state changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection error handling</strong> requires distinguishing between transient network issues and persistent backend failures. <strong>Connection refused errors</strong> typically indicate backend server problems and should trigger health check updates. <strong>Timeout errors</strong> may indicate network congestion or backend overload and might warrant connection pool tuning. <strong>Protocol errors</strong> suggest backend server misconfigumentation and may require connection pool draining.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Connection Error Type</th>\n<th>Pool Action</th>\n<th>Health Check Impact</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection refused</td>\n<td>Mark backend unhealthy</td>\n<td>Trigger immediate health check</td>\n<td>Wait for health recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection timeout</td>\n<td>Close connection, retry once</td>\n<td>No immediate action</td>\n<td>May adjust timeout settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLS handshake failure</td>\n<td>Close connection</td>\n<td>Log security concern</td>\n<td>Check certificate validity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protocol error</td>\n<td>Close connection</td>\n<td>No immediate action</td>\n<td>Log for backend investigation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Idle connection closed</td>\n<td>Remove from pool</td>\n<td>No action</td>\n<td>Normal connection lifecycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DNS resolution failure</td>\n<td>No pool action</td>\n<td>Mark backend unhealthy</td>\n<td>Check DNS configuration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Performance Insight</strong>: Connection pooling can reduce request latency by <strong>50-80%</strong> for workloads with frequent requests to the same backends, as it eliminates TCP handshake (typically 1 RTT) and TLS handshake (typically 2-3 RTTs) overhead. However, poorly configured pools can cause connection exhaustion or resource leaks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection pool monitoring</strong> provides visibility into pool performance and helps identify configuration issues. Key metrics include <strong>active connection count</strong> (connections currently handling requests), <strong>idle connection count</strong> (connections available for reuse), <strong>connection establishment rate</strong> (new connections created per second), and <strong>connection reuse rate</strong> (percentage of requests using pooled connections).</p>\n<p>The connection pool integrates with the proxy&#39;s <strong>graceful shutdown</strong> process by providing connection draining functionality. During shutdown, the pool stops accepting new connection requests, allows active requests to complete, and closes all idle connections in an orderly fashion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The HTTP reverse proxy component involves several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact performance, reliability, and maintainability. These decisions establish the foundation for how the proxy handles HTTP semantics, manages resources, and integrates with other load balancer components.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: HTTP Client Implementation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The proxy needs an HTTP client to communicate with backend servers, with options ranging from low-level socket programming to high-level HTTP libraries</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Raw TCP sockets with manual HTTP parsing, Go&#39;s net/http package, third-party HTTP clients like fasthttp</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use Go&#39;s standard <code>net/http</code> package with customized <code>http.Transport</code></li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: The standard library provides robust HTTP/1.1 implementation, built-in connection pooling, comprehensive error handling, and extensive testing. Custom transport configuration allows fine-tuning for proxy-specific needs without reimplementing HTTP protocol details</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Leverages battle-tested HTTP implementation and reduces development complexity, but limits control over low-level connection behavior and may have higher memory overhead than specialized proxy libraries</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>HTTP Client Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Raw TCP + Manual HTTP</td>\n<td>Maximum control, minimal overhead</td>\n<td>High complexity, error-prone parsing</td>\n<td>Highest</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Go net/http</td>\n<td>Standard library, robust, well-tested</td>\n<td>Some overhead, less control</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fasthttp Library</td>\n<td>Optimized for high performance</td>\n<td>Non-standard API, less ecosystem support</td>\n<td>Highest</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom HTTP Client</td>\n<td>Tailored to proxy needs</td>\n<td>Development and maintenance overhead</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Header Processing Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: HTTP headers require careful handling to maintain protocol correctness while adding proxy functionality</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Forward all headers unchanged, selective header filtering, comprehensive header rewriting</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement selective header processing with explicit forwarding rules</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Forwarding all headers unchanged preserves application functionality, while selective processing allows adding proxy-specific headers like X-Forwarded-For.

Connection timeouts should be short (network reachable quickly), while response timeouts may need to accommodate backend processing time</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Provides fine-grained control over failure detection speed, but requires careful tuning and increases configuration complexity</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Error Response Generation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When backend servers fail or return errors, the proxy must decide what information to include in error responses to clients</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Forward all backend errors unchanged, generate generic proxy errors, provide detailed error information</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Forward backend application errors (4xx/5xx) unchanged, generate standard proxy errors for infrastructure failures</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Application errors from backends contain information clients need for proper error handling. Infrastructure errors (network failures, timeouts) should be normalized to standard proxy error codes to avoid exposing backend topology</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Preserves application error semantics while protecting infrastructure details, but may require careful classification of error types</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Connection pooling architecture</strong> decisions directly impact both performance and resource usage patterns. The choice of pooling strategy affects how efficiently the proxy can handle concurrent requests and how gracefully it responds to backend server changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Request context propagation</strong> decisions determine how cancellation, timeouts, and trace information flow through the proxy. Proper context handling ensures that client disconnections cancel backend requests and that distributed tracing works correctly across the proxy boundary.</p>\n<p><strong>Logging and observability integration</strong> decisions establish what information the proxy records about requests and how that information integrates with monitoring systems. These decisions impact debugging capabilities and operational visibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>The HTTP reverse proxy implementation involves several areas where developers commonly encounter issues that can lead to incorrect behavior, performance problems, or security vulnerabilities. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid frustrating debugging sessions and ensures robust proxy operation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Copying All Request Headers</strong></p>\n<p>Many developers forget to copy important headers when forwarding requests to backend servers, leading to broken application functionality. Common missed headers include <code>Authorization</code> (breaking authentication), <code>Content-Type</code> (causing backend parsing errors), and <code>Accept</code> (preventing content negotiation).</p>\n<p>The problem occurs because developers focus on the obvious headers like <code>Host</code> and <code>User-Agent</code> while overlooking headers that specific applications depend on. This is particularly problematic with RESTful APIs that rely on <code>Accept</code> headers for response format selection or applications using custom authentication headers.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use Go&#39;s header cloning functionality and implement explicit header forwarding lists. Copy all headers by default, then selectively remove hop-by-hop headers rather than selectively adding headers:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">go</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// Wrong approach - easy to miss important headers</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">backendReq.Header.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Set</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Authorization\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, req.Header.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Get</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Authorization\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">))</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">backendReq.Header.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Set</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Content-Type\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, req.Header.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Get</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"Content-Type\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">))</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// ... what about Accept, Accept-Language, X-Custom-Auth, etc?</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// Better approach - copy all, then remove hop-by-hop</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">for</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> name, values </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">:=</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> range</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> req.Header {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    if</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> !</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">isHopByHopHeader</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(name) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">        backendReq.Header[name] </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> values</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Buffering Large Request Bodies</strong></p>\n<p>Developers often load entire request bodies into memory before forwarding them, causing memory exhaustion when clients upload large files or send streaming data.

(Health Checks), Milestone 4 (Additional Algorithms) — this component manages the collection of backend servers and provides the foundation for all load balancing algorithms and health monitoring</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-team-roster\">Mental Model: Team Roster</h3>\n<p>Think of the backend pool manager as a sports team&#39;s roster management system. Just as a coach maintains a roster of players with their positions, capabilities, and current availability status, the backend pool manager maintains a collection of backend servers with their URLs, weights, and health states.</p>\n<p>When it&#39;s time to put a player in the game, the coach considers who&#39;s healthy, who&#39;s performing well, and what position needs to be filled. Similarly, when a request arrives, the backend pool manager considers which servers are healthy, which algorithm is active, and selects the most appropriate backend server. The coach tracks player statistics and injury status just as the pool manager tracks connection counts and health check results.</p>\n<p>The roster can be updated mid-season as players are traded, injured, or recovered, and the backend pool can be updated during operation as servers are added, removed, or change health status. The key insight is that the roster manager provides a clean abstraction between the game strategy (load balancing algorithm) and the individual player management (backend server lifecycle).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model.svg\" alt=\"Core Data Structures\"></p>\n<p>The <code>BackendManager</code> serves as the central coordinator that bridges three critical concerns: maintaining the pool of available backend servers, tracking their health and connection states, and providing a clean interface for load balancing algorithms to select appropriate targets. This separation of concerns allows algorithms to focus purely on selection logic while the manager handles the operational complexities of backend lifecycle management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-registration\">Backend Registration</h3>\n<p>Backend registration encompasses the entire lifecycle of adding, updating, and removing backend servers from the active pool. The registration process must handle both initial configuration loading and runtime updates while maintaining service availability and ensuring data consistency across concurrent operations.</p>\n<p>The registration process begins with parsing and validating backend configurations. Each backend requires a valid URL that the load balancer can reach, along with optional parameters like weight for proportional distribution and connection limits for capacity management. The validation phase checks URL format, ensures uniqueness within the pool, and verifies that network connectivity is possible before adding the backend to the active rotation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Registration Operation</th>\n<th>Input Parameters</th>\n<th>Validation Checks</th>\n<th>Side Effects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>AddBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>BackendConfig</code></td>\n<td>URL format, uniqueness, connectivity</td>\n<td>Creates <code>Backend</code> struct, initializes health state, adds to pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RemoveBackend</code></td>\n<td>Backend ID string</td>\n<td>Backend exists, handle active connections</td>\n<td>Updates pool, waits for connection drain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UpdateBackend</code></td>\n<td>Backend ID, new config</td>\n<td>Config validity, backward compatibility</td>\n<td>Updates in-place, preserves health history</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LoadBackends</code></td>\n<td>Configuration file/API</td>\n<td>Bulk validation, dependency checks</td>\n<td>Replaces entire pool atomically</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>NewBackend</code> function transforms a <code>BackendConfig</code> into a fully initialized <code>Backend</code> struct with proper defaults and initial state. The backend receives a unique ID (typically a hash of the URL), atomic counters for connection tracking initialized to zero, and a fresh <code>HealthState</code> that assumes the backend is healthy until proven otherwise. The creation timestamp and metadata fields support monitoring and debugging scenarios.</p>\n<p>Backend removal requires careful coordination with active connections and ongoing health checks. The removal process first marks the backend as unavailable for new requests, then waits for existing connections to complete or timeout. Health checkers must be notified to stop monitoring the removed backend, and any algorithm-specific state (like weighted round-robin counters) needs cleanup to prevent memory leaks or stale references.</p>\n<p>Runtime updates to backend configuration present unique challenges because they must preserve operational history while applying new parameters. Weight changes for weighted algorithms require recalculating distribution ratios, while URL changes effectively create a new backend with fresh health state. The update process uses copy-on-write semantics to ensure atomic transitions that don&#39;t disrupt ongoing requests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> Backend registration uses optimistic concurrency control where operations assume success and handle conflicts during commit. This approach minimizes lock contention during high-traffic periods while ensuring consistency through atomic swap operations on the backend pool reference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Backend Identification Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use URL-based hash IDs for backend identification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need unique, stable identifiers for backends that survive configuration reloads and support efficient lookups</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Sequential integers (simple but not stable across restarts)</li>\n<li>User-provided names (flexible but requires uniqueness validation)</li>\n<li>URL-based hashes (stable and deterministic)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Generate backend IDs using SHA-256 hash of the normalized URL</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: URL hashes provide stable identifiers that survive restarts, enable idempotent configuration reloads, and eliminate the need for explicit ID management. Hash collisions are extremely unlikely with SHA-256.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Backend IDs are deterministic and stable, but not human-readable. Debug scenarios require mapping IDs back to URLs, which the manager provides through lookup methods.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sequential integers</td>\n<td>Simple, compact, human-readable</td>\n<td>Not stable across restarts, requires state persistence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User-provided names</td>\n<td>Human-readable, meaningful</td>\n<td>Requires uniqueness validation, potential conflicts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>URL-based hashes</td>\n<td>Stable, deterministic, no coordination needed</td>\n<td>Not human-readable, potential for collisions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"health-state-tracking\">Health State Tracking</h3>\n<p>Health state tracking maintains a comprehensive view of each backend&#39;s operational status through both active health checks and passive monitoring of request outcomes. The health state system implements a finite state machine with hysteresis to prevent rapid oscillations between healthy and unhealthy states that could destabilize request distribution.</p>\n<p>The <code>HealthState</code> structure captures both current status and historical trends to support intelligent failover decisions. The consecutive success and failure counters implement the threshold-based state transitions that prevent single transient errors from removing healthy backends from rotation. The comprehensive timestamp tracking enables monitoring systems to understand health patterns and identify backends experiencing intermittent issues.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health State Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Update Trigger</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Healthy</code></td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Current availability status</td>\n<td>State transition after threshold breach</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConsecutiveSuccesses</code></td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Consecutive successful checks</td>\n<td>Each successful health check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConsecutiveFailures</code></td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Consecutive failed checks</td>\n<td>Each failed health check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastCheckTime</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent health check attempt</td>\n<td>Every health check start</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastSuccessTime</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent successful check</td>\n<td>Successful health check completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastFailureTime</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent failed check</td>\n<td>Failed health check completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastError</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Error message from last failure</td>\n<td>Health check error occurrence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TotalChecks</code></td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Lifetime health check count</td>\n<td>Every health check attempt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TotalSuccesses</code></td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Lifetime successful check count</td>\n<td>Each successful health check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TotalFailures</code></td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Lifetime failed check count</td>\n<td>Each failed health check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StateChanges</code></td>\n<td>[]HealthStateChange</td>\n<td>History of state transitions</td>\n<td>Healthy/unhealthy transitions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fbackend-health-states.svg\" alt=\"Backend Health State Machine\"></p>\n<p>The state transition logic implements configurable thresholds to balance responsiveness with stability. When a healthy backend fails a health check, the consecutive failure counter increments while the consecutive success counter resets to zero. Only after reaching the <code>UnhealthyThreshold</code> does the backend transition to unhealthy state. The reverse process applies for recovery, requiring <code>HealthyThreshold</code> consecutive successes to restore the backend to healthy state.</p>\n<p>Health state updates must be thread-safe because multiple goroutines may simultaneously process health check results, update connection counts, or read health status for request routing decisions. The <code>UpdateHealthState</code> method uses atomic operations for scalar fields and mutex protection for complex updates that modify multiple related fields.</p>\n<p>The <code>RecordSuccess</code> and <code>RecordFailure</code> methods encapsulate the state transition logic and return boolean values indicating whether a state change occurred. This return value triggers notifications to other system components like metrics collectors or alerting systems that need to respond to backend availability changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Health State Persistence</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Maintain health state only in memory with graceful startup behavior</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to balance fast health state updates with persistence requirements and system complexity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>In-memory only (fast but loses history on restart)</li>\n<li>Database persistence (durable but adds latency)</li>\n<li>File-based snapshots (balance of performance and persistence)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Keep health state in memory with intelligent startup behavior that assumes all backends are healthy initially</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Health checks provide rapid feedback on actual backend status, making historical state less critical. In-memory storage eliminates persistence-related latency and complexity. Assuming healthy at startup is safer than assuming unhealthy (which could cause unnecessary downtime).</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Fast health state operations with no I/O overhead, but system restart temporarily loses health history.

This abstraction allows algorithms to focus purely on selection logic while the manager handles filtering unhealthy backends, updating connection counts, and maintaining algorithm-agnostic operational concerns.</p>\n<p>The core <code>Algorithm</code> interface defines the contract that all load balancing implementations must satisfy. The interface receives a slice of healthy backends and returns the selected backend, or nil if no suitable backend is available. This simple interface supports both stateless algorithms (like random selection) and stateful algorithms (like round-robin with counters) through the algorithm implementation&#39;s internal state management.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Interface Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Behavior Contract</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SelectBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>[]*Backend</code> (healthy backends only)</td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code> or nil</td>\n<td>Must handle empty slice, return nil for no selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Name</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Return human-readable algorithm name for logging/metrics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>BackendManager</code> orchestrates the selection process by first filtering the backend pool to include only healthy backends, then delegating to the active algorithm for the actual selection decision. This two-stage process ensures that algorithms never receive unhealthy backends and don&#39;t need to duplicate health checking logic across every algorithm implementation.</p>\n<p>The selection workflow follows a consistent pattern across all algorithm types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The manager receives a request for backend selection from the HTTP proxy component</li>\n<li>It queries the current backend pool and filters out any backends marked as unhealthy</li>\n<li>If no healthy backends remain, it returns an error indicating service unavailability</li>\n<li>The filtered healthy backend list is passed to the active algorithm&#39;s <code>SelectBackend</code> method</li>\n<li>The algorithm applies its selection logic and returns the chosen backend</li>\n<li>The manager increments the selected backend&#39;s active connection counter atomically</li>\n<li>The selected backend is returned to the caller for request forwarding</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The interface design supports runtime algorithm switching by allowing the manager to swap algorithm implementations without disrupting ongoing requests. Algorithm instances maintain their own internal state (like round-robin counters or least-connection tracking) independently of the backend pool, enabling clean separation of concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Algorithm State Management</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algorithms maintain internal state with backend pool change notifications</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Load balancing algorithms need to track state (counters, connection counts) while the backend pool changes dynamically</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Stateless algorithms only (simple but limits algorithm types)</li>\n<li>Manager-maintained algorithm state (centralized but tightly coupled)</li>\n<li>Algorithm-internal state with notifications (flexible and decoupled)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Algorithms maintain their own state and receive notifications when the backend pool changes</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Different algorithms need different state (round-robin needs counters, least-connections needs connection tracking). Internal state keeps algorithms self-contained while notifications enable adaptation to pool changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Algorithms are more complex but also more flexible. Backend pool changes require notification broadcast, but this enables sophisticated algorithm behavior like weighted round-robin with smooth transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stateless algorithms only</td>\n<td>Simple, no synchronization needed</td>\n<td>Limits available algorithms, worse distribution quality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manager-maintained algorithm state</td>\n<td>Centralized state management</td>\n<td>Tight coupling, manager complexity grows with algorithms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm-internal state</td>\n<td>Flexible, self-contained algorithms</td>\n<td>More complex algorithms, need change notifications</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The notification mechanism uses the observer pattern where algorithms can register for backend pool change events. When backends are added, removed, or change health status, the manager broadcasts notifications that allow algorithms to update their internal state accordingly. This approach maintains loose coupling while enabling stateful algorithm behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>Several critical architecture decisions shape the backend pool manager&#39;s design and directly impact performance, maintainability, and operational characteristics. These decisions balance competing concerns like thread safety, performance, and operational flexibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Thread Safety Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use fine-grained locking with atomic operations for hot paths</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Backend manager faces concurrent access from multiple goroutines handling requests, health checks updating status, and configuration changes</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Single global mutex (simple but serializes all access)</li>\n<li>Read-write mutex for pool access (better than global mutex)</li>\n<li>Fine-grained locking with atomics (complex but highest performance)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use atomic operations for connection counting, RWMutex for backend pool access, and separate mutexes for individual backend health state updates</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Hot path operations (backend selection, connection counting) need minimal latency.

Understanding these pitfalls and their solutions prevents common bugs that can cause request failures or system instability.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Connection Counting</strong></p>\n<p>The most frequent error occurs when multiple goroutines simultaneously modify backend connection counters without proper synchronization. This typically happens when request handlers increment the connection count when selecting a backend, then later decrement it in a deferred function, but use non-atomic operations for the counter updates.</p>\n<p>The symptom appears as connection counts that become negative or grow without bounds, leading to incorrect least-connections algorithm behavior. Backends may show impossibly high connection counts that never decrease, or negative counts that confuse the selection logic.</p>\n<p>The fix requires using atomic operations for all connection counter modifications. The <code>IncrementConnections</code> and <code>DecrementConnections</code> methods must use <code>atomic.AddInt64</code> to ensure thread-safe updates. Additionally, ensure that every increment has a corresponding decrement, typically using deferred function calls that execute even when request processing encounters errors.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Backend Pool Views During Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Configuration updates can create scenarios where different parts of the system see different versions of the backend pool simultaneously. This happens when the pool update process modifies the backend map incrementally while other goroutines are reading from it, leading to partially updated views.</p>\n<p>Symptoms include algorithms selecting backends that no longer exist, health checkers monitoring removed backends, or new backends not appearing in selection rotation despite successful configuration updates. Error logs may show &quot;backend not found&quot; errors during request forwarding.</p>\n<p>The solution uses atomic pointer swaps for the entire backend pool. Store the backend map in an atomic pointer value, create a complete new map during updates, then atomically swap the pointer. This ensures all readers see either the complete old state or the complete new state, never a mixed view.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health State Update Ordering</strong></p>\n<p>Health state updates from multiple concurrent health checks can arrive out of order, causing newer health check results to be overwritten by older results. This occurs when network delays cause health check responses to arrive in different order than they were sent, particularly under high load or network congestion.</p>\n<p>The manifestation includes backends that appear to randomly flip between healthy and unhealthy states, health statistics that don&#39;t match actual check timing, and backends that remain unhealthy despite successful checks. The <code>LastCheckTime</code> field may show timestamps that move backward.</p>\n<p>Prevention requires adding sequence numbers or timestamps to health check operations and ignoring updates that are older than the current health state timestamp. The <code>RecordSuccess</code> and <code>RecordFailure</code> methods should verify that the update timestamp is newer than <code>LastCheckTime</code> before applying changes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Empty Backend Pool Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Algorithms often fail to handle the case where no healthy backends are available, either returning nil pointers that cause panics or attempting to perform modulo operations with zero divisors. This scenario occurs during startup, configuration updates, or when all backends fail simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Symptoms include application crashes with division by zero errors, null pointer dereferences during request forwarding, or infinite loops in selection algorithms that assume at least one backend exists.</p>\n<p>The robust solution implements graceful degradation at multiple layers. The <code>GetHealthyBackends</code> method should document that it can return empty slices. Algorithm <code>SelectBackend</code> methods must check for empty input and return nil gracefully. The HTTP proxy component should handle nil backend selection by returning 503 Service Unavailable responses rather than crashing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Algorithm State</strong></p>\n<p>Stateful algorithms like weighted round-robin or least connections can accumulate state for backends that have been removed from the pool. This occurs when algorithms maintain internal maps or counters keyed by backend ID but don&#39;t clean up when backends are removed.</p>\n<p>The memory leak grows over time as backends are added and removed during configuration updates, particularly in dynamic environments where backend pools change frequently. Memory usage increases monotonically, and algorithm state may reference deleted backends indefinitely.</p>\n<p>The fix implements proper cleanup notifications where the backend manager sends removal events to all registered algorithms. Algorithms must implement cleanup logic that removes internal state for deleted backends. Using weak references or timeout-based cleanup can provide additional safety against leaked state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check State Inconsistency During Algorithm Selection</strong></p>\n<p>Backend health state can change between the time an algorithm selects a backend and when the request is forwarded to it. This race condition occurs when health checks update backend state to unhealthy just after the algorithm selection but before request forwarding begins.</p>\n<p>The result is requests sent to backends that are known to be unhealthy, causing unnecessary request failures and poor user experience. Error rates increase despite the health checking system functioning correctly.</p>\n<p>The solution implements last-moment health validation in the HTTP proxy component immediately before forwarding requests. If the selected backend becomes unhealthy between selection and forwarding, the proxy can either retry with a new selection or return an appropriate error response. This adds a small latency cost but prevents forwarding to known-bad backends.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The backend pool manager bridges abstract load balancing concepts with concrete implementation concerns like thread safety, state management, and configuration updates.

(Round Robin Distribution), Milestone 4 (Additional Algorithms) — this section implements the core algorithms that determine how requests are distributed across backend servers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-traffic-director\">Mental Model: Traffic Director</h3>\n<p>Imagine you&#39;re a traffic director at a busy intersection with multiple roads leading to the same destination. Each road represents a backend server, and every car represents an incoming HTTP request. Your job is to decide which road each car should take to reach their destination efficiently.</p>\n<p>Just as a traffic director has different strategies for routing vehicles, a load balancer employs various algorithms to distribute requests. You might use <strong>round-robin routing</strong> like a simple traffic light that cycles through each road in turn, ensuring equal opportunity for all routes. For <strong>weighted distribution</strong>, imagine some roads are highways while others are small streets — you&#39;d send more cars down the highways because they can handle more traffic. With <strong>least-busy routing</strong>, you&#39;d count how many cars are currently on each road and direct new cars to the emptiest route. For <strong>consistent routing</strong>, you might assign specific types of vehicles (delivery trucks, emergency vehicles) to always use the same road to maintain familiarity and efficiency.</p>\n<p>Each strategy has trade-offs. Round-robin is simple but doesn&#39;t account for road capacity differences. Least-busy routing is dynamic but requires constant monitoring. Consistent routing provides predictability but might create uneven distribution if certain vehicle types are more common. As a traffic director, you need to understand these trade-offs and choose the right strategy for your specific intersection&#39;s needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"round-robin-algorithm\">Round Robin Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The <strong>round-robin algorithm</strong> represents the simplest and most intuitive approach to load balancing. It operates like a circular queue, selecting each backend server in sequential order and cycling back to the first server after reaching the last one. This algorithm ensures that over time, each backend receives an approximately equal number of requests, regardless of their processing speed or current load.</p>\n<p>The core challenge in implementing round-robin lies in maintaining thread safety when multiple goroutines simultaneously select backends. The algorithm maintains a shared counter that tracks the next backend to select, but this counter must be incremented atomically to prevent race conditions that could lead to uneven distribution or incorrect selections.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Implementation Logic:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Counter Management</strong>: Maintain an atomic counter that tracks the next backend index to select from the healthy backend pool</li>\n<li><strong>Atomic Increment</strong>: Use atomic operations to increment the counter and retrieve the current value in a single, thread-safe operation</li>\n<li><strong>Modulo Operation</strong>: Apply modulo arithmetic to wrap the counter around to zero when it exceeds the number of available backends</li>\n<li><strong>Health Filtering</strong>: Only consider backends that are currently marked as healthy by the health checking system</li>\n<li><strong>Empty Pool Handling</strong>: Return an error or nil when no healthy backends are available for selection</li>\n<li><strong>Index Validation</strong>: Ensure the calculated index is within the bounds of the current healthy backend slice</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The round-robin algorithm maintains fairness by treating all healthy backends equally, without considering their current load, processing capacity, or response times. This simplicity makes it highly predictable and easy to debug, but it may not be optimal when backend servers have different capabilities or when request processing times vary significantly.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Round Robin State</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Counter</td>\n<td><code>counter</code></td>\n<td><code>*int64</code></td>\n<td>Atomic counter tracking next backend index to select</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastSelected</td>\n<td><code>lastSelected</code></td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code></td>\n<td>Reference to the most recently selected backend for debugging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SelectionCount</td>\n<td><code>selectionCount</code></td>\n<td><code>*int64</code></td>\n<td>Total number of backend selections performed since startup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Round Robin Methods</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SelectBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>backends []*Backend</code></td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code></td>\n<td>Selects next backend using round-robin algorithm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Name</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Returns &quot;round_robin&quot; as algorithm identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Reset</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Resets internal counter to zero for testing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetStats</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>map[string]int64</code></td>\n<td>Returns selection count and current counter value</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The round-robin algorithm&#39;s strength lies in its predictability and simplicity. Unlike more complex algorithms, its behavior is completely deterministic given the same sequence of healthy backends, making it ideal for testing and debugging load balancer behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Atomic Counter Implementation Details:</strong></p>\n<p>The atomic counter implementation requires careful attention to integer overflow and wrap-around behavior. When the counter approaches the maximum value for <code>int64</code>, it should wrap around to zero gracefully without causing panics or negative indices. The modulo operation naturally handles this wrap-around, but the implementation must ensure that the modulo operand (number of backends) is never zero.</p>\n<p><strong>Thread Safety Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple goroutines calling <code>SelectBackend</code> simultaneously must receive different backends when possible. The atomic increment operation ensures that each goroutine gets a unique counter value, preventing duplicate selections. However, the healthy backend slice itself may change between the atomic increment and the actual backend selection, requiring careful handling of race conditions where backends are added or removed during selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Round-Robin Selection Sequence:</strong></p>\n<p>Consider a load balancer with three healthy backends: Backend-A, Backend-B, and Backend-C. The selection sequence proceeds as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Request 1: Counter=0, 0 % 3 = 0, selects Backend-A, increment counter to 1</li>\n<li>Request 2: Counter=1, 1 % 3 = 1, selects Backend-B, increment counter to 2  </li>\n<li>Request 3: Counter=2, 2 % 3 = 2, selects Backend-C, increment counter to 3</li>\n<li>Request 4: Counter=3, 3 % 3 = 0, selects Backend-A, increment counter to 4</li>\n<li>Request 5: Counter=4, 4 % 3 = 1, selects Backend-B, increment counter to 5</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This pattern continues indefinitely, ensuring each backend receives every third request in a predictable cycle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fround-robin-algorithm.svg\" alt=\"Round Robin Selection Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"weighted-round-robin-algorithm\">Weighted Round Robin Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The <strong>weighted round-robin algorithm</strong> extends basic round-robin by allowing administrators to assign different weights to backend servers, enabling proportional traffic distribution based on server capacity, performance, or cost considerations. A backend with weight 3 receives three times as many requests as a backend with weight 1 over a sufficient number of selections.</p>\n<p>The challenge in weighted round-robin lies in achieving smooth distribution that avoids sending consecutive requests to high-weight backends. A naive implementation might select a weight-3 backend three times in a row before moving to the next server, creating bursty traffic patterns. The smooth weighted round-robin algorithm addresses this by gradually distributing weighted selections across time.</p>\n<p><strong>Smooth Weighted Round Robin Logic:</strong></p>\n<p>The algorithm maintains a current weight for each backend that starts at zero and increases by the backend&#39;s configured weight on each selection round. The backend with the highest current weight is selected, and its current weight is then decreased by the sum of all backend weights. This approach ensures that high-weight backends are selected more frequently but not consecutively.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Weight Initialization</strong>: Set each backend&#39;s current weight to zero at algorithm startup</li>\n<li><strong>Weight Calculation</strong>: In each selection round, increase each backend&#39;s current weight by its configured weight</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum Selection</strong>: Select the backend with the highest current weight value</li>\n<li><strong>Weight Adjustment</strong>: Decrease the selected backend&#39;s current weight by the total weight sum of all backends</li>\n<li><strong>Health Filtering</strong>: Only consider backends that are currently healthy for weight calculations</li>\n<li><strong>Zero Weight Handling</strong>: Treat backends with zero or negative weights as having weight 1 to prevent exclusion</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Weighted Round Robin State</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>BackendWeights</td>\n<td><code>backendWeights</code></td>\n<td><code>map[string]int</code></td>\n<td>Configured weight for each backend by ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CurrentWeights</td>\n<td><code>currentWeights</code></td>\n<td><code>map[string]int</code></td>\n<td>Current weight values used for selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TotalWeight</td>\n<td><code>totalWeight</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Sum of all configured backend weights</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WeightMutex</td>\n<td><code>weightMutex</code></td>\n<td><code>sync.RWMutex</code></td>\n<td>Protects weight maps from concurrent access</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Weighted Round Robin Methods</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SelectBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>backends []*Backend</code></td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code></td>\n<td>Selects backend using smooth weighted algorithm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UpdateWeights</code></td>\n<td><code>weights map[string]int</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Updates backend weights with validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetCurrentWeights</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>map[string]int</code></td>\n<td>Returns current weight values for debugging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ResetWeights</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Resets all current weights to zero</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Smooth Distribution Example:</strong></p>\n<p>Consider three backends with weights: A=5, B=1, C=1 (total weight = 7).

This algorithm excels when request processing times vary significantly or when backends have different processing capacities, as it naturally routes new requests to less busy servers.</p>\n<p>The algorithm requires accurate tracking of active connection counts for each backend server. A connection becomes active when a request is forwarded to a backend and remains active until the response is completely returned to the client. This tracking must be thread-safe and atomic to prevent race conditions that could lead to incorrect connection counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Tracking Implementation:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increment on Request</strong>: Atomically increment the backend&#39;s active connection count when forwarding a request</li>\n<li><strong>Decrement on Response</strong>: Atomically decrement the count when the response is fully processed, regardless of success or failure</li>\n<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Ensure connection counts are decremented even when backend requests fail or time out</li>\n<li><strong>Cleanup on Backend Removal</strong>: Reset connection counts when backends are removed from the pool</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery on Startup</strong>: Initialize all connection counts to zero when the load balancer starts up</li>\n<li><strong>Overflow Protection</strong>: Handle potential integer overflow in connection counters gracefully</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Least Connections State</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ConnectionCounts</td>\n<td><code>connectionCounts</code></td>\n<td><code>map[string]*int64</code></td>\n<td>Active connection count for each backend by ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CounterMutex</td>\n<td><code>counterMutex</code></td>\n<td><code>sync.RWMutex</code></td>\n<td>Protects connection count map from concurrent access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxConnections</td>\n<td><code>maxConnections</code></td>\n<td><code>map[string]int</code></td>\n<td>Maximum allowed connections per backend</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Least Connections Methods</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SelectBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>backends []*Backend</code></td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code></td>\n<td>Selects backend with fewest active connections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>IncrementConnections</code></td>\n<td><code>backendID string</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td>Atomically increments connection count for backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DecrementConnections</code></td>\n<td><code>backendID string</code></td>\n<td><code>int64</code></td>\n<td>Atomically decrements connection count for backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetConnectionCounts</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>map[string]int64</code></td>\n<td>Returns current connection counts for all backends</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Selection Logic with Tie Breaking:</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple backends have the same lowest connection count, the algorithm needs a consistent tie-breaking strategy. Common approaches include selecting the first backend encountered, using round-robin among tied backends, or selecting randomly. The choice impacts load distribution when many backends are idle or when connection counts frequently tie.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Count Synchronization:</strong></p>\n<p>The critical challenge lies in ensuring that connection count increments and decrements are properly paired and that counts accurately reflect reality. Network failures, timeout errors, and client disconnections can all cause situations where a connection count might become permanently incorrect if not handled properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Selection with Varying Loads:</strong></p>\n<p>Consider three backends with current active connections: A=5, B=2, C=8. A new request arrives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Backend B has the fewest connections (2)</li>\n<li><strong>Selection</strong>: Choose Backend B for the new request</li>\n<li><strong>Increment</strong>: Backend B&#39;s count becomes 3 (atomically)</li>\n<li><strong>Processing</strong>: Request is forwarded to Backend B</li>\n<li><strong>Completion</strong>: When Backend B responds, decrement count back to 2</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If Backend B fails to respond or times out, the decrement operation must still occur to prevent connection count drift.</p>\n<p><strong>Handling Maximum Connection Limits:</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced implementations can respect per-backend maximum connection limits, skipping backends that have reached their connection capacity even if they currently have the fewest connections. This prevents overloading backends and provides graceful degradation when backends approach their processing limits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ip-hash-algorithm\">IP Hash Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The <strong>IP hash algorithm</strong> provides <strong>session affinity</strong> by consistently routing requests from the same client IP address to the same backend server.

Consistent hashing algorithms minimize this disruption by maintaining most existing IP-to-backend mappings when backends change.</p>\n<p><strong>Example IP Hashing Sequence:</strong></p>\n<p>Client IP addresses map consistently to backends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP 192.168.1.100: hash(IP) = 12345, 12345 % 3 = 0, maps to Backend-A</li>\n<li>IP 192.168.1.101: hash(IP) = 67890, 67890 % 3 = 1, maps to Backend-B  </li>\n<li>IP 192.168.1.102: hash(IP) = 24680, 24680 % 3 = 2, maps to Backend-C</li>\n<li>IP 192.168.1.100: (later request) maps to Backend-A again (consistent)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Session Affinity Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Session affinity creates an inherent trade-off with load distribution. If certain IP addresses generate significantly more traffic than others, the load becomes uneven across backends. The algorithm may need fallback mechanisms when a client&#39;s designated backend becomes unhealthy, temporarily breaking session affinity to maintain service availability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: IP hash algorithms must balance session consistency with load distribution fairness. In practice, many deployments use IP hashing only when session affinity is required and fall back to other algorithms when all backend servers are stateless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"random-selection-algorithm\">Random Selection Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The <strong>random selection algorithm</strong> provides the simplest statistical approach to load balancing by selecting backends with equal probability using a cryptographically secure random number generator. While seemingly naive, random selection often achieves surprisingly good load distribution with minimal state management overhead.</p>\n<p>Random selection shines in scenarios where request processing times are relatively uniform and backend capabilities are similar. Over a large number of requests, the law of large numbers ensures that each backend receives approximately equal traffic, but short-term distribution may be uneven compared to round-robin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random Selection Implementation:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Random Number Generation</strong>: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator seeded at startup</li>\n<li><strong>Range Scaling</strong>: Scale the random number to the range [0, number_of_healthy_backends)</li>\n<li><strong>Index Selection</strong>: Use the scaled random number as an index into the healthy backend slice</li>\n<li><strong>Health Filtering</strong>: Only include currently healthy backends in the selection pool</li>\n<li><strong>Thread Safety</strong>: Ensure the random number generator is safe for concurrent access across goroutines</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Random Selection State</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>RandomGenerator</td>\n<td><code>rng</code></td>\n<td><code>*rand.Rand</code></td>\n<td>Seeded random number generator instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GeneratorMutex</td>\n<td><code>rngMutex</code></td>\n<td><code>sync.Mutex</code></td>\n<td>Protects random generator from concurrent access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SelectionHistory</td>\n<td><code>history</code></td>\n<td><code>[]string</code></td>\n<td>Recent backend selections for debugging/testing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Random Selection Methods</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>SelectBackend</code></td>\n<td><code>backends []*Backend</code></td>\n<td><code>*Backend</code></td>\n<td>Randomly selects a backend from healthy pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SetSeed</code></td>\n<td><code>seed int64</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Sets random number generator seed for testing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetDistribution</code></td>\n<td><code>window int</code></td>\n<td><code>map[string]int</code></td>\n<td>Returns selection counts over recent window</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Statistical Distribution Properties:</strong></p>\n<p>Random selection provides several valuable statistical properties. The variance in backend selection decreases as the number of requests increases, following the central limit theorem. For N backends and R requests, each backend receives approximately R/N requests with a standard deviation of sqrt(R * (1/N) * (1 - 1/N)).</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages of Random Selection:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stateless</strong>: No counters, weights, or connection tracking required</li>\n<li><strong>Simple</strong>: Minimal code complexity and fewer edge cases to handle  </li>\n<li><strong>Scalable</strong>: Performance doesn&#39;t degrade as the number of backends increases</li>\n<li><strong>Resilient</strong>: No state corruption possible during backend pool changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example Random Distribution:</strong></p>\n<p>Over 1000 requests to 3 backends, random selection might produce:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Backend-A: 334 requests (33.4%)</li>\n<li>Backend-B: 329 requests (32.9%) </li>\n<li>Backend-C: 337 requests (33.7%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not perfectly even like round-robin, this distribution is acceptable for most applications and required no state synchronization.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptographically Secure Randomness:</strong></p>\n<p>The random number generator should be seeded with a cryptographically secure source to prevent predictable selection patterns that could be exploited for denial-of-service attacks. However, the generator itself need not be cryptographically secure since load balancing decisions are not security-sensitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algorithm Interface Design</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need a common interface that supports multiple load balancing algorithms with different state requirements and parameters</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single method interface, Strategy pattern with factory, Plugin-based architecture</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement Strategy pattern with common <code>Algorithm</code> interface containing <code>SelectBackend</code> and <code>Name</code> methods</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Strategy pattern allows runtime algorithm switching while keeping implementation details encapsulated within each algorithm</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables easy addition of new algorithms and runtime reconfiguration, but requires careful handling of algorithm-specific state</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Algorithm Interface Options</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single Method Interface</td>\n<td>Simple to implement and use</td>\n<td>Cannot handle algorithm-specific configuration or state</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strategy Pattern</td>\n<td>Clean separation, runtime switching, extensible</td>\n<td>Slightly more complex state management</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plugin Architecture</td>\n<td>Ultimate flexibility, external algorithms possible</td>\n<td>Complex loading, versioning, and security concerns</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algorithm State Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Algorithms need to maintain state (counters, weights, connection counts) that must be thread-safe and persistent across requests</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Global shared state, Per-algorithm state encapsulation, Stateless algorithms only</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Encapsulate state within each algorithm implementation using appropriate synchronization primitives</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Encapsulation prevents state conflicts between algorithms and allows each to optimize its synchronization strategy</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Each algorithm manages its own thread safety, but state is isolated and easier to reason about</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Runtime Algorithm Switching</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Administrators need to change load balancing algorithms without restarting the load balancer or dropping connections</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Restart required, Graceful transition, Immediate switch, Dual-algorithm mode</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement immediate switching with state preservation where possible</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Immediate switching provides operational flexibility without service disruption, most algorithm state can be safely discarded</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables rapid response to changing traffic patterns but may cause temporary distribution irregularities during transitions</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Selection Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>The load balancer supports runtime selection of the active algorithm through configuration updates.

requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: Use when backends are identical and request processing times are uniform</li>\n<li><strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong>: Use when backends have different capacities or you want to favor certain servers</li>\n<li><strong>Least Connections</strong>: Use when request processing times vary significantly or during long-polling/websocket scenarios  </li>\n<li><strong>IP Hash</strong>: Use when you need session affinity and backend servers maintain client-specific state</li>\n<li><strong>Random</strong>: Use for simple stateless applications where you want minimal overhead</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Language-Specific Implementation Hints:</strong></p>\n<p>For Go implementations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>sync/atomic</code> for all counter operations to ensure thread safety</li>\n<li>Prefer <code>sync.RWMutex</code> over <code>sync.Mutex</code> for read-heavy operations like backend selection</li>\n<li>Use <code>crypto/rand</code> for cryptographically secure random number generation in production</li>\n<li>Consider using <code>sync.Pool</code> for frequently allocated temporary objects in high-throughput scenarios</li>\n<li>Handle integer overflow explicitly in weighted algorithms using checked arithmetic</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone Checkpoint (Milestone 2: Round Robin Distribution):</strong></p>\n<p>After implementing round-robin selection:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start the load balancer</strong> with multiple backend servers configured</li>\n<li><strong>Send 100 test requests</strong> using a tool like curl or ab: <code>for i in {1..100}; do curl http://localhost:8080/test; done</code></li>\n<li><strong>Check backend logs</strong> to verify each backend received approximately 33-34 requests (for 3 backends)</li>\n<li><strong>Verify thread safety</strong> by running concurrent requests: <code>ab -n 1000 -c 10

System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 3 (Health Checks) — this section implements active health monitoring that enables the load balancer to detect backend failures and exclude unhealthy servers from request distribution</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-medical-checkups\">Mental Model: Medical Checkups</h3>\n<p>Think of the health checking system as a <strong>medical monitoring program</strong> for a professional sports team. Just as team doctors conduct regular checkups on athletes to ensure they&#39;re fit to play, our health checker continuously monitors backend servers to ensure they&#39;re ready to handle requests.</p>\n<p>In this analogy, each backend server is like an athlete on the team roster. The health checker acts as the team doctor, performing scheduled examinations at regular intervals. Just as a doctor might check an athlete&#39;s pulse, reflexes, and stamina, our health checker sends HTTP requests to verify that backends can respond properly. When an athlete fails multiple checkups in a row, the doctor declares them unfit for play and removes them from the active lineup. Similarly, when a backend fails consecutive health checks, it gets marked as unhealthy and removed from the request distribution pool.</p>\n<p>The recovery process mirrors an injured athlete&#39;s return to play. Just as an athlete must pass several consecutive medical clearances before rejoining the active roster, a previously unhealthy backend must succeed on multiple consecutive health checks before being restored to the available backend pool. This prevents flapping — rapidly switching between healthy and unhealthy states — which would disrupt the stability of request distribution.</p>\n<p>The health checking system operates independently from request processing, much like how medical checkups happen during training sessions rather than during games. This separation ensures that health monitoring doesn&#39;t interfere with live request handling, and that failed health checks don&#39;t block ongoing traffic to healthy backends.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model.svg\" alt=\"Core Data Structures\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"periodic-health-probes\">Periodic Health Probes</h3>\n<p>The <strong>periodic health probes</strong> form the foundation of active health monitoring, implementing scheduled HTTP requests to verify backend server availability. Unlike passive health checking that waits for request failures to detect problems, active probing discovers issues before they impact live traffic.</p>\n<p>The health probe mechanism operates on a configurable interval, typically ranging from 5 to 60 seconds depending on the required detection speed and acceptable overhead. Each probe consists of an HTTP GET request sent to a designated health endpoint on the backend server, usually something like <code>/health</code> or <code>/status</code>. The probe includes specific headers to identify itself as a health check rather than regular application traffic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Probe Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Implementation Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Probe Scheduler</td>\n<td>Manages timing of health checks</td>\n<td>Uses <code>time.Ticker</code> with configurable interval</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP Client</td>\n<td>Sends health check requests</td>\n<td>Separate client with short timeout (2-5 seconds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Evaluator</td>\n<td>Determines probe success/failure</td>\n<td>Checks status code, response time, optional body content</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Updater</td>\n<td>Records probe results</td>\n<td>Updates <code>HealthState</code> with atomic operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Classifier</td>\n<td>Categorizes different failure types</td>\n<td>Distinguishes connection errors, timeouts, and HTTP errors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The probe scheduler maintains independent timers for each backend server to prevent synchronized checking that could create load spikes. This <strong>staggered scheduling</strong> spreads health check traffic evenly over time, reducing the impact on backend servers and network infrastructure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Dedicated Health Check HTTP Client</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Health probes need different timeout and retry characteristics than request forwarding</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Reuse the main HTTP client from request forwarding</li>\n<li>Create a dedicated HTTP client for health checks</li>\n<li>Use raw TCP connections for simple connectivity testing</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Dedicated HTTP client with short timeouts</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Health checks should fail fast (2-5 second timeout vs 30+ seconds for requests), need different retry logic, and shouldn&#39;t interfere with connection pooling for live traffic</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly more memory overhead but better isolation and more appropriate timeout behavior for health monitoring</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each health probe follows a structured sequence of operations designed to minimize false positives while detecting real failures quickly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The probe scheduler triggers a health check for a specific backend server based on the configured interval</li>\n<li>The health checker creates an HTTP GET request to the backend&#39;s health endpoint with appropriate headers</li>\n<li>A dedicated HTTP client sends the request with a short timeout (typically 2-5 seconds)</li>\n<li>The response evaluator examines the HTTP status code, comparing it against the expected healthy status (usually 200)</li>\n<li>Optional response body validation checks for specific content patterns that indicate application readiness</li>\n<li>The probe duration is measured and recorded for latency monitoring and timeout tuning</li>\n<li>The result (success or failure with error details) is passed to the failure detection logic</li>\n<li>The next probe is scheduled based on the configured interval, independent of the current result</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Response evaluation goes beyond simple HTTP status code checking to provide more comprehensive health assessment. A backend might return HTTP 200 but include an error message in the response body indicating database connectivity issues or resource exhaustion. Advanced health probe configurations allow specifying expected response body patterns, response time thresholds, and custom headers that must be present.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Evaluation Criteria</th>\n<th>Healthy Condition</th>\n<th>Unhealthy Condition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Status Code</td>\n<td>Matches expected status (default 200)</td>\n<td>Any other status code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Time</td>\n<td>Under configured threshold (default 5s)</td>\n<td>Exceeds timeout threshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Body</td>\n<td>Contains expected pattern (if configured)</td>\n<td>Missing pattern or contains error indicators</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection</td>\n<td>Successful TCP connection established</td>\n<td>Connection refused, timeout, or network error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Content Type</td>\n<td>Matches expected type (if configured)</td>\n<td>Unexpected content type header</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health probe system handles various failure scenarios gracefully, categorizing them to enable appropriate response strategies:</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Failures</strong>: These include DNS resolution failures, connection refused errors, and network timeouts. Connection failures typically indicate infrastructure problems or complete backend unavailability and result in immediate failure classification.</p>\n<p><strong>HTTP Protocol Errors</strong>: These encompass invalid HTTP responses, malformed headers, and protocol violations. While less common than connection failures, protocol errors suggest backend application issues and also result in failure classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Application-Level Failures</strong>: These occur when the HTTP request succeeds but the application reports unhealthy status through error codes (500, 503) or response body content. Application-level failures often indicate partial outages or degraded performance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The health probe timeout should be significantly shorter than the request forwarding timeout. A backend that takes 10 seconds to respond to a health check will likely perform poorly for real requests, so it should be marked unhealthy even if it eventually responds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"failure-detection-logic\">Failure Detection Logic</h3>\n<p>The <strong>failure detection logic</strong> processes individual probe results to determine when a backend should be marked as unhealthy and removed from the active pool. Rather than making decisions based on single probe failures, the system uses <strong>consecutive failure counting</strong> to avoid false positives caused by temporary network glitches or brief backend hiccups.</p>\n<p>The failure detection mechanism maintains a running count of consecutive failures for each backend server. When a health probe succeeds, the consecutive failure count resets to zero. When a probe fails, the count increments. Once the consecutive failure count reaches the configured <strong>unhealthy threshold</strong>, the backend transitions to the unhealthy state and gets excluded from request distribution.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Detection State</th>\n<th>Consecutive Failures</th>\n<th>Action Taken</th>\n<th>Next State Trigger</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Healthy Monitoring</td>\n<td>0 to (threshold - 1)</td>\n<td>Continue normal checking</td>\n<td>Failure count reaches unhealthy threshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transitioning to Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Equals unhealthy threshold</td>\n<td>Mark backend unhealthy, remove from pool</td>\n<td>Additional failure (stays unhealthy) or success (start recovery)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unhealthy Confirmed</td>\n<td>Greater than unhealthy threshold</td>\n<td>Keep backend out of pool</td>\n<td>First successful probe (start recovery process)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recovery Monitoring</td>\n<td>Varies during recovery</td>\n<td>Keep out of pool but continue checking</td>\n<td>Consecutive successes reach healthy threshold</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The consecutive failure approach provides several important benefits for production load balancer stability:</p>\n<p><strong>False Positive Reduction</strong>: Temporary network hiccups, brief CPU spikes, or momentary resource contention won&#39;t immediately remove a healthy backend from service. The system tolerates transient issues while still detecting sustained problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Configurable Sensitivity</strong>: Different environments require different failure detection speeds. A development environment might use a threshold of 2 consecutive failures for quick feedback, while a production system might use 5 consecutive failures to prioritize stability over immediate response.</p>\n<p><strong>Gradual Response</strong>: The system doesn&#39;t immediately panic when a single probe fails. Instead, it continues monitoring and only takes action when multiple consecutive probes confirm a persistent problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Consecutive Failure Counting vs. Sliding Window</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to balance quick failure detection with false positive avoidance</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Single failure triggers unhealthy state (immediate response)</li>\n<li>Consecutive failure counting (current approach)</li>\n<li>Sliding window percentage (e.g., 80% failures in last 10 probes)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Consecutive failure counting with configurable threshold</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simpler to understand and configure than sliding windows, more stable than single-failure triggering, and maps well to common operational expectations</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: May be slower to detect intermittent failures compared to sliding windows, but provides predictable behavior and lower false positive rates</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The failure detection logic tracks multiple types of information for each backend to support both operational decisions and debugging:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>HealthState Structure Components:\n- Healthy: Current overall health status (boolean)\n- ConsecutiveSuccesses: Count of consecutive successful probes\n- ConsecutiveFailures: Count of consecutive failed probes  \n- LastCheckTime: Timestamp of most recent probe attempt\n- LastSuccessTime: Timestamp of most recent successful probe\n- LastFailureTime: Timestamp of most recent failed probe\n- LastError: Error message from most recent failure\n- TotalChecks: Lifetime count of all probe attempts\n- TotalSuccesses: Lifetime count of successful probes\n- TotalFailures: Lifetime count of failed probes\n- StateChanges: Historical log of healthy/unhealthy transitions</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The state transition algorithm follows a clear decision tree for each probe result:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Receive probe result</strong> with timestamp, success/failure status, and error details (if failure)</li>\n<li><strong>Update timing information</strong> by recording the probe timestamp and updating last success/failure times</li>\n<li><strong>Increment counters</strong> for both total checks and either total successes or total failures</li>\n<li><strong>Process success path</strong> (if probe succeeded): Reset consecutive failure count to zero, increment consecutive success count, and check if recovery conditions are met</li>\n<li><strong>Process failure path</strong> (if probe failed): Reset consecutive success count to zero, increment consecutive failure count, and record error details</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluate state transition</strong>: Compare consecutive failure count against unhealthy threshold to determine if backend should be marked unhealthy</li>\n<li><strong>Execute state change</strong> (if threshold crossed): Update healthy status, log state change with reason, and notify backend manager of status change</li>\n<li><strong>Update statistics</strong> including failure rate calculations and availability metrics for monitoring</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Error classification during failure detection helps operators understand the types of problems affecting their backends:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Detection Pattern</th>\n<th>Typical Causes</th>\n<th>Operational Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Connection Refused</td>\n<td>TCP connection fails immediately</td>\n<td>Backend process stopped, port not listening</td>\n<td>Restart backend service, check process status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout</td>\n<td>No response within configured time limit</td>\n<td>Backend overloaded, network congestion</td>\n<td>Check backend CPU/memory, investigate network</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DNS Failure</td>\n<td>Cannot resolve backend hostname</td>\n<td>DNS server issues, incorrect configuration</td>\n<td>Verify DNS configuration, check name resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP Error</td>\n<td>Connection succeeds but HTTP status indicates failure</td>\n<td>Application-level problems, database issues</td>\n<td>Check backend application logs, verify dependencies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Protocol Error</td>\n<td>Invalid HTTP response format</td>\n<td>Backend returning malformed responses</td>\n<td>Investigate backend application code, check for corruption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"recovery-detection-logic\">Recovery Detection Logic</h3>\n<p>The <strong>recovery detection logic</strong> manages the process of bringing previously unhealthy backends back into the active pool once they demonstrate sustained recovery.

Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid subtle bugs and operational issues that often emerge only under specific conditions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Overwhelming Backends</strong></p>\n<p>A frequently encountered problem occurs when health check traffic itself causes backend performance degradation or failure. This happens when health check intervals are too aggressive, health check endpoints are too expensive, or the health checking system doesn&#39;t account for backend capacity limits.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Health checks run continuously regardless of backend load, and poorly configured intervals can generate significant additional traffic. For example, checking 100 backends every 5 seconds with a 30-second timeout creates sustained load that might overwhelm already-stressed backends.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Monitor backend server logs for high health check request volume, observe correlation between health check frequency and backend response times, or notice that backends fail health checks during high traffic periods but recover during low traffic periods.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Configure reasonable check intervals (30+ seconds for production), implement lightweight health check endpoints that don&#39;t perform expensive operations, use jitter to distribute check timing, and monitor health check traffic as a percentage of total backend load.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Health State Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Concurrent access to health state information can create race conditions where multiple goroutines read and modify state simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state transitions or lost updates.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Health check updates, request routing decisions, and administrative queries all access backend health state concurrently. Without proper synchronization, the health checker might mark a backend unhealthy while the request router is simultaneously reading it as healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Inconsistent health state reports between different system components, backends that seem to flicker between healthy and unhealthy states, or occasional panics related to concurrent map access.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Use appropriate synchronization primitives (RWMutex for state transitions, atomic operations for counters), implement copy-on-read for expensive operations, and ensure state changes are atomic from the perspective of other system components.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Thundering Herd During Recovery</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple backends recover simultaneously after a shared outage (network partition, dependency failure), they can overwhelm the system with sudden traffic spikes, potentially causing a cascade failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: All backends fail health checks simultaneously during an infrastructure outage, then all begin recovery at roughly the same time when the outage resolves. Without coordination, they all rejoin the active pool simultaneously, receiving full traffic allocation immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Sudden traffic spikes coinciding with backend recovery events, performance degradation immediately after outage resolution, or repeated cycles of recovery and failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Implement jitter in recovery timing, consider gradual traffic restoration for recently recovered backends, monitor for mass recovery events and implement rate limiting when detected, or use longer healthy thresholds to spread recovery timing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Endpoint Doesn&#39;t Reflect Application Health</strong></p>\n<p>Health check endpoints that only verify basic connectivity (returning 200 OK) without checking application dependencies can create false positives where backends appear healthy but can&#39;t actually serve requests successfully.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Simple health checks might only verify that the HTTP server is running without checking database connectivity, external service availability, or resource availability (memory, disk space).</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Backends pass health checks but return errors for actual requests, user-facing errors that don&#39;t correlate with health check failures, or performance issues that aren&#39;t reflected in health check results.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Design health check endpoints to verify critical dependencies, implement multiple levels of health checking (shallow for basic connectivity, deep for application readiness), and consider separate endpoints for different health aspects.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inappropriate Threshold Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>Incorrectly configured failure and recovery thresholds can cause either excessive sensitivity (frequent false positives) or insufficient sensitivity (slow failure detection), both of which degrade system reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Thresholds are often set based on intuition rather than measurement, different environments require different sensitivity levels, and threshold requirements change as system scale and reliability requirements evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Frequent backend state flapping indicating overly sensitive thresholds, delayed failure detection causing user impact indicating insufficient sensitivity, or correlation between network conditions and health state changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Start with conservative thresholds and tune based on observed behavior, implement different threshold profiles for different environments, monitor threshold effectiveness through failure detection time and false positive rates, and document threshold rationale for future tuning.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Health State History</strong></p>\n<p>Accumulating health check history, state changes, and error messages without proper cleanup can cause memory usage to grow unbounded over time, particularly in systems with many backends or long uptimes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Health state structures accumulate historical data for debugging and analysis, but without cleanup policies this data grows indefinitely. State change logs, error message histories, and statistical counters can consume significant memory.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Gradually increasing memory usage over time, memory usage that correlates with system uptime rather than current load, or large amounts of memory attributed to health checking structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Implement retention policies for historical data (keep last N state changes, limit error message storage), use ring buffers for historical data instead of unlimited slices, periodically clean up old statistical data, and monitor memory usage of health checking components.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Timeout Longer Than Request Timeout</strong></p>\n<p>Configuring health check timeouts that are longer than request forwarding timeouts creates a situation where backends might appear healthy to the health checker but still fail user requests due to slowness.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Occurs</strong>: Health check and request forwarding timeouts are often configured independently, and it&#39;s counterintuitive that health checks should have shorter timeouts than actual requests.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Detect</strong>: Backends that pass health checks but frequently time out on user requests, user-reported slow response times that don&#39;t correlate with health check failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention and Fix</strong>: Set health check timeouts to be 50-80% of request timeouts, consider separate performance-based health checking that measures response times, and monitor correlation between health check performance and request success rates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The health checking system requires careful implementation to handle concurrent operations, manage resource usage, and provide reliable failure detection.

(1-4) — the request router serves as the central coordinator that integrates HTTP proxying (Milestone 1), backend selection algorithms (Milestone 2), health checking (Milestone 3), and advanced routing features (Milestone 4) into a unified request processing pipeline</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-airport-control-tower\">Mental Model: Airport Control Tower</h3>\n<p>Think of the request router as an airport control tower coordinating the complex dance of aircraft arrivals and departures. Just as an air traffic controller receives incoming flight requests, checks runway availability, weather conditions, and aircraft capabilities before directing each plane to the appropriate runway, the request router receives HTTP requests, checks backend health status, applies load balancing algorithms, and directs each request to the most suitable backend server.</p>\n<p>The control tower doesn&#39;t fly the planes itself — it coordinates between multiple specialized systems. Weather monitoring provides current conditions (health checking system), runway management tracks capacity and availability (backend pool manager), and flight planning algorithms determine optimal routing (load balancing algorithms). The controller integrates information from all these systems to make real-time routing decisions while handling edge cases like emergency landings (error responses) and runway closures (backend failures).</p>\n<p>This coordination role is critical because individual components work well in isolation, but the real complexity emerges in their integration. The request router must handle timing issues (what happens when a backend becomes unhealthy between selection and request forwarding?), resource coordination (ensuring connection limits are respected), and failure scenarios (graceful degradation when multiple systems experience problems simultaneously).</p>\n<h3 id=\"request-processing-pipeline\">Request Processing Pipeline</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Frequest-flow.svg\" alt=\"Request Processing Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The request router orchestrates a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that transforms incoming HTTP requests into successful responses through careful coordination of specialized components. Understanding this pipeline is essential because each stage introduces potential failure points and requires different error handling strategies.</p>\n<p>The <strong>request reception stage</strong> begins when the HTTP server accepts an incoming connection and parses the request headers, body, and metadata. The request router immediately creates a request context containing the original request, client connection information, and timing metadata. This context travels with the request through every subsequent stage, ensuring that timeouts, logging, and cleanup operations can be performed correctly even if intermediate stages fail.</p>\n<p>During the <strong>backend selection stage</strong>, the request router queries the <code>BackendManager</code> for the current list of healthy backends, then invokes the active load balancing algorithm to choose the most appropriate target. This stage requires careful error handling because the backend pool can change between the health check and the selection call. The router must handle cases where no healthy backends are available, where the selected backend becomes unhealthy after selection but before connection, and where algorithm state becomes inconsistent due to concurrent updates.</p>\n<p>The <strong>request enhancement stage</strong> prepares the original request for forwarding by adding necessary proxy headers, adjusting the request URL to point to the selected backend, and applying any request transformations required by the proxy configuration. The router adds standard headers like <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code>, and <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code>, while preserving all original headers that should be forwarded to the backend. Connection-specific headers like <code>Connection</code> and <code>Proxy-Connection</code> must be handled specially to prevent forwarding connection management directives meant for the proxy itself.</p>\n<p>The <strong>connection management stage</strong> establishes or reuses an HTTP connection to the selected backend server. The request router works with the reverse proxy component&#39;s connection pool to minimize connection overhead while respecting per-backend connection limits configured in the <code>BackendConfig</code>. This stage tracks active connections for algorithms like least connections and enforces timeout policies to prevent resource exhaustion. Connection establishment failures trigger immediate fallback to error response generation without attempting to forward the request.</p>\n<p>During the <strong>request forwarding stage</strong>, the enhanced request is transmitted to the backend server with appropriate timeout monitoring. The request router must handle various failure scenarios: connection timeouts during request transmission, backend servers that accept connections but never respond, and backends that respond with partial data before failing. The router maintains request context throughout this process to enable proper cleanup and logging regardless of how the forwarding attempt concludes.</p>\n<p>The <strong>response processing stage</strong> receives the backend response and prepares it for transmission back to the original client. The router removes backend-specific headers that shouldn&#39;t be exposed to clients, adds any required proxy response headers, and begins streaming the response body back to the client. Response processing must handle cases where backends return invalid HTTP responses, where the client connection is lost during response streaming, and where backends close connections unexpectedly during response transmission.</p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>cleanup and logging stage</strong> ensures that all resources are properly released, connection counts are accurately decremented, and comprehensive request logs are generated for monitoring and debugging purposes. This stage executes regardless of whether the request succeeded or failed, making it critical for preventing resource leaks and maintaining accurate system state.</p>\n<p>The pipeline stages are designed with <strong>explicit handoff points</strong> where control and responsibility transfer between components. Each handoff includes validation that prerequisites are met and that the receiving component has the information needed to proceed or handle failures gracefully. This design ensures that failures in one stage don&#39;t cascade unpredictably to other stages.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pipeline Stage</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Failure Modes</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Reception</td>\n<td>HTTP connection</td>\n<td>Parsed request + context</td>\n<td>Malformed HTTP, oversized request</td>\n<td>Return 400 Bad Request immediately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Selection</td>\n<td>Request context + healthy backends</td>\n<td>Selected backend + algorithm state</td>\n<td>No healthy backends available</td>\n<td>Return 503 Service Unavailable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Enhancement</td>\n<td>Original request + selected backend</td>\n<td>Enhanced request ready for forwarding</td>\n<td>Header processing errors</td>\n<td>Log warning, continue with original headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Management</td>\n<td>Enhanced request + backend config</td>\n<td>Active connection to backend</td>\n<td>Connection timeout, connection limit exceeded</td>\n<td>Return 502 Bad Gateway or 503 Service Unavailable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Forwarding</td>\n<td>Enhanced request + active connection</td>\n<td>Response from backend</td>\n<td>Backend timeout, connection lost</td>\n<td>Return 502 Bad Gateway, decrement connection count</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Processing</td>\n<td>Backend response + client connection</td>\n<td>Client response stream</td>\n<td>Invalid response headers, client disconnect</td>\n<td>Log error, close connections cleanly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleanup and Logging</td>\n<td>Request context + final status</td>\n<td>Resource cleanup + log entries</td>\n<td>Logging system failure</td>\n<td>Continue cleanup, fallback to stderr logging</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: The request router maintains request context throughout the entire pipeline to ensure that timeouts, resource cleanup, and error logging work correctly even when individual stages fail unexpectedly.

The request router must generate HTTP responses that accurately reflect the underlying problem while providing useful information for debugging without exposing internal system details.</p>\n<p>The <strong>error classification system</strong> categorizes failures into distinct types that require different response strategies. <strong>Client errors</strong> (4xx responses) occur when the incoming request is malformed, oversized, or otherwise invalid — these are detected during request reception and should be handled immediately without attempting backend forwarding. <strong>Backend unavailability errors</strong> (503 Service Unavailable) occur when no healthy backends are available or when all backends are at connection capacity — these indicate temporary system overload. <strong>Backend communication errors</strong> (502 Bad Gateway) occur when backends are selected successfully but fail during connection establishment or request processing — these indicate problems with specific backend servers. <strong>Timeout errors</strong> can manifest as either 504 Gateway Timeout responses when backends are slow to respond, or as connection timeouts that appear as 502 errors when backends never establish connections.</p>\n<p>The <strong>error detection pipeline</strong> monitors for failures at each stage of request processing and applies different detection strategies based on the failure type. Connection errors are detected through standard network error handling, examining error types returned by the HTTP client to distinguish between connection refused (backend down), connection timeout (backend overloaded), and DNS resolution failures (configuration problems). Response validation errors are detected by examining HTTP status codes, header formats, and response streaming behavior from backends. Resource exhaustion errors are detected through connection pool monitoring, memory usage tracking, and active request count monitoring.</p>\n<p><strong>Error response generation</strong> follows HTTP specifications while providing actionable information for debugging. The request router maintains a structured error response format that includes appropriate HTTP status codes, descriptive error messages that don&#39;t expose internal architecture details, and correlation IDs that enable request tracing across log files. Error responses include standard headers like <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, and <code>Connection</code> management headers, while avoiding headers that might confuse HTTP clients or proxy chains.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>HTTP Status</th>\n<th>Response Headers</th>\n<th>Body Content</th>\n<th>When to Use</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Invalid Request</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request</td>\n<td><code>Content-Type: text/plain</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Bad Request: Invalid HTTP request format&quot;</td>\n<td>Malformed HTTP, oversized headers, invalid methods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Unavailable</td>\n<td>503 Service Unavailable</td>\n<td><code>Retry-After: 30</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Service Unavailable: No backend servers available&quot;</td>\n<td>Zero healthy backends, all at capacity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Connection Failed</td>\n<td>502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td><code>Content-Type: text/plain</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Bad Gateway: Unable to connect to backend server&quot;</td>\n<td>Connection refused, DNS failure, connection timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Response Timeout</td>\n<td>504 Gateway Timeout</td>\n<td><code>Content-Type: text/plain</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Gateway Timeout: Backend server response timeout&quot;</td>\n<td>Backend accepts request but never responds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Invalid Response</td>\n<td>502 Bad Gateway</td>\n<td><code>Content-Type: text/plain</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Bad Gateway: Invalid response from backend server&quot;</td>\n<td>Malformed HTTP response, connection closed during headers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Internal Router Error</td>\n<td>500 Internal Server Error</td>\n<td><code>Content-Type: text/plain</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Internal Server Error: Request processing failed&quot;</td>\n<td>Algorithm failures, configuration errors, resource exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>error correlation system</strong> generates unique request IDs that are included in error responses and logged with sufficient detail to enable effective debugging. Each error log entry includes the request ID, client IP address, requested URL, selected backend (if any), error category, detailed error message, and timing information for each pipeline stage. This correlation data enables operators to trace problematic requests through the entire system and identify patterns in error occurrence.</p>\n<p><strong>Graceful degradation strategies</strong> determine how the request router behaves when multiple error conditions occur simultaneously. When the health checking system fails, the router can continue operating with the last known healthy backend list, gradually marking backends as unhealthy based on connection failures observed during request forwarding. When the backend selection algorithm fails due to corrupted state, the router can fall back to simple round-robin selection to maintain service availability. When the logging system fails, the router continues processing requests while writing error information to standard error streams.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Error Response Timing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Error responses must be generated quickly to prevent client timeouts while including sufficient diagnostic information for debugging</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate error responses with minimal detail, delayed responses with comprehensive diagnostic data, or adaptive timing based on error type</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Generate immediate error responses with essential information while logging comprehensive diagnostic data asynchronously</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Client applications typically have short timeout expectations (5-30 seconds), making response speed critical for user experience, while comprehensive diagnostic data is needed for operational debugging</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables fast client error handling while maintaining debugging capabilities, but requires careful log correlation to match error responses with diagnostic details</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The request router integration design requires several critical architectural decisions that fundamentally impact system behavior, performance, and maintainability.

making it particularly susceptible to subtle bugs that only manifest under specific timing conditions or failure scenarios. Understanding these common pitfalls helps prevent difficult-to-reproduce issues in production environments.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Request Context Loss During Error Handling</strong></p>\n<p>The most frequent integration mistake is losing request context information when errors occur, making it impossible to perform proper cleanup or generate meaningful log entries. This typically happens when error handling code paths bypass the normal context passing mechanisms or when panic recovery doesn&#39;t preserve context data.</p>\n<p>For example, when a backend selection algorithm throws an exception due to corrupted internal state, the error handling code might generate a 500 error response without access to the original request context. This results in connection leaks (because connection counts can&#39;t be decremented without knowing which backend was selected), incomplete log entries (because request timing and client information is lost), and difficult debugging (because error correlation becomes impossible).</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing comprehensive error handling that preserves request context throughout all failure scenarios. Error handling code must receive the same context object as success paths, and panic recovery mechanisms must capture context from the goroutine or thread stack. All error response generation must include request correlation IDs from the preserved context.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions Between Health Updates and Request Routing</strong></p>\n<p>Backend health states can change between the time a backend is selected by the load balancing algorithm and when the actual connection attempt is made. This creates a race condition where the router attempts to connect to a backend that has just been marked unhealthy by the health checking system.</p>\n<p>The symptom is intermittent connection failures that seem to contradict the load balancer&#39;s health checking logic — clients receive 502 Bad Gateway responses even when health checks show all backends as healthy. This happens because health state updates and request routing operate on different timelines and use different data synchronization mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing connection-time health validation that double-checks backend health immediately before connection establishment. If the selected backend has become unhealthy since selection, the request router should attempt fallback selection to choose a different healthy backend. The health checking system must also use appropriate synchronization primitives to ensure that health state updates are visible to concurrent request processing threads.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Improper Error Response Headers</strong></p>\n<p>Generating error responses with incorrect or missing HTTP headers can cause problems for client applications, proxy chains, and debugging tools. Common header mistakes include missing <code>Content-Length</code> headers for error response bodies, incorrect <code>Content-Type</code> headers, missing <code>Connection</code> management headers, and accidentally forwarding backend-specific headers in error responses.</p>\n<p>For example, when a backend connection fails, the request router might generate a 502 error response but forget to set appropriate <code>Content-Type: text/plain</code> headers. Client applications that expect JSON responses might then attempt to parse the plain text error message as JSON, leading to client-side parsing errors that obscure the original backend connection problem.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing standardized error response generation that always includes appropriate headers for each error type. Error response generation should use template-based approaches that ensure header consistency and should never forward headers from failed backend responses. Error responses should include correlation headers that enable request tracing without exposing internal architecture details.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resource Leaks During Connection Failures</strong></p>\n<p>When backend connections fail after successful establishment but before request completion, the request router must carefully manage resource cleanup to prevent connection leaks and inaccurate connection counting. Failed connection cleanup often introduces subtle resource leaks that accumulate over time and eventually cause connection pool exhaustion.</p>\n<p>The symptom is gradually increasing connection counts that never decrease properly, eventually leading to &quot;too many open files&quot; errors or connection pool exhaustion. This often occurs during periods of backend instability when many connections are being established and torn down rapidly.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing comprehensive resource cleanup using defer statements or try-finally blocks that execute regardless of how the request processing concludes. Connection counting must be decremented in all code paths that increment it, including error paths and panic recovery handlers. Connection cleanup must also handle partially established connections that fail during HTTP handshaking.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Request Processing Pipeline</strong></p>\n<p>Request processing pipelines that include blocking operations without appropriate timeout handling can cause cascading failures where slow or unresponsive backends affect the router&#39;s ability to handle other requests. This is particularly problematic when backend selection algorithms or health state updates perform blocking operations during request processing.</p>\n<p>For example, if the backend selection algorithm needs to acquire a lock on internal state and that lock is held by a goroutine performing a slow health check operation, all incoming requests will block waiting for backend selection to complete. This turns a problem with one component into a system-wide availability issue.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing non-blocking patterns for all operations in the request processing pipeline, using timeouts for any operations that might block, and designing component interfaces to avoid holding locks during external operations. Backend selection should use lock-free algorithms where possible, and health state updates should use optimistic concurrency control rather than long-held exclusive locks.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Logging During Failure Scenarios</strong></p>\n<p>Request routing failures often result in incomplete or inconsistent log entries that make debugging difficult, especially when multiple error conditions occur simultaneously. This happens when different components use different logging formats, when error handling code paths don&#39;t include proper logging, or when log correlation data is lost during failure scenarios.</p>\n<p>The symptom is log files that contain error messages without sufficient context to understand what went wrong, making it difficult to identify patterns in failures or correlate related events. Production debugging becomes particularly challenging when the information needed to understand a failure is spread across multiple log entries with different formats.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing structured logging with consistent correlation IDs throughout the request processing pipeline. All error handling code paths must generate log entries with the same format and correlation data as success paths. Log entries should include sufficient context information to understand the failure without requiring correlation with other log entries, while still providing correlation IDs to enable cross-component tracing when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The request router integration serves as the central coordinator that must handle complex interactions between multiple concurrent systems while maintaining high performance and reliability.

During a performance, the theater director occasionally needs to make changes to the program — perhaps adding an understated actor when someone calls in sick, adjusting the lighting cues, or changing the intermission timing. These changes must happen seamlessly without stopping the show or disrupting the audience experience.</p>\n<p>In a theater, the stage manager receives updated instructions from the director, validates that the changes make sense (the understudy knows the role, the new lighting cue won&#39;t blind the actors), and then coordinates with the crew to implement the changes during appropriate moments — perhaps between scenes or during natural breaks. The audience never sees the coordination happening behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a load balancer must accept configuration updates while continuing to serve live traffic. When operators need to add new backend servers, adjust health check intervals, or switch load balancing algorithms, these changes should take effect without dropping existing connections or causing service interruptions. The configuration system acts like the stage manager, validating changes and coordinating their implementation across all components.</p>\n<p>Just as the theater maintains a master program that all crew members reference, the load balancer maintains a central configuration that all components — the HTTP proxy, backend manager, health checker, and algorithm engines — use as their source of truth. When this configuration changes, each component must gracefully adopt the new settings while preserving its current operational state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-loading\">Configuration Loading</h3>\n<p>The configuration loading system provides the foundation for how the load balancer discovers its operational parameters and validates their correctness before applying them. This system must handle both initial startup configuration and runtime updates, ensuring that invalid configurations never compromise system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>File-Based Configuration Structure</strong></p>\n<p>The primary configuration mechanism uses structured files that operators can edit and deploy through standard configuration management tools. The configuration file contains all parameters needed to operate the load balancer, organized into logical sections that correspond to system components.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Configuration Section</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Key Parameters</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Port</td>\n<td>HTTP listener configuration</td>\n<td>Port number, bind address</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backends</td>\n<td>Backend server definitions</td>\n<td>URLs, weights, connection limits, timeouts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm</td>\n<td>Load balancing strategy</td>\n<td>Algorithm name, algorithm-specific parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HealthCheck</td>\n<td>Health monitoring settings</td>\n<td>Intervals, thresholds, probe endpoints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proxy</td>\n<td>HTTP proxy behavior</td>\n<td>Timeouts, header limits, connection pooling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Logging</td>\n<td>Observability configuration</td>\n<td>Log levels, output formats, destinations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>Config</code> structure represents the complete system configuration with strongly typed fields that enable compile-time validation and IDE assistance. Each backend server gets its own <code>BackendConfig</code> entry with comprehensive connection and timeout parameters that allow fine-tuning for different backend characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration Validation Logic</strong></p>\n<p>Before any configuration takes effect, the validation system performs comprehensive checks to ensure operational safety and logical consistency. This validation happens in multiple phases, from basic syntax checking to complex inter-dependency validation.</p>\n<p>The validation process follows this sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Syntax Validation</strong>: Parse the configuration file format and verify all required fields are present with correct data types</li>\n<li><strong>Range Validation</strong>: Check that numeric values fall within acceptable ranges (positive timeouts, valid port numbers)</li>\n<li><strong>URL Validation</strong>: Verify that backend URLs are well-formed and use supported protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Validation</strong>: Ensure referenced components exist (algorithm names match implemented algorithms)</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency Validation</strong>: Check that related settings make logical sense together (health check timeout less than interval)</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Validation</strong>: Verify that the configuration is achievable with available system resources</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Type</th>\n<th>Check Performed</th>\n<th>Example Failure</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Syntax</td>\n<td>JSON/YAML parsing</td>\n<td>Malformed JSON</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, keep current</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Range</td>\n<td>Numeric bounds</td>\n<td>Negative timeout</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, log specific error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>URL Format</td>\n<td>Backend URL parsing</td>\n<td>Invalid hostname</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, identify bad URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm</td>\n<td>Known algorithm name</td>\n<td>Typo in algorithm</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, suggest alternatives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consistency</td>\n<td>Cross-field validation</td>\n<td>Timeout &gt; interval</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, explain conflict</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource</td>\n<td>System capability</td>\n<td>Too many backends</td>\n<td>Reject configuration, suggest limits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Error Handling and Fallback Behavior</strong></p>\n<p>When configuration loading encounters errors, the system must maintain operational stability while providing clear feedback about what went wrong. The error handling strategy prioritizes service availability over configuration updates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Principle</strong>: Configuration errors never bring down a running load balancer. Invalid updates are rejected while the current configuration remains active.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The error handling system categorizes failures by severity and recoverability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fatal Errors</strong>: Problems that prevent any operation (missing configuration file at startup)</li>\n<li><strong>Validation Errors</strong>: Invalid configuration content that can be corrected (bad syntax, invalid values)</li>\n<li><strong>Warning Conditions</strong>: Suboptimal but workable configuration (single backend server, very short timeouts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each error category, the system provides detailed diagnostic information including the specific configuration element that failed, the nature of the problem, and suggested corrections. This feedback helps operators quickly identify and fix configuration issues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Configuration Validation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Configuration errors can cause service outages or unpredictable behavior, but overly strict validation might prevent legitimate configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Strict validation that rejects any questionable configuration</li>\n<li>Permissive validation that allows dubious but syntactically correct configuration</li>\n<li>Layered validation with errors vs warnings</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement layered validation with clear error/warning distinction</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach prevents dangerous configurations while allowing operators flexibility for unusual but valid setups. Warning messages help operators understand potential issues without blocking deployments.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex validation logic but better operator experience and safer deployments</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"hot-reload-mechanism\">Hot Reload Mechanism</h3>\n<p>The hot reload mechanism enables configuration updates without service interruption, allowing operators to modify load balancer behavior while maintaining existing connections and preserving service availability. This capability is essential for production environments where downtime is unacceptable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fconfiguration-update.svg\" alt=\"Configuration Hot Reload Sequence\"></p>\n<p><strong>Configuration Change Detection</strong></p>\n<p>The hot reload system monitors for configuration changes through multiple mechanisms that accommodate different operational workflows. File-based monitoring watches for changes to configuration files on disk, while API-based updates provide programmatic configuration management integration.</p>\n<p>The change detection system uses file system notifications (inotify on Linux, fsevents on macOS) to avoid polling overhead while ensuring rapid response to configuration updates. When file system notifications are unavailable, the system falls back to periodic file modification time checking with configurable intervals.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Mechanism</th>\n<th>Latency</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>File System Events</td>\n<td>inotify/fsevents</td>\n<td>&lt; 100ms</td>\n<td>Development, manual updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API Endpoint</td>\n<td>HTTP POST</td>\n<td>&lt; 50ms</td>\n<td>Automated deployment, orchestration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Periodic Polling</td>\n<td>Stat() calls</td>\n<td>1-30s</td>\n<td>Fallback, network filesystems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handling</td>\n<td>SIGHUP</td>\n<td>&lt; 10ms</td>\n<td>Traditional Unix administration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Graceful Configuration Transitions</strong></p>\n<p>When a configuration update is detected and validated, the system must coordinate the transition across all components while preserving operational state. This coordination happens through a carefully orchestrated sequence that minimizes disruption.</p>\n<p>The transition process follows these phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Preparation Phase</strong>: Load and validate the new configuration without affecting current operations</li>\n<li><strong>Coordination Phase</strong>: Notify all components of the pending configuration change and allow them to prepare</li>\n<li><strong>Transition Phase</strong>: Switch components to the new configuration in dependency order</li>\n<li><strong>Validation Phase</strong>: Verify that all components successfully adopted the new configuration</li>\n<li><strong>Cleanup Phase</strong>: Release resources associated with the old configuration</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each component implements a configuration transition interface that supports atomic updates with rollback capability. If any component fails to adopt the new configuration, the entire update is rolled back to maintain consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Pool Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Backend pool changes represent the most common configuration updates and require special handling to manage existing connections gracefully. When backend servers are added, removed, or modified, the system must update its internal state while respecting active connections.</p>\n<p>Adding new backend servers involves creating new <code>Backend</code> instances, initializing their health state, and registering them with the health checker before making them available for request routing. This process ensures that new backends are verified as healthy before receiving traffic.</p>\n<p>Removing backend servers requires a more complex process to handle existing connections gracefully:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mark for Removal</strong>: Flag the backend as no longer accepting new requests</li>\n<li><strong>Drain Connections</strong>: Allow existing requests to complete naturally</li>\n<li><strong>Health Check Cleanup</strong>: Remove the backend from active health monitoring</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Cleanup</strong>: Close connection pools and release backend-specific resources</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Backend configuration changes (weight adjustments, timeout modifications) can often be applied immediately since they don&#39;t affect connection state. However, changes that affect connection behavior (timeouts, limits) may require connection pool recreation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Update Type</th>\n<th>Immediate Effect</th>\n<th>Graceful Actions</th>\n<th>Rollback Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Add Backend</td>\n<td>Health check start</td>\n<td>Register with algorithms</td>\n<td>Remove from pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remove Backend</td>\n<td>Mark unavailable</td>\n<td>Drain connections</td>\n<td>Re-add to pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight Change</td>\n<td>Update algorithms</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Revert weight value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout Change</td>\n<td>Update proxy config</td>\n<td>Recreate connection pools</td>\n<td>Revert timeouts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Switching</strong></p>\n<p>Changing load balancing algorithms during operation requires careful state management since different algorithms maintain different internal state structures. The algorithm switching process must preserve request distribution fairness while transitioning to the new selection strategy.</p>\n<p>The switching process coordinates with the request router to ensure that in-flight requests complete using the current algorithm while new requests use the updated algorithm. This prevents inconsistent behavior during the transition window.</p>\n<p>Some algorithm transitions require state migration or reset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Round Robin to Weighted Round Robin</strong>: Preserve current position in rotation</li>\n<li><strong>Least Connections to IP Hash</strong>: Reset connection tracking, build hash state</li>\n<li><strong>Any Algorithm to Random</strong>: No state preservation needed</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algorithm State Preservation vs Reset</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When switching algorithms, existing state might be incompatible with the new algorithm&#39;s requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Always preserve state and attempt migration</li>\n<li>Always reset state on algorithm changes</li>\n<li>Preserve when possible, reset when necessary</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Preserve compatible state, reset incompatible state with clear logging</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This provides the best balance of consistency and performance. Compatible transitions maintain fairness, while incompatible transitions are handled safely with clear operator feedback.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex transition logic but better operational experience and fewer traffic distribution surprises</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Health Check Parameter Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Health check configuration changes affect the monitoring behavior for all backend servers and must be applied consistently across the entire backend pool. These updates can significantly impact system behavior, so they require careful coordination.</p>\n<p>Interval changes take effect at the next scheduled check cycle to avoid disrupting the current check timing. Threshold changes (healthy/unhealthy counts) are applied immediately but may trigger state reevaluation for backends near threshold boundaries.</p>\n<p>The health checker must handle parameter updates atomically to prevent inconsistent checking behavior:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pause Scheduling</strong>: Stop scheduling new health checks temporarily</li>\n<li><strong>Update Configuration</strong>: Apply new intervals, timeouts, and thresholds</li>\n<li><strong>Reevaluate State</strong>: Check if current backend states remain valid under new thresholds</li>\n<li><strong>Resume Scheduling</strong>: Restart periodic checking with new parameters</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The configuration and runtime control system involves several critical architecture decisions that affect both operational flexibility and implementation complexity. Each decision represents a trade-off between different operational requirements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Configuration Format Choice</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The configuration format affects both human readability and machine processing, with implications for validation, tooling, and operator experience</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>JSON for simplicity and universal parsing support</li>\n<li>YAML for human readability and comment support</li>\n<li>TOML for simplicity with better human readability than JSON</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Support both JSON and YAML with automatic format detection</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: JSON provides universal tooling support and parsing reliability, while YAML offers better operator experience with comments and readability. Supporting both accommodates different operational preferences and integration requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex parsing logic but better flexibility for different deployment scenarios and operator preferences</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Format</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Best Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>JSON</td>\n<td>Universal support, strict syntax</td>\n<td>No comments, less readable</td>\n<td>Automated generation, APIs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>YAML</td>\n<td>Human readable, supports comments</td>\n<td>More complex parsing, indentation sensitive</td>\n<td>Manual editing, documentation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TOML</td>\n<td>Simple syntax, good readability</td>\n<td>Less widespread support</td>\n<td>Small configurations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hot Reload vs Restart Requirement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Configuration updates can be handled either through service restart (simpler) or hot reload (more complex but zero downtime)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Require full service restart for all configuration changes</li>\n<li>Support hot reload for safe changes, restart for others</li>\n<li>Support hot reload for all configuration changes</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement hot reload for all changes with atomic rollback on failure</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Production load balancers cannot afford downtime for routine configuration updates. Complete hot reload support enables operational flexibility and reduces deployment risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Significantly more complex implementation but essential for production operation and continuous deployment workflows</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Configuration Validation Strictness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Configuration validation can be strict (reject questionable configs) or permissive (allow operator flexibility)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Strict validation that rejects any potentially problematic configuration</li>\n<li>Permissive validation that allows any syntactically correct configuration</li>\n<li>Layered validation with mandatory checks and optional warnings</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement layered validation with clear error vs warning classification</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach prevents dangerous configurations while preserving operator flexibility for legitimate edge cases. Warning messages provide guidance without blocking valid but unusual configurations.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More nuanced validation logic but better operator experience and fewer false positives that block legitimate deployments</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Configuration Storage and Persistence</strong></p>\n<p>The configuration storage strategy determines how the system maintains authoritative configuration state and handles persistence across restarts. This decision affects both operational complexity and reliability requirements.</p>\n<p>The system maintains configuration state in memory for runtime performance while persisting validated configurations to disk for restart recovery. This dual storage approach provides fast access for request processing while ensuring configuration durability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Storage Location</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Update Frequency</th>\n<th>Backup Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>Runtime access</td>\n<td>Every request</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Local File</td>\n<td>Persistence</td>\n<td>On validation</td>\n<td>Regular filesystem backup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>External Store</td>\n<td>Centralized management</td>\n<td>On deploy</td>\n<td>Distributed backup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Version Control</td>\n<td>Change tracking</td>\n<td>On commit</td>\n<td>Repository backup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Configuration Distribution in Multi-Instance Deployments</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple load balancer instances operate together, configuration distribution ensures consistency across all instances while accommodating network partitions and deployment timing differences.</p>\n<p>The configuration distribution strategy must handle several challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: All instances should eventually converge to the same configuration</li>\n<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Instance startup should not depend on external configuration services</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: Configuration updates should be applied atomically across instances</li>\n<li><strong>Rollback</strong>: Failed deployments should be recoverable across all instances</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Configuration Distribution Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Multi-instance deployments need consistent configuration across all load balancer instances</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Centralized configuration service with polling</li>\n<li>File-based distribution with shared storage</li>\n<li>Each instance manages its own configuration independently</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: File-based configuration with shared storage and local caching</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This provides good consistency with operational simplicity.

Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid common implementation mistakes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Partial Configuration Application</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is applying configuration updates partially when some components succeed in adopting new settings while others fail. This creates an inconsistent system state where different components operate with different configuration assumptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Partial configuration application can cause request routing failures, connection mismatches, and health check inconsistencies. For example, if the backend pool updates successfully but the health checker fails to adopt new thresholds, backends might be incorrectly marked as unhealthy.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement atomic configuration updates with all-or-nothing semantics. If any component fails to adopt the new configuration, roll back all changes and maintain the previous consistent state. Use two-phase configuration updates: validate all changes first, then apply all changes together.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Configuration Validation Race Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple configuration updates arrive simultaneously, validation logic can interfere with itself, leading to corrupted validation state or inconsistent rejection decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Race conditions in validation can cause the system to accept invalid configurations or reject valid ones. This creates unpredictable behavior that&#39;s difficult to debug and can compromise system reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Serialize configuration updates using a mutex or queue to ensure that only one configuration change is processed at a time. Validate against a consistent snapshot of current state rather than live state that might be changing during validation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks During Configuration Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Each configuration update creates new objects (backend instances, algorithm state, connection pools) but may fail to clean up old objects properly, leading to memory leaks over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Memory leaks eventually cause the load balancer to exhaust available memory and crash. Even small leaks become significant problems over time in production systems with frequent configuration updates.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement explicit lifecycle management for all configuration-related objects. Use reference counting or ownership tracking to ensure that old configurations are fully cleaned up when new configurations are applied. Include memory usage monitoring to detect leaks early.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Invalid Default Value Assumptions</strong></p>\n<p>Configuration loading often assumes that missing configuration values should use &quot;reasonable&quot; defaults, but these defaults might not be appropriate for all deployment scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Inappropriate defaults can cause performance problems (timeouts too short), security issues (permissive settings), or operational difficulties (verbose logging). Operators might not realize that critical settings are using defaults rather than explicit values.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Make critical configuration explicit rather than defaulted. Provide clear documentation about default values and their implications. Consider requiring explicit values for settings that significantly affect behavior rather than silently applying defaults.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Configuration File Format Lock-in</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a single configuration file format without considering future requirements can create operational difficulties when integration needs change.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Different operational tools and deployment pipelines have preferences for different configuration formats. Forcing operators to use an incompatible format creates unnecessary friction and may prevent integration with existing workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Support multiple configuration formats or choose formats with broad tooling support. Implement format detection so operators can use their preferred format without explicit format specification. Document the trade-offs between different formats clearly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Configuration Inconsistencies</strong></p>\n<p>When health check parameters are updated, existing backend health states might become invalid under the new configuration, but the system continues using stale state information.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Stale health state can cause backends to remain in incorrect states (healthy when they should be unhealthy or vice versa) until the next natural state transition. This defeats the purpose of configuration updates and can impact traffic distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Reevaluate all backend health states when health check configuration changes. Reset consecutive success/failure counters appropriately when thresholds change. Document which configuration changes trigger health state reevaluation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The configuration and runtime control system requires careful implementation to balance flexibility, reliability, and performance.

Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) — comprehensive error handling is essential throughout the project, from basic HTTP proxy errors (Milestone 1) through request distribution failures (Milestone 2), health check edge cases (Milestone 3), and algorithm-specific error scenarios (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-emergency-response-system\">Mental Model: Emergency Response System</h3>\n<p>Think of the load balancer&#39;s error handling like a hospital&#39;s emergency response system. Just as a hospital has protocols for different types of emergencies — cardiac arrest requires immediate CPR, while a broken bone needs stabilization and transport — the load balancer must recognize different failure patterns and respond appropriately. The triage nurse (error classifier) quickly assesses each situation, the emergency protocols (graceful degradation) keep critical systems running even when some equipment fails, and the circuit breaker acts like an automatic fire suppression system that stops spreading damage before it can cascade throughout the facility.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that not all failures are created equal. A single backend timing out is like a patient with a minor injury — handle it quietly and move on. But when multiple backends start failing simultaneously, it&#39;s like a mass casualty event requiring coordinated response to prevent the entire system from collapse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-mode-analysis\">Failure Mode Analysis</h3>\n<p>The load balancer operates in a complex environment where failures can occur at multiple levels and cascade in unpredictable ways. Understanding the complete spectrum of possible failures allows the system to respond appropriately rather than treating all errors as equivalent catastrophes.</p>\n<p><strong>Network-Level Failures</strong> represent the most common category of issues the load balancer encounters. Connection failures occur when the load balancer cannot establish TCP connections to backend servers, typically manifesting as connection refused errors when backends are down or connection timeout errors when backends are overloaded but still accepting connections slowly. DNS resolution failures can occur when backend hostnames cannot be resolved, either due to DNS server issues or misconfigured backend addresses. Network partitions represent more severe scenarios where network connectivity exists but is unreliable, leading to intermittent failures that can be particularly challenging to diagnose.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Server Failures</strong> encompass issues originating from the application servers themselves. Complete backend unavailability occurs when servers crash, are shut down for maintenance, or become completely unresponsive. Partial backend degradation happens when servers are running but experiencing high load, returning errors for some requests while successfully processing others. Application-level errors manifest as HTTP 5xx responses from backends that are otherwise healthy, indicating internal application issues rather than infrastructure problems. Resource exhaustion on backends can cause them to reject new connections or respond with errors even when the load balancer&#39;s health checks pass.</p>\n<p><strong>Load Balancer Internal Failures</strong> can critically impact the entire system&#39;s operation. Algorithm selection failures occur when the chosen load balancing algorithm cannot select a backend, typically because no healthy backends are available or algorithm state has become corrupted. Health checker failures can leave the system with stale health information, potentially routing traffic to failed backends or excluding healthy ones from rotation. Configuration errors can cause the load balancer to operate with invalid backend lists, incorrect timeouts, or malformed routing rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Exhaustion Scenarios</strong> affect the load balancer&#39;s ability to handle incoming requests. Connection pool exhaustion occurs when all available connections to backends are in use, preventing new requests from being processed. Memory exhaustion can cause the load balancer itself to become unstable or crash. File descriptor exhaustion prevents new connections from being established either from clients or to backends.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/load-balancer-basic/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling Decision Tree\"></p>\n<p>The following table catalogs the primary failure modes, their detection mechanisms, and immediate impact on system operation:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>System Impact</th>\n<th>Time to Detect</th>\n<th>Recovery Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend Connection Refused</td>\n<td>TCP connection error</td>\n<td>Request fails immediately</td>\n<td>&lt; 1 second</td>\n<td>Low - automatic retry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Connection Timeout</td>\n<td>Connect timeout expires</td>\n<td>Request delayed then fails</td>\n<td>5-30 seconds</td>\n<td>Medium - may indicate overload</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Response Timeout</td>\n<td>Read timeout expires</td>\n<td>Request fails after delay</td>\n<td>30-120 seconds</td>\n<td>Medium - backend may be struggling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DNS Resolution Failure</td>\n<td>Hostname lookup error</td>\n<td>All requests to backend fail</td>\n<td>1-5 seconds</td>\n<td>High - infrastructure issue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Returns 5xx Error</td>\n<td>HTTP status code</td>\n<td>Request fails with error</td>\n<td>&lt; 1 second</td>\n<td>Low - application level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All Backends Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Health check failures</td>\n<td>Service completely unavailable</td>\n<td>30-180 seconds</td>\n<td>High - requires manual intervention</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Checker Failure</td>\n<td>Health check process crash</td>\n<td>Stale health information</td>\n<td>Varies</td>\n<td>High - monitoring blind spot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm State Corruption</td>\n<td>Selection returns null/error</td>\n<td>Request routing fails</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Medium - algorithm reset needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Load Balancer Memory Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Memory monitoring alerts</td>\n<td>Performance degradation/crash</td>\n<td>Minutes</td>\n<td>High - requires restart</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration File Corruption</td>\n<td>Config parsing errors</td>\n<td>Cannot reload configuration</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Medium - fix config and reload</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Cascade Failure Scenarios</strong> represent the most dangerous category where initial failures trigger additional failures throughout the system. The classic scenario begins when one backend fails, increasing load on remaining backends, which may cause additional backends to fail under the increased pressure, eventually leading to complete service unavailability. Health check storms can occur when many backends fail simultaneously and then recover, causing a thundering herd of traffic that immediately overwhelms the recovering backends. Client retry storms happen when the load balancer starts returning errors, causing upstream clients to retry requests, multiplying the load on an already stressed system.</p>\n<p><strong>Timing-Related Failures</strong> introduce subtle bugs that can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose. Race conditions in algorithm state updates can cause inconsistent backend selection or connection counting. Health check timing issues can cause backends to flap between healthy and unhealthy states. Configuration update races can leave the system in inconsistent states where different components are operating with different configuration versions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most critical insight for failure analysis is that the load balancer sits at a convergence point where failures from many different systems and layers can manifest. A single client request might fail due to DNS issues, network problems, backend overload, application bugs, or load balancer resource exhaustion. The error handling system must be sophisticated enough to distinguish between these different failure classes and respond appropriately to each.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"graceful-degradation-strategies\">Graceful Degradation Strategies</h3>\n<p>Graceful degradation ensures the load balancer continues providing service even when operating under adverse conditions. The fundamental principle is to maintain the highest possible level of service availability by sacrificing non-essential functionality when resources become constrained or components fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Backend Selection</strong> represents the first line of defense against backend failures. When the health checking system identifies failed backends, the load balancer immediately excludes them from the selection pool, ensuring that client requests are only routed to backends capable of handling them. However, this simple approach can create problems if implemented naively. When backend capacity is reduced, the load balancer must account for the increased load on remaining backends and potentially implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent cascade failures.</p>\n<p>The system implements a tiered backend classification approach rather than the binary healthy/unhealthy model. Backends are classified as: Primary (fully healthy, normal response times), Secondary (healthy but experiencing elevated response times or error rates), Degraded (functional but unreliable, use only if no better options), and Failed (completely unavailable). This classification allows the algorithm to prefer better backends while still utilizing degraded ones when necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Request Admission Control</strong> provides protection against overwhelming the system during high load or reduced backend capacity. Rather than accepting all incoming requests and allowing them to fail at backend selection time, the load balancer can implement admission control that rejects requests early when system capacity is constrained. This approach is counterintuitive but essential — by rejecting some requests immediately with proper error responses, the system can successfully process more requests than if it attempted to handle all incoming traffic.</p>\n<p>The admission control mechanism monitors several key metrics: current backend capacity (number of healthy backends multiplied by their individual capacity), request queue depth, average response time, and error rate trends. When these metrics indicate the system is approaching overload, admission control begins rejecting a percentage of incoming requests, starting with the least critical traffic if request prioritization is configured.</p>\n<p><strong>Degraded Mode Operations</strong> allow the load balancer to continue functioning even when supporting systems fail. When the health checking system fails, the load balancer can operate in static mode using the last known good health states, gradually reducing confidence in this information over time. If configuration hot reloading fails, the system continues operating with the current configuration while logging errors and attempting periodic reload retries.</p>\n<p>During degraded operations, the system reduces functionality rather than failing completely. Complex algorithms like least connections may fall back to simpler round-robin selection if connection tracking becomes unreliable. Detailed request logging might be disabled to reduce I/O load. Non-essential monitoring endpoints may return simplified responses to reduce processing overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker Integration</strong> prevents the load balancer from repeatedly attempting operations that are likely to fail, reducing resource waste and improving response times. Each backend has an associated circuit breaker that monitors error rates and response times. When error thresholds are exceeded, the circuit breaker opens, immediately failing requests to that backend without attempting connection. This prevents the load balancer from wasting time and resources on backends that are known to be failing.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker implements three states: Closed (normal operation), Open (failing fast), and Half-Open (testing recovery). In the closed state, requests proceed normally while the circuit breaker monitors error rates. When failure thresholds are exceeded, the circuit opens, immediately returning errors for all requests to that backend. After a configured timeout period, the circuit enters half-open state, allowing a limited number of test requests through. If these succeed, the circuit closes and normal operation resumes. If they fail, the circuit reopens for another timeout period.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Service Availability</strong> ensures that even when some functionality is unavailable, the core request routing capability continues operating. If the health checking system fails completely, the load balancer can continue routing requests using the last known backend health states, with appropriate warnings in responses indicating degraded operation. If specific load balancing algorithms fail due to state corruption, the system can fall back to simpler algorithms that require less state management.</p>\n<p>The following table outlines the degradation strategies for different failure scenarios:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Scenario</th>\n<th>Degradation Strategy</th>\n<th>Functionality Retained</th>\n<th>Functionality Lost</th>\n<th>Recovery Trigger</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single Backend Failed</td>\n<td>Exclude from rotation</td>\n<td>Full service with reduced capacity</td>\n<td>None - transparent to clients</td>\n<td>Backend health recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple Backends Failed</td>\n<td>Admission control + reduced capacity</td>\n<td>Core routing with selective rejection</td>\n<td>Full request handling guarantee</td>\n<td>Backend capacity restoration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Checker Failed</td>\n<td>Static health state + gradual degradation</td>\n<td>Request routing with stale data</td>\n<td>Automatic failure detection</td>\n<td>Health checker restart</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary Algorithm Failed</td>\n<td>Fallback to simple round-robin</td>\n<td>Basic load distribution</td>\n<td>Advanced algorithm features</td>\n<td>Algorithm state recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration System Failed</td>\n<td>Continue with last known config</td>\n<td>Stable operation</td>\n<td>Configuration updates</td>\n<td>Config system restoration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial Network Connectivity</td>\n<td>Route to reachable backends only</td>\n<td>Service to accessible regions</td>\n<td>Global load distribution</td>\n<td>Network connectivity restoration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for graceful degradation is that availability is more valuable than perfection. A load balancer that serves 80% of requests successfully is infinitely better than one that fails completely while trying to maintain 100% functionality. The art lies in determining which 80% to serve and how to fail gracefully for the remaining 20%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Progressive Degradation Levels</strong> provide a structured approach to reducing functionality as conditions worsen. Level 0 represents normal operation with all features enabled. Level 1 disables non-essential features like detailed metrics collection and verbose logging. Level 2 simplifies algorithms and reduces health check frequency. Level 3 implements admission control and disables advanced routing features. Level 4 represents minimal functionality with only basic round-robin distribution and static backend lists.</p>\n<p>Each degradation level has clear entry and exit criteria based on system health metrics. The system automatically transitions between levels based on conditions, but also provides manual override capabilities for operational control during maintenance or emergency situations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"circuit-breaker-pattern\">Circuit Breaker Pattern</h3>\n<p>The circuit breaker pattern provides a critical protection mechanism that prevents the load balancer from repeatedly attempting operations that are likely to fail, while also providing a pathway for automatic recovery when conditions improve. Unlike simple timeout mechanisms that wait for each request to fail individually, circuit breakers learn from failure patterns and proactively prevent resource waste.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker State Management</strong> implements a state machine with three distinct states, each optimized for different failure scenarios. The Closed state represents normal operation where requests flow through to backends normally, but the circuit breaker continuously monitors error rates, response times, and other health indicators. Statistical tracking includes rolling windows of success/failure counts, recent response time percentiles, and consecutive failure streaks.</p>\n<p>When failure thresholds are exceeded in the Closed state, the circuit immediately transitions to Open state. In the Open state, all requests to the affected backend fail immediately with circuit breaker errors, preventing resource waste on operations that are likely to fail. This provides immediate feedback to clients while protecting backend servers from additional load that might prevent their recovery. The circuit breaker maintains the Open state for a configured timeout period, allowing the backend time to recover without additional request pressure.</p>\n<p>After the timeout period expires, the circuit enters Half-Open state, which serves as a careful testing phase for backend recovery. In Half-Open state, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests through to the backend while continuing to fail-fast for all other requests. If the test requests succeed, indicating the backend has recovered, the circuit transitions back to Closed state and normal operation resumes. If the test requests fail, the circuit immediately returns to Open state for another timeout period.</p>\n<p><strong>Per-Backend Circuit Breaker Configuration</strong> recognizes that different backends may have different failure characteristics and recovery patterns. High-capacity backends might tolerate higher error rates before circuit breaking, while smaller backends might need more aggressive protection. Database backends might have longer recovery times requiring extended Open state timeouts, while stateless web services might recover quickly.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker configuration includes several key parameters: failure rate threshold (percentage of requests that must fail to open the circuit), minimum request count (circuits don&#39;t open until sufficient data is available), timeout duration (how long to stay in Open state), half-open request count (number of test requests in recovery phase), and monitoring window duration (time period for calculating failure rates).</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Circuit Breaker State Transitions:\nClosed → Open: failure_rate &gt; threshold AND request_count &gt;= minimum\nOpen → Half-Open: timeout_duration elapsed\nHalf-Open → Closed: test_requests_successful &gt;= required_successes  \nHalf-Open → Open: any_test_request_failed</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Integration with Health Checking</strong> creates a comprehensive backend protection system where circuit breakers provide immediate failure response while health checks provide longer-term backend monitoring. Circuit breakers react to request-level failures within seconds, while health checks monitor backend availability over minutes. The two systems complement each other — circuit breakers prevent immediate damage from failed requests, while health checks provide the authoritative backend health state for load balancing decisions.</p>\n<p>When a circuit breaker opens for a backend, this information influences but doesn&#39;t override health check status. A backend might be healthy according to health checks but have an open circuit breaker due to high error rates under load. Conversely, a backend marked unhealthy by health checks will have its circuit breaker opened to prevent any test traffic until health recovery is confirmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker Metrics and Observability</strong> provide essential visibility into failure patterns and system protection effectiveness. Key metrics include circuit state transitions over time, failure rates leading to circuit opening, recovery success rates, and request volume reduction during circuit open periods. These metrics help operators understand system behavior and tune circuit breaker parameters for optimal protection.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker maintains detailed logs of state transitions including timestamps, triggering conditions, and relevant metrics at transition time. This information proves invaluable for post-incident analysis and system tuning. Circuit breaker dashboards should display current state for all backends, recent state transition history, and trending metrics that might indicate approaching threshold breaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Circuit Breaker Patterns</strong> extend the basic three-state model to handle more complex failure scenarios. Adaptive thresholds adjust failure rate requirements based on overall system load and backend capacity. During high load periods, circuits might tolerate higher error rates before opening, recognizing that some failures are inevitable under stress.</p>\n<p>Cascading circuit breakers coordinate between related backends to prevent failure spread. When a primary backend&#39;s circuit opens, related backup backends might automatically reduce their failure thresholds, recognizing that they&#39;re likely to experience increased load and potential secondary failures.</p>\n<p>The following table describes circuit breaker behavior for different failure patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Pattern</th>\n<th>Circuit Breaker Response</th>\n<th>Protection Provided</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Monitoring Focus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Intermittent Errors</td>\n<td>Remains closed until threshold</td>\n<td>None - errors passed through</td>\n<td>Automatic - no action needed</td>\n<td>Error rate trending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steady High Error Rate</td>\n<td>Opens after threshold breach</td>\n<td>Immediate fail-fast</td>\n<td>Half-open testing after timeout</td>\n<td>Error rate stability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complete Backend Failure</td>\n<td>Opens immediately on 100% errors</td>\n<td>Full protection from dead backend</td>\n<td>Coordinated with health checks</td>\n<td>Backend recovery signals</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow Response Times</td>\n<td>Opens based on timeout thresholds</td>\n<td>Prevents request queuing</td>\n<td>Response time improvement</td>\n<td>Latency percentiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Opens on connection/resource errors</td>\n<td>Prevents resource waste</td>\n<td>Backend capacity restoration</td>\n<td>Resource utilization metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cascade Failure</td>\n<td>Coordinated opening across backends</td>\n<td>System-wide protection</td>\n<td>Staged recovery testing</td>\n<td>Cross-backend correlation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The circuit breaker pattern embodies the principle of failing fast and recovering gracefully. By quickly detecting failure patterns and stopping wasteful operations, circuit breakers not only protect the load balancer&#39;s resources but often help backends recover more quickly by reducing the load pressure that contributed to their failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Circuit Breaker Implementation Considerations</strong> address the practical challenges of implementing effective circuit breaking in a high-throughput load balancer. Thread safety becomes critical when multiple concurrent requests might simultaneously detect failure conditions and attempt to change circuit state. The implementation uses atomic operations for state changes and careful synchronization around shared data structures.</p>\n<p>Memory management for circuit breaker statistics requires attention to prevent memory leaks from accumulating failure data. Rolling windows for error rate calculation must efficiently add new data points while discarding old ones. The implementation uses circular buffers and periodic cleanup to maintain bounded memory usage even during extended operation periods.</p>\n<p>Integration with load balancing algorithms requires careful coordination to ensure circuit breaker state changes are immediately reflected in backend selection decisions. When a circuit opens, the backend must be immediately excluded from algorithm consideration. When circuits close, backends should be gradually reintroduced rather than immediately receiving full traffic allocation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Treating All Errors Equally</strong>\nMany load balancer implementations handle all errors with the same generic &quot;502 Bad Gateway&quot; response, losing valuable diagnostic information. A DNS resolution failure indicates a configuration problem requiring immediate attention, while a backend timeout might indicate normal load fluctuation. The error handling system must classify errors appropriately and generate responses that help operators and clients understand the underlying issue. Implement specific error classification logic that examines error types, sources, and contexts to provide meaningful error responses.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Circuit Breaker Thundering Herd</strong>\nWhen multiple circuit breakers transition from Open to Half-Open simultaneously, the resulting test traffic can immediately overwhelm recovering backends, causing them to fail again and preventing successful recovery. This occurs when multiple backends fail and recover simultaneously, or when circuit breaker timeouts are configured with identical values. Implement jittered timeout values and coordinated recovery strategies that stagger test traffic across time and backends.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Masking Circuit Breaker State</strong>\nHealth checks that only test basic connectivity may report backends as healthy even when they&#39;re experiencing high error rates under load, leading to circuit breaker conflicts where backends appear healthy but circuits remain open. Design health checks to include load testing elements that simulate real request patterns, and ensure circuit breaker state influences backend availability decisions even when health checks pass.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Error Context Propagation</strong>\nError responses that don&#39;t include correlation IDs, backend identifiers, or failure timestamps make debugging nearly impossible in distributed environments. When a request fails, operators need to understand which backend failed, what type of failure occurred, and how to correlate the failure with logs and monitoring systems. Implement comprehensive error context that includes request correlation IDs, backend selection details, failure classifications, and timestamps.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cascading Timeout Configuration</strong>\nWhen load balancer timeouts are longer than client timeouts, clients give up and retry while the load balancer continues processing the original request, leading to resource waste and duplicate processing. Conversely, when load balancer timeouts are too short compared to backend processing times, requests that would eventually succeed are prematurely failed. Carefully configure timeout hierarchies where each layer has appropriate timeout values that account for downstream processing times and expected client behavior.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Error Tracking</strong>\nError tracking systems that accumulate failure statistics without bounds can consume unbounded memory over time, especially in high-traffic environments with frequent failures. Circuit breaker statistics, error rate calculations, and failure logs must implement proper cleanup and bounded data structures. Use rolling windows with fixed sizes, periodic cleanup of old error data, and memory usage monitoring to prevent error tracking from becoming a source of failures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The error handling implementation requires careful integration with all load balancer components while maintaining clear separation of concerns and comprehensive failure coverage.</p>\n<p><strong>A.

Just as a car manufacturer tests individual components (engine, brakes, transmission) in isolation before integrating them into a complete vehicle for road testing, we must validate load balancer components independently before testing the entire system end-to-end.</p>\n<p>The <strong>unit testing</strong> stage resembles testing individual car parts on specialized benches — we verify each algorithm, health checker, and proxy component works correctly in controlled conditions with predictable inputs. The <strong>integration testing</strong> stage is like road testing the complete vehicle — we run the assembled load balancer against real HTTP servers, inject failures, and verify it handles complex real-world scenarios. The <strong>milestone validation</strong> checkpoints act like quality gates between assembly line stages — each component must pass specific criteria before moving to the next integration level.</p>\n<p>This layered approach ensures that when something breaks during complex integration testing, we can quickly isolate whether the problem lies in individual component logic or in the interaction between components. Just as automotive quality assurance catches defects early when they&#39;re cheapest to fix, our testing strategy identifies load balancer issues at the appropriate level of granularity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-testing-philosophy\">The Testing Philosophy</h3>\n<p>A comprehensive testing strategy for a load balancer must address the unique challenges of distributed systems testing. Unlike testing a simple web application, load balancer testing involves multiple moving parts: backend servers that can fail, network connections that can timeout, concurrent requests that can create race conditions, and health checks that must detect failures accurately without overwhelming backends.</p>\n<p>The testing pyramid for load balancers has three distinct layers, each serving different purposes. <strong>Unit tests</strong> verify individual algorithms and components work correctly in isolation with mocked dependencies. <strong>Integration tests</strong> validate that components work together correctly and handle real network failures, server responses, and timing issues. <strong>Milestone validation checkpoints</strong> provide structured verification that each development phase produces working functionality before moving to more complex features.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that load balancer testing must simulate failure conditions extensively, since the primary value of load balancing is handling backend failures gracefully. A load balancer that works perfectly when all backends are healthy but fails catastrophically when backends go down is worse than no load balancer at all. Therefore, our testing strategy emphasizes failure injection, concurrent request handling, and edge case validation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: Test failure scenarios as thoroughly as success scenarios. A load balancer&#39;s value comes from handling failures gracefully, so failure conditions must be first-class citizens in the test suite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"testing-challenges-and-approaches\">Testing Challenges and Approaches</h3>\n<p>Load balancer testing presents several unique challenges that require specialized approaches. <strong>Race condition detection</strong> is critical because multiple concurrent requests can expose subtle bugs in counter incrementation, connection tracking, and backend selection. <strong>Timing-sensitive behavior</strong> like health check intervals and circuit breaker timeouts requires careful test design to avoid flaky tests that fail intermittently. <strong>Network simulation</strong> must replicate real-world conditions like connection timeouts, DNS failures, and partial response reads.</p>\n<p>Our testing approach addresses these challenges through deterministic mocking for unit tests, controlled integration environments with fault injection capabilities, and structured milestone validation that builds confidence incrementally. The testing strategy emphasizes <strong>reproducible failure scenarios</strong> where we can reliably trigger specific error conditions, measure the system&#39;s response, and verify recovery behavior.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unit-testing-approach\">Unit Testing Approach</h2>\n<p>Unit testing for load balancer components focuses on testing individual algorithms, health checkers, and request forwarders in isolation with predictable, controlled inputs. The goal is to verify that each component&#39;s core logic works correctly without dependencies on network I/O, timing, or external services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"algorithm-testing-strategy\">Algorithm Testing Strategy</h3>\n<p>Load balancing algorithm testing requires validating both correctness and concurrency safety. Each algorithm must demonstrate correct selection behavior under normal conditions and maintain consistency under concurrent access patterns that simulate real load balancer usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Robin Algorithm Testing</strong> focuses on verifying sequential selection with proper wraparound behavior. The test suite creates a pool of mock backends and verifies that the <code>RoundRobin</code> algorithm selects each backend exactly once before cycling back to the first. Concurrency testing spawns multiple goroutines making simultaneous selection calls and verifies that no backend is skipped and the distribution remains even within acceptable variance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Expected Output</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sequential Selection</td>\n<td>3 backends, 6 requests</td>\n<td>Backends selected in order: 0,1,2,0,1,2</td>\n<td>Assert sequence matches expected pattern</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty Backend Pool</td>\n<td>Empty slice</td>\n<td>Error or nil return</td>\n<td>Verify graceful handling without panic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single Backend</td>\n<td>1 backend, 5 requests</td>\n<td>Same backend selected 5 times</td>\n<td>Assert all selections return same backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrent Access</td>\n<td>1000 concurrent requests</td>\n<td>Even distribution ±5%</td>\n<td>Statistical analysis of selection counts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Counter Overflow</td>\n<td>Max int64 counter value</td>\n<td>Proper wraparound behavior</td>\n<td>Verify counter resets without errors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Weighted Round Robin Algorithm Testing</strong> validates proportional distribution according to backend weights. The algorithm must ensure that over a sufficient number of selections, each backend receives requests proportional to its weight while avoiding burst selections of high-weight backends (smooth weighted round robin behavior).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Backend Weights</th>\n<th>Request Count</th>\n<th>Expected Distribution</th>\n<th>Tolerance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Equal Weights</td>\n<td>[5,5,5]</td>\n<td>300 requests</td>\n<td>[100,100,100]</td>\n<td>±5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unequal Weights</td>\n<td>[1,2,3]</td>\n<td>600 requests</td>\n<td>[100,200,300]</td>\n<td>±5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Zero Weight</td>\n<td>[1,0,2]</td>\n<td>300 requests</td>\n<td>[100,0,200]</td>\n<td>±5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large Weight Difference</td>\n<td>[1,100]</td>\n<td>1010 requests</td>\n<td>[10,1000]</td>\n<td>±2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight Changes</td>\n<td>[1,1] → [1,3]</td>\n<td>Before/after distribution</td>\n<td>Smooth transition</td>\n<td>Manual verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Least Connections Algorithm Testing</strong> verifies selection of backends with minimum active connections. The test suite manually sets connection counts for mock backends and verifies that the algorithm consistently selects the backend with the fewest active connections, with proper tie-breaking behavior when multiple backends have equal connection counts.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Hash Algorithm Testing</strong> validates consistent client-to-backend mapping. The same client IP must always map to the same backend (session affinity), and the hash distribution should be reasonably uniform across different IP addresses. Testing includes edge cases like IPv4 vs IPv6 addresses and hash collision handling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"health-checker-component-testing\">Health Checker Component Testing</h3>\n<p>Health checker testing focuses on the <code>HealthChecker</code> component&#39;s ability to track backend health state accurately and transition between healthy and unhealthy states according to configured thresholds. Since health checking involves timing and network I/O, unit tests use mock HTTP clients and controllable time sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Health State Transitions</strong> testing verifies the state machine behavior defined in the <code>HealthState</code> structure. Tests manually trigger probe successes and failures to verify that backends transition from healthy to unhealthy after exceeding the <code>UnhealthyThreshold</code> consecutive failures, and back to healthy after exceeding the <code>HealthyThreshold</code> consecutive successes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Expected New State</th>\n<th>Additional Verifications</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Single failure</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td><code>ConsecutiveFailures</code> = 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>3 consecutive failures</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td><code>LastFailureTime</code> updated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Single success</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td><code>ConsecutiveSuccesses</code> = 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>2 consecutive successes</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td><code>LastSuccessTime</code> updated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Success after failure</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Counters reset properly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Probe Result Processing</strong> testing validates the <code>HTTPProber</code> component&#39;s ability to interpret HTTP responses correctly. Tests use a mock HTTP server that returns controlled status codes, timeouts, and connection errors to verify that the prober classifies responses correctly as healthy or unhealthy according to the configured <code>ExpectedStatus</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent Health Checking</strong> testing verifies thread safety when multiple health check operations run simultaneously. Tests spawn multiple goroutines calling health check methods concurrently and verify that health state updates are atomic and no race conditions corrupt the backend health tracking data structures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"backend-pool-manager-testing\">Backend Pool Manager Testing</h3>\n<p>The <code>BackendManager</code> component requires testing of backend registration, health state tracking, and thread-safe access to the backend pool. Unit tests focus on the core logic without network dependencies by using mock backends and health checkers.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Registration</strong> testing verifies the <code>AddBackend</code> and <code>RemoveBackend</code> methods work correctly. Tests add backends with various configurations, verify they appear in the pool with correct initial state, remove backends, and verify they no longer appear in selection results.</p>\n<p><strong>Health State Integration</strong> testing validates that the backend manager correctly integrates with health checking results. Tests simulate health state changes and verify that <code>GetHealthyBackends</code> returns only currently healthy backends, and that unhealthy backends are excluded from algorithm selection.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection Tracking</strong> testing verifies the <code>IncrementConnections</code> and <code>DecrementConnections</code> methods maintain accurate connection counts per backend. Tests simulate concurrent connection establishment and closure to verify that connection counting is thread-safe and accurate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Operation Sequence</th>\n<th>Expected Connection Count</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Increment, Increment, Decrement</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Assert <code>GetActiveConnections()</code> returns 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 concurrent increments</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>Verify no race condition corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decrement below zero</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Verify count doesn&#39;t go negative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reset backend state</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Verify counter resets properly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"request-forwarding-testing\">Request Forwarding Testing</h3>\n<p>The <code>ReverseProxy</code> component&#39;s HTTP request forwarding logic requires testing of header manipulation, request body handling, and error response generation. Unit tests use mock HTTP servers and clients to verify request forwarding behavior without real network dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Header Forwarding</strong> testing verifies that HTTP headers are copied correctly between client requests and backend requests. Tests create requests with various header combinations and verify that all headers are forwarded, forbidden headers are filtered out, and forwarding headers like <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> are added correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Request Body Handling</strong> testing validates that request bodies of various sizes and content types are forwarded correctly without corruption. Tests use requests with JSON payloads, binary data, and streaming bodies to verify that the proxy correctly streams request data to backends without buffering limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Response Generation</strong> testing verifies that various backend failure modes result in appropriate HTTP error responses to clients. Tests simulate connection failures, timeouts, and invalid responses to verify that the proxy returns correct status codes (502 Bad Gateway, 504 Gateway Timeout) with appropriate error messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-unit-testing\">Common Pitfalls in Unit Testing</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Testing with Real Network I/O</strong>\nMany developers write unit tests that make actual HTTP requests to localhost servers or external services. This makes tests slow, flaky, and dependent on network conditions. Instead, use mock HTTP servers that return controlled responses, or mock the HTTP client interface entirely to return predetermined responses and errors.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Race Conditions</strong>\nLoad balancer algorithms involve shared state (counters, connection counts, health states) that can be corrupted by concurrent access. Tests must specifically verify thread safety by spawning multiple goroutines and checking that results remain consistent. A test that passes in single-threaded execution may fail under concurrent load.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Error Scenario Coverage</strong>\nDevelopers often test only the happy path where all backends are healthy and responsive. Load balancers must handle various failure modes gracefully, so unit tests must cover scenarios like empty backend pools, all backends unhealthy, network timeouts, and invalid responses.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Non-Deterministic Test Assertions</strong>\nTests that rely on exact timing, random number generation, or hash functions may produce different results on different runs or platforms. Use controlled time sources, seeded random number generators, and statistical assertions (within tolerance ranges) rather than exact equality checks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"integration-testing\">Integration Testing</h2>\n<p>Integration testing validates that load balancer components work together correctly in realistic environments with actual HTTP servers, network connections, and failure injection. Unlike unit tests that use mocks, integration tests exercise the complete request processing pipeline from client request receipt through backend selection, health checking, and response forwarding.</p>\n<h3 id=\"end-to-end-request-processing\">End-to-End Request Processing</h3>\n<p>Integration tests must verify the complete request lifecycle through the load balancer system. This involves starting a real load balancer instance, configuring it with multiple backend servers, sending HTTP requests from test clients, and verifying that requests are distributed correctly and responses are returned properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Backend Distribution Testing</strong> creates multiple HTTP test servers (typically 3-5 backends) that return unique responses identifying which backend served the request. Test clients send a series of requests through the load balancer and verify that requests are distributed according to the configured algorithm (round-robin, weighted, etc.) and that all responses are received correctly.</p>\n<p>The test environment setup involves starting backend servers on different ports, configuring the load balancer with the backend addresses, waiting for health checks to mark all backends healthy, then executing the request sequence. Each backend server logs incoming requests so that distribution patterns can be verified independently of response analysis.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Backend Count</th>\n<th>Request Count</th>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Round Robin Distribution</td>\n<td>3 backends</td>\n<td>30 requests</td>\n<td><code>round_robin</code></td>\n<td>Each backend gets 10 requests ±1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weighted Distribution</td>\n<td>3 backends (weights 1:2:3)</td>\n<td>60 requests</td>\n<td><code>weighted_round_robin</code></td>\n<td>Distribution 10:20:30 ±5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Least Connections</td>\n<td>3 backends</td>\n<td>Variable load</td>\n<td><code>least_connections</code></td>\n<td>Requests flow to least loaded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IP Hash Consistency</td>\n<td>3 backends</td>\n<td>Same client IP</td>\n<td><code>ip_hash</code></td>\n<td>All requests to same backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Switching</td>\n<td>3 backends</td>\n<td>Before/after switch</td>\n<td>Runtime change</td>\n<td>Distribution changes correctly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Header and Body Preservation</strong> testing verifies that HTTP requests are forwarded to backends without corruption. Test clients send requests with various header combinations, different content types, and request bodies of varying sizes. Backend servers echo back the received headers and bodies so that the test can verify no information is lost or modified during forwarding.</p>\n<p>Critical headers to test include <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Authorization</code>, custom application headers, and headers containing special characters or Unicode content. Request bodies to test include JSON payloads, form data, binary content, and large bodies that exceed typical buffer sizes to verify streaming behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-injection-and-recovery\">Failure Injection and Recovery</h3>\n<p>Integration testing must validate that the load balancer handles various failure modes gracefully and recovers properly when backends return to healthy state. This requires controlled failure injection that simulates real-world backend problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Server Failures</strong> are simulated by stopping backend servers during active request processing. Tests verify that in-flight requests to the failed backend receive appropriate error responses (502 Bad Gateway), new requests are redirected to healthy backends, and the failed backend is marked unhealthy by the health checking system.</p>\n<p>The test sequence involves establishing steady request traffic across all backends, stopping one backend server, verifying that requests continue to be served by remaining backends with minimal error rate, then restarting the backend and verifying that it&#39;s restored to the rotation after successful health checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Partition Simulation</strong> tests scenarios where backends are reachable but respond slowly or partially. This is implemented using proxy servers that introduce controlled delays, drop connections at specific points, or return partial responses. The load balancer must handle these conditions with appropriate timeouts and error responses.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Simulation Method</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Recovery Verification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend crash</td>\n<td>Kill backend process</td>\n<td>502 errors, traffic redirected</td>\n<td>Health checks restore backend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow response</td>\n<td>Add response delay</td>\n<td>Timeouts, failover to healthy backends</td>\n<td>Fast backends handle load</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection drops</td>\n<td>Close connections mid-response</td>\n<td>Connection errors, retry logic</td>\n<td>New connections succeed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid responses</td>\n<td>Return malformed HTTP</td>\n<td>Parse errors, backend marked unhealthy</td>\n<td>Valid responses restore health</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DNS failure</td>\n<td>Invalid backend hostname</td>\n<td>Connection failures, backend excluded</td>\n<td>DNS resolution restores backend</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Health Check Validation</strong> testing verifies that the health checking system accurately detects backend problems and recovers backends appropriately. Tests configure backends to return different health check responses (success, failure, timeout) and verify that the health checker transitions backend states correctly according to the configured thresholds.</p>\n<p>The test setup includes mock backends that can be controlled to return specific health check responses on command. Tests verify that backends are marked unhealthy after the configured number of consecutive failures, excluded from request routing while unhealthy, and restored after consecutive successful health checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"concurrent-load-testing\">Concurrent Load Testing</h3>\n<p>Load balancer integration testing must verify correct behavior under concurrent request load that simulates realistic production conditions. This involves spawning multiple client goroutines that send requests simultaneously while monitoring for race conditions, uneven distribution, and performance degradation.</p>\n<p><strong>High Concurrency Distribution</strong> testing spawns hundreds of concurrent client goroutines that each send multiple requests through the load balancer. The test verifies that request distribution remains statistically correct under high concurrency and that no backends are overwhelmed while others remain idle.</p>\n<p>The test monitors backend request counts in real-time and calculates distribution variance across backends. For round-robin algorithms, the variance should remain low even under high concurrent load. For weighted algorithms, the distribution should match configured weights within acceptable tolerance.</p>\n<p><strong>Race Condition Detection</strong> focuses on scenarios that can expose subtle concurrency bugs in counter incrementation, backend selection, and health state updates. Tests specifically design request patterns that maximize the likelihood of race conditions, such as synchronized request bursts and rapid backend state changes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Concurrency Test</th>\n<th>Concurrent Clients</th>\n<th>Requests per Client</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Distribution Accuracy</td>\n<td>100 goroutines</td>\n<td>10 requests each</td>\n<td>30 seconds</td>\n<td>±5% distribution variance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Race Condition Detection</td>\n<td>500 goroutines</td>\n<td>20 requests each</td>\n<td>60 seconds</td>\n<td>No panics, consistent counters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mixed Algorithm Load</td>\n<td>200 goroutines</td>\n<td>Continuous requests</td>\n<td>2 minutes</td>\n<td>Algorithm switching works</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Check Integration</td>\n<td>100 goroutines</td>\n<td>Continuous requests</td>\n<td>5 minutes</td>\n<td>Health changes don&#39;t break distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection Tracking</td>\n<td>300 goroutines</td>\n<td>Keep-alive requests</td>\n<td>90 seconds</td>\n<td>Connection counts accurate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Backend Failure During Load</strong> combines high concurrent request load with backend failures to verify that the load balancer maintains service availability and doesn&#39;t cascade failures. Tests establish high request rates across all backends, then systematically fail backends while monitoring error rates and response times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-and-runtime-changes\">Configuration and Runtime Changes</h3>\n<p>Integration testing must validate that configuration changes can be applied during operation without dropping existing connections or causing service interruption. This includes adding and removing backends, changing algorithms, and updating health check settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Configuration Reload</strong> testing modifies the load balancer configuration file while the system is actively processing requests. Tests verify that configuration changes take effect without interrupting ongoing requests and that new requests use the updated configuration immediately.</p>\n<p>The test procedure involves establishing steady request traffic, modifying configuration parameters (backend list, algorithm, health check intervals), triggering configuration reload, and verifying that behavior changes appropriately without connection drops or request failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Pool Updates</strong> testing adds and removes backends from the pool during active request processing. Tests verify that new backends are integrated smoothly after health checks confirm they&#39;re healthy, and removed backends don&#39;t receive new requests but complete existing requests properly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-resource-usage\">Performance and Resource Usage</h3>\n<p>Integration testing includes performance validation to ensure the load balancer doesn&#39;t introduce excessive latency or resource consumption. Performance tests measure request latency, throughput, memory usage, and connection overhead compared to direct backend access.</p>\n<p><strong>Latency Impact Measurement</strong> compares response times for requests sent directly to backends versus requests processed through the load balancer. The load balancer should add minimal latency overhead (typically &lt;5ms) for request processing and forwarding.</p>\n<p><strong>Throughput Testing</strong> measures the maximum request rate the load balancer can sustain while maintaining correct distribution and error handling. Tests gradually increase request rate until error rates exceed acceptable thresholds or response times degrade significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory Usage Monitoring</strong> tracks memory consumption during extended operation to verify that the load balancer doesn&#39;t have memory leaks in connection pooling, health checking, or request processing. Tests run for extended periods (hours) while monitoring memory usage patterns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-integration-testing\">Common Pitfalls in Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Test Environment Isolation</strong>\nIntegration tests often fail when run concurrently or on shared systems because they compete for ports, file descriptors, or other system resources. Each test should use unique port ranges, temporary directories, and isolated configuration to avoid conflicts with other tests or system services.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Test Setup</strong>\nTests that start multiple servers and immediately begin sending requests may fail because servers haven&#39;t finished initializing or health checks haven&#39;t completed. Include proper synchronization to wait for all components to be ready before starting test operations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Unrealistic Failure Scenarios</strong>\nTests that simulate failures by immediately killing processes or cutting network connections may not reflect realistic failure modes where backends degrade gradually or become partially responsive. Include tests for gradual degradation, intermittent failures, and partial response scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Cleanup</strong>\nIntegration tests that don&#39;t properly clean up started servers, open connections, or temporary files can cause resource exhaustion and test failures. Implement proper test teardown that ensures all resources are released even if tests fail or panic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"milestone-validation-checkpoints\">Milestone Validation Checkpoints</h2>\n<p>Milestone validation checkpoints provide structured verification that each development phase produces working functionality before proceeding to more complex features. Each checkpoint includes specific behavioral criteria, testing commands, and debugging guidance to ensure learners can validate their progress systematically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"milestone-1-http-proxy-foundation-validation\">Milestone 1: HTTP Proxy Foundation Validation</h3>\n<p>The HTTP Proxy Foundation milestone validation ensures that basic reverse proxy functionality works correctly for single-backend forwarding before implementing load balancing algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional Verification Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Start Backend Server</strong>: Launch a simple HTTP server on port 8081 that returns a JSON response containing the request path and timestamp: <code>{&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/test&quot;, &quot;backend&quot;: &quot;server1&quot;, &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2024-01-01T12:00:00Z&quot;}</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Configure Load Balancer</strong>: Create configuration file specifying the single backend server and start the load balancer on port 8080 with logging enabled for all proxied requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Basic Request Forwarding</strong>: Send GET request to <code>http://localhost:8080/hello</code> and verify that the response contains the expected JSON from the backend with path &quot;/hello&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Header Preservation</strong>: Send request with custom headers (<code>X-Test-Header: value123</code>) and verify that the backend receives these headers correctly by examining backend logs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Request Body Forwarding</strong>: Send POST request with JSON body to the proxy and verify that the backend receives the complete request body without corruption.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Response Handling</strong>: Stop the backend server and send a request to the proxy.

id=\"debugging-guide\">Debugging Guide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) — debugging skills are essential throughout the project, from basic HTTP proxy connection issues (Milestone 1) through request distribution problems (Milestone 2), health check failures (Milestone 3), and algorithm selection issues (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-medical-diagnosis\">Mental Model: Medical Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>Think of debugging a load balancer like a medical diagnosis process. Just as a doctor systematically examines symptoms, runs tests, and narrows down the root cause before prescribing treatment, debugging a load balancer requires methodical observation of symptoms, targeted diagnostic tests, and systematic elimination of potential causes. The load balancer exhibits &quot;symptoms&quot; like failed requests or uneven distribution, and we use &quot;diagnostic tools&quot; like logs, metrics, and network traces to identify the underlying &quot;disease&quot; — whether it&#39;s a configuration error, network issue, or algorithmic bug.</p>\n<p>The debugging process follows the same systematic approach as medical diagnosis: first gather symptoms from multiple sources (logs, metrics, user reports), then form hypotheses about potential causes, design targeted tests to verify or eliminate each hypothesis, and finally apply the appropriate fix. Just as doctors maintain differential diagnosis lists, effective load balancer debugging requires maintaining a mental catalog of common failure modes and their characteristic symptoms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connection-and-networking-issues\">Connection and Networking Issues</h3>\n<p>Network connectivity problems represent the most fundamental category of load balancer failures. When the basic HTTP reverse proxy functionality fails to establish connections or properly forward requests, the entire system becomes non-functional regardless of how sophisticated the load balancing algorithms might be.</p>\n<p>Connection failures manifest in several distinct patterns, each requiring different diagnostic approaches. <strong>Connection refused errors</strong> typically indicate that the target backend server is not listening on the expected port, while <strong>timeout errors</strong> suggest that packets are being sent but no response is received within the configured time limit. <strong>DNS resolution failures</strong> prevent the load balancer from even attempting to connect to backends, and <strong>TLS handshake failures</strong> occur when HTTPS backends have certificate or protocol configuration issues.</p>\n<p>The diagnostic process for connection issues follows a systematic bottom-up approach, starting with basic network connectivity and progressing through increasingly sophisticated layers. This layered approach ensures that we don&#39;t waste time debugging application-layer issues when the root cause lies in basic network configuration.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Root Cause</th>\n<th>Primary Diagnostic Steps</th>\n<th>Secondary Investigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>&quot;Connection refused&quot; errors</td>\n<td>Backend not running or wrong port</td>\n<td>Check backend service status, verify port binding</td>\n<td>Examine firewall rules, network routing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout on all requests</td>\n<td>Network routing issue or backend overload</td>\n<td>Test direct backend connectivity, check network path</td>\n<td>Monitor backend resource usage, examine proxy timeout settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DNS resolution failures</td>\n<td>Incorrect backend hostnames or DNS server issues</td>\n<td>Test DNS resolution manually, verify hostname configuration</td>\n<td>Check DNS server connectivity, examine domain configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLS handshake failures</td>\n<td>Certificate mismatch or protocol version incompatibility</td>\n<td>Examine certificate validity and hostname matching</td>\n<td>Check supported TLS versions, cipher suite compatibility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermittent connection failures</td>\n<td>Backend intermittently unavailable or network instability</td>\n<td>Monitor backend availability over time, check network stability</td>\n<td>Examine backend startup/shutdown patterns, investigate network infrastructure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Port binding errors</td>\n<td>Load balancer port already in use or permission issues</td>\n<td>Check port availability, verify user permissions</td>\n<td>Examine other processes using the port, check system limits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Connection Pool Management Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Connection pooling problems create particularly subtle debugging challenges because they often manifest as performance degradation rather than outright failures. The <code>ReverseProxy</code> component maintains connection pools to backend servers for efficiency, but misconfigured pooling can cause resource exhaustion, connection leaks, or unnecessary connection churn.</p>\n<p>Connection leaks occur when HTTP connections to backends are opened but never properly closed, gradually exhausting the available connection pool. This typically manifests as gradually increasing response times followed by eventual connection timeouts as the pool becomes exhausted. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring the active connection count over time and examining connection lifecycle management in the proxy code.</p>\n<p><strong>Port Binding and Permission Problems</strong></p>\n<p>Load balancer startup failures often stem from port binding issues that prevent the HTTP server from accepting incoming connections. These problems require examining both the network configuration and system-level permissions that control port access.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Port binding failures during load balancer startup are often the first indication of configuration conflicts or permission issues.

These issues require systematic testing of network paths and routing configuration.</p>\n<p>The diagnostic process for routing issues involves testing connectivity at progressively higher network layers. We start with basic IP connectivity using ping, progress to port-level connectivity using telnet or nc, and finally test HTTP-level connectivity using curl or similar tools. This layered approach helps isolate whether problems exist at the network, transport, or application layer.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Level</th>\n<th>Command Example</th>\n<th>Success Indication</th>\n<th>Failure Diagnosis</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>IP connectivity</td>\n<td><code>ping backend1.example.com</code></td>\n<td>Packets received with normal latency</td>\n<td>Check routing tables, firewall rules, DNS resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Port connectivity</td>\n<td><code>telnet backend1.example.com 8080</code></td>\n<td>Successfully connected</td>\n<td>Examine service binding, port configuration, local firewall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP connectivity</td>\n<td><code>curl -I http://backend1.example.com:8080/health</code></td>\n<td>HTTP status code returned</td>\n<td>Check HTTP service configuration, request handling, application firewall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLS connectivity</td>\n<td><code>openssl s_client -connect backend1.example.com:8443</code></td>\n<td>TLS handshake completes</td>\n<td>Examine certificate configuration, TLS version compatibility</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"load-distribution-problems\">Load Distribution Problems</h3>\n<p>Load distribution issues represent algorithmic and concurrency problems in the backend selection logic. Unlike connection issues which prevent any request processing, distribution problems allow some requests to succeed while creating uneven traffic patterns or algorithmic failures that compromise the load balancer&#39;s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Distribution problems typically manifest as statistical anomalies in request routing patterns. The <code>RoundRobin</code> algorithm should distribute requests evenly across healthy backends, but race conditions in the counter increment or modulo operation can create clustering or skipped backends. The <code>WeightedRoundRobin</code> algorithm should respect configured weight ratios over time, but implementation bugs can cause disproportionate distribution or integer overflow issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Round Robin Counter Race Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>The most common distribution problem involves race conditions in the round robin counter increment operation. When multiple goroutines simultaneously increment the <code>counter</code> field in the <code>RoundRobin</code> struct without proper synchronization, the atomic increment operation can be lost or duplicated, leading to uneven distribution patterns.</p>\n<p>Race condition symptoms typically appear under concurrent load rather than during sequential testing. Single-threaded tests might show perfect distribution while concurrent load tests reveal significant skew. The diagnostic approach involves examining distribution statistics over large request volumes and monitoring counter increment behavior under concurrent access.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Distribution Pattern</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Approach</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Some backends never receive requests</td>\n<td>Counter increment race condition causing skipped values</td>\n<td>Monitor counter increments vs backend selection, check for gaps</td>\n<td>Load test with request tracking, verify each backend receives requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clustering of requests to single backend</td>\n<td>Modulo operation using stale counter value</td>\n<td>Examine counter read/increment timing, check atomic operation usage</td>\n<td>Track sequential backend selections, look for repeated selections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uneven distribution over time</td>\n<td>Integer overflow in counter causing negative modulo results</td>\n<td>Monitor counter value growth, check for overflow conditions</td>\n<td>Test with large request volumes, monitor counter wraparound behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Random distribution instead of round robin</td>\n<td>Multiple counter increments per request</td>\n<td>Trace counter increments per request processing, verify single increment</td>\n<td>Add counter increment logging, ensure one increment per selection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Selection and State Management</strong></p>\n<p>Algorithm switching problems occur when the load balancer attempts to change from one selection algorithm to another during runtime. The <code>RequestRouter</code> coordinates between different algorithm implementations, but state inconsistencies can cause selection failures or incorrect algorithm behavior.</p>\n<p>Algorithm state corruption often occurs during transitions when the previous algorithm&#39;s state remains cached or when the new algorithm initializes with incorrect state. The <code>WeightedRoundRobin</code> algorithm maintains complex internal state in the <code>currentWeights</code> map that must be properly reset when switching algorithms or updating backend configurations.</p>\n<p><strong>Weight Configuration and Calculation Errors</strong></p>\n<p>Weighted distribution algorithms face additional complexity from weight calculation and normalization logic. The <code>WeightedRoundRobin</code> implementation must handle weight configuration changes, zero weights, and weight ratio calculations without introducing mathematical errors or division-by-zero conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Weight-based algorithms are particularly susceptible to configuration errors and edge cases. A backend configured with zero weight should be excluded from selection, while negative weights typically indicate configuration errors that should be detected during validation rather than causing runtime failures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Weight Configuration Issue</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause Analysis</th>\n<th>Resolution Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Backend with zero weight receives requests</td>\n<td>Selection algorithm ignores weight values</td>\n<td>Check weight application in selection logic</td>\n<td>Implement weight validation, exclude zero-weight backends</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integer overflow in weight calculations</td>\n<td>Sudden distribution changes or selection failures</td>\n<td>Monitor weight sum calculations, check for overflow</td>\n<td>Use appropriate integer types, implement overflow detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Negative weights cause selection failures</td>\n<td>Algorithm exceptions or undefined behavior</td>\n<td>Examine weight validation during configuration loading</td>\n<td>Add configuration validation, reject negative weights</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight changes not reflected in distribution</td>\n<td>Algorithm uses cached weight values</td>\n<td>Check weight update propagation to selection logic</td>\n<td>Implement proper weight update notification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Backend Pool Synchronization Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Backend pool management creates complex synchronization challenges when backends are added, removed, or have their health status updated while requests are being processed. The <code>BackendManager</code> must coordinate between health checking updates and algorithm selection requests without introducing race conditions or inconsistent state.</p>\n<p>Synchronization problems typically manifest as selection of unavailable backends or failure to utilize newly added healthy backends. The diagnostic approach involves examining the timing relationship between backend state changes and selection algorithm state updates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"health-check-debugging\">Health Check Debugging</h3>\n<p>Health checking systems introduce temporal complexity into load balancer debugging because health state changes occur asynchronously relative to request processing. The <code>HealthChecker</code> component runs periodic probes against backend servers and updates health state based on consecutive success or failure counts, creating multiple timing-dependent failure modes.</p>\n<p>Health check false positives occur when healthy backends are marked as unhealthy due to transient network issues, overly aggressive failure thresholds, or health check implementation problems. False negatives occur when unhealthy backends remain marked as healthy, continuing to receive traffic and generate client-visible failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Check False Positives and Negatives</strong></p>\n<p>False positive health check failures create availability problems by unnecessarily removing healthy backends from the rotation. This typically occurs when health check timeouts are too aggressive for the network environment, when health check intervals create excessive load on backend servers, or when health endpoints don&#39;t accurately reflect backend health.</p>\n<p>The diagnostic process for false positives involves comparing health check results with actual backend availability and examining the correlation between health check timing and backend performance. Manual health endpoint testing often reveals discrepancies between health check logic and actual service availability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>False Positive Pattern</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Steps</th>\n<th>Corrective Actions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Healthy backends marked unhealthy during peak load</td>\n<td>Health check timeout too aggressive</td>\n<td>Compare health check timing with backend response times under load</td>\n<td>Increase health check timeout, implement adaptive timeouts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermittent false failures on stable backends</td>\n<td>Network instability affecting health checks</td>\n<td>Monitor network path to backends, compare with direct connectivity tests</td>\n<td>Increase consecutive failure threshold, implement jittered retry logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All backends fail health checks simultaneously</td>\n<td>Health check implementation error or network partition</td>\n<td>Examine health check implementation, test health endpoints manually</td>\n<td>Fix health check logic, implement network connectivity verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New backends never pass initial health checks</td>\n<td>Health endpoint configuration mismatch</td>\n<td>Verify health endpoint paths and expected responses</td>\n<td>Correct health endpoint configuration, implement endpoint discovery</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Health State Transition Problems</strong></p>\n<p>Backend health state management involves complex transition logic between healthy, unhealthy, and recovery states based on consecutive success and failure counts. The <code>HealthState</code> structure tracks multiple counters and timestamps that must be updated atomically to prevent inconsistent state transitions.</p>\n<p>State transition bugs often manifest as backends that become &quot;stuck&quot; in unhealthy states despite successful health checks, or backends that rapidly alternate between healthy and unhealthy states due to inadequate hysteresis in the transition logic. This &quot;flapping&quot; behavior can cause traffic disruption and excessive logging.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Check Endpoint Configuration Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Health check configuration problems stem from mismatches between the health check implementation and backend server health endpoint design. The <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> specifies the expected HTTP path, status code, and response characteristics, but backends may implement health endpoints with different semantics.</p>\n<p>Configuration debugging involves verifying that health check requests match the exact format expected by backend health endpoints. This includes HTTP method, request headers, expected response codes, and response body validation logic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Configuration Mismatch</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n<th>Solution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Wrong health endpoint path</td>\n<td>All health checks return 404</td>\n<td>Manual curl test of health endpoint</td>\n<td>Correct health check path configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Incorrect expected status code</td>\n<td>Health checks fail despite healthy backend</td>\n<td>Compare expected vs actual response codes</td>\n<td>Update expected status code in configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing required headers</td>\n<td>Backend rejects health check requests</td>\n<td>Examine backend access logs for health check requests</td>\n<td>Add required headers to health check configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response timeout too short</td>\n<td>Health checks timeout on slow but healthy backends</td>\n<td>Monitor health check response times vs timeout setting</td>\n<td>Increase health check timeout or optimize backend health endpoint</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Health Check Timing and Frequency Issues</strong></p>\n<p>Health check timing configuration requires balancing between rapid failure detection and avoiding excessive load on backend servers. The <code>DefaultInterval</code> of 30 seconds provides a reasonable starting point, but production environments may require different timing based on failure tolerance and backend capacity.</p>\n<p>Overly frequent health checks can overwhelm backend servers, particularly during startup or high load conditions. This creates a feedback loop where health checks contribute to backend overload, causing legitimate health check failures that remove backends from rotation. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring backend resource usage during health check intervals and correlating health check timing with backend performance metrics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-tools-and-techniques\">Debugging Tools and Techniques</h3>\n<p>Effective load balancer debugging requires a systematic toolkit of logging strategies, monitoring approaches, and diagnostic techniques tailored to distributed system challenges. Unlike debugging single-process applications, load balancer debugging must account for network timing, concurrent request processing, and interactions between multiple backend servers.</p>\n<p>The foundation of load balancer debugging lies in comprehensive logging that provides correlation between client requests, backend selection decisions, and response outcomes. The <code>RequestContext</code> structure carries correlation information throughout the request processing pipeline, enabling end-to-end request tracing even when requests span multiple components and goroutines.</p>\n<p><strong>Structured Logging and Request Correlation</strong></p>\n<p>Request correlation represents the most critical debugging capability for load balancer systems. Each incoming request receives a unique request ID that gets logged at every processing stage, enabling reconstruction of the complete request flow from initial receipt through backend selection, health checking, and response forwarding.</p>\n<p>The logging strategy must balance between providing sufficient detail for debugging while avoiding performance impact under high request volumes. Structured logging formats like JSON enable programmatic log analysis while maintaining human readability for interactive debugging sessions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Log Level</th>\n<th>Information Captured</th>\n<th>Example Entry</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>DEBUG</td>\n<td>Detailed algorithm selection, health check probes, connection pool operations</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;debug&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2023-10-15T10:30:45Z&quot;,&quot;request_id&quot;:&quot;req-123&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;backend_selected&quot;,&quot;algorithm&quot;:&quot;round_robin&quot;,&quot;backend&quot;:&quot;backend-2&quot;,&quot;counter&quot;:42}</code></td>\n<td>Algorithm debugging, performance analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>INFO</td>\n<td>Request processing, backend health changes, configuration updates</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;info&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2023-10-15T10:30:45Z&quot;,&quot;request_id&quot;:&quot;req-123&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;request_completed&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;GET&quot;,&quot;path&quot;:&quot;/api/users&quot;,&quot;backend&quot;:&quot;backend-2&quot;,&quot;status&quot;:200,&quot;duration_ms&quot;:45}</code></td>\n<td>Operational monitoring, request tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WARN</td>\n<td>Health check failures, backend unavailability, configuration issues</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;warn&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2023-10-15T10:30:45Z&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;backend_unhealthy&quot;,&quot;backend&quot;:&quot;backend-1&quot;,&quot;consecutive_failures&quot;:3,&quot;last_error&quot;:&quot;connection_timeout&quot;}</code></td>\n<td>Early warning system, capacity planning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ERROR</td>\n<td>Request failures, connection errors, system failures</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;level&quot;:&quot;error&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2023-10-15T10:30:45Z&quot;,&quot;request_id&quot;:&quot;req-123&quot;,&quot;event&quot;:&quot;request_failed&quot;,&quot;error&quot;:&quot;no_healthy_backends&quot;,&quot;total_backends&quot;:3,&quot;healthy_backends&quot;:0}</code></td>\n<td>Incident response, failure analysis</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Metrics Collection and Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>Metrics collection provides quantitative analysis capabilities that complement qualitative log analysis. The load balancer should expose metrics for request distribution patterns, backend health statistics, response time distributions, and error rates categorized by type and backend.</p>\n<p>Request distribution metrics enable detection of algorithm implementation bugs by comparing actual distribution patterns against expected theoretical distributions. The round robin algorithm should show nearly equal request counts across all healthy backends over time, while weighted algorithms should show proportional distribution matching configured weights.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Profiling and Resource Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>Load balancer performance profiling requires monitoring both internal component performance and overall system resource usage. Go&#39;s built-in pprof package provides CPU and memory profiling capabilities that help identify bottlenecks in request processing, algorithm selection, or health checking logic.</p>\n<p>Memory profiling becomes particularly important for connection pool management and health state tracking, where memory leaks can gradually degrade system performance. The diagnostic approach involves capturing memory profiles during different operational phases and identifying objects that persist longer than expected.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Metric</th>\n<th>Monitoring Method</th>\n<th>Normal Range</th>\n<th>Investigation Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>CPU utilization</td>\n<td>System monitoring, pprof CPU profiles</td>\n<td>&lt;50% during normal load</td>\n<td>&gt;80% sustained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory usage</td>\n<td>Process memory monitoring, pprof heap profiles</td>\n<td>Stable after warmup</td>\n<td>Continuous growth indicating leaks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goroutine count</td>\n<td>Runtime metrics, pprof goroutine profiles</td>\n<td>Stable with request load</td>\n<td>Unbounded growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File descriptor usage</td>\n<td>System limits monitoring</td>\n<td>&lt;50% of system limits</td>\n<td>&gt;80% of available descriptors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network connection count</td>\n<td>Netstat analysis, connection pool metrics</td>\n<td>Matches expected backend connections</td>\n<td>Excessive connection accumulation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Network-Level Debugging Tools</strong></p>\n<p>Network-level debugging tools provide visibility into the actual HTTP traffic between the load balancer and backend servers. Tools like tcpdump, Wireshark, and curl enable examination of raw HTTP requests and responses, helping identify protocol-level issues that might not be apparent from application logs.</p>\n<p>Network debugging becomes essential when diagnosing subtle HTTP protocol issues like header forwarding problems, connection keep-alive behavior, or TLS handshake failures. The systematic approach involves capturing network traffic during problem reproduction and analyzing the packet-level interaction between components.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated Testing and Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Automated testing tools enable systematic validation of load balancer behavior under various failure scenarios. The <code>TestServerPool</code> provides a foundation for creating controlled testing environments where backend failures, network issues, and load patterns can be simulated reproducibly.</p>\n<p>Testing automation should cover both normal operation validation and failure mode testing. Normal operation tests verify that request distribution matches algorithm expectations, that healthy backends receive appropriate traffic, and that response forwarding preserves HTTP semantics. Failure mode tests verify that backend failures are detected appropriately, that traffic fails over correctly, and that recovery behavior works as expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The debugging infrastructure for a load balancer requires careful instrumentation throughout the codebase combined with external tooling for monitoring and analysis.

milestones (1-4) — this section explores potential enhancements beyond the core load balancer implementation, demonstrating how the architectural decisions made throughout the project enable natural evolution and growth of the system&#39;s capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-growing-software-ecosystem\">Mental Model: Growing Software Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Think of extending the load balancer like expanding a thriving city. The basic load balancer is like the city&#39;s foundational infrastructure — roads, utilities, and core services. Future extensions are like adding specialized districts: a financial district (SSL termination), a smart traffic management system (advanced routing), and a comprehensive monitoring network (observability features). Each extension builds on the existing foundation while adding new capabilities that serve different needs.</p>\n<p>Just as a well-planned city leaves room for growth with proper zoning and infrastructure corridors, the load balancer&#39;s modular architecture creates natural extension points. The component boundaries, interface abstractions, and data models established in earlier sections provide the &quot;zoning laws&quot; that guide where and how new features can be integrated without disrupting existing functionality.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that extensions should feel like natural evolution rather than awkward retrofitting. When the core architecture is designed with extensibility in mind, new features integrate smoothly and leverage existing components rather than working around them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ssltls-termination-adding-https-support-and-certificate-management\">SSL/TLS Termination: Adding HTTPS Support and Certificate Management</h3>\n<p>The <strong>SSL/TLS termination</strong> extension transforms the load balancer from a simple HTTP proxy into a comprehensive HTTPS gateway that handles encryption, certificate management, and secure client communications. This extension addresses the critical requirement for secure web traffic while offloading encryption overhead from backend servers.</p>\n<p>In modern web architectures, SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer provides significant operational advantages. It centralizes certificate management, reduces computational load on backend servers, and enables the load balancer to inspect encrypted traffic for routing decisions. The load balancer becomes the security boundary, handling all client-facing encryption while communicating with backends over internal networks using HTTP.</p>\n<p>The SSL termination capability integrates naturally with the existing <code>ReverseProxy</code> component by adding a TLS layer before HTTP processing. The current request flow of client → load balancer → backend becomes client → TLS termination → load balancer → backend, with the load balancer now responsible for the cryptographic handshake and session management.</p>\n<p><strong>Certificate Management Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The certificate management system requires several new components that work together to provide automated certificate lifecycle management:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Integration Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>CertificateStore</td>\n<td>Manages certificate storage, loading, and rotation</td>\n<td>Integrates with Config loading system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TLSListener</td>\n<td>Handles TLS handshakes and client connections</td>\n<td>Replaces HTTP listener in ReverseProxy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CertificateValidator</td>\n<td>Validates certificate chains and expiration</td>\n<td>Used by HealthChecker for certificate monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AutoRenewal</td>\n<td>Automatic certificate renewal via ACME protocol</td>\n<td>Runs as background service alongside HealthChecker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SNIRouter</td>\n<td>Routes requests based on Server Name Indication</td>\n<td>Integrates with request routing pipeline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The certificate store manages multiple certificates simultaneously, enabling the load balancer to serve multiple domains from a single instance. This is particularly important in microservices environments where a single load balancer might front dozens of different services, each with their own domain and certificate requirements.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">go</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TLSConfig</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Enabled           </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">bool</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                    `json:\"enabled\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    CertificatesPath  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"certificates_path\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PrivateKeyPath    </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"private_key_path\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    CipherSuites      []</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint16</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                `json:\"cipher_suites\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    MinTLSVersion     </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint16</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"min_tls_version\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    MaxTLSVersion     </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">uint16</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"max_tls_version\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ClientAuth        </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">tls</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">ClientAuthType</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">      `json:\"client_auth\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Certificates      []</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">CertificateConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     `json:\"certificates\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ACME              </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">ACMEConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">             `json:\"acme\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    OCSP              </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">OCSPConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">             `json:\"ocsp\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> CertificateConfig</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Domain           </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    `json:\"domain\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    CertificatePath  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    `json:\"certificate_path\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    PrivateKeyPath   </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">    `json:\"private_key_path\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ExpirationTime   </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">time</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Time</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> `json:\"expiration_time\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    AutoRenew        </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">bool</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">      `json:\"auto_renew\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Backends         []</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">  `json:\"backends\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>ACME Protocol Integration</strong></p>\n<p>Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) integration enables the load balancer to automatically obtain and renew certificates from Certificate Authorities like Let&#39;s Encrypt. This removes the operational burden of manual certificate management while ensuring certificates remain current.</p>\n<p>The ACME integration requires careful coordination with the existing health checking system. The load balancer must temporarily serve ACME challenge responses while maintaining normal traffic flow. This creates an interesting architectural challenge where the request router must distinguish between ACME challenges and normal application traffic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: ACME Challenge Routing</strong></p>\n<p>ACME HTTP-01 challenges require the load balancer to serve specific content at <code>/.well-known/acme-challenge/</code> paths. This creates a conflict with normal request forwarding, as these requests must be handled locally rather than forwarded to backends. The solution is to add ACME challenge detection to the request routing pipeline, creating a short-circuit path for challenge requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Certificate Storage Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: File-Based Certificate Storage with In-Memory Caching</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Certificates need persistent storage for restart survival and fast access during TLS handshakes</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Database storage with encrypted certificate data</li>\n<li>File-based storage with periodic reload</li>\n<li>In-memory only with external certificate injection</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: File-based storage with automatic reload detection and in-memory caching</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: File-based storage provides simplicity and compatibility with standard certificate management tools, while in-memory caching ensures TLS handshake performance isn&#39;t degraded by disk I/O</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables standard certificate management workflows while maintaining performance, but requires file system security and backup considerations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>TLS Performance Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>TLS termination significantly impacts load balancer performance due to the computational overhead of cryptographic operations. Modern approaches use hardware acceleration where available and optimize connection reuse to amortize handshake costs across multiple requests.</p>\n<p>The integration with the existing connection pooling system becomes more complex with TLS termination. While backend connections can remain HTTP and benefit from existing pooling, client-facing TLS connections require different management strategies. TLS session resumption and connection reuse become critical for maintaining acceptable performance levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Certificate Authentication</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced TLS configurations support mutual authentication where clients present certificates for verification. This creates additional integration points with the request routing system, as certificate-based identity can influence backend selection and routing decisions.</p>\n<p>The client certificate validation integrates with the error handling system established in earlier sections. Certificate validation failures generate appropriate error responses while maintaining security by avoiding information disclosure about the specific failure reasons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-routing-rules-path-based-header-based-and-content-aware-distribution\">Advanced Routing Rules: Path-Based, Header-Based, and Content-Aware Distribution</h3>\n<p>The <strong>advanced routing rules</strong> extension transforms the load balancer from simple request distribution into intelligent application-aware traffic management. This extension enables sophisticated routing decisions based on request content, enabling use cases like API versioning, canary deployments, and multi-tenant architectures.</p>\n<p>Current load balancing algorithms focus purely on backend selection without considering request characteristics. Advanced routing adds a decision layer that examines request properties before applying load balancing algorithms, creating a two-stage process: first route to the appropriate backend pool, then apply load balancing within that pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Routing Rule Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The routing rule system introduces several new concepts that extend the existing data model:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Concept</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Integration Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>RoutingRule</td>\n<td>Defines conditions and actions for request routing</td>\n<td>Added to Config structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RequestMatcher</td>\n<td>Evaluates whether requests match rule conditions</td>\n<td>Integrated with RequestRouter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BackendPool</td>\n<td>Groups backends for specific routing rules</td>\n<td>Extends existing Backend grouping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RoutingAction</td>\n<td>Defines what happens when rule matches</td>\n<td>Applied before algorithm selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RulePriority</td>\n<td>Determines evaluation order for multiple rules</td>\n<td>Managed by request processing pipeline</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The routing rule evaluation happens early in the request processing pipeline, immediately after request parsing but before backend selection. This positioning allows routing decisions to influence which backend pool is considered for load balancing, while still benefiting from health checking and algorithm selection within the chosen pool.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">go</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span

routing enables different URL paths to route to different backend pools, supporting microservices architectures where different services handle different API endpoints. This routing strategy is essential for API gateways and service mesh implementations.</p>\n<p>The path matching system supports various matching strategies:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Matching Strategy</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact Match</td>\n<td><code>/api/users</code></td>\n<td>Specific endpoint routing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prefix Match</td>\n<td><code>/api/v1/*</code></td>\n<td>API version routing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regex Match</td>\n<td><code>/users/\\d+/profile</code></td>\n<td>Pattern-based routing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wildcard Match</td>\n<td><code>/static/**</code></td>\n<td>Static content routing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Path-based routing integrates naturally with the existing request processing pipeline. The URL path is available immediately after request parsing, enabling early routing decisions without requiring request body inspection or complex header analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Header-Based Routing Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Header-based routing enables routing decisions based on HTTP headers, supporting use cases like API versioning through Accept headers, tenant routing through custom headers, and device-specific routing through User-Agent headers.</p>\n<p>Header-based routing is particularly powerful for implementing canary deployments and A/B testing. Requests can be routed to experimental backend pools based on specific header values, enabling controlled rollouts and feature flagging at the load balancer level.</p>\n<p>The header matching system requires careful consideration of header normalization and case sensitivity. HTTP headers are case-insensitive by specification, but different clients and frameworks may use different casing conventions. The routing rule system normalizes headers for consistent matching while preserving original header values for forwarding to backends.</p>\n<p><strong>Content-Aware Distribution</strong></p>\n<p>Content-aware distribution represents the most sophisticated routing capability, enabling decisions based on request body content. This capability supports use cases like routing GraphQL queries to specialized backends, directing large file uploads to high-capacity storage services, and implementing content-based sharding.</p>\n<p>Content-aware routing requires careful integration with the existing request forwarding system. Reading request bodies for routing decisions means the body must be buffered and made available for both routing evaluation and subsequent forwarding to backends. This creates memory and performance implications that must be carefully managed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Request Body Buffering Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Content-aware routing requires access to request bodies, but HTTP proxying typically streams bodies to avoid memory consumption</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Always buffer bodies in memory for routing evaluation</li>\n<li>Stream bodies while extracting routing-relevant content</li>\n<li>Conditional buffering based on content-type and size</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Conditional buffering with configurable size limits and content-type filtering</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides content-aware routing capabilities while limiting memory impact and maintaining streaming performance for large uploads</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables sophisticated routing at the cost of increased memory usage and latency for content-inspected requests</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Routing Rule Evaluation Engine</strong></p>\n<p>The routing rule evaluation engine processes rules in priority order, applying the first matching rule&#39;s action. This requires careful consideration of rule ordering and conflict resolution to ensure predictable behavior.</p>\n<p>The evaluation engine integrates with the existing request context system, adding routing decisions to the request correlation data for observability and debugging. Failed routing evaluations are logged with sufficient detail to enable troubleshooting of complex rule interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Backend Pool Management</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced routing requires extending the backend management system to support multiple named pools rather than a single backend list. Each pool can have its own load balancing algorithm, health check configuration, and operational parameters.</p>\n<p>The backend pool concept extends naturally from the existing <code>BackendManager</code>, creating a hierarchical structure where the manager contains multiple pools, each containing multiple backends. This structure maintains backward compatibility while enabling advanced routing scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monitoring-and-metrics-adding-detailed-metrics-monitoring-endpoints-and-observability-features\">Monitoring and Metrics: Adding Detailed Metrics, Monitoring Endpoints, and Observability Features</h3>\n<p>The <strong>monitoring and metrics</strong> extension transforms the load balancer from a black box into a fully observable system that provides deep insights into traffic patterns, performance characteristics, and operational health. This extension addresses the critical operational requirement for visibility into system behavior and performance.</p>\n<p>Observability becomes increasingly important as load balancers handle more traffic and support more complex routing logic. Operators need visibility into request distribution, backend health patterns, algorithm performance, and error trends to effectively manage and optimize the system. The monitoring extension provides this visibility through metrics collection, monitoring endpoints, and integration with external observability systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The metrics system introduces several new components that integrate with existing load balancer functionality:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Integration Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>MetricsCollector</td>\n<td>Collects and aggregates metrics from all components</td>\n<td>Integrated throughout request processing pipeline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MetricsRegistry</td>\n<td>Manages metric definitions and storage</td>\n<td>Singleton service used by all components</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MetricsExporter</td>\n<td>Exports metrics in standard formats (Prometheus, JSON)</td>\n<td>HTTP endpoint handler for metrics scraping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HistogramManager</td>\n<td>Manages latency and duration histograms</td>\n<td>Integrated with request timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AlertingEngine</td>\n<td>Evaluates metric thresholds and generates alerts</td>\n<td>Background service monitoring metrics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The metrics collection system requires minimal performance impact while providing comprehensive visibility. This creates a design challenge where metrics collection must be efficient enough to run on every request without significantly impacting load balancer performance.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">go</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> MetricsConfig</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Enabled          </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">bool</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                    `json:\"enabled\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    CollectionInterval </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">time</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Duration</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        `json:\"collection_interval\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    RetentionPeriod  </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">time</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">.</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">Duration</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">          `json:\"retention_period\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Exporters        []</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">ExporterConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">       `json:\"exporters\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Histograms       </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">HistogramConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        `json:\"histograms\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Alerting         </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">AlertingConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">         `json:\"alerting\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    CustomMetrics    []</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">CustomMetricConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">   `json:\"custom_metrics\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> LoadBalancerMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    TotalRequests        </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">int64</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                    `json:\"total_requests\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    SuccessfulRequests   </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">int64</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                    `json:\"successful_requests\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    FailedRequests       </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">int64</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                    `json:\"failed_requests\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    RequestRate          </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">float64</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"request_rate\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ErrorRate            </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">float64</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">                  `json:\"error_rate\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ResponseTime         </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">ResponseTimeMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     `json:\"response_time\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    BackendMetrics       </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">map</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">string</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">]</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">BackendMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> `json:\"backend_metrics\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    AlgorithmMetrics     </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">AlgorithmMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">        `json:\"algorithm_metrics\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    HealthCheckMetrics   </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">HealthCheckMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">      `json:\"health_check_metrics\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    ConnectionMetrics    </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">ConnectionMetrics</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">       `json:\"connection_metrics\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Request-Level Metrics Collection</strong></p>\n<p>Request-level metrics provide the foundation for understanding load balancer behavior and performance. These metrics capture every aspect of request processing, from initial receipt through backend selection to response delivery.</p>\n<p>The request metrics collection integrates with the existing <code>RequestContext</code> system established in earlier sections. Each request context carries a metrics collection object that accumulates timing, status, and routing information throughout the request lifecycle.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Category</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Collection Point</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Volume</td>\n<td>Requests per second, total requests</td>\n<td>Request start/completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Times</td>\n<td>P50, P95, P99 latency</td>\n<td>Request start/end timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Status Codes</td>\n<td>2xx, 4xx, 5xx response counts</td>\n<td>Response processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backend Selection</td>\n<td>Algorithm choice, backend distribution</td>\n<td>Algorithm selection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Rates</td>\n<td>Connection failures, timeouts, health check failures</td>\n<td>Error handling points</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Backend Performance Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Backend performance metrics provide visibility into individual backend server behavior and health patterns. These metrics enable operators to identify problematic backends, understand capacity utilization, and optimize backend pool configuration.</p>\n<p>Backend metrics collection extends the existing <code>Backend</code> data structure with metrics collection capabilities. Each backend maintains its own metrics collector that aggregates performance data over configurable time windows.</p>\n<p>The backend metrics integrate with the health checking system to provide correlation between health check results and actual request performance. This correlation enables more sophisticated health assessment that considers both probe success and actual request performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Load Balancing Algorithm Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Algorithm-specific metrics provide insights into how different load balancing strategies perform under various traffic patterns. These metrics enable operators to choose appropriate algorithms and tune algorithm parameters for optimal performance.</p>\n<p>Each algorithm implementation extends the base <code>Algorithm</code> interface with metrics collection capabilities. The metrics collected vary by algorithm type but generally include selection patterns, decision timing, and effectiveness measures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n<th>Key Metrics</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>RoundRobin</td>\n<td>Selection distribution, counter resets</td>\n<td>Verify even distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WeightedRoundRobin</td>\n<td>Weight utilization, smooth distribution</td>\n<td>Optimize weight settings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LeastConnections</td>\n<td>Connection count accuracy, selection efficiency</td>\n<td>Validate connection tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPHash</td>\n<td>Hash distribution, consistency maintenance</td>\n<td>Assess hash function quality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Random</td>\n<td>Distribution uniformity, selection performance</td>\n<td>Evaluate randomness quality</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Health Check Metrics</strong></p>\n<p>Health check metrics provide detailed visibility into backend health patterns, failure detection accuracy, and recovery behavior. These metrics are essential for tuning health check parameters and understanding system reliability characteristics.</p>\n<p>The health check metrics extend the existing <code>HealthState</code> data structure with additional statistical information. Historical health data enables trend analysis and predictive health assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Impact Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Metrics collection must balance comprehensiveness with performance impact. The metrics system uses several strategies to minimize overhead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Atomic counters</strong>: Use atomic operations for high-frequency metrics to avoid locking overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Batched updates</strong>: Aggregate metrics in memory and flush periodically rather than updating external systems synchronously</li>\n<li><strong>Sampling</strong>: For very high-traffic scenarios, sample a percentage of requests rather than collecting metrics on every request</li>\n<li><strong>Lock-free data structures</strong>: Use lock-free ring buffers and other concurrent data structures for metrics collection</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Metrics Collection Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Comprehensive metrics are essential for operations, but collection overhead can impact load balancer performance</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Synchronous metrics with external system updates on every request</li>\n<li>Asynchronous metrics with in-memory aggregation and periodic export</li>\n<li>Sampling-based metrics collection with configurable sample rates</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Asynchronous collection with in-memory aggregation and multiple export formats</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides comprehensive metrics while maintaining performance, with flexibility in how metrics are consumed by external systems</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables rich observability without performance penalties, but requires careful memory management for metrics storage</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Prometheus Integration</strong></p>\n<p>Prometheus integration enables the load balancer to export metrics in the industry-standard Prometheus format, enabling integration with existing monitoring infrastructure and alerting systems.</p>\n<p>The Prometheus integration requires exposing a <code>/metrics</code> endpoint that serves metrics in Prometheus text format. This endpoint integrates with the existing HTTP server infrastructure while providing access to all collected metrics.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom Metrics and Extensibility</strong></p>\n<p>The metrics system provides extensibility for application-specific metrics that operators may want to collect. Custom metrics can be defined through configuration and collected at various points in the request processing pipeline.</p>\n<p>Custom metrics support enables advanced use cases like business metrics collection (e.g., API usage by customer tier) and application-specific performance metrics (e.g., cache hit rates for cached responses).</p>\n<p><strong>Alerting Integration</strong></p>\n<p>The alerting engine evaluates metric thresholds and generates alerts when conditions are met. Alerting rules can be defined for any collected metric, enabling operators to create comprehensive monitoring coverage.</p>\n<p>The alerting system integrates with external notification systems through webhooks and standard protocols. Alert conditions can include simple threshold checks, trend analysis, and complex multi-metric conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashboard and Visualization Support</strong></p>\n<p>The metrics export system provides data in formats suitable for popular dashboard systems like Grafana. Pre-built dashboard templates enable operators to quickly establish comprehensive load balancer monitoring.</p>\n<p>The dashboard integration includes both real-time metrics for operational monitoring and historical data for capacity planning and performance analysis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-points-with-existing-architecture\">Integration Points with Existing Architecture</h3>\n<p>All three extension areas integrate naturally with the existing load balancer architecture through well-defined extension points established in the original design.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration Extension Points</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>Config</code> structure established in earlier sections uses Go&#39;s struct embedding to enable extension:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">go</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">type</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> ExtendedConfig</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">    Config</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">                    // Embed existing configuration</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    TLS        </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">TLSConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">     `json:\"tls,omitempty\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Routing    </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">RoutingConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> `json:\"routing,omitempty\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    Metrics    </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">MetricsConfig</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> `json:\"metrics,omitempty\"`</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">}</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This approach maintains backward compatibility while enabling new functionality through configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Integration Patterns</strong></p>\n<p>Each extension integrates with existing components through established interfaces and patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Middleware Pattern</strong>: SSL termination and routing rules act as middleware layers in the request processing pipeline</li>\n<li><strong>Observer Pattern</strong>: Metrics collection observes events throughout the system without modifying core logic</li>\n<li><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong>: Advanced routing rules extend the existing algorithm selection strategy</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin Architecture</strong>: Extensions can be enabled/disabled through configuration without code changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data Flow Extensions</strong></p>\n<p>The extensions modify the request processing pipeline by adding new stages while preserving the core flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Original Flow</strong>: Client → HTTP Proxy → Backend Selection → Backend Request → Response</li>\n<li><strong>Extended Flow</strong>: Client → TLS Termination → Routing Rules → Metrics Collection → HTTP Proxy → Backend Selection → Metrics Collection → Backend Request → Response → Metrics Collection</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each extension adds processing stages without disrupting the fundamental request flow, maintaining system reliability while adding new capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The future extensions build naturally on the foundation established in the core load balancer implementation.

can significantly impact performance due to cryptographic overhead. Monitor request latency and throughput after enabling SSL. Use hardware acceleration when available and optimize TLS configuration for performance. Consider connection reuse and session resumption to amortize handshake costs.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Routing Rule Conflicts</strong>\nComplex routing rules can interact in unexpected ways, causing requests to route to wrong backends. Implement rule validation that checks for conflicts and ambiguous conditions. Provide clear error messages when rules conflict. Test routing decisions thoroughly with comprehensive request scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Metrics Collection Memory Leaks</strong>\nUnbounded metrics collection can cause memory leaks, especially for response time histograms and per-backend metrics. Implement metric retention policies with automatic cleanup of old data. Use sampling for high-frequency metrics. Monitor metrics collector memory usage and implement circuit breakers if needed.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Extension Configuration Complexity</strong>\nMultiple extensions can create configuration files that are difficult to understand and maintain. Design configuration schemas that are hierarchical and well-documented. Provide configuration validation that gives clear error messages. Consider configuration templates and examples for common use cases.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Backward Compatibility Breaks</strong>\nExtensions should not break existing configurations or APIs. Use configuration versioning and provide migration tools when necessary. Test extensively with existing configurations to ensure compatibility. Document any breaking changes clearly and provide upgrade paths.</p>\n<p>The future extensions demonstrate the value of thoughtful architectural design in the original load balancer implementation. By establishing clear component boundaries, extensible interfaces, and modular data models, the core system provides natural extension points that enable sophisticated functionality without architectural disruption.</p>\n<p>Each extension represents a significant enhancement that addresses real operational requirements in production load balancer deployments. The SSL termination extension enables secure communications, the advanced routing extension supports complex application architectures, and the monitoring extension provides essential operational visibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) — this glossary defines technical terms, acronyms, and domain-specific vocabulary used throughout the load balancer design and implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-technical-dictionary\">Mental Model: Technical Dictionary</h3>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a technical dictionary for a specialized field. Just as medical professionals have precise terminology like &quot;myocardial infarction&quot; instead of &quot;heart attack,&quot; load balancing has specific vocabulary that carries exact meaning. Each term represents a concept that has been refined through years of distributed systems practice, and using the correct terminology helps communicate complex ideas precisely between engineers.</p>\n<p>The terminology in load balancing draws from multiple domains — networking (Layer 4 vs Layer 7), distributed systems (graceful degradation, circuit breakers), and algorithms (round-robin, consistent hashing). Understanding these terms deeply helps engineers discuss trade-offs, debug issues, and design systems that behave predictably under various conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-load-balancing-terms\">Core Load Balancing Terms</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Context</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>load balancer</strong></td>\n<td>A system that distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

The key architectural challenge is maintaining high availability and even traffic distribution while handling backend failures gracefully through health checking and automatic failover.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — this establishes the foundational understanding needed throughout the project\n\n### Mental Model: Restaurant Host\n\nThink of a **load balancer** as a restaurant host who greets customers at the entrance and decides where to seat them. When diners arrive, they don't randomly wander around looking for empty tables — that would create chaos, with some sections overwhelmed while others sit empty. Instead, the host has a clear view of the entire restaurant, knows which tables are available, which servers are busy, and how to distribute customers evenly for the best dining experience.\n\nThe host uses different strategies depending on the situation. During quiet periods, they might simply rotate between sections in order — the **round-robin** approach. When one section gets backed up because a server called in sick, the host routes new customers elsewhere — this is **health-aware routing**. For VIP customers who prefer their regular server, the host remembers their preference and seats them consistently — this is **session affinity**. If some servers handle large parties better than others, the host might send more customers to those sections — this is **weighted distribution**.\n\nJust like the restaurant host, a load balancer sits between clients (diners) and backend servers (restaurant sections). It receives incoming requests, chooses which backend should handle each one, and ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed while others remain idle. The load balancer must track which backends are healthy and responsive, maintain fairness in distribution, and gracefully handle situations where backends fail or become unavailable.\n\n> The key insight is that load balancing is fundamentally about **coordination and optimization** — taking a stream of independent requests and making intelligent routing decisions to maximize overall system performance and reliability.\n\n### The Distribution Challenge\n\nBuilding an effective load balancer requires solving several interconnected challenges that go beyond simply forwarding requests. Each challenge represents a fundamental problem in distributed systems that affects both performance and reliability.\n\n**Request Distribution Fairness** represents the core algorithmic challenge. When requests arrive at unpredictable rates and backend servers have different processing capabilities, how do we ensure fair distribution? A naive approach might assign requests randomly, but this can lead to significant imbalances over short time periods. Some requests might be computationally expensive while others are simple database lookups, making simple request counting insufficient. The load balancer must implement algorithms that account for these variables while remaining efficient enough to route thousands of requests per second without becoming a bottleneck itself.\n\n**Backend Failure Detection and Recovery** introduces the reliability challenge. Backend servers fail in various ways — they might crash completely, become unreachable due to network partitions, or degrade slowly under load while still accepting connections. The load balancer must distinguish between temporary hiccups and genuine failures, avoiding the mistake of removing healthy backends due to transient network issues. Equally important is the recovery process: when should a previously failed backend be given another chance, and how can the system avoid overwhelming a recovering server with a sudden flood of traffic?\n\n**State Management Under Concurrency** presents the consistency challenge. Modern load balancers handle hundreds or thousands of concurrent requests, each potentially requiring updates to shared state like backend health status, connection counts, or round-robin counters. Race conditions can lead to uneven distribution, incorrect health states, or even crashes. The challenge is maintaining consistency without introducing locks that could serialize request processing and destroy throughput. Atomic operations, lock-free data structures, and careful state design become critical for high-performance operation.\n\n**Graceful Degradation During Failures** defines the availability challenge. What happens when all backends in a pool become unhealthy? Should the load balancer return errors immediately, attempt to route to unhealthy backends anyway, or maintain some form of circuit breaker? The system must fail gracefully rather than catastrophically, providing meaningful error responses to clients while continuing to monitor for backend recovery. This requires sophisticated error handling that distinguishes between different failure modes and responds appropriately to each.\n\n| Challenge | Impact | Key Considerations | Common Failure Modes |\n|-----------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Request Distribution | Performance, Fairness | Algorithm choice, Request characteristics, Backend capacity | Hot spots, Uneven distribution, Algorithm bias |\n| Failure Detection | Availability, Reliability | Health check frequency, False positive rate, Recovery timing | Cascading failures, Premature removal, Thundering herd |\n| State Management | Consistency, Throughput | Concurrency control, Data races, Lock contention | Race conditions, Stale state, Deadlocks |\n| Graceful Degradation | User Experience, System Stability | Error responses, Fallback strategies, Circuit breaking | Error storms, Resource exhaustion, Total outage |\n\n**The Observability Challenge** emerges as systems scale. When request distribution becomes uneven or backends start failing, operators need visibility into the load balancer's decision-making process. Which algorithm is active? How are requests being distributed? What's the current health state of each backend? Are any backends consistently slower than others? Without proper logging and metrics, debugging load balancer issues becomes nearly impossible, especially under production load when problems manifest most acutely.\n\n### Load Balancing Landscape\n\nThe load balancing ecosystem offers numerous approaches, each with distinct trade-offs that influence architecture decisions. Understanding these options helps contextualize our design choices and explains why certain approaches are better suited for different scenarios.\n\n**Hardware vs Software Load Balancers** represents the fundamental deployment choice. Hardware load balancers like F5 BigIP or Citrix ADX offer dedicated processing power, specialized network interfaces, and vendor support, but they're expensive, difficult to scale horizontally, and create vendor lock-in. They excel in environments requiring extremely high throughput with predictable workloads and established budgets. Software load balancers like HAProxy, NGINX, or our implementation run on commodity hardware, offer greater flexibility, and integrate easily with modern deployment pipelines. They sacrifice some raw performance for operational agility and cost effectiveness.\n\n**Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing** defines the protocol awareness level. Layer 4 (transport layer) load balancers make routing decisions based on IP addresses and port numbers, operating at the TCP/UDP connection level. They're fast because they don't need to parse application protocols, but they can't make content-aware routing decisions. Layer 7 (application layer) load balancers understand HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and request content, enabling sophisticated routing rules based on user type, API version, or request characteristics. Our implementation operates at Layer 7, parsing HTTP requests to enable features like health checks via HTTP endpoints and potential future enhancements like path-based routing.\n\n> **Decision: Layer 7 HTTP Load Balancer**\n> - **Context**: We need to choose the protocol layer at which our load balancer operates, balancing simplicity with functionality\n> - **Options Considered**: Layer 4 TCP proxy, Layer 7 HTTP proxy, Hybrid approach\n> - **Decision**: Layer 7 HTTP load balancer\n> - **Rationale**: HTTP awareness enables health checks via HTTP endpoints, better debugging through request logging, and extensibility for future features like path-based routing. The performance overhead is acceptable for learning purposes and typical application workloads\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation due to HTTP parsing, but greater flexibility and observability\n\n| Approach | Performance | Features | Complexity | Use Cases |\n|----------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|\n| Layer 4 | Very High | Basic routing, port-based | Low | High throughput, simple routing needs |\n| Layer 7 | High | Content-aware, rich routing | Medium | Application load balancing, microservices |\n| Hybrid | Variable | Best of both | High | Complex applications with mixed requirements |\n\n**Algorithm Sophistication** varies dramatically across implementations. Simple algorithms like random selection or round-robin are easy to implement and understand but may not handle real-world traffic patterns well. Weighted algorithms account for server capacity differences. Least connections adapts to varying request processing times. Hash-based algorithms provide session affinity. Advanced algorithms like least response time or adaptive algorithms adjust to real-time performance metrics. Our implementation focuses on the most common algorithms that demonstrate key concepts while remaining implementable by intermediate developers.\n\n**Deployment Patterns** influence architecture requirements. Reverse proxy deployment places the load balancer between clients and servers, typically in a DMZ or edge network. Direct server return (DSR) allows backends to respond directly to clients, reducing load balancer bandwidth requirements but complicating network configuration. Service mesh deployment integrates load balancing with service discovery and inter-service communication. Our design assumes reverse proxy deployment, the most common and straightforward pattern for application load balancing.\n\n**Existing Solutions Comparison** helps position our implementation:\n\n| Solution | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |\n|----------|-----------|------------|----------|\n| HAProxy | High performance, feature rich, proven | Complex configuration, steep learning curve | Production environments, high throughput |\n| NGINX | Web server integration, good performance | Complex for pure load balancing, licensing costs | Web applications, content serving |\n| Cloud Load Balancers | Managed service, auto-scaling, integration | Vendor lock-in, cost, limited customization | Cloud-native applications, managed operations |\n| Envoy Proxy | Modern architecture, service mesh ready | Complex, resource intensive | Microservices, service mesh deployments |\n| Our Implementation | Educational focus, clear code, customizable | Limited features, not production-hardened | Learning, prototyping, custom requirements |\n\n> The load balancing landscape reveals a fundamental tension between **simplicity and sophistication**. Simple solutions are easier to understand, debug, and maintain, but they may not handle complex real-world scenarios effectively. Our implementation deliberately chooses educational clarity over feature completeness, providing a solid foundation for understanding core concepts.\n\n**Configuration and Management** approaches vary from static configuration files to dynamic service discovery integration. Static configuration is simple and predictable but requires manual updates when backends change. Dynamic configuration through APIs or service discovery systems enables automated scaling and deployment but introduces additional complexity and failure modes. Our design supports both approaches, starting with static configuration for simplicity while enabling API-based updates for operational flexibility.\n\nThe choice of implementation language significantly impacts the final system's characteristics. Go offers excellent HTTP handling, built-in concurrency, and deployment simplicity. Python provides rapid development and extensive libraries but may have performance limitations under high load. JavaScript (Node.js) enables full-stack teams to maintain the load balancer but has different concurrency characteristics. Our primary Go implementation balances performance, clarity, and learning accessibility while supporting other languages for different learning objectives.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| HTTP Server | Go `net/http` | Custom HTTP handling | Standard library provides robust foundation |\n| HTTP Client | Go `net/http.Client` with connection pooling | Third-party HTTP client | Built-in pooling handles most needs efficiently |\n| Configuration | JSON file with `encoding/json` | YAML with validation library | JSON is simple and well-supported |\n| Concurrency | Go goroutines with `sync` package | Lock-free data structures | Standard approaches are sufficient for learning |\n| Logging | Go `log` package | Structured logging (logrus, zap) | Simple logging aids debugging without complexity |\n| Testing | Go `testing` with `net/http/httptest` | Third-party testing frameworks | Standard library provides excellent HTTP testing |\n\n#### Recommended Project Structure\n\nOrganize your load balancer project to separate concerns clearly and enable incremental development across milestones:\n\n```\nload-balancer/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── loadbalancer/\n│       └── main.go                    ← Entry point, CLI parsing, startup\n├── internal/\n│   ├── proxy/\n│   │   ├── proxy.go                   ← HTTP reverse proxy (Milestone 1)\n│   │   ├── proxy_test.go              ← Unit tests for proxy logic\n│   │   └── headers.go                 ← Header manipulation utilities\n│   ├── backend/\n│   │   ├── pool.go                    ← Backend pool management (Milestone 2)\n│   │   ├── backend.go                 ← Backend server model\n│   │   └── health.go                  ← Health checking (Milestone 3)\n│   ├── algorithm/\n│   │   ├── interface.go               ← Load balancing algorithm interface\n│   │   ├── roundrobin.go              ← Round robin implementation (Milestone 2)\n│   │   ├── weighted.go                ← Weighted round robin (Milestone 4)\n│   │   ├── leastconn.go               ← Least connections (Milestone 4)\n│   │   └── hash.go                    ← IP hash algorithm (Milestone 4)\n│   ├── config/\n│   │   ├── config.go                  ← Configuration loading and validation\n│   │   └── reload.go                  ← Hot reload functionality\n│   └── router/\n│       ├── router.go                  ← Main request router coordination\n│       └── errors.go                  ← Error response handling\n├── configs/\n│   ├── example.json                   ← Example configuration\n│   └── test.json                      ← Configuration for testing\n├── test/\n│   ├── integration/                   ← End-to-end integration tests\n│   └── backends/                      ← Test HTTP servers for development\n├── docs/                              ← Documentation and design notes\n├── go.mod\n├── go.sum\n└── README.md\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n**Configuration Loading Infrastructure** (complete implementation):\n\n```go\n// internal/config/config.go\npackage config\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\ntype Config struct {\n    Port            int               `json:\"port\"`\n    Backends        []BackendConfig   `json:\"backends\"`\n    Algorithm       string            `json:\"algorithm\"`\n    HealthCheck     HealthCheckConfig `json:\"health_check\"`\n}\n\ntype BackendConfig struct {\n    URL    string `json:\"url\"`\n    Weight int    `json:\"weight\"`\n}\n\ntype HealthCheckConfig struct {\n    Enabled         bool          `json:\"enabled\"`\n    Interval        time.Duration `json:\"interval\"`\n    Timeout         time.Duration `json:\"timeout\"`\n    HealthyThreshold   int        `json:\"healthy_threshold\"`\n    UnhealthyThreshold int        `json:\"unhealthy_threshold\"`\n    Path            string        `json:\"path\"`\n}\n\nfunc LoadConfig(filename string) (*Config, error) {\n    data, err := os.ReadFile(filename)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to read config file: %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    var config Config\n    if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &config);

Check that request method, path, and headers are preserved\n2. Verify response status code and body are returned correctly\n3. Confirm connection errors return 502 Bad Gateway\n4. Validate that logs show request details and response status\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint - Round Robin Distribution**:\n```bash\n# Start multiple backends\ngo run test/backends/server.go 8081 &\ngo run test/backends/server.go 8082 &\ngo run test/backends/server.go 8083 &\n\n# Start load balancer with round-robin configuration\ngo run cmd/loadbalancer/main.go -config configs/round-robin.json\n\n# Test distribution\nfor i in {1..9}; do curl http://localhost:8080/ | jq .server; done\n# Expected output: backend-8081, backend-8082, backend-8083, backend-8081, ...\n```\n\n**Signs of Issues**:\n- Uneven distribution suggests race conditions in counter increment\n- Always hitting same backend indicates modulo calculation error\n- Requests failing randomly suggests backend list synchronization issues\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — this section establishes the scope and boundaries that guide implementation decisions throughout the entire project\n\n### Mental Model: Construction Blueprint\n\nThink of this section as the construction blueprint and building permit for our load balancer project. Just as a construction project needs clear specifications about what will be built (a three-story house with specific rooms) and what won't be built (no swimming pool or garage), our load balancer needs explicit boundaries. The blueprint prevents scope creep during construction — when the contractor suggests adding a hot tub, you can point to the blueprint and say \"that's not in scope.\" Similarly, when implementing the load balancer, clear goals prevent feature creep that could derail the learning objectives.\n\nThe building permit analogy extends further: permits specify safety requirements (the building must withstand certain wind loads), quality standards (electrical work must meet code), and timeline expectations (completion within 6 months). Our quality requirements serve the same function — they define performance targets, reliability expectations, and maintainability standards that guide implementation decisions without getting lost in endless optimization.\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nThe functional requirements define the core capabilities that our load balancer must deliver to be considered complete and useful. These requirements map directly to the project milestones and represent the minimum viable functionality needed for a production-ready basic load balancer.\n\n#### Core Request Distribution\n\nThe load balancer must accept incoming HTTP requests on a configurable port and distribute them across multiple backend servers. This fundamental capability forms the foundation of all other features and establishes the reverse proxy pattern that enables traffic distribution.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Milestone |\n|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| HTTP Request Acceptance | Accept and parse incoming HTTP requests | All HTTP methods, headers, and body content preserved | 1 |\n| Request Forwarding | Forward requests to backend servers | Method, path, headers, and body transmitted unchanged | 1 |\n| Response Relay | Return backend responses to clients | Status code, headers, and response body preserved | 1 |\n| Header Enrichment | Add proxy-specific headers | X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers added | 1 |\n| Round Robin Distribution | Cycle through backends sequentially | Even distribution across healthy backends | 2 |\n| Backend Pool Management | Manage list of available backends | Add, remove, and update backend configurations | 2 |\n\nThe request forwarding capability requires preserving the complete HTTP request context while adapting it for backend communication. This includes handling edge cases like chunked transfer encoding, WebSocket upgrade requests, and large request bodies that exceed memory limits.\n\n> **Decision: HTTP/1.1 Focus**\n> - **Context**: Modern applications use various HTTP versions including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3\n> - **Options Considered**: HTTP/1.1 only, HTTP/2 support, Multi-version support\n> - **Decision**: Focus exclusively on HTTP/1.1\n> - **Rationale**: HTTP/1.1 provides sufficient complexity for learning reverse proxy concepts without the additional protocol complexity of multiplexing and stream management in HTTP/2\n> - **Consequences**: Simplifies implementation and testing while covering 90% of real-world load balancer use cases\n\n#### Algorithm Flexibility\n\nThe load balancer must support multiple distribution algorithms to accommodate different application requirements and traffic patterns. Algorithm selection should be configurable at runtime without requiring service restart.\n\n| Algorithm | Purpose | Use Case | Implementation Complexity |\n|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------------|\n| `round_robin` | Sequential selection | Even load distribution | Low |\n| `weighted_round_robin` | Proportional distribution | Heterogeneous backend capacity | Medium |\n| `least_connections` | Connection-based selection | Long-lived connections | Medium |\n| `ip_hash` | Consistent client routing | Session affinity requirements | Low |\n| `random` | Random selection | Stateless distribution | Low |\n\nEach algorithm must implement the `Algorithm` interface with a `SelectBackend` method that accepts a slice of healthy backends and returns the chosen backend. The selection logic must be thread-safe and handle edge cases like empty backend lists and concurrent access to shared state.\n\nThe weighted round robin algorithm presents particular implementation challenges around smooth weight distribution. Rather than simple repetition (which creates bursts), it should use smooth weighted selection that distributes requests proportionally over time without clustering requests to high-weight backends.\n\n#### Health Monitoring System\n\nActive health checking enables the load balancer to detect backend failures and automatically remove unhealthy servers from rotation. This capability transforms a simple request forwarder into a reliable traffic distribution system that maintains service availability during partial backend failures.\n\n| Health Check Feature | Requirement | Configuration Parameter | Default Value |\n|---------------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| Periodic Probes | HTTP GET requests to health endpoint | `Interval time.Duration` | 30 seconds |\n| Failure Detection | Mark unhealthy after consecutive failures | `UnhealthyThreshold int` | 3 failures |\n| Recovery Detection | Restore after consecutive successes | `HealthyThreshold int` | 2 successes |\n| Probe Timeout | Maximum time to wait for response | `Timeout time.Duration` | 5 seconds |\n| Health Endpoint | Configurable probe path | `Path string` | \"/health\" |\n\nThe health checking system must operate independently of request processing to avoid blocking normal traffic flow. Health state changes should be atomic and immediately reflected in backend selection algorithms. The system must handle edge cases like all backends becoming unhealthy (continue serving with best-effort routing to least-recently-failed backends) and rapid state oscillation (implement dampening to prevent flapping).\n\n> **Decision: Active vs Passive Health Checking**\n> - **Context**: Health can be monitored by sending dedicated probes (active) or inferring from request success rates (passive)\n> - **Options Considered**: Active only, Passive only, Hybrid approach\n> - **Decision**: Implement active health checking only\n> - **Rationale**: Active checking provides predictable failure detection timing and clear pass/fail criteria, making it easier to reason about system behavior during failures\n> - **Consequences**: Adds network overhead from health probes but ensures consistent failure detection regardless of traffic patterns\n\n### Quality Requirements\n\nQuality requirements define the non-functional characteristics that make the load balancer suitable for production use. These requirements establish performance baselines, reliability expectations, and operational characteristics that guide implementation decisions throughout the project.\n\n#### Performance Characteristics\n\nThe load balancer must handle realistic traffic loads without becoming a bottleneck between clients and backend services. Performance requirements focus on throughput, latency, and resource utilization under normal and peak load conditions.\n\n| Performance Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Rationale |\n|-------------------|--------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Request Throughput | 1000 requests/second | Load testing with concurrent clients | Handles typical web application traffic |\n| Latency Overhead | <5ms median added latency | Comparison with direct backend access | Minimal impact on response times |\n| Memory Usage | <100MB baseline | Process memory monitoring | Lightweight deployment footprint |\n| Connection Pooling | Reuse backend connections | Monitor connection count vs request rate | Reduce connection establishment overhead |\n| Algorithm Selection Time | <1ms for backend selection | Benchmark algorithm implementations | No bottleneck in request path |\n\nPerformance testing should use realistic request patterns including varying request sizes, concurrent connections, and sustained load over extended periods. The load balancer should demonstrate consistent performance without memory leaks or degradation over time.\n\nConnection pooling efficiency significantly impacts performance characteristics. The reverse proxy component must maintain persistent connections to backend servers and reuse them across multiple client requests. Connection pool sizing should balance resource usage with the ability to handle traffic bursts.\n\n#### Reliability and Fault Tolerance\n\nThe load balancer must continue operating effectively during various failure scenarios including backend server outages, network partitions, and partial system degradation. Reliability requirements define how the system behaves under stress and failure conditions.\n\n| Reliability Requirement | Behavior | Recovery Expectation | Implementation Need |\n|------------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Backend Server Failure | Remove failed backends from rotation | Automatic restoration after recovery | Health checking integration |\n| All Backends Unhealthy | Continue serving with degraded routing | Route to least-recently-failed backends | Graceful degradation logic |\n| Network Partition | Timeout and retry failed requests | Client receives 502 Bad Gateway | Timeout configuration |\n| Configuration Reload | Update settings without dropping connections | Zero-downtime configuration changes | Hot reload mechanism |\n| High Load Handling | Maintain service under traffic spikes | Graceful performance degradation | Backpressure and circuit breaking |\n\nThe system must implement graceful degradation strategies that maintain partial service availability rather than complete failure during adverse conditions. When all backends are unhealthy, the load balancer should attempt to route requests to the most recently healthy backends rather than rejecting all requests.\n\n> **Decision: Fail-Fast vs Circuit Breaker**\n> - **Context**: When backends fail, the load balancer can either immediately return errors (fail-fast) or temporarily stop trying failed backends (circuit breaker)\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate failure responses, Simple circuit breaker, Adaptive circuit breaker\n> - **Decision**: Implement fail-fast with health check-based recovery\n> - **Rationale**: Health checking provides the circuit breaker functionality with explicit recovery detection, avoiding the complexity of adaptive thresholds while ensuring failed backends are retried systematically\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler implementation with predictable behavior, but may not handle transient failures as gracefully as adaptive circuit breakers\n\n#### Maintainability and Observability\n\nThe load balancer must provide sufficient operational visibility and maintainable code structure to support ongoing development and production operations. These requirements ensure the system can be debugged, monitored, and extended effectively.\n\n| Maintainability Aspect | Requirement | Implementation Approach | Benefit |\n|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Request Logging | Log all proxied requests with timing | Structured logging with timestamp, method, path, backend, status | Request tracing and debugging |\n| Health Check Logging | Log health state changes | State transition logging with backend and reason | Health debugging |\n| Configuration Validation | Validate config on load with clear errors | Schema validation with specific error messages | Prevent misconfiguration |\n| Error Categorization | Distinguish error types in responses | Different HTTP status codes for different failures | Client error handling |\n| Code Organization | Separate concerns into focused modules | Interface-based design with clear boundaries | Easy testing and extension |\n\nLogging must be structured and configurable to support both development debugging and production monitoring. Request logs should include sufficient information to trace request flow without overwhelming log storage. Health check logs should clearly indicate why state changes occurred to support operational troubleshooting.\n\nThe code organization should follow Go package conventions with clear separation between HTTP handling, backend management, algorithm implementation, and health checking. Each component should have well-defined interfaces that enable independent testing and future extension.\n\n### Out of Scope\n\nExplicitly defining features that are NOT included in this basic load balancer helps maintain focus on the core learning objectives and prevents scope creep during implementation. These exclusions represent functionality that would be added in a production load balancer but would complicate the learning experience.\n\n#### SSL/TLS Termination\n\nThe load balancer will NOT handle SSL/TLS encryption or certificate management. All communication between clients and the load balancer, and between the load balancer and backends, will use plain HTTP.\n\n| Excluded SSL Feature | Rationale for Exclusion | Alternative Approach |\n|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Certificate Management | Complex PKI operations distract from load balancing logic | Use external TLS termination (nginx, cloud load balancer) |\n| SSL Handshake Processing | Cryptographic operations add significant complexity | Deploy load balancer behind TLS-terminating reverse proxy |\n| SNI (Server Name Indication) | Multiple certificate handling complicates configuration | Single domain deployments or external TLS handling |\n| SSL Session Resumption | Performance optimization unrelated to load balancing | Focus on HTTP-level optimizations |\n\nThis exclusion allows the implementation to focus on HTTP protocol handling, request routing, and backend management without the additional complexity of cryptographic operations and certificate lifecycle management.\n\n#### Advanced Routing Rules\n\nThe load balancer will implement basic host-based routing only, without support for complex routing rules based on request content, headers, or path patterns.\n\n| Excluded Routing Feature | Complexity Added | Learning Value |\n|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Path-based routing (/api → backend1, /static → backend2) | Request parsing and rule evaluation | Low - focuses on configuration complexity |\n| Header-based routing (User-Agent, Custom headers) | Header matching and rule precedence | Low - peripheral to core load balancing |\n| Content-based routing (request body inspection) | Deep packet inspection | Low - performance anti-pattern |\n| Geographic routing (client IP geolocation) | External data dependencies | Low - focuses on data integration |\n| Rate limiting per client | Client state tracking | Medium - but orthogonal to load balancing |\n\nThese routing features represent important production capabilities but would shift focus from core load balancing algorithms and health management to rule evaluation and configuration complexity.\n\n#### Caching and Content Optimization\n\nThe load balancer will NOT implement any caching mechanisms or content optimization features, maintaining its role as a pure traffic distribution system.\n\n| Excluded Caching Feature | Implementation Complexity | Focus Distraction |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Response Caching | Cache invalidation strategies, storage management | High - becomes a cache server project |\n| Static File Serving | File system integration, MIME type handling | Medium - unrelated to load balancing |\n| Compression (gzip, brotli) | Content encoding/decoding | Medium - focuses on content transformation |\n| Response Buffering | Memory management for large responses | Low - useful but adds complexity |\n\nCaching functionality represents a separate system design challenge with its own complexity around cache invalidation, storage management, and consistency. Including caching would transform the project from a load balancer implementation into a caching proxy implementation.\n\n> **Decision: Pure Load Balancer vs Feature-Rich Proxy**\n> - **Context**: Production load balancers often include caching, SSL termination, and advanced routing to reduce infrastructure complexity\n> - **Options Considered**: Basic load balancer only, Load balancer with SSL, Full-featured proxy\n> - **Decision**: Implement basic load balancer only\n> - **Rationale**: Each additional feature adds significant complexity that obscures the core learning objectives of request distribution, health checking, and algorithm implementation\n> - **Consequences**: Results in a focused learning experience but produces a component that requires additional infrastructure (TLS termination, caching) for production use\n\n#### Advanced Load Balancing Features\n\nSeveral advanced load balancing capabilities are excluded to maintain implementation focus on fundamental concepts while still producing a useful and educational system.\n\n| Excluded Advanced Feature | Reason for Exclusion | Alternative Learning Path |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) | Multi-datacenter complexity | Separate distributed systems project |\n| Service Discovery Integration | External system dependencies | Configuration-file based backend management |\n| Real-time Metrics Dashboard | UI development distraction | Log-based monitoring and external tools |\n| Connection Draining | Complex connection lifecycle management | Focus on health check-based removal |\n| Sticky Sessions (beyond IP hash) | Session storage and synchronization | IP hash provides basic session affinity |\n\nThese features represent important production capabilities but involve integration with external systems, complex state management, or user interface development that would significantly expand the project scope beyond its core learning objectives.\n\nThe excluded features provide natural extension points for learners who complete the basic implementation and want to explore additional challenges. Each exclusion represents a potential follow-up project that builds on the foundational load balancing concepts.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe functional and quality requirements translate into specific technical decisions that guide implementation throughout the project milestones.

read locks for getting backends, write locks for health updates\n- Use `context.WithTimeout` for HTTP requests to backends with configurable timeouts\n- Use `net/http.Client` with custom transport for connection pooling: `&http.Transport{MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10}`\n- Use `log/slog` for structured logging: `slog.Info(\"request forwarded\", \"backend\", backend.URL, \"status\", response.StatusCode)`\n- Use table-driven tests for algorithm testing: create slices of test cases with inputs and expected outputs\n- Use `httptest.NewServer` for creating test backend servers during integration testing\n- Handle graceful shutdown with `context.Context` and `sync.WaitGroup` for cleanup\n\n**Common Go Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n\n- Don't forget to check for nil pointers when backends slice might be empty\n- Always close response bodies: `defer response.Body.Close()` after successful HTTP requests\n- Use `io.ReadAll` carefully - it loads entire response into memory, consider streaming for large responses\n- Don't share http.Client instances across goroutines without proper configuration\n- Be careful with slice operations under concurrent access - always use locks\n- Use `atomic` operations for simple counters rather than mutex locks for performance\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - HTTP Proxy Foundation:**\n```bash\n# Start your load balancer\ngo run cmd/load-balancer/main.go -config configs/single-backend.json\n\n# In another terminal, start a test backend\ngo run scripts/test-backend.go -port 8081\n\n# Test request forwarding\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/test\n# Expected: Response from backend on port 8081, with X-Forwarded-* headers\n\n# Test with POST request and body\ncurl -X POST -d \"test data\" http://localhost:8080/api\n# Expected: POST request forwarded with body intact\n\n# Test backend failure\n# Stop the test backend and make a request\ncurl http://localhost:8080/test\n# Expected: 502 Bad Gateway response\n```\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint -

The key is to verify each milestone's functionality before moving to the next level of complexity.\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — the architectural foundation established here supports HTTP proxy functionality (Milestone 1), request distribution (Milestone 2), health monitoring (Milestone 3), and algorithm extensibility (Milestone 4)\n\n### Mental Model: Airport Terminal System\n\nThink of our load balancer as an airport terminal managing passenger flow to multiple boarding gates. The **arrivals hall** receives all incoming passengers (HTTP requests) and directs them to a **central information desk** (request router). The information desk consults the **gate assignment board** (backend manager) to determine which gate (backend server) should handle each passenger, using different strategies like sending passengers to the gate with the shortest line or rotating through gates in order.\n\nBehind the scenes, **gate monitors** (health checkers) continuously verify that each gate is operational and ready to accept passengers. If a gate closes for maintenance, the monitors immediately update the assignment board so no passengers are sent there. The **traffic control algorithms** (load balancing algorithms) determine the specific logic for choosing gates - whether it's simple rotation, sending passengers to the least crowded gate, or ensuring frequent flyers always go to their preferred gate.\n\nThis mental model captures the key architectural insight: **separation of concerns between request handling, backend management, health monitoring, and selection algorithms**. Each component has a distinct responsibility but must coordinate seamlessly to provide a unified service.\n\n![Load Balancer System Architecture](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\n### System Components\n\nThe load balancer architecture consists of four core components that work together to provide reliable request distribution across multiple backend servers. Each component has clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces, enabling modular development and testing while maintaining loose coupling between subsystems.\n\n#### HTTP Reverse Proxy Component\n\nThe **HTTP Reverse Proxy** serves as the system's entry point, accepting incoming client connections and forwarding requests to selected backend servers. This component handles all the low-level HTTP protocol details, connection management, and request/response translation between clients and backends. It abstracts away the complexity of HTTP communication so other components can focus on their specific responsibilities.\n\nThe reverse proxy maintains connection pools to backend servers for efficiency, implements request and response buffering to handle variable network speeds, and adds standard proxy headers like `X-Forwarded-For` to preserve client information. When backend selection fails or no healthy backends are available, the proxy generates appropriate HTTP error responses to clients.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Interface Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Request Acceptance | Listen on configured port and accept HTTP connections | `ListenAndServe(port int) error` |\n| Request Parsing | Parse HTTP method, path, headers, and body | `parseRequest(*http.Request) (*ProxyRequest, error)` |\n| Backend Communication | Forward requests to selected backend servers | `forwardRequest(*ProxyRequest, *Backend) (*ProxyResponse, error)` |\n| Response Relay | Return backend responses to original clients | `sendResponse(http.ResponseWriter, *ProxyResponse) error` |\n| Connection Management | Handle keep-alive, timeouts, and connection pooling | `getConnection(*Backend) (*http.Client, error)` |\n| Error Response Generation | Generate 502 Bad Gateway and other error responses | `sendErrorResponse(http.ResponseWriter, int, string) error` |\n\n#### Backend Pool Manager\n\nThe **Backend Pool Manager** maintains the authoritative registry of all backend servers and their current operational state. This component tracks which backends are available, their configuration parameters like weights, and their real-time health status. It provides a clean interface for other components to query available backends without exposing internal state management complexity.\n\nThe backend manager handles dynamic configuration updates, allowing backends to be added or removed without service interruption. It maintains thread-safe access to the backend pool since multiple goroutines will be selecting backends concurrently for different client requests. The manager also coordinates with the health checking system to update backend availability in real-time.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Interface Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Backend Registration | Add and remove backends from the active pool | `AddBackend(config BackendConfig) error` |\n| State Management | Track health status, weights, and connection counts | `UpdateBackendState(*Backend, *HealthResult) error` |\n| Backend Queries | Provide filtered views of healthy/available backends | `GetHealthyBackends() []*Backend` |\n| Configuration Updates | Handle dynamic backend pool changes | `UpdatePool([]BackendConfig) error` |\n| Concurrency Safety | Ensure thread-safe access to shared backend state | `lockBackends() *sync.RWMutex` |\n| Statistics Tracking | Maintain request counts and performance metrics | `GetBackendStats(*Backend) *BackendStats` |\n\n#### Health Checking System\n\nThe **Health Checking System** runs as a background process that continuously monitors backend server availability through periodic HTTP health probes. This component implements the failure detection and recovery logic that automatically removes unhealthy backends from rotation and restores them when they recover. The health checker operates independently of request processing to provide consistent monitoring regardless of traffic patterns.\n\nThe health checking system maintains separate state for each backend's health status, including consecutive failure counts, last check timestamps, and response time metrics. It implements configurable thresholds for marking backends as unhealthy (consecutive failures) and healthy (consecutive successes), providing tunable sensitivity to transient issues versus persistent failures.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Interface Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Periodic Probing | Send HTTP health checks at configured intervals | `startHealthChecks(interval time.Duration) error` |\n| Failure Detection | Count consecutive failures and mark backends unhealthy | `processHealthResult(*Backend, *HealthResult) error` |\n| Recovery Detection | Detect recovered backends and restore to rotation | `checkRecovery(*Backend) error` |\n| Health State Updates | Notify backend manager of health status changes | `updateHealthStatus(*Backend, bool) error` |\n| Configuration Management | Handle health check settings and endpoint changes | `UpdateHealthConfig(*HealthCheckConfig) error` |\n| Monitoring Integration | Expose health metrics for operational visibility | `GetHealthMetrics() *HealthMetrics` |\n\n#### Load Balancing Algorithm Engines\n\nThe **Algorithm Engines** implement the various strategies for selecting which backend server should handle each incoming request. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate component that conforms to a common interface, enabling runtime algorithm switching and easy addition of new selection strategies. The algorithms operate on the filtered list of healthy backends provided by the backend manager.\n\nDifferent algorithms optimize for different goals: round robin provides even distribution, least connections minimizes server load, weighted algorithms allow capacity-based distribution, and hash-based algorithms provide session affinity. Each algorithm maintains its own internal state (like counters or connection tracking) while being thread-safe for concurrent access.\n\n| Algorithm Type | Purpose | State Maintained | Selection Strategy |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Round Robin | Even request distribution | Current position counter | Sequential cycling through backends |\n| Weighted Round Robin | Capacity-proportional distribution | Per-backend current/target weights | Smooth weighted selection algorithm |\n| Least Connections | Minimize server load | Active connection count per backend | Select backend with minimum connections |\n| IP Hash | Session affinity/stickiness | Hash ring or consistent mapping | Hash client IP to consistent backend |\n| Random | Stateless even distribution | None (purely random) | Uniform random selection |\n\n### Request Flow\n\nUnderstanding how requests flow through the load balancer system is crucial for implementing correct coordination between components. The request processing pipeline involves multiple decision points where different failure scenarios can occur, requiring careful error handling and fallback logic at each stage.\n\n#### Normal Request Processing Flow\n\nThe typical request flow begins when a client establishes an HTTP connection to the load balancer's listening port. The reverse proxy accepts the connection and parses the incoming HTTP request, extracting the method, path, headers, and body content. This parsing step validates that the request is well-formed and can be successfully forwarded to a backend server.\n\nOnce the request is parsed, the reverse proxy consults the backend pool manager to obtain the current list of healthy, available backends. If no backends are available, the proxy immediately returns a 503 Service Unavailable response to the client without attempting backend selection. This fail-fast approach prevents unnecessary processing and provides clear error feedback.\n\nWhen healthy backends are available, the reverse proxy invokes the currently configured load balancing algorithm to select the specific backend that should handle this request. The algorithm receives the list of healthy backends and returns its selection based on the algorithm's internal logic and state. For example, round robin increments its counter and selects the next backend in sequence, while least connections examines the active connection count for each backend.\n\n| Processing Stage | Component | Input | Output | Error Conditions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Connection Accept | HTTP Reverse Proxy | Client TCP connection | Parsed HTTP request | Malformed HTTP, connection timeout |\n| Backend Pool Query | Backend Pool Manager | Health status filter | List of healthy backends | No healthy backends available |\n| Algorithm Selection | Load Balancing Algorithm | Healthy backend list | Selected backend | Algorithm state corruption |\n| Request Forwarding | HTTP Reverse Proxy | Request + selected backend | Backend HTTP response | Backend connection failure, timeout |\n| Response Relay | HTTP Reverse Proxy | Backend response | Client receives response | Client connection dropped |\n\n#### Backend Selection and Forwarding\n\nAfter the algorithm selects a target backend, the reverse proxy establishes or reuses an HTTP connection to that backend server. The proxy modifies the original request by adding standard forwarding headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`) and potentially modifying the `Host` header to match the backend's expected hostname.\n\nThe request forwarding process involves streaming the request body to the backend while handling potential network issues like slow clients or backends. The reverse proxy implements appropriate timeouts to prevent connections from hanging indefinitely and monitors for connection failures that indicate the backend has become unavailable.\n\nWhen the backend responds, the reverse proxy receives the HTTP response including status code, headers, and body. The response is then streamed back to the original client, preserving all headers and status information. Throughout this process, the proxy maintains connection state and updates any relevant metrics like active connection counts needed by the least connections algorithm.\n\n#### Error Handling and Fallback Logic\n\nMultiple failure scenarios can occur during request processing, each requiring specific error handling logic. **Connection failures** occur when the selected backend is unreachable due to network issues or the backend service being down. In this case, the reverse proxy returns a 502 Bad Gateway response and may trigger an immediate health check to update the backend's status.\n\n**Timeout failures** happen when a backend accepts the connection but takes too long to respond. The reverse proxy enforces configurable timeouts for connection establishment, request sending, and response reading. When timeouts occur, the proxy closes the backend connection and returns a 504 Gateway Timeout response to the client.\n\n**Backend unavailability** occurs when no healthy backends are available to handle requests. This situation requires careful handling because it represents a complete service outage from the client's perspective. The reverse proxy returns a 503 Service Unavailable response with appropriate retry-after headers to guide client behavior.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: The request flow must be designed to fail fast and provide clear error signals rather than hanging indefinitely. Each component should have bounded processing time and clear error propagation to prevent cascading failures that could affect other concurrent requests.\n\nThe request flow also handles **partial failures** where some backends are available but others are not. The load balancing algorithm automatically excludes unhealthy backends from selection, allowing the system to continue operating with reduced capacity. This graceful degradation is essential for maintaining service availability during backend maintenance or failures.\n\n#### Concurrency and Thread Safety\n\nMultiple client requests are processed concurrently, requiring careful coordination between components to maintain consistency. The backend pool manager uses read-write locks to allow concurrent read access to the backend list while serializing updates from health checks or configuration changes. Each load balancing algorithm implements its own thread safety mechanisms appropriate for its internal state.\n\nThe reverse proxy creates separate goroutines for each client connection, enabling high concurrency without blocking. However, shared resources like connection pools and algorithm state require proper synchronization to prevent race conditions. The system uses atomic operations for simple counters and mutexes for more complex shared state.\n\n### Recommended Project Structure\n\nOrganizing the codebase into clear modules and packages is essential for managing the complexity of the load balancer system. The recommended structure separates concerns along component boundaries while providing clear interfaces between modules. This organization supports incremental development through the project milestones and makes testing individual components straightforward.\n\n#### Top-Level Project Organization\n\nThe project follows Go's standard layout conventions with clearly separated packages for each major component. The `cmd` directory contains the main entry point and command-line interface, while `internal` packages contain the core load balancer logic that should not be imported by external projects. Configuration files and documentation live at the project root for easy access.\n\n```\nload-balancer/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── loadbalancer/\n│       ├── main.go                 # Entry point and CLI setup\n│       ├── server.go               # HTTP server lifecycle management\n│       └── config.go               # Configuration loading and validation\n├── internal/\n│   ├── proxy/                      # HTTP reverse proxy implementation\n│   ├── backend/                    # Backend pool management\n│   ├── health/                     # Health checking system\n│   ├── algorithm/                  # Load balancing algorithms\n│   ├── config/                     # Configuration types and parsing\n│   └── metrics/                    # Monitoring and statistics\n├── pkg/                            # Public interfaces (if any)\n├── configs/\n│   ├── development.yaml            # Development configuration\n│   ├── production.yaml             # Production configuration\n│   └── example.yaml                # Example with all options\n├── tests/\n│   ├── integration/                # End-to-end tests\n│   └── testdata/                   # Test fixtures and mock backends\n├── docs/\n│   ├── api.md                      # Configuration API documentation\n│   └── deployment.md               # Deployment and operations guide\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── test-backend.go             # Simple test HTTP server\n│   └── benchmark.go                # Load testing utilities\n├── go.mod\n├── go.sum\n├── README.md\n└── Makefile                        # Build and test automation\n```\n\n#### Core Component Package Design\n\nEach major component is organized as a separate Go package with clear internal structure. The package design follows the principle of high cohesion within packages and loose coupling between packages, using well-defined interfaces for communication between components.\n\n**Proxy Package Structure** (`internal/proxy/`):\nThe proxy package contains all HTTP reverse proxy functionality including request parsing, backend communication, and response handling. It depends on the backend and algorithm packages through interfaces rather than concrete types.\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Types | Dependencies |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `proxy.go` | Main proxy server and request handling | `ReverseProxy`, `ProxyRequest`, `ProxyResponse` | backend, algorithm interfaces |\n| `forwarder.go` | HTTP request/response forwarding logic | `RequestForwarder`, `ResponseForwarder` | net/http, backend types |\n| `connection.go` | Connection pooling and management | `ConnectionPool`, `BackendConnection` | net/http, sync primitives |\n| `middleware.go` | Header manipulation and logging | `HeaderMiddleware`, `LoggingMiddleware` | logging, metrics interfaces |\n| `proxy_test.go` | Unit tests for proxy functionality | Test fixtures and mocks | testing, httptest |\n\n**Backend Package Structure** (`internal/backend/`):\nThe backend package manages the pool of backend servers including their configuration, health state, and runtime statistics. It provides thread-safe access to backend information for both request processing and health checking.\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Types | Dependencies |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `manager.go` | Backend pool management and coordination | `BackendManager`, `Backend` | sync, config types |\n| `backend.go` | Individual backend server representation | `Backend`, `BackendStats`, `BackendState` | net/url, atomic |\n| `pool.go` | Backend collection and filtering operations | `BackendPool`, `PoolFilter` | sync, algorithm interfaces |\n| `config.go` | Backend configuration and validation | `BackendConfig`, `PoolConfig` | config package |\n| `manager_test.go` | Backend manager unit tests | Test backends and mock configs | testing, testify |\n\n**Algorithm Package Structure** (`internal/algorithm/`):\nThe algorithm package implements all load balancing strategies as separate modules that conform to a common interface. This design enables easy addition of new algorithms and runtime algorithm switching.\n\n| File | Purpose | Key Types | Dependencies |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `interface.go` | Common algorithm interface definition | `Algorithm`, `SelectionContext` | backend types |\n| `roundrobin.go` | Round robin algorithm implementation | `RoundRobinAlgorithm` | atomic, backend types |\n| `weighted.go` | Weighted round robin implementation | `WeightedAlgorithm`, `WeightTracker` | backend types, math |\n| `leastconn.go` | Least connections algorithm | `LeastConnectionsAlgorithm` | backend types, atomic |\n| `iphash.go` | IP hash algorithm for session affinity | `IPHashAlgorithm`, `ConsistentHash` | hash, backend types |\n| `random.go` | Random selection algorithm | `RandomAlgorithm` | math/rand, backend types |\n| `registry.go` | Algorithm registration and factory | `AlgorithmRegistry`, `AlgorithmFactory` | all algorithm implementations |\n\n#### Configuration and Startup Flow\n\nThe configuration system provides flexible deployment options while maintaining clear validation and error reporting. The main entry point coordinates component initialization in the correct order, ensuring dependencies are satisfied and resources are properly allocated.\n\n**Configuration Loading Process**:\n1. Parse command-line flags for config file path and override options\n2. Load configuration file (YAML/JSON) and validate schema\n3. Apply command-line overrides to configuration values\n4. Validate complete configuration including backend reachability\n5. Initialize logging and metrics systems based on configuration\n\n**Component Initialization Order**:\n1. **Metrics system** - Initialize first to capture initialization metrics\n2. **Backend manager** - Create backend pool from configuration\n3. **Health checker** - Start monitoring configured backends\n4. **Algorithm registry** - Register all available algorithm implementations\n5. **Request router** - Initialize with selected algorithm\n6. **HTTP proxy** - Create proxy server with router dependency\n7. **Signal handlers** - Setup graceful shutdown and configuration reload\n\n#### Testing Strategy Integration\n\nThe project structure supports comprehensive testing at multiple levels, from unit tests of individual algorithms to integration tests of complete request flows. Each package contains its own unit tests, while integration tests exercise cross-component interactions.\n\n**Unit Testing Structure**:\n- Each package contains `*_test.go` files with comprehensive unit tests\n- Test fixtures and mocks are co-located with the components they test\n- Table-driven tests validate algorithm behavior across different scenarios\n- Benchmark tests measure algorithm selection performance\n\n**Integration Testing Structure**:\n- `tests/integration/` contains end-to-end test scenarios\n- Mock backend servers simulate various failure conditions\n- Test configurations exercise different algorithm and health check settings\n- Automated test scripts validate milestone acceptance criteria\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Package Organization**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance component separation with development velocity\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Monolithic package with all components\n>   2. Fine-grained packages for every type\n>   3. Component-based packages with clear interfaces\n> - **Decision**: Component-based packages (option 3)\n> - **Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns while avoiding excessive package proliferation that complicates imports and testing\n> - **Consequences**: Enables independent development of components, supports milestone-based implementation, requires interface discipline\n\n#### Development Workflow Support\n\nThe project structure supports incremental development through the defined milestones, allowing learners to focus on one component at a time while maintaining a working system. Each milestone builds upon previous work without requiring major refactoring.\n\n**Milestone Development Path**:\n- **Milestone 1**: Implement proxy package with single backend forwarding\n- **Milestone 2**: Add algorithm package with round robin implementation\n- **Milestone 3**: Implement health package and integrate with backend manager\n- **Milestone 4**: Add remaining algorithms and runtime switching capability\n\nThe structure also supports iterative refinement where learners can start with simple implementations and enhance them with additional features like connection pooling, advanced error handling, and monitoring integration.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\nThe load balancer implementation uses Go's standard library extensively while incorporating specific third-party packages for configuration management and testing utilities. This approach minimizes external dependencies while leveraging robust, well-tested libraries for complex functionality.\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| HTTP Server | `net/http` standard library | `fasthttp` or `fiber` framework | Standard library provides sufficient performance and better learning value |\n| Configuration | `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for YAML parsing | `viper` for multi-format config | YAML is simple and readable for load balancer configuration |\n| Logging | `log/slog` standard structured logging | `logrus` or `zap` high-performance | Standard library slog provides structured logging with good performance |\n| Testing | `testing` + `net/http/httptest` | `testify` + `ginkgo/gomega` | Standard library sufficient for unit tests, testify adds convenience |\n| Metrics | Simple counters with atomic operations | `prometheus/client_golang` | Start simple, add Prometheus when monitoring is needed |\n| JSON Parsing | `encoding/json` standard library | `json-iterator` for performance | Standard library performance adequate for configuration |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThis structure supports milestone-based development where learners implement one component at a time while maintaining a working system throughout the development process.\n\n```\nload-balancer/\n├── cmd/\n│   └──

Implementation Hints\n\n**Go Concurrency Patterns**:\n- Use `sync.RWMutex` for backend pool access - allows multiple readers but exclusive writers\n- Use `atomic` package operations for simple counters and flags to avoid mutex overhead\n- Use `context.Context` for request timeout handling and cancellation propagation\n- Use buffered channels for health check result communication between goroutines\n\n**HTTP Client Configuration**:\n```go\n// Create HTTP client with appropriate timeouts for backend communication\nclient := &http.Client{\n    Timeout: 30 * time.Second,\n    Transport: &http.Transport{\n        MaxIdleConns:        100,\n        MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10,\n        IdleConnTimeout:     90 * time.Second,\n        DisableKeepAlives:   false,\n    },\n}\n```\n\n**Error Handling Best Practices**:\n- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf(\"operation failed: %w\", err)`\n- Define custom error types for different failure modes (backend unavailable, timeout, etc.)\n- Use structured logging with `log/slog` to include request context in error logs\n- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (502 for backend errors, 503 for no backends available)\n\n**Testing Utilities**:\n- Use `httptest.NewServer()` to create mock backends for unit tests\n- Use `net/http/httptest.NewRecorder()` to capture HTTP responses in tests\n- Use table-driven tests for algorithm validation with different backend configurations\n- Use `t.Parallel()` for tests that don't share state to improve test performance\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - HTTP Proxy Foundation**:\n```bash\n# Start the load balancer with single backend\ngo run cmd/loadbalancer/main.go -config configs/minimal.yaml\n\n# Test basic proxying (should return backend response)\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/test\n\n# Expected: Response from backend server with proxy headers added\n# Look for: X-Forwarded-For header in backend logs\n# Status: 200 OK with JSON

HTTP proxy functionality (Milestone 1), request distribution across backends (Milestone 2), health checking implementation (Milestone 3), and multiple algorithm support (Milestone 4)\n\n### Mental Model: Medical Patient Chart\n\nThink of the load balancer's data model like a comprehensive medical patient chart system. Each **backend server** is like a patient with a complete medical record — we track their identity (address, capabilities), current health status (vital signs), medical history (past health check results), and care instructions (weight for treatment priority). The **health state model** is like the vital signs monitoring system — it continuously tracks each patient's condition, records when they're healthy or sick, and maintains a timeline of their health changes. The **configuration schema** acts like the hospital's treatment protocols — it defines how often to check patients, what constitutes healthy vs unhealthy readings, which treatment algorithms to use, and how to prioritize care based on patient needs.\n\nJust as a hospital must maintain accurate, up-to-date records for each patient while following standardized protocols for care delivery, our load balancer maintains detailed state for each backend while following configurable rules for traffic distribution and health management. The data structures must be precise, consistent, and accessible to all components that need to make routing and health decisions.\n\n### The Data Architecture Challenge\n\nThe load balancer's effectiveness hinges on maintaining accurate, consistent state about backend servers while supporting real-time decision making under high request volume. The primary data modeling challenges include:\n\n**State Consistency**: Multiple goroutines simultaneously read backend health states for routing decisions while health checkers update the same state based on probe results. The data model must prevent race conditions while maintaining performance under concurrent access patterns.\n\n**Configuration Flexibility**: The system must support runtime configuration changes without service interruption. This requires data structures that can be atomically swapped, validated incrementally, and merged with existing state while preserving ongoing connections and health check schedules.\n\n**Health State Accuracy**: Health information becomes stale quickly in distributed systems. The data model must capture not just current health status, but health history, check timestamps, and transition patterns to enable sophisticated failure detection and recovery logic.\n\n**Algorithm Extensibility**: Different load balancing algorithms require different metadata about backends. Round robin needs simple ordering, weighted algorithms need numeric weights, least connections needs active connection counts, and hash-based algorithms need consistent identification. The backend model must accommodate these varied requirements without algorithm-specific coupling.\n\n![Core Data Structures](./diagrams/data-model.svg)\n\nThe data model consists of three primary layers: the **Backend Server Model** that represents individual servers with all their associated state, the **Health State Model** that captures the current and historical health status of each backend, and the **Configuration Schema** that defines how the load balancer should operate. These models interact through well-defined interfaces that support both high-frequency read operations (request routing) and periodic write operations (health updates, configuration changes).\n\n### Backend Server Model\n\nThe backend server model represents an individual application server that can receive proxied requests from the load balancer. This model must capture all information necessary for routing decisions, health tracking, connection management, and algorithm-specific metadata.\n\n#### Core Backend Structure\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| ID | string | Unique identifier generated from URL, used for consistent hashing and logging |\n| URL | *url.URL | Parsed backend server address including scheme, host, and port |\n| Weight | int | Relative weight for weighted round robin algorithms (default: 1) |\n| ActiveConnections | *int64 | Current number of active HTTP connections (atomic access required) |\n| HealthState | *HealthState | Current health status and check history (pointer for atomic updates) |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Timestamp when backend was added to pool |\n| LastUsed | *time.Time | Most recent request routing timestamp (atomic updates) |\n| Metadata | map[string]interface{} | Algorithm-specific data storage for extensibility |\n\nThe `Backend` structure serves as the central representation of a backend server throughout its lifecycle in the load balancer. The ID field provides a stable identifier that persists across configuration reloads and enables consistent hash calculations for session affinity algorithms. The URL field stores the parsed destination address, eliminating repeated parsing during request forwarding.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Using atomic pointers for frequently updated fields like `ActiveConnections` and `LastUsed` prevents race conditions during concurrent request processing while maintaining read performance for routing decisions.\n\nThe weight field supports proportional traffic distribution in weighted algorithms. A weight of 0 effectively disables the backend without removing it from the pool, while higher weights increase the backend's share of traffic proportionally. The metadata map provides an extension point for algorithms that need custom state without modifying the core backend structure.\n\n#### Connection Tracking Interface\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| IncrementConnections | backend *Backend | int64 | Atomically increments active connection count and returns new value |\n| DecrementConnections | backend *Backend | int64 | Atomically decrements active connection count and returns new value |\n| GetActiveConnections | backend *Backend | int64 | Reads current active connection count atomically |\n| SetLastUsed | backend *Backend, timestamp time.Time | none | Atomically updates the last request timestamp |\n| GetLastUsed | backend *Backend | time.Time | Reads the last used timestamp atomically |\n\nConnection tracking enables the least connections algorithm while providing observability into backend utilization. The atomic operations ensure accurate counts even under high concurrency. The increment and decrement methods return the new count to enable immediate algorithm decisions without additional reads.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Atomic Counters vs Mutex Protection**\n> - **Context**: Active connection counts are updated on every request and need protection from race conditions\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Mutex-protected integer fields with read/write locking\n>   2. Atomic int64 operations with pointer-based access\n>   3. Channel-based counter service with dedicated goroutine\n> - **Decision**: Atomic int64 operations with pointer-based access\n> - **Rationale**: Atomic operations provide lock-free performance for simple counters, eliminating contention bottlenecks during high request volume. Mutex protection adds overhead for every request, while channels introduce unnecessary complexity and latency.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables lock-free connection counting but limits counter operations to simple increment/decrement/read patterns. More complex counter logic would require mutex protection.\n\n#### Backend State Management\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| NewBackend | config BackendConfig | *Backend, error | Creates new backend from configuration with initial healthy state |\n| Clone | backend *Backend | *Backend | Creates deep copy for safe concurrent access during updates |\n| IsHealthy | backend *Backend | bool | Returns current health status thread-safely |\n| String | backend *Backend | string | Returns human-readable representation for logging |\n\nThe `NewBackend` constructor validates the configuration and initializes the backend with default values. It parses the URL, validates the scheme (http/https), and sets the initial health state to healthy with no check history. This optimistic initialization allows new backends to receive traffic immediately while health checking begins in the background.\n\nThe `Clone` method supports atomic backend pool updates during configuration reloads. Rather than modifying backends in-place, configuration changes create new backend instances and atomically swap the entire pool. This prevents partial state inconsistencies during updates.\n\n> **Critical Implementation Detail**: The `IsHealthy` method must read the health state atomically to prevent seeing partial health state updates during health check transitions. Use atomic pointer loads to ensure consistent health state reading.\n\n### Health State Model\n\nThe health state model tracks the current and historical health status of backend servers. This model enables sophisticated failure detection, recovery logic, and health-based routing decisions while providing observability into backend reliability patterns.\n\n#### Core Health State Structure\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Healthy | bool | Current health status (true = healthy, false = unhealthy) |\n| ConsecutiveSuccesses | int | Number of consecutive successful health checks |\n| ConsecutiveFailures | int | Number of consecutive failed health checks |\n| LastCheckTime | time.Time | Timestamp of most recent health check attempt |\n| LastSuccessTime | time.Time | Timestamp of most recent successful health check |\n| LastFailureTime | time.Time | Timestamp of most recent failed health check |\n| LastError | string | Error message from most recent failed health check |\n| TotalChecks | int64 | Lifetime total number of health checks performed |\n| TotalSuccesses | int64 | Lifetime total number of successful health checks |\n| TotalFailures | int64 | Lifetime total number of failed health checks |\n| StateChanges | []HealthStateChange | History of health state transitions (limited size) |\n\nThe health state maintains both current status and historical patterns to enable intelligent failure detection. The consecutive counters drive threshold-based state transitions, while the timestamp fields provide timing information for health check scheduling and debugging.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Separating consecutive counts from total counts allows threshold-based decisions (consecutive failures) while maintaining long-term reliability metrics for monitoring and capacity planning.\n\nThe error message field captures diagnostic information from failed health checks, enabling operators to distinguish between different failure types (connection refused, timeout, HTTP 5xx responses). The state changes history provides an audit trail of health transitions for debugging intermittent issues.\n\n#### Health State Change Tracking\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Timestamp | time.Time | When the state change occurred |\n| PreviousState | bool | Health status before the change |\n| NewState | bool | Health status after the change |\n| Reason | string | Cause of the state change (threshold reached, manual override) |\n| CheckCount | int | Number of consecutive checks that triggered this change |\n\nState change tracking enables analysis of backend reliability patterns and health check effectiveness. Operators can identify backends that flap between healthy and unhealthy states, indicating network issues or marginal capacity problems.\n\nThe reason field distinguishes between automatic transitions (threshold reached) and manual interventions (administrative actions). This information helps operators understand whether state changes reflect actual backend issues or operational decisions.\n\n#### Health State Transition Interface\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| RecordSuccess | state *HealthState, timestamp time.Time | bool | Records successful check, returns true if state changed to healthy |\n| RecordFailure | state *HealthState, timestamp time.Time, error string | bool | Records failed check, returns true if state changed to unhealthy |\n| ShouldTransitionToHealthy | state *HealthState, threshold int | bool | Checks if consecutive successes meet healthy threshold |\n| ShouldTransitionToUnhealthy | state *HealthState, threshold int | bool | Checks if consecutive failures meet unhealthy threshold |\n| GetHealthSummary | state *HealthState | HealthSummary | Returns current health metrics for monitoring |\n\nThe record methods update counters and timestamps while checking for state transitions based on configurable thresholds. They return boolean flags indicating whether the health status changed, enabling health checkers to log transitions and notify other components.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Threshold-Based State Transitions**\n> - **Context**: Health checks can be noisy, with occasional false positives due to network hiccups or temporary backend overload\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Immediate state changes on single check results\n>   2. Threshold-based transitions requiring consecutive successes/failures\n>   3. Sliding window analysis of check history with percentage thresholds\n> - **Decision**: Threshold-based transitions with consecutive check counting\n> - **Rationale**: Consecutive thresholds provide simple, predictable behavior while filtering out transient issues. Operators can tune thresholds based on their reliability requirements without complex configuration. Sliding windows add complexity without significantly better filtering for most use cases.\n> - **Consequences**: Reduces false positive state changes but may delay detection of actual failures. Requires careful threshold tuning for different backend types and network conditions.\n\n#### Health Metrics Aggregation\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| SuccessRate | float64 | Percentage of successful checks over lifetime |\n| RecentSuccessRate | float64 | Success rate over last 100 checks |\n| AverageResponseTime | time.Duration | Mean health check response time |\n| UptimePercentage | float64 | Percentage of time backend has been healthy |\n| StateChangeCount | int | Total number of health state transitions |\n\nHealth metrics provide observability into backend reliability and health check effectiveness. The success rate calculations help identify backends with marginal reliability, while response time metrics can indicate performance degradation before hard failures occur.\n\nThe recent success rate uses a sliding window to provide more current reliability information than lifetime statistics. This helps identify backends that have recently become unstable even if their historical success rate remains high.\n\n### Configuration Schema\n\nThe configuration schema defines all operational parameters for the load balancer, including backend server definitions, algorithm selection, health check settings, and runtime behavior controls. The schema must support validation, hot reloading, and extensibility for new features.\n\n#### Primary Configuration Structure\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Port | int | HTTP port for the load balancer to listen on (required) |\n| Backends | []BackendConfig | List of backend server configurations (minimum 1 required) |\n| Algorithm | string | Load balancing algorithm name (default: \"round_robin\") |\n| HealthCheck | HealthCheckConfig | Health checking configuration and settings |\n| Proxy | ProxyConfig | HTTP proxy behavior and timeout settings |\n| Logging | LoggingConfig | Logging level and output configuration |\n| Metrics | MetricsConfig | Monitoring and metrics collection settings |\n\nThe top-level configuration provides all settings needed to operate the load balancer. The port field defines where the load balancer accepts incoming requests, while the backends list specifies where requests should be forwarded. The algorithm field selects which load balancing strategy to use from the available implementations.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Grouping related settings into sub-configuration objects (HealthCheckConfig, ProxyConfig) improves maintainability and enables focused validation logic for each functional area.\n\n#### Backend Configuration Structure\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| URL | string | Backend server URL including scheme and port (required) |\n| Weight | int | Relative weight for weighted algorithms (default: 1, minimum: 0) |\n| MaxConnections | int | Maximum concurrent connections (0 = unlimited) |\n| ConnectTimeout | time.Duration | TCP connection timeout (default: 5s) |\n| ResponseTimeout | time.Duration | HTTP response timeout (default: 30s) |\n| Enabled | bool | Whether backend accepts traffic (default: true) |\n\nBackend configuration defines the connection parameters and operational settings for each backend server. The URL must include the scheme (http/https) and may include a custom port. The weight field enables proportional traffic distribution in weighted algorithms.\n\nThe timeout settings allow per-backend tuning based on the backend's characteristics. Backends serving complex queries may need longer response timeouts, while simple APIs can use shorter timeouts for faster failure detection.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Per-Backend vs Global Timeouts**\n> - **Context**: Different backend services may have different performance characteristics and timeout requirements\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Global timeout settings applied to all backends uniformly\n>   2. Per-backend timeout configuration with global defaults\n>   3. Automatic timeout adjustment based on response time history\n> - **Decision**: Per-backend timeout configuration with global defaults\n> - **Rationale**: Backend services often have different response time profiles (database queries vs static content), requiring different timeout values. Per-backend settings provide necessary flexibility while global defaults simplify configuration for homogeneous backends.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables optimal timeout tuning for mixed backend environments but increases configuration complexity. Operators must understand each backend's performance characteristics.\n\n#### Health Check Configuration Structure\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Enabled | bool | Whether to perform active health checking (default: true) |\n| Interval | time.Duration | Time between health checks (default: 10s) |\n| Timeout | time.Duration | Health check request timeout (default: 5s) |\n| HealthyThreshold | int | Consecutive successes needed to mark healthy (default: 2) |\n| UnhealthyThreshold | int | Consecutive failures needed to mark unhealthy (default: 3) |\n| Path | string | HTTP path for health check requests (default: \"/health\") |\n| ExpectedStatus | int | Expected HTTP status code for success (default: 200) |\n| UserAgent | string | User-Agent header for health check requests |\n\nHealth check configuration controls how the load balancer monitors backend server availability. The interval and timeout settings determine the frequency and responsiveness of health monitoring, while the threshold values control the sensitivity to transient issues.\n\nThe path and expected status fields allow health checks to target specific health endpoints rather than the general application path. Many applications provide dedicated health check endpoints that verify database connectivity, external dependencies, and other critical components.\n\n#### Algorithm Configuration Options\n\n| Algorithm Name | Required Config | Optional Config | Description |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| round_robin | None | None | Simple sequential rotation through backends |\n| weighted_round_robin | Backend weights | None | Proportional distribution based on backend weights |\n| least_connections | None | Connection tracking | Routes to backend with fewest active connections |\n| ip_hash | None | Hash function | Consistent client-to-backend mapping based on IP |\n| random | None | Random seed | Random backend selection for each request |\n\nAlgorithm configuration varies based on the selected algorithm's requirements. Simple algorithms like round robin need no additional configuration, while weighted algorithms require weight values for each backend. The configuration schema accommodates these differences through optional fields and algorithm-specific validation.\n\nThe IP hash algorithm supports different hash functions (consistent hashing, simple modulo) through optional configuration. This allows tuning the distribution characteristics and handling backend pool changes gracefully.\n\n> **Critical Configuration Validation**: The configuration system must validate that weighted algorithms have weight values for all backends, and that threshold values are positive integers with healthy threshold ≤ unhealthy threshold to prevent configuration errors that could disable health checking.\n\n#### Configuration Validation Rules\n\n| Validation Rule | Field(s) | Error Condition | Resolution |\n|----------------|----------|-----------------|------------|\n| Port Range | Port | Port < 1 or Port > 65535 | Must be valid TCP port number |\n| Backend URL Format | Backends[].URL | Invalid URL or missing scheme | Must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URL |\n| Algorithm Validity | Algorithm | Unknown algorithm name | Must match available algorithm implementations |\n| Threshold Logic | HealthyThreshold, UnhealthyThreshold | Healthy > Unhealthy | Healthy threshold must be ≤ unhealthy threshold |\n| Minimum Backends | Backends | Empty backends list | Must have at least one backend configured |\n| Weight Range | Backends[].Weight | Weight < 0 | Weight must be non-negative integer |\n| Timeout Values | Various timeout fields | Timeout ≤ 0 | All timeouts must be positive durations |\n\nConfiguration validation prevents common misconfigurations that could cause runtime failures or unexpected behavior. The validation logic runs during configuration loading and before applying configuration updates, ensuring only valid configurations reach the running system.\n\nThe threshold logic validation prevents impossible health check configurations where backends could never transition to healthy state. URL validation ensures backend addresses can be parsed and used for HTTP requests.\n\n#### Configuration Update Interface\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| LoadConfig | filename string | *Config, error | Loads configuration from file with full validation |\n| Validate | config *Config | error | Validates all configuration fields and dependencies |\n| MergeConfig | current *Config, updates *Config | *Config, error | Merges partial updates with existing configuration |\n| CompareConfigs | config1, config2 *Config | ConfigDiff | Identifies differences between configurations |\n| ApplyUpdates | current *Config, diff ConfigDiff | *Config, error | Applies validated changes to create new configuration |\n\nThe configuration interface supports both full configuration loading and incremental updates. The merge functionality enables partial configuration updates where only changed fields are specified, reducing the risk of accidentally reverting unrelated settings.\n\nConfiguration comparison identifies what changed between versions, enabling targeted updates that only affect modified components. For example, changing only health check settings should not restart the algorithm selector or rebuild backend connection pools.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Health State Updates**\n\nMany implementations access health state fields directly without proper synchronization, leading to corrupted state during concurrent health checks and routing decisions. For example, reading the `Healthy` boolean while another goroutine updates consecutive failure counts can see inconsistent state where a backend appears healthy but has high failure counts.\n\n*Why it's wrong*: Concurrent access to shared state without synchronization causes data races that can lead to incorrect routing decisions, such as sending traffic to unhealthy backends or incorrectly marking healthy backends as failed.\n\n*How to fix*: Use atomic operations for simple fields or protect the entire health state with a read-write mutex. Better yet, make health state immutable and use atomic pointer swaps for updates, ensuring readers always see consistent state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Configuration Validation After Startup**\n\nSome implementations only validate configuration during initial loading, allowing invalid configurations to be applied during runtime updates. This can cause the load balancer to fail when applying configuration changes, potentially leaving it in an inconsistent state.\n\n*Why it's wrong*: Runtime configuration updates without validation can introduce invalid settings that crash the load balancer or cause subtle behavioral issues that are difficult to diagnose.\n\n*How to fix*: Always validate configuration changes before applying them. Create a staging configuration, validate all fields and dependencies, then atomically swap to the new configuration only if validation succeeds. Keep the previous valid configuration as a rollback option.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Connection Tracking**\n\nImplementations often increment connection counters on request start but fail to decrement them on all exit paths (normal completion, client disconnect, backend failure). This causes connection counts to grow indefinitely, breaking the least connections algorithm.\n\n*Why it's wrong*: Inaccurate connection counts cause traffic distribution problems and eventually integer overflow. The least connections algorithm becomes useless when counts don't reflect actual connections.\n\n*How to fix*: Use defer statements or finally blocks to ensure connection counters are decremented on all exit paths. Implement connection count auditing that periodically verifies counts match actual connection states and resets counters if they diverge significantly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health State History Memory Growth**\n\nStoring unlimited health check history in the `StateChanges` slice causes memory usage to grow without bound over time, especially for backends with frequent state changes due to intermittent issues.\n\n*Why it's wrong*: Unbounded memory growth eventually causes the load balancer to run out of memory, particularly in environments with many backends or frequent health state transitions.\n\n*How to fix*: Limit the state change history to a fixed number of recent entries (e.g., last 100 changes) using a circular buffer or by trimming old entries when adding new ones. Archive detailed history to external monitoring systems if needed for analysis.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Backend ID Collisions**\n\nGenerating backend IDs from URLs without proper normalization can create collisions when the same backend is specified with different URL formats (e.g., \"http://api.example.com\" vs \"http://api.example.com/\"). This causes backends to overwrite each other during configuration updates.\n\n*Why it's wrong*: Backend collisions result in lost configuration, unpredictable behavior during updates, and difficulty tracking specific backends in logs and metrics.\n\n*How to fix*: Normalize URLs before generating IDs by parsing the URL, standardizing the scheme/host/port format, and removing trailing slashes. Use the normalized form consistently for ID generation and backend comparison.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

in Go 1.19+, or `atomic.Value` for earlier versions\n- Parse duration strings with `time.ParseDuration(\"10s\")` for human-readable timeout configuration\n- Use `net/url.Parse()` for URL validation and normalize with `url.String()` for consistent ID generation\n- Implement `fmt.Stringer` interface on Backend and HealthState for readable logging output\n- Use struct tags with validation libraries like `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` for declarative validation\n- Leverage `json:\",omitempty\"` tags to exclude empty fields from configuration output\n\n**Atomic Operations for Concurrent Access:**\n```go\n// Reading atomic values\nconnections := atomic.LoadInt64(b.activeConnections)\nlastUsed := time.Unix(atomic.LoadInt64(b.lastUsed), 0)\n\n// Writing atomic values  \natomic.StoreInt64(b.lastUsed, time.Now().Unix())\nnewCount := atomic.AddInt64(b.activeConnections, 1)\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - Data Model Foundation:**\nAfter implementing the data model structures, verify:\n\n1. **Backend Creation**: Create backends from configuration and verify all fields are properly initialized\n   ```bash\n   go test -run TestNewBackend ./internal/models/\n   ```\n\n2. **Atomic Operations**: Test concurrent access to connection counters and health state\n   ```bash\n   go test -race -run TestConcurrentAccess ./internal/models/\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration Validation**: Load valid and invalid configurations and verify validation catches errors\n   ```bash\n   go test -run TestConfigValidation ./internal/config/\n   ```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- New backends should have healthy initial state and zero connections\n- Concurrent connection increment/decrement should maintain accurate counts\n- Invalid configurations should return specific validation errors\n- Health state updates should be atomic and consistent\n\n**Signs Something is Wrong:**\n- Race condition warnings during `go test -race`\n- Connection counters that drift or become negative\n- Configuration validation that accepts invalid values\n- Panics when accessing health state concurrently\n\n\n## HTTP Reverse Proxy Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (HTTP Proxy Foundation) — this component implements the core reverse proxy functionality that forwards HTTP requests between clients and backend servers\n\n### Mental Model: Relay Runner\n\nThink of the HTTP reverse proxy as a **relay runner** in a communication chain between two parties who cannot speak directly to each other. Imagine you're at an international conference where a client speaks only English and a backend server speaks only French. The reverse proxy acts as a bilingual interpreter who:\n\n1. **Receives the message** from the English-speaking client, understanding exactly what they want to say\n2. **Translates and forwards** the message to the French-speaking backend server, preserving all the nuances and context\n3. **Waits for the response** from the backend server, maintaining the connection and context\n4. **Translates and relays** the response back to the original client, ensuring nothing is lost in translation\n\nThe key insight is that the reverse proxy is **transparent to both parties** — the client thinks they're talking directly to the backend server, and the backend server thinks the proxy is the original client. This transparency is crucial because it allows the load balancer to sit invisibly between clients and servers, distributing traffic without either side needing to be aware of the load balancing happening.\n\nUnlike a forward proxy (which acts on behalf of clients), a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the servers. It's positioned at the server side of the network, accepting requests that clients think are going directly to the origin server, then deciding which actual backend server should handle each request.\n\nThe relay runner analogy helps us understand the three critical responsibilities: **message fidelity** (preserving all headers, body content, and HTTP semantics), **connection management** (maintaining efficient communication channels), and **error handling** (gracefully managing situations when the backend server is unavailable or unresponsive).\n\n### Request Forwarding Logic\n\nThe request forwarding logic forms the heart of the reverse proxy, responsible for accepting incoming HTTP requests and faithfully relaying them to selected backend servers. This process involves careful parsing, modification, and transmission of HTTP messages while preserving their semantic meaning and ensuring proper error handling.\n\n![Request Processing Sequence](./diagrams/request-flow.svg)\n\nThe request forwarding process follows a structured sequence of steps that ensures reliable message transmission:\n\n1. **Accept the incoming connection** from the client on the configured proxy port, establishing a TCP connection that will carry the HTTP request\n2. **Parse the HTTP request** using Go's built-in HTTP server capabilities, extracting the method, path, headers, and body into a structured request object\n3. **Select the target backend** by consulting the backend manager and load balancing algorithm to determine which server should handle this request\n4. **Clone and modify the request** by creating a new HTTP request object with the backend server's URL while preserving the original method, path, and body\n5. **Add proxy headers** including `X-Forwarded-For` (client's IP address), `X-Forwarded-Proto` (original protocol), and `X-Forwarded-Host` (original host header)\n6. **Establish backend connection** using the HTTP client's connection pool, leveraging keep-alive connections when possible for efficiency\n7. **Forward the request** by writing the modified request to the backend server, including all headers and streaming the body content\n8. **Handle connection errors** by catching network failures, timeouts, and other transport-level issues that prevent request delivery\n\nThe request forwarding mechanism must handle several critical aspects of HTTP semantics correctly. **Method preservation** ensures that GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods are forwarded exactly as received, maintaining the intended operation semantics. **Header forwarding** requires careful attention to which headers should be passed through unchanged, which should be modified, and which should be stripped or added by the proxy.\n\n**Body handling** presents particular challenges because HTTP request bodies can be large and may arrive as streaming data. The proxy must efficiently forward body content without loading entire payloads into memory, using Go's `io.Copy` or similar streaming mechanisms to transfer data directly from the client connection to the backend connection.\n\nThe forwarding logic maintains a **request context** throughout the process, allowing for proper timeout handling, cancellation propagation, and resource cleanup. This context carries deadlines from the original client request and enables the proxy to cancel backend requests if the client disconnects or times out.\n\n| Request Component | Forwarding Behavior | Modification Required | Error Handling |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------- |----------------|\n| HTTP Method | Pass through unchanged | None | Invalid methods return 400 Bad Request |\n| Request Path | Pass through unchanged | None | Malformed paths return 400 Bad Request |\n| Query Parameters | Pass through unchanged | None | Invalid encoding returns 400 Bad Request |\n| Host Header | Replace with backend host | Set to backend server address | Missing host returns 400 Bad Request |\n| Content-Length | Pass through if present | None | Mismatched length returns 400 Bad Request |\n| Transfer-Encoding | Pass through unchanged | None | Unsupported encodings return 501 Not Implemented |\n| Authorization | Pass through unchanged | None | Invalid format passed to backend |\n| User-Agent | Pass through unchanged | None | Missing user agent is acceptable |\n| X-Forwarded-For | Add or append client IP | Append to existing or create new | Network errors logged but not fatal |\n| X-Forwarded-Proto | Set to original protocol | Set to \"http\" or \"https\" | Default to \"http\" if uncertain |\n| Connection | Strip and handle internally | Remove hop-by-hop header | Invalid values ignored |\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: The proxy must act as a **protocol translator** while maintaining semantic fidelity. Every HTTP request has multiple layers of meaning — the transport layer (TCP connection), the HTTP protocol layer (methods, headers, status codes), and the application layer (body content, authentication tokens). The proxy must preserve meaning at all layers while translating between different network endpoints.\n\n**Connection management** during request forwarding requires careful attention to resource lifecycle. The proxy must track active requests to prevent resource leaks, implement appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging connections, and properly close connections when errors occur or requests complete.\n\nError scenarios during request forwarding fall into several categories that require different handling strategies. **Network connectivity errors** occur when the backend server is unreachable, the connection is refused, or DNS resolution fails — these should result in a 502 Bad Gateway response. **Timeout errors** happen when backend servers accept connections but don't respond within configured limits — these also generate 502 responses but may trigger health check updates. **Protocol errors** arise from malformed HTTP responses or unexpected connection closures — these require careful error response generation to avoid leaving clients hanging.\n\n### Response Processing\n\nResponse processing handles the return path of the HTTP proxy flow, receiving responses from backend servers and relaying them back to the original clients. This process requires careful attention to HTTP status codes, header handling, body streaming, and error recovery to ensure clients receive complete and correct responses.\n\nThe response processing workflow mirrors the request forwarding process but operates in reverse, with additional complexity around error response generation and connection cleanup:\n\n1. **Receive the backend response** by reading the HTTP response from the established backend connection, parsing status code, headers, and preparing for body streaming\n2. **Validate response integrity** by checking for proper HTTP format, valid status codes, and consistent header values that indicate a well-formed response\n3. **Process response headers** by forwarding most headers unchanged while stripping hop-by-hop headers and adding any proxy-specific headers needed by clients\n4. **Set response status** by copying the backend's HTTP status code to the client response, ensuring proper status line formatting and reason phrase handling\n5. **Stream response body** by efficiently copying the backend response body to the client connection without buffering large payloads in memory\n6. **Handle streaming errors** by detecting network failures during body transfer and implementing appropriate error recovery or connection termination\n7. **Clean up connections** by properly closing backend connections when appropriate and returning them to connection pools for reuse when possible\n8. **Log response completion** by recording the final status, bytes transferred, and timing information for monitoring and debugging purposes\n\nResponse header processing requires understanding which headers are safe to forward and which require special handling. **Content headers** like `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Content-Encoding` must be forwarded exactly as received to ensure proper client interpretation. **Caching headers** including `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Expires` should be passed through to allow client-side and intermediate proxy caching to function correctly.\n\n**Security-related headers** such as `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization`, and custom authentication headers must be forwarded carefully to maintain application functionality while not exposing sensitive proxy internals. **CORS headers** including `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and related directives should be passed through unchanged to preserve cross-origin request handling.\n\n| Response Header Category | Forwarding Policy | Modification Required | Special Considerations |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------- |----------------------|\n| Content Headers | Forward unchanged | None | Critical for proper client parsing |\n| Caching Headers | Forward unchanged | None | Enables downstream caching |\n| Security Headers | Forward unchanged | None | Required for authentication flows |\n| CORS Headers | Forward unchanged | None | Needed for browser cross-origin requests |\n| Server Headers | Forward unchanged | None | May reveal backend server information |\n| Date Headers | Forward unchanged | None | Important for cache validation |\n| Connection Headers | Strip from response | Remove hop-by-hop headers | Proxy manages connections independently |\n| Proxy Headers | Add if configured | May add Via or X-Forwarded headers | Optional proxy identification |\n\n**Response body streaming** represents a critical performance and resource management concern. The proxy must handle response bodies of arbitrary size without consuming excessive memory, support various `Transfer-Encoding` formats including chunked encoding, and maintain streaming efficiency even for large payloads like file downloads or media content.\n\nThe streaming implementation uses Go's `io.Copy` function or similar mechanisms to create a direct pipe between the backend response body reader and the client response writer. This approach avoids loading response content into proxy memory while maintaining high throughput and low latency.\n\n**Error response generation** becomes necessary when backend servers fail to respond properly or when network errors occur during response processing. The proxy must generate appropriate HTTP error responses that inform clients about the failure while providing sufficient information for debugging without exposing sensitive backend details.\n\n| Error Scenario | HTTP Status Code | Response Body | Client Action |\n|----------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Backend connection refused | 502 Bad Gateway | \"Backend server unavailable\" | Retry or use alternative endpoint |\n| Backend connection timeout | 502 Bad Gateway | \"Backend server timeout\" | Retry with longer timeout |\n| Backend returns invalid HTTP | 502 Bad Gateway | \"Invalid backend response\" | Check backend server status |\n| Response body streaming error | Connection closed | Partial response already sent | Client must handle incomplete response |\n| Backend returns 5xx error | Forward status unchanged | Forward backend error response | Client handles backend application error |\n| Proxy internal error | 500 Internal Server Error | \"Proxy processing error\" | Contact proxy administrator |\n\n> **Critical Design Principle**: Response processing must maintain **streaming semantics** to support real-time applications, large file transfers, and long-polling connections. Buffering entire responses in proxy memory would create scalability bottlenecks and increase latency, violating the transparency principle of reverse proxying.\n\n**Connection lifecycle management** during response processing involves coordinating between client and backend connections. When responses complete successfully, backend connections should be returned to the connection pool for reuse when using HTTP keep-alive. When errors occur, connections may need to be closed and discarded to prevent connection state corruption.\n\nThe response processing logic must also handle **partial response scenarios** where backend connections fail or close unexpectedly after the response has started streaming to the client. In these cases, the proxy cannot send a different HTTP status code (since headers have already been sent) and must log the error while closing the client connection.\n\n### Connection Pool Management\n\nConnection pool management optimizes the reverse proxy's network efficiency by reusing HTTP connections to backend servers, reducing the overhead of establishing new TCP connections for each request. This component manages connection lifecycle, implements keep-alive functionality, and handles connection limits and timeouts to ensure reliable and performant backend communication.\n\nThe connection pool operates as a **shared resource manager** that coordinates connection allocation across concurrent requests. When a request needs to communicate with a backend server, it requests a connection from the pool rather than establishing a new one. After the request completes, the connection returns to the pool for reuse by subsequent requests to the same backend.\n\nGo's built-in `http.Client` and `http.Transport` provide robust connection pooling capabilities that the reverse proxy leverages. The `http.Transport` automatically manages connection pools per backend server, implements HTTP/1.1 keep-alive semantics, and handles connection limits and timeouts according to configured parameters.\n\n**Connection pool configuration** requires balancing several competing concerns: **connection reuse efficiency** (higher limits reduce connection establishment overhead), **resource consumption** (connection pools consume memory and file descriptors), and **backend server protection** (too many connections can overwhelm backend servers).\n\n| Configuration Parameter | Purpose | Default Value | Tuning Considerations |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------------|----------------------|\n| MaxIdleConns | Total idle connections across all backends | 100 | Higher values reduce connection establishment but consume memory |\n| MaxIdleConnsPerHost | Idle connections per backend server | 2 | Should match expected concurrency per backend |\n| MaxConnsPerHost | Total connections per backend server | Unlimited | Set to protect backend servers from connection exhaustion |\n| IdleConnTimeout | How long to keep idle connections | 90 seconds | Longer timeouts improve reuse but consume resources |\n| TLSHandshakeTimeout | Timeout for TLS connection establishment | 10 seconds | Shorter timeouts fail faster but may cause false failures |\n| ResponseHeaderTimeout | Timeout for response headers | 0 (no timeout) | Should be set to prevent hanging requests |\n| ExpectContinueTimeout | Timeout for 100-continue responses | 1 second | Affects POST/PUT request performance |\n\nThe connection pool implements **connection lifecycle management** through several phases. **Connection establishment** occurs when no idle connections exist for a backend server, triggering TCP connection setup and any required TLS handshaking. **Connection allocation** assigns an available connection to an incoming request, removing it from the idle pool and marking it as active. **Connection return** happens when a request completes successfully with a reusable connection, returning it to the idle pool for future use. **Connection expiry** removes connections that exceed idle timeout limits or encounter errors that make them unsuitable for reuse.\n\n**Health-based connection management** integrates with the load balancer's health checking system to prevent connection allocation to unhealthy backends. When a backend server is marked unhealthy, the connection pool should drain existing connections and refuse new connection allocations until the backend recovers.\n\nThe connection pool must handle **concurrent access patterns** safely, as multiple goroutines will simultaneously request connections for different client requests. Go's `http.Transport` handles this concurrency internally, but the proxy must coordinate between connection pool operations and backend health state changes.\n\n**Connection error handling** requires distinguishing between transient network issues and persistent backend failures. **Connection refused errors** typically indicate backend server problems and should trigger health check updates. **Timeout errors** may indicate network congestion or backend overload and might warrant connection pool tuning. **Protocol errors** suggest backend server misconfigumentation and may require connection pool draining.\n\n| Connection Error Type | Pool Action | Health Check Impact | Recovery Strategy |\n|----------------------|-------------|-------------------- |------------------|\n| Connection refused | Mark backend unhealthy | Trigger immediate health check | Wait for health recovery |\n| Connection timeout | Close connection, retry once | No immediate action | May adjust timeout settings |\n| TLS handshake failure | Close connection | Log security concern | Check certificate validity |\n| Protocol error | Close connection | No immediate action | Log for backend investigation |\n| Idle connection closed | Remove from pool | No action | Normal connection lifecycle |\n| DNS resolution failure | No pool action | Mark backend unhealthy | Check DNS configuration |\n\n> **Performance Insight**: Connection pooling can reduce request latency by **50-80%** for workloads with frequent requests to the same backends, as it eliminates TCP handshake (typically 1 RTT) and TLS handshake (typically 2-3 RTTs) overhead. However, poorly configured pools can cause connection exhaustion or resource leaks.\n\n**Connection pool monitoring** provides visibility into pool performance and helps identify configuration issues. Key metrics include **active connection count** (connections currently handling requests), **idle connection count** (connections available for reuse), **connection establishment rate** (new connections created per second), and **connection reuse rate** (percentage of requests using pooled connections).\n\nThe connection pool integrates with the proxy's **graceful shutdown** process by providing connection draining functionality. During shutdown, the pool stops accepting new connection requests, allows active requests to complete, and closes all idle connections in an orderly fashion.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe HTTP reverse proxy component involves several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact performance, reliability, and maintainability. These decisions establish the foundation for how the proxy handles HTTP semantics, manages resources, and integrates with other load balancer components.\n\n> **Decision: HTTP Client Implementation**\n> - **Context**: The proxy needs an HTTP client to communicate with backend servers, with options ranging from low-level socket programming to high-level HTTP libraries\n> - **Options Considered**: Raw TCP sockets with manual HTTP parsing, Go's net/http package, third-party HTTP clients like fasthttp\n> - **Decision**: Use Go's standard `net/http` package with customized `http.Transport`\n> - **Rationale**: The standard library provides robust HTTP/1.1 implementation, built-in connection pooling, comprehensive error handling, and extensive testing. Custom transport configuration allows fine-tuning for proxy-specific needs without reimplementing HTTP protocol details\n> - **Consequences**: Leverages battle-tested HTTP implementation and reduces development complexity, but limits control over low-level connection behavior and may have higher memory overhead than specialized proxy libraries\n\n| HTTP Client Option | Pros | Cons | Performance | Complexity |\n|--------------------|------|------|-------------|------------|\n| Raw TCP + Manual HTTP | Maximum control, minimal overhead | High complexity, error-prone parsing | Highest | Very High |\n| Go net/http | Standard library, robust, well-tested | Some overhead, less control | Good | Low |\n| fasthttp Library | Optimized for high performance | Non-standard API, less ecosystem support | Highest | Medium |\n| Custom HTTP Client | Tailored to proxy needs | Development and maintenance overhead | Variable | High |\n\n> **Decision: Header Processing Strategy**\n> - **Context**: HTTP headers require careful handling to maintain protocol correctness while adding proxy functionality\n> - **Options Considered**: Forward all headers unchanged, selective header filtering, comprehensive header rewriting\n> - **Decision**: Implement selective header processing with explicit forwarding rules\n> - **Rationale**: Forwarding all headers unchanged preserves application functionality, while selective processing allows adding proxy-specific headers like X-Forwarded-For. Comprehensive rewriting introduces complexity and potential compatibility issues\n> - **Consequences**: Maintains application compatibility and simplifies debugging, but may forward headers that expose backend server information or cause client confusion\n\n> **Decision: Request Body Handling**\n> - **Context**: HTTP request bodies can be large and may arrive as streaming data, requiring efficient forwarding without excessive memory usage\n> - **Options Considered**: Buffer entire body in memory, stream body with fixed buffer, stream with adaptive buffering\n> - **Decision**: Use streaming with fixed buffer size and io.Copy for body forwarding\n> - **Rationale**: Streaming prevents memory exhaustion with large payloads, fixed buffers provide predictable resource usage, and io.Copy is optimized for efficient data transfer in Go\n> - **Consequences**: Supports arbitrarily large request bodies with bounded memory usage, but may not optimize buffer sizes for different payload characteristics\n\n| Body Handling Strategy | Memory Usage | Performance | Complexity | Large File Support |\n|------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Buffer Entire Body | High (proportional to body size) | Good for small bodies | Low | Poor (memory exhaustion) |\n| Fixed Buffer Streaming | Constant (buffer size) | Good overall | Low | Excellent |\n| Adaptive Buffer Streaming | Variable (optimized per request) | Best | High | Excellent |\n| Zero-Copy Streaming | Minimal | Best (when supported) | Very High | Excellent |\n\n> **Decision: Connection Timeout Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Network operations can hang indefinitely without proper timeouts, but aggressive timeouts cause false failures\n> - **Options Considered**: Single global timeout, separate timeouts per operation type, dynamic timeout adjustment\n> - **Decision**: Implement separate configurable timeouts for connection establishment, request sending, and response receiving\n> - **Rationale**: Different operations have different latency characteristics and failure modes. Connection timeouts should be short (network reachable quickly), while response timeouts may need to accommodate backend processing time\n> - **Consequences**: Provides fine-grained control over failure detection speed, but requires careful tuning and increases configuration complexity\n\n> **Decision: Error Response Generation**\n> - **Context**: When backend servers fail or return errors, the proxy must decide what information to include in error responses to clients\n> - **Options Considered**: Forward all backend errors unchanged, generate generic proxy errors, provide detailed error information\n> - **Decision**: Forward backend application errors (4xx/5xx) unchanged, generate standard proxy errors for infrastructure failures\n> - **Rationale**: Application errors from backends contain information clients need for proper error handling. Infrastructure errors (network failures, timeouts) should be normalized to standard proxy error codes to avoid exposing backend topology\n> - **Consequences**: Preserves application error semantics while protecting infrastructure details, but may require careful classification of error types\n\n**Connection pooling architecture** decisions directly impact both performance and resource usage patterns. The choice of pooling strategy affects how efficiently the proxy can handle concurrent requests and how gracefully it responds to backend server changes.\n\n**Request context propagation** decisions determine how cancellation, timeouts, and trace information flow through the proxy. Proper context handling ensures that client disconnections cancel backend requests and that distributed tracing works correctly across the proxy boundary.\n\n**Logging and observability integration** decisions establish what information the proxy records about requests and how that information integrates with monitoring systems. These decisions impact debugging capabilities and operational visibility.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nThe HTTP reverse proxy implementation involves several areas where developers commonly encounter issues that can lead to incorrect behavior, performance problems, or security vulnerabilities. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid frustrating debugging sessions and ensures robust proxy operation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Copying All Request Headers**\n\nMany developers forget to copy important headers when forwarding requests to backend servers, leading to broken application functionality. Common missed headers include `Authorization` (breaking authentication), `Content-Type` (causing backend parsing errors), and `Accept` (preventing content negotiation).\n\nThe problem occurs because developers focus on the obvious headers like `Host` and `User-Agent` while overlooking headers that specific applications depend on. This is particularly problematic with RESTful APIs that rely on `Accept` headers for response format selection or applications using custom authentication headers.\n\n**Fix**: Use Go's header cloning functionality and implement explicit header forwarding lists. Copy all headers by default, then selectively remove hop-by-hop headers rather than selectively adding headers:\n\n```go\n// Wrong approach - easy to miss important headers\nbackendReq.Header.Set(\"Authorization\", req.Header.Get(\"Authorization\"))\nbackendReq.Header.Set(\"Content-Type\", req.Header.Get(\"Content-Type\"))\n// ... what about Accept, Accept-Language, X-Custom-Auth, etc?\n\n// Better approach - copy all, then remove hop-by-hop\nfor name, values := range req.Header {\n    if !isHopByHopHeader(name) {\n        backendReq.Header[name] = values\n    }\n}\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Buffering Large Request Bodies**\n\nDevelopers often load entire request bodies into memory before forwarding them, causing memory exhaustion when clients upload large files or send streaming data. This happens because the obvious approach is to read the body, process it, then write it to the backend.\n\nThe issue manifests as the proxy consuming gigabytes of memory during large uploads, potentially causing out-of-memory crashes or degraded performance for other requests. It also increases latency because the proxy waits to receive the entire body before starting backend transmission.\n\n**Fix**: Use streaming body forwarding with `io.Copy` or similar mechanisms that transfer data without intermediate buffering:\n\n```go\n// Wrong - buffers entire body in memory\nbodyBytes, err := io.ReadAll(req.Body)\nbackendReq.Body = io.NopCloser(bytes.NewReader(bodyBytes))\n\n// Right - streams body directly\nbackendReq.Body = req.Body\nbackendReq.ContentLength = req.ContentLength\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Handling Connection Errors Properly**\n\nIncorrect error handling when backend connections fail leads to confusing client error responses and poor debugging experience. Common mistakes include returning 500 Internal Server Error for all backend connection failures or not distinguishing between different types of network errors.\n\nBackend connection failures should return 502 Bad Gateway to indicate that the proxy successfully received the request but couldn't reach the backend server. This helps clients and monitoring systems distinguish between proxy problems (5xx) and backend problems (502).\n\n**Fix**: Classify connection errors correctly and return appropriate HTTP status codes:\n\n```go\nresp, err := client.Do(backendReq)\nif err != nil {\n    if isConnectionError(err) {\n        http.Error(w, \"Backend server unavailable\", http.StatusBadGateway)\n    } else if isTimeoutError(err) {\n        http.Error(w, \"Backend server timeout\", http.StatusGatewayTimeout)\n    } else {\n        http.Error(w, \"Proxy error\", http.StatusInternalServerError)\n    }\n    return\n}\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Leaking Connections on Errors**\n\nFailing to properly close connections when errors occur leads to connection leaks that eventually exhaust available file descriptors or connection pool resources. This happens when developers focus on the happy path but don't ensure cleanup in error cases.\n\nConnection leaks are particularly problematic because they accumulate slowly and may not manifest until the proxy has been running under load for extended periods. The symptoms include increasing memory usage, declining performance, and eventually connection establishment failures.\n\n**Fix**: Use defer statements and proper error handling to ensure connections are always cleaned up:\n\n```go\nresp, err := client.Do(backendReq)\nif err != nil {\n    // Handle error and return early\n    return\n}\ndefer resp.Body.Close() // Ensures connection cleanup\n\n// Process response...\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Setting Appropriate Timeouts**\n\nMissing or incorrectly configured timeouts cause the proxy to hang indefinitely when backend servers become unresponsive, leading to resource exhaustion and poor user experience. Without timeouts, a single slow backend can cause request queuing and cascade failures.\n\nThe default timeout behavior in many HTTP clients is to wait indefinitely, which is inappropriate for a proxy that needs to provide reliable service even when backends are slow or unresponsive.\n\n**Fix**: Configure comprehensive timeout settings on the HTTP transport:\n\n```go\ntransport := &http.Transport{\n    DialTimeout:           5 * time.Second,  // Connection establishment\n    TLSHandshakeTimeout:   5 * time.Second,  // TLS handshake\n    ResponseHeaderTimeout: 10 * time.Second, // Response headers\n    IdleConnTimeout:       30 * time.Second, // Idle connection reuse\n}\nclient := &http.Client{\n    Transport: transport,\n    Timeout:   30 * time.Second, // Total request timeout\n}\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Modifying X-Forwarded Headers Incorrectly**\n\nIncorrectly handling `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers breaks client IP detection, protocol detection, and virtual host routing in backend applications. Common mistakes include overwriting existing values instead of appending, or using incorrect values.\n\nThis is especially problematic in proxy chains where multiple proxies add forwarding headers. Each proxy should append to existing `X-Forwarded-For` values rather than replacing them, preserving the complete chain of client and intermediate proxy IP addresses.\n\n**Fix**: Properly append to existing forwarding headers:\n\n```go\n// Get client IP from connection\nclientIP, _, _ := net.SplitHostPort(req.RemoteAddr)\n\n// Append to existing X-Forwarded-For\nexisting := req.Header.Get(\"X-Forwarded-For\")\nif existing != \"\" {\n    backendReq.Header.Set(\"X-Forwarded-For\", existing+\", \"+clientIP)\n} else {\n    backendReq.Header.Set(\"X-Forwarded-For\", clientIP)\n}\n\n// Set protocol and host appropriately\nbackendReq.Header.Set(\"X-Forwarded-Proto\", \"http\") // or \"https\"\nbackendReq.Header.Set(\"X-Forwarded-Host\", req.Host)\n```\n\n###

implementing the main reverse proxy functionality:\n\n```go\n// internal/proxy/proxy.go\npackage proxy\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"io\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n

`RemoteAddr` field contains \"IP:port\" format, use `net.SplitHostPort()` to extract just the IP address for X-Forwarded-For\n- Use `atomic.AddInt64()` for thread-safe counter increments in the round-robin algorithm\n- Set `Transport.DisableKeepAlives = false` to enable connection reuse for better performance\n- Use `defer response.Body.Close()` immediately after checking for request errors to ensure cleanup\n- The `io.Copy()` function efficiently streams data without intermediate buffering\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing this component, verify functionality with these steps:\n\n1. **Start the proxy server**: `go run cmd/load-balancer/main.go -config configs/example.json`\n2. **Start test backend servers** on ports 8081, 8082: `python3 -m http.server 8081 &`\n3. **Send test requests**: `curl -v http://localhost:8080/test` \n4. **Expected behavior**:\n   - Requests alternate between backend servers (round-robin)\n   - Response headers include content from backend servers\n   - X-Forwarded-For header added with client IP\n   - Connection errors return 502 Bad Gateway status\n\n**Debugging Checklist:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Solution |\n|---------|--------------|------------------|----------|\n| All requests return 502 | Backend servers not running | Check backend server status, verify URLs in config | Start backend servers, fix configuration |\n| Requests hang indefinitely | Missing timeouts | Check HTTP client configuration | Add timeout settings to transport |\n| Memory usage grows with large uploads | Body buffering | Profile memory usage during uploads | Implement streaming body forwarding |\n| Some headers missing in backend | Incomplete header copying | Compare request headers vs forwarded headers | Fix header copying logic |\n| Round-robin not working | Race condition in counter | Test with concurrent requests | Use atomic operations for counter |\n\n\n## Backend Pool Manager\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Round Robin Distribution), Milestone 3 (Health Checks), Milestone 4 (Additional Algorithms) — this component manages the collection of backend servers and provides the foundation for all load balancing algorithms and health monitoring\n\n### Mental Model: Team Roster\n\nThink of the backend pool manager as a sports team's roster management system. Just as a coach maintains a roster of players with their positions, capabilities, and current availability status, the backend pool manager maintains a collection of backend servers with their URLs, weights, and health states.\n\nWhen it's time to put a player in the game, the coach considers who's healthy, who's performing well, and what position needs to be filled. Similarly, when a request arrives, the backend pool manager considers which servers are healthy, which algorithm is active, and selects the most appropriate backend server. The coach tracks player statistics and injury status just as the pool manager tracks connection counts and health check results.\n\nThe roster can be updated mid-season as players are traded, injured, or recovered, and the backend pool can be updated during operation as servers are added, removed, or change health status. The key insight is that the roster manager provides a clean abstraction between the game strategy (load balancing algorithm) and the individual player management (backend server lifecycle).\n\n![Core Data Structures](./diagrams/data-model.svg)\n\nThe `BackendManager` serves as the central coordinator that bridges three critical concerns: maintaining the pool of available backend servers, tracking their health and connection states, and providing a clean interface for load balancing algorithms to select appropriate targets. This separation of concerns allows algorithms to focus purely on selection logic while the manager handles the operational complexities of backend lifecycle management.\n\n### Backend Registration\n\nBackend registration encompasses the entire lifecycle of adding, updating, and removing backend servers from the active pool. The registration process must handle both initial configuration loading and runtime updates while maintaining service availability and ensuring data consistency across concurrent operations.\n\nThe registration process begins with parsing and validating backend configurations. Each backend requires a valid URL that the load balancer can reach, along with optional parameters like weight for proportional distribution and connection limits for capacity management. The validation phase checks URL format, ensures uniqueness within the pool, and verifies that network connectivity is possible before adding the backend to the active rotation.\n\n| Registration Operation | Input Parameters | Validation Checks | Side Effects |\n|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| `AddBackend` | `BackendConfig` | URL format, uniqueness, connectivity | Creates `Backend` struct, initializes health state, adds to pool |\n| `RemoveBackend` | Backend ID string | Backend exists, handle active connections | Updates pool, waits for connection drain |\n| `UpdateBackend` | Backend ID, new config | Config validity, backward compatibility | Updates in-place, preserves health history |\n| `LoadBackends` | Configuration file/API | Bulk validation, dependency checks | Replaces entire pool atomically |\n\nThe `NewBackend` function transforms a `BackendConfig` into a fully initialized `Backend` struct with proper defaults and initial state. The backend receives a unique ID (typically a hash of the URL), atomic counters for connection tracking initialized to zero, and a fresh `HealthState` that assumes the backend is healthy until proven otherwise. The creation timestamp and metadata fields support monitoring and debugging scenarios.\n\nBackend removal requires careful coordination with active connections and ongoing health checks. The removal process first marks the backend as unavailable for new requests, then waits for existing connections to complete or timeout. Health checkers must be notified to stop monitoring the removed backend, and any algorithm-specific state (like weighted round-robin counters) needs cleanup to prevent memory leaks or stale references.\n\nRuntime updates to backend configuration present unique challenges because they must preserve operational history while applying new parameters. Weight changes for weighted algorithms require recalculating distribution ratios, while URL changes effectively create a new backend with fresh health state. The update process uses copy-on-write semantics to ensure atomic transitions that don't disrupt ongoing requests.\n\n> **Design Insight:** Backend registration uses optimistic concurrency control where operations assume success and handle conflicts during commit. This approach minimizes lock contention during high-traffic periods while ensuring consistency through atomic swap operations on the backend pool reference.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Backend Identification Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Use URL-based hash IDs for backend identification**\n> - **Context**: Need unique, stable identifiers for backends that survive configuration reloads and support efficient lookups\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Sequential integers (simple but not stable across restarts)\n>   - User-provided names (flexible but requires uniqueness validation)\n>   - URL-based hashes (stable and deterministic)\n> - **Decision**: Generate backend IDs using SHA-256 hash of the normalized URL\n> - **Rationale**: URL hashes provide stable identifiers that survive restarts, enable idempotent configuration reloads, and eliminate the need for explicit ID management. Hash collisions are extremely unlikely with SHA-256.\n> - **Consequences**: Backend IDs are deterministic and stable, but not human-readable. Debug scenarios require mapping IDs back to URLs, which the manager provides through lookup methods.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Sequential integers | Simple, compact, human-readable | Not stable across restarts, requires state persistence |\n| User-provided names | Human-readable, meaningful | Requires uniqueness validation, potential conflicts |\n| URL-based hashes | Stable, deterministic, no coordination needed | Not human-readable, potential for collisions |\n\n### Health State Tracking\n\nHealth state tracking maintains a comprehensive view of each backend's operational status through both active health checks and passive monitoring of request outcomes. The health state system implements a finite state machine with hysteresis to prevent rapid oscillations between healthy and unhealthy states that could destabilize request distribution.\n\nThe `HealthState` structure captures both current status and historical trends to support intelligent failover decisions. The consecutive success and failure counters implement the threshold-based state transitions that prevent single transient errors from removing healthy backends from rotation. The comprehensive timestamp tracking enables monitoring systems to understand health patterns and identify backends experiencing intermittent issues.\n\n| Health State Field | Type | Purpose | Update Trigger |\n|-------------------|------|---------|----------------|\n| `Healthy` | bool | Current availability status | State transition after threshold breach |\n| `ConsecutiveSuccesses` | int | Consecutive successful checks | Each successful health check |\n| `ConsecutiveFailures` | int | Consecutive failed checks | Each failed health check |\n| `LastCheckTime` | time.Time | Most recent health check attempt | Every health check start |\n| `LastSuccessTime` | time.Time | Most recent successful check | Successful health check completion |\n| `LastFailureTime` | time.Time | Most recent failed check | Failed health check completion |\n| `LastError` | string | Error message from last failure | Health check error occurrence |\n| `TotalChecks` | int64 | Lifetime health check count | Every health check attempt |\n| `TotalSuccesses` | int64 | Lifetime successful check count | Each successful health check |\n| `TotalFailures` | int64 | Lifetime failed check count | Each failed health check |\n| `StateChanges` | []HealthStateChange | History of state transitions | Healthy/unhealthy transitions |\n\n![Backend Health State Machine](./diagrams/backend-health-states.svg)\n\nThe state transition logic implements configurable thresholds to balance responsiveness with stability. When a healthy backend fails a health check, the consecutive failure counter increments while the consecutive success counter resets to zero. Only after reaching the `UnhealthyThreshold` does the backend transition to unhealthy state. The reverse process applies for recovery, requiring `HealthyThreshold` consecutive successes to restore the backend to healthy state.\n\nHealth state updates must be thread-safe because multiple goroutines may simultaneously process health check results, update connection counts, or read health status for request routing decisions. The `UpdateHealthState` method uses atomic operations for scalar fields and mutex protection for complex updates that modify multiple related fields.\n\nThe `RecordSuccess` and `RecordFailure` methods encapsulate the state transition logic and return boolean values indicating whether a state change occurred. This return value triggers notifications to other system components like metrics collectors or alerting systems that need to respond to backend availability changes.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Health State Persistence**\n\n> **Decision: Maintain health state only in memory with graceful startup behavior**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance fast health state updates with persistence requirements and system complexity\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - In-memory only (fast but loses history on restart)\n>   - Database persistence (durable but adds latency)\n>   - File-based snapshots (balance of performance and persistence)\n> - **Decision**: Keep health state in memory with intelligent startup behavior that assumes all backends are healthy initially\n> - **Rationale**: Health checks provide rapid feedback on actual backend status, making historical state less critical. In-memory storage eliminates persistence-related latency and complexity. Assuming healthy at startup is safer than assuming unhealthy (which could cause unnecessary downtime).\n> - **Consequences**: Fast health state operations with no I/O overhead, but system restart temporarily loses health history. Health checks quickly rebuild accurate state within one check interval.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| In-memory only | Fast updates, no I/O overhead, simple | Loses history on restart |\n| Database persistence | Durable, queryable history | Adds latency, complexity, dependencies |\n| File-based snapshots | Balanced approach, good for debugging | Still adds I/O overhead, snapshot timing issues |\n\n### Backend Selection Interface\n\nThe backend selection interface provides a clean abstraction that decouples load balancing algorithms from backend pool management. This abstraction allows algorithms to focus purely on selection logic while the manager handles filtering unhealthy backends, updating connection counts, and maintaining algorithm-agnostic operational concerns.\n\nThe core `Algorithm` interface defines the contract that all load balancing implementations must satisfy. The interface receives a slice of healthy backends and returns the selected backend, or nil if no suitable backend is available. This simple interface supports both stateless algorithms (like random selection) and stateful algorithms (like round-robin with counters) through the algorithm implementation's internal state management.\n\n| Interface Method | Parameters | Returns | Behavior Contract |\n|-----------------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `[]*Backend` (healthy backends only) | `*Backend` or nil | Must handle empty slice, return nil for no selection |\n| `Name` | none | string | Return human-readable algorithm name for logging/metrics |\n\nThe `BackendManager` orchestrates the selection process by first filtering the backend pool to include only healthy backends, then delegating to the active algorithm for the actual selection decision. This two-stage process ensures that algorithms never receive unhealthy backends and don't need to duplicate health checking logic across every algorithm implementation.\n\nThe selection workflow follows a consistent pattern across all algorithm types:\n\n1. The manager receives a request for backend selection from the HTTP proxy component\n2. It queries the current backend pool and filters out any backends marked as unhealthy\n3. If no healthy backends remain, it returns an error indicating service unavailability\n4. The filtered healthy backend list is passed to the active algorithm's `SelectBackend` method\n5. The algorithm applies its selection logic and returns the chosen backend\n6. The manager increments the selected backend's active connection counter atomically\n7. The selected backend is returned to the caller for request forwarding\n\nThe interface design supports runtime algorithm switching by allowing the manager to swap algorithm implementations without disrupting ongoing requests. Algorithm instances maintain their own internal state (like round-robin counters or least-connection tracking) independently of the backend pool, enabling clean separation of concerns.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Algorithm State Management**\n\n> **Decision: Algorithms maintain internal state with backend pool change notifications**\n> - **Context**: Load balancing algorithms need to track state (counters, connection counts) while the backend pool changes dynamically\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Stateless algorithms only (simple but limits algorithm types)\n>   - Manager-maintained algorithm state (centralized but tightly coupled)\n>   - Algorithm-internal state with notifications (flexible and decoupled)\n> - **Decision**: Algorithms maintain their own state and receive notifications when the backend pool changes\n> - **Rationale**: Different algorithms need different state (round-robin needs counters, least-connections needs connection tracking). Internal state keeps algorithms self-contained while notifications enable adaptation to pool changes.\n> - **Consequences**: Algorithms are more complex but also more flexible. Backend pool changes require notification broadcast, but this enables sophisticated algorithm behavior like weighted round-robin with smooth transitions.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Stateless algorithms only | Simple, no synchronization needed | Limits available algorithms, worse distribution quality |\n| Manager-maintained algorithm state | Centralized state management | Tight coupling, manager complexity grows with algorithms |\n| Algorithm-internal state | Flexible, self-contained algorithms | More complex algorithms, need change notifications |\n\nThe notification mechanism uses the observer pattern where algorithms can register for backend pool change events. When backends are added, removed, or change health status, the manager broadcasts notifications that allow algorithms to update their internal state accordingly. This approach maintains loose coupling while enabling stateful algorithm behavior.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nSeveral critical architecture decisions shape the backend pool manager's design and directly impact performance, maintainability, and operational characteristics. These decisions balance competing concerns like thread safety, performance, and operational flexibility.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Thread Safety Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Use fine-grained locking with atomic operations for hot paths**\n> - **Context**: Backend manager faces concurrent access from multiple goroutines handling requests, health checks updating status, and configuration changes\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Single global mutex (simple but serializes all access)\n>   - Read-write mutex for pool access (better than global mutex)\n>   - Fine-grained locking with atomics (complex but highest performance)\n> - **Decision**: Use atomic operations for connection counting, RWMutex for backend pool access, and separate mutexes for individual backend health state updates\n> - **Rationale**: Hot path operations (backend selection, connection counting) need minimal latency. Read-heavy workloads benefit from RWMutex allowing concurrent reads. Health state updates are infrequent and can use individual backend locks to avoid blocking pool access.\n> - **Consequences**: Higher performance under concurrent load but increased implementation complexity. Need careful lock ordering to prevent deadlocks during operations that affect multiple backends.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Single global mutex | Simple, no deadlock risk | Serializes all access, poor performance |\n| Read-write mutex for pool | Better read performance | Still serializes writes, health updates block reads |\n| Fine-grained locking | Highest performance, targeted synchronization | Complex, potential deadlock scenarios |\n\n**Architecture Decision: Configuration Update Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Implement atomic backend pool replacement with graceful connection draining**\n> - **Context**: Configuration updates must not drop existing connections while ensuring new requests use updated backend pool\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Stop-and-restart (simple but causes downtime)\n>   - Incremental updates (complex coordination)\n>   - Atomic pool replacement (clean but requires connection tracking)\n> - **Decision**: Replace the entire backend pool atomically while tracking connections to removed backends\n> - **Rationale**: Atomic replacement eliminates complex state reconciliation and ensures consistent view of backend pool. Connection tracking enables graceful shutdown of removed backends without dropping active requests.\n> - **Consequences**: Configuration updates are clean and atomic, but require sophisticated connection tracking. Memory usage temporarily increases during transitions as both old and new backend pools exist simultaneously.\n\n![Configuration Hot Reload Sequence](./diagrams/configuration-update.svg)\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Stop-and-restart | Simple, guaranteed consistency | Service downtime, lost connections |\n| Incremental updates | No service interruption | Complex state reconciliation, potential inconsistencies |\n| Atomic pool replacement | Clean semantics, no inconsistent state | Requires connection tracking, temporary memory overhead |\n\n**Architecture Decision: Backend Pool Storage Structure**\n\n> **Decision: Use concurrent-safe map with slice snapshot for algorithm selection**\n> - **Context**: Need efficient backend lookup by ID for health updates while providing algorithm-friendly iteration interface\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Slice only (simple iteration but O(n) lookups)\n>   - Map only (fast lookups but poor algorithm interface)\n>   - Map with slice snapshots (best of both but requires synchronization)\n> - **Decision**: Maintain backends in a concurrent map with periodic slice snapshots for algorithm selection\n> - **Rationale**: Map enables O(1) backend lookup for health updates and configuration changes. Slice snapshots provide algorithms with stable, consistent views of the backend pool without holding locks during selection logic.\n> - **Consequences**: Fast lookups and algorithm-friendly interface, but requires careful snapshot management and slightly increased memory usage for snapshot storage.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Slice only | Simple, good for algorithms | O(n) lookups for health updates |\n| Map only | Fast lookups, efficient updates | Poor interface for algorithm iteration |\n| Map with slice snapshots | Fast lookups and good algorithm interface | More complex, requires snapshot synchronization |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nBackend pool management involves several subtle concurrency and state management challenges that frequently cause issues for developers implementing load balancers. Understanding these pitfalls and their solutions prevents common bugs that can cause request failures or system instability.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Connection Counting**\n\nThe most frequent error occurs when multiple goroutines simultaneously modify backend connection counters without proper synchronization. This typically happens when request handlers increment the connection count when selecting a backend, then later decrement it in a deferred function, but use non-atomic operations for the counter updates.\n\nThe symptom appears as connection counts that become negative or grow without bounds, leading to incorrect least-connections algorithm behavior. Backends may show impossibly high connection counts that never decrease, or negative counts that confuse the selection logic.\n\nThe fix requires using atomic operations for all connection counter modifications. The `IncrementConnections` and `DecrementConnections` methods must use `atomic.AddInt64` to ensure thread-safe updates. Additionally, ensure that every increment has a corresponding decrement, typically using deferred function calls that execute even when request processing encounters errors.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Backend Pool Views During Updates**\n\nConfiguration updates can create scenarios where different parts of the system see different versions of the backend pool simultaneously. This happens when the pool update process modifies the backend map incrementally while other goroutines are reading from it, leading to partially updated views.\n\nSymptoms include algorithms selecting backends that no longer exist, health checkers monitoring removed backends, or new backends not appearing in selection rotation despite successful configuration updates. Error logs may show \"backend not found\" errors during request forwarding.\n\nThe solution uses atomic pointer swaps for the entire backend pool. Store the backend map in an atomic pointer value, create a complete new map during updates, then atomically swap the pointer. This ensures all readers see either the complete old state or the complete new state, never a mixed view.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health State Update Ordering**\n\nHealth state updates from multiple concurrent health checks can arrive out of order, causing newer health check results to be overwritten by older results. This occurs when network delays cause health check responses to arrive in different order than they were sent, particularly under high load or network congestion.\n\nThe manifestation includes backends that appear to randomly flip between healthy and unhealthy states, health statistics that don't match actual check timing, and backends that remain unhealthy despite successful checks. The `LastCheckTime` field may show timestamps that move backward.\n\nPrevention requires adding sequence numbers or timestamps to health check operations and ignoring updates that are older than the current health state timestamp. The `RecordSuccess` and `RecordFailure` methods should verify that the update timestamp is newer than `LastCheckTime` before applying changes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Empty Backend Pool Handling**\n\nAlgorithms often fail to handle the case where no healthy backends are available, either returning nil pointers that cause panics or attempting to perform modulo operations with zero divisors. This scenario occurs during startup, configuration updates, or when all backends fail simultaneously.\n\nSymptoms include application crashes with division by zero errors, null pointer dereferences during request forwarding, or infinite loops in selection algorithms that assume at least one backend exists.\n\nThe robust solution implements graceful degradation at multiple layers. The `GetHealthyBackends` method should document that it can return empty slices. Algorithm `SelectBackend` methods must check for empty input and return nil gracefully. The HTTP proxy component should handle nil backend selection by returning 503 Service Unavailable responses rather than crashing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Algorithm State**\n\nStateful algorithms like weighted round-robin or least connections can accumulate state for backends that have been removed from the pool. This occurs when algorithms maintain internal maps or counters keyed by backend ID but don't clean up when backends are removed.\n\nThe memory leak grows over time as backends are added and removed during configuration updates, particularly in dynamic environments where backend pools change frequently. Memory usage increases monotonically, and algorithm state may reference deleted backends indefinitely.\n\nThe fix implements proper cleanup notifications where the backend manager sends removal events to all registered algorithms. Algorithms must implement cleanup logic that removes internal state for deleted backends. Using weak references or timeout-based cleanup can provide additional safety against leaked state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check State Inconsistency During Algorithm Selection**\n\nBackend health state can change between the time an algorithm selects a backend and when the request is forwarded to it. This race condition occurs when health checks update backend state to unhealthy just after the algorithm selection but before request forwarding begins.\n\nThe result is requests sent to backends that are known to be unhealthy, causing unnecessary request failures and poor user experience. Error rates increase despite the health checking system functioning correctly.\n\nThe solution implements last-moment health validation in the HTTP proxy component immediately before forwarding requests. If the selected backend becomes unhealthy between selection and forwarding, the proxy can either retry with a new selection or return an appropriate error response. This adds a small latency cost but prevents forwarding to known-bad backends.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe backend pool manager bridges abstract load balancing concepts with concrete implementation concerns like thread safety, state management, and configuration updates.

Hints\n\n**Go-Specific Patterns:**\n- Use `sync.RWMutex` for backend pool access with frequent reads and infrequent writes\n- Implement atomic backend slice updates using `atomic.Value` to avoid holding locks during algorithm selection\n- Use `sync.Once` for lazy initialization of health checkers and algorithm instances\n- Implement graceful shutdown using context cancellation and `sync.WaitGroup` for cleanup coordination\n\n**Thread Safety Guidelines:**\n- All connection count operations must use `sync/atomic` functions\n- Backend health state updates need individual mutexes per backend to avoid blocking pool operations\n- Use copy-on-write semantics for backend slice updates to provide consistent algorithm views\n- Implement lock ordering (pool mutex before individual backend mutexes) to prevent deadlocks\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the backend pool manager, verify the following behavior:\n\n**Basic Functionality Test:**\n```bash\ngo test ./internal/backend/... -v\n```\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n1. Create a test configuration with 3 backend servers\n2. Start the backend manager and verify all backends are loaded\n3. Query `GetHealthyBackends()` and confirm all 3 backends are returned\n4. Simulate a backend failure by updating health state\n5. Verify `GetHealthyBackends()` now returns only 2 backends\n6. Add a new backend via configuration reload\n7. Confirm the new backend appears in the healthy backend list\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- Backend creation should generate stable, unique IDs for each URL\n- Connection counting should remain accurate under concurrent access\n- Health state updates should not block backend selection operations\n- Configuration reloads should not drop existing connections\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- Race condition warnings from `go test -race`\n- Connection counts that become negative or grow without bounds\n- Backends that remain in healthy list despite being marked unhealthy\n- Panics during concurrent access to backend pool or health state\n\nThis checkpoint ensures the backend pool manager provides a solid foundation for implementing load balancing algorithms and health checking in subsequent milestones.\n\n\n## Load Balancing Algorithms\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Round Robin Distribution), Milestone 4 (Additional Algorithms) — this section implements the core algorithms that determine how requests are distributed across backend servers\n\n### Mental Model: Traffic Director\n\nImagine you're a traffic director at a busy intersection with multiple roads leading to the same destination. Each road represents a backend server, and every car represents an incoming HTTP request. Your job is to decide which road each car should take to reach their destination efficiently.\n\nJust as a traffic director has different strategies for routing vehicles, a load balancer employs various algorithms to distribute requests. You might use **round-robin routing** like a simple traffic light that cycles through each road in turn, ensuring equal opportunity for all routes. For **weighted distribution**, imagine some roads are highways while others are small streets — you'd send more cars down the highways because they can handle more traffic. With **least-busy routing**, you'd count how many cars are currently on each road and direct new cars to the emptiest route. For **consistent routing**, you might assign specific types of vehicles (delivery trucks, emergency vehicles) to always use the same road to maintain familiarity and efficiency.\n\nEach strategy has trade-offs. Round-robin is simple but doesn't account for road capacity differences. Least-busy routing is dynamic but requires constant monitoring. Consistent routing provides predictability but might create uneven distribution if certain vehicle types are more common. As a traffic director, you need to understand these trade-offs and choose the right strategy for your specific intersection's needs.\n\n### Round Robin Algorithm\n\nThe **round-robin algorithm** represents the simplest and most intuitive approach to load balancing. It operates like a circular queue, selecting each backend server in sequential order and cycling back to the first server after reaching the last one. This algorithm ensures that over time, each backend receives an approximately equal number of requests, regardless of their processing speed or current load.\n\nThe core challenge in implementing round-robin lies in maintaining thread safety when multiple goroutines simultaneously select backends. The algorithm maintains a shared counter that tracks the next backend to select, but this counter must be incremented atomically to prevent race conditions that could lead to uneven distribution or incorrect selections.\n\n**Algorithm Implementation Logic:**\n\n1. **Counter Management**: Maintain an atomic counter that tracks the next backend index to select from the healthy backend pool\n2. **Atomic Increment**: Use atomic operations to increment the counter and retrieve the current value in a single, thread-safe operation\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Apply modulo arithmetic to wrap the counter around to zero when it exceeds the number of available backends\n4. **Health Filtering**: Only consider backends that are currently marked as healthy by the health checking system\n5. **Empty Pool Handling**: Return an error or nil when no healthy backends are available for selection\n6. **Index Validation**: Ensure the calculated index is within the bounds of the current healthy backend slice\n\nThe round-robin algorithm maintains fairness by treating all healthy backends equally, without considering their current load, processing capacity, or response times. This simplicity makes it highly predictable and easy to debug, but it may not be optimal when backend servers have different capabilities or when request processing times vary significantly.\n\n| Round Robin State | Field | Type | Description |\n|------------------|-------|------|-------------|\n| Counter | `counter` | `*int64` | Atomic counter tracking next backend index to select |\n| LastSelected | `lastSelected` | `*Backend` | Reference to the most recently selected backend for debugging |\n| SelectionCount | `selectionCount` | `*int64` | Total number of backend selections performed since startup |\n\n| Round Robin Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|---------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `backends []*Backend` | `*Backend` | Selects next backend using round-robin algorithm |\n| `Name` | none | `string` | Returns \"round_robin\" as algorithm identifier |\n| `Reset` | none | `error` | Resets internal counter to zero for testing |\n| `GetStats` | none | `map[string]int64` | Returns selection count and current counter value |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The round-robin algorithm's strength lies in its predictability and simplicity. Unlike more complex algorithms, its behavior is completely deterministic given the same sequence of healthy backends, making it ideal for testing and debugging load balancer behavior.\n\n**Atomic Counter Implementation Details:**\n\nThe atomic counter implementation requires careful attention to integer overflow and wrap-around behavior. When the counter approaches the maximum value for `int64`, it should wrap around to zero gracefully without causing panics or negative indices. The modulo operation naturally handles this wrap-around, but the implementation must ensure that the modulo operand (number of backends) is never zero.\n\n**Thread Safety Considerations:**\n\nMultiple goroutines calling `SelectBackend` simultaneously must receive different backends when possible. The atomic increment operation ensures that each goroutine gets a unique counter value, preventing duplicate selections. However, the healthy backend slice itself may change between the atomic increment and the actual backend selection, requiring careful handling of race conditions where backends are added or removed during selection.\n\n**Example Round-Robin Selection Sequence:**\n\nConsider a load balancer with three healthy backends: Backend-A, Backend-B, and Backend-C. The selection sequence proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Request 1: Counter=0, 0 % 3 = 0, selects Backend-A, increment counter to 1\n2. Request 2: Counter=1, 1 % 3 = 1, selects Backend-B, increment counter to 2  \n3. Request 3: Counter=2, 2 % 3 = 2, selects Backend-C, increment counter to 3\n4. Request 4: Counter=3, 3 % 3 = 0, selects Backend-A, increment counter to 4\n5. Request 5: Counter=4, 4 % 3 = 1, selects Backend-B, increment counter to 5\n\nThis pattern continues indefinitely, ensuring each backend receives every third request in a predictable cycle.\n\n![Round Robin Selection Flow](./diagrams/round-robin-algorithm.svg)\n\n### Weighted Round Robin Algorithm\n\nThe **weighted round-robin algorithm** extends basic round-robin by allowing administrators to assign different weights to backend servers, enabling proportional traffic distribution based on server capacity, performance, or cost considerations. A backend with weight 3 receives three times as many requests as a backend with weight 1 over a sufficient number of selections.\n\nThe challenge in weighted round-robin lies in achieving smooth distribution that avoids sending consecutive requests to high-weight backends. A naive implementation might select a weight-3 backend three times in a row before moving to the next server, creating bursty traffic patterns. The smooth weighted round-robin algorithm addresses this by gradually distributing weighted selections across time.\n\n**Smooth Weighted Round Robin Logic:**\n\nThe algorithm maintains a current weight for each backend that starts at zero and increases by the backend's configured weight on each selection round. The backend with the highest current weight is selected, and its current weight is then decreased by the sum of all backend weights. This approach ensures that high-weight backends are selected more frequently but not consecutively.\n\n1. **Weight Initialization**: Set each backend's current weight to zero at algorithm startup\n2. **Weight Calculation**: In each selection round, increase each backend's current weight by its configured weight\n3. **Maximum Selection**: Select the backend with the highest current weight value\n4. **Weight Adjustment**: Decrease the selected backend's current weight by the total weight sum of all backends\n5. **Health Filtering**: Only consider backends that are currently healthy for weight calculations\n6. **Zero Weight Handling**: Treat backends with zero or negative weights as having weight 1 to prevent exclusion\n\n| Weighted Round Robin State | Field | Type | Description |\n|---------------------------|-------|------|-------------|\n| BackendWeights | `backendWeights` | `map[string]int` | Configured weight for each backend by ID |\n| CurrentWeights | `currentWeights` | `map[string]int` | Current weight values used for selection |\n| TotalWeight | `totalWeight` | `int` | Sum of all configured backend weights |\n| WeightMutex | `weightMutex` | `sync.RWMutex` | Protects weight maps from concurrent access |\n\n| Weighted Round Robin Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-----------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `backends []*Backend` | `*Backend` | Selects backend using smooth weighted algorithm |\n| `UpdateWeights` | `weights map[string]int` | `error` | Updates backend weights with validation |\n| `GetCurrentWeights` | none | `map[string]int` | Returns current weight values for debugging |\n| `ResetWeights` | none | `error` | Resets all current weights to zero |\n\n**Smooth Distribution Example:**\n\nConsider three backends with weights: A=5, B=1, C=1 (total weight = 7). The selection sequence demonstrates smooth distribution:\n\n| Round | A Current | B Current | C Current | Selected | A After | B After | C After |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | A (max) | -2 (5-7) | 1 | 1 |\n| 2 | 3 (-2+5) | 2 (1+1) | 2 (1+1) | A (max) | -4 (3-7) | 2 | 2 |\n| 3 | 1 (-4+5) | 3 (2+1) | 3 (2+1) | B or C | 1 | -4 or 3 | 3 or -4 |\n| 4 | 6 (1+5) | -3 or 4 | 4 or -3 | A (max) | -1 (6-7) | same | same |\n\nThis pattern ensures Backend A receives approximately 5/7 of requests while Backends B and C each receive 1/7, but the selections are distributed smoothly rather than in bursts.\n\n> **Decision: Smooth Weighted Round Robin vs Simple Weighted Round Robin**\n> - **Context**: Need to distribute requests proportionally while avoiding traffic bursts to high-weight backends\n> - **Options Considered**: Simple weighted (repeat selections), Smooth weighted (gradual distribution), Random weighted (probabilistic)\n> - **Decision**: Implement smooth weighted round-robin algorithm\n> - **Rationale**: Provides proportional distribution without creating request bursts, better for backend stability and performance\n> - **Consequences**: More complex state management but significantly better traffic smoothness and backend resource utilization\n\n### Least Connections Algorithm\n\nThe **least connections algorithm** selects the backend server currently handling the fewest active connections, making it responsive to actual backend load rather than just request count. This algorithm excels when request processing times vary significantly or when backends have different processing capacities, as it naturally routes new requests to less busy servers.\n\nThe algorithm requires accurate tracking of active connection counts for each backend server. A connection becomes active when a request is forwarded to a backend and remains active until the response is completely returned to the client. This tracking must be thread-safe and atomic to prevent race conditions that could lead to incorrect connection counts.\n\n**Connection Tracking Implementation:**\n\n1. **Increment on Request**: Atomically increment the backend's active connection count when forwarding a request\n2. **Decrement on Response**: Atomically decrement the count when the response is fully processed, regardless of success or failure\n3. **Error Handling**: Ensure connection counts are decremented even when backend requests fail or time out\n4. **Cleanup on Backend Removal**: Reset connection counts when backends are removed from the pool\n5. **Recovery on Startup**: Initialize all connection counts to zero when the load balancer starts up\n6. **Overflow Protection**: Handle potential integer overflow in connection counters gracefully\n\n| Least Connections State | Field | Type | Description |\n|--------------------------|-------|------|-------------|\n| ConnectionCounts | `connectionCounts` | `map[string]*int64` | Active connection count for each backend by ID |\n| CounterMutex | `counterMutex` | `sync.RWMutex` | Protects connection count map from concurrent access |\n| MaxConnections | `maxConnections` | `map[string]int` | Maximum allowed connections per backend |\n\n| Least Connections Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|---------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `backends []*Backend` | `*Backend` | Selects backend with fewest active connections |\n| `IncrementConnections` | `backendID string` | `int64` | Atomically increments connection count for backend |\n| `DecrementConnections` | `backendID string` | `int64` | Atomically decrements connection count for backend |\n| `GetConnectionCounts` | none | `map[string]int64` | Returns current connection counts for all backends |\n\n**Selection Logic with Tie Breaking:**\n\nWhen multiple backends have the same lowest connection count, the algorithm needs a consistent tie-breaking strategy. Common approaches include selecting the first backend encountered, using round-robin among tied backends, or selecting randomly. The choice impacts load distribution when many backends are idle or when connection counts frequently tie.\n\n**Connection Count Synchronization:**\n\nThe critical challenge lies in ensuring that connection count increments and decrements are properly paired and that counts accurately reflect reality. Network failures, timeout errors, and client disconnections can all cause situations where a connection count might become permanently incorrect if not handled properly.\n\n**Example Selection with Varying Loads:**\n\nConsider three backends with current active connections: A=5, B=2, C=8. A new request arrives:\n\n1. **Evaluation**: Backend B has the fewest connections (2)\n2. **Selection**: Choose Backend B for the new request\n3. **Increment**: Backend B's count becomes 3 (atomically)\n4. **Processing**: Request is forwarded to Backend B\n5. **Completion**: When Backend B responds, decrement count back to 2\n\nIf Backend B fails to respond or times out, the decrement operation must still occur to prevent connection count drift.\n\n**Handling Maximum Connection Limits:**\n\nAdvanced implementations can respect per-backend maximum connection limits, skipping backends that have reached their connection capacity even if they currently have the fewest connections. This prevents overloading backends and provides graceful degradation when backends approach their processing limits.\n\n### IP Hash Algorithm\n\nThe **IP hash algorithm** provides **session affinity** by consistently routing requests from the same client IP address to the same backend server. This algorithm is essential for applications that maintain server-side session state, shopping carts, or user authentication tokens that are not shared across backend servers.\n\nThe algorithm computes a hash value from the client's IP address and uses modulo arithmetic to map this hash to a specific backend server. The key requirement is consistency — the same IP address must always map to the same backend server as long as the backend pool remains unchanged.\n\n**Hash Function Selection and Properties:**\n\n1. **Deterministic**: The same IP address must always produce the same hash value\n2. **Uniform Distribution**: Hash values should be evenly distributed across the output space to prevent clustering\n3. **Fast Computation**: Hash calculation should be computationally efficient for high-throughput scenarios\n4. **Collision Handling**: Different IP addresses may hash to the same value, which is acceptable with modulo mapping\n\n| IP Hash State | Field | Type | Description |\n|---------------|-------|------|-------------|\n| HashSeed | `hashSeed` | `uint64` | Random seed for hash function to prevent prediction |\n| BackendMapping | `backendMapping` | `map[string]string` | Cache of IP-to-backend mappings for debugging |\n| ConsistencyMode | `consistencyMode` | `string` | Algorithm variant: \"simple\" or \"consistent_hash\" |\n\n| IP Hash Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|----------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `backends []*Backend, clientIP string` | `*Backend` | Selects backend based on client IP hash |\n| `HashIP` | `ip string` | `uint64` | Computes hash value for given IP address |\n| `GetIPMapping` | `ip string` | `string` | Returns backend ID that IP would map to |\n| `ClearMappingCache` | none | `error` | Clears IP mapping cache for memory management |\n\n**Simple Hash Implementation Logic:**\n\n1. **IP Address Parsing**: Extract the client IP from the request, handling both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n2. **Hash Computation**: Apply a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or FNV) to the IP address bytes\n3. **Modulo Mapping**: Use modulo arithmetic to map the hash value to a backend index\n4. **Health Validation**: Ensure the selected backend is currently healthy, fallback to round-robin if unhealthy\n5. **IPv6 Handling**: Normalize IPv6 addresses to handle different representation formats consistently\n\n**Consistent Hashing Alternative:**\n\nFor environments where backends are frequently added or removed, simple modulo hashing causes significant remapping when the backend count changes. Consistent hashing algorithms minimize this disruption by maintaining most existing IP-to-backend mappings when backends change.\n\n**Example IP Hashing Sequence:**\n\nClient IP addresses map consistently to backends:\n- IP 192.168.1.100: hash(IP) = 12345, 12345 % 3 = 0, maps to Backend-A\n- IP 192.168.1.101: hash(IP) = 67890, 67890 % 3 = 1, maps to Backend-B  \n- IP 192.168.1.102: hash(IP) = 24680, 24680 % 3 = 2, maps to Backend-C\n- IP 192.168.1.100: (later request) maps to Backend-A again (consistent)\n\n**Session Affinity Considerations:**\n\nSession affinity creates an inherent trade-off with load distribution. If certain IP addresses generate significantly more traffic than others, the load becomes uneven across backends. The algorithm may need fallback mechanisms when a client's designated backend becomes unhealthy, temporarily breaking session affinity to maintain service availability.\n\n> **Design Insight**: IP hash algorithms must balance session consistency with load distribution fairness. In practice, many deployments use IP hashing only when session affinity is required and fall back to other algorithms when all backend servers are stateless.\n\n### Random Selection Algorithm\n\nThe **random selection algorithm** provides the simplest statistical approach to load balancing by selecting backends with equal probability using a cryptographically secure random number generator. While seemingly naive, random selection often achieves surprisingly good load distribution with minimal state management overhead.\n\nRandom selection shines in scenarios where request processing times are relatively uniform and backend capabilities are similar. Over a large number of requests, the law of large numbers ensures that each backend receives approximately equal traffic, but short-term distribution may be uneven compared to round-robin.\n\n**Random Selection Implementation:**\n\n1. **Random Number Generation**: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator seeded at startup\n2. **Range Scaling**: Scale the random number to the range [0, number_of_healthy_backends)\n3. **Index Selection**: Use the scaled random number as an index into the healthy backend slice\n4. **Health Filtering**: Only include currently healthy backends in the selection pool\n5. **Thread Safety**: Ensure the random number generator is safe for concurrent access across goroutines\n\n| Random Selection State | Field | Type | Description |\n|------------------------|-------|------|-------------|\n| RandomGenerator | `rng` | `*rand.Rand` | Seeded random number generator instance |\n| GeneratorMutex | `rngMutex` | `sync.Mutex` | Protects random generator from concurrent access |\n| SelectionHistory | `history` | `[]string` | Recent backend selections for debugging/testing |\n\n| Random Selection Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `SelectBackend` | `backends []*Backend` | `*Backend` | Randomly selects a backend from healthy pool |\n| `SetSeed` | `seed int64` | `error` | Sets random number generator seed for testing |\n| `GetDistribution` | `window int` | `map[string]int` | Returns selection counts over recent window |\n\n**Statistical Distribution Properties:**\n\nRandom selection provides several valuable statistical properties. The variance in backend selection decreases as the number of requests increases, following the central limit theorem. For N backends and R requests, each backend receives approximately R/N requests with a standard deviation of sqrt(R * (1/N) * (1 - 1/N)).\n\n**Advantages of Random Selection:**\n\n- **Stateless**: No counters, weights, or connection tracking required\n- **Simple**: Minimal code complexity and fewer edge cases to handle  \n- **Scalable**: Performance doesn't degrade as the number of backends increases\n- **Resilient**: No state corruption possible during backend pool changes\n\n**Example Random Distribution:**\n\nOver 1000 requests to 3 backends, random selection might produce:\n- Backend-A: 334 requests (33.4%)\n- Backend-B: 329 requests (32.9%) \n- Backend-C: 337 requests (33.7%)\n\nWhile not perfectly even like round-robin, this distribution is acceptable for most applications and required no state synchronization.\n\n**Cryptographically Secure Randomness:**\n\nThe random number generator should be seeded with a cryptographically secure source to prevent predictable selection patterns that could be exploited for denial-of-service attacks. However, the generator itself need not be cryptographically secure since load balancing decisions are not security-sensitive.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\n> **Decision: Algorithm Interface Design**\n> - **Context**: Need a common interface that supports multiple load balancing algorithms with different state requirements and parameters\n> - **Options Considered**: Single method interface, Strategy pattern with factory, Plugin-based architecture\n> - **Decision**: Implement Strategy pattern with common `Algorithm` interface containing `SelectBackend` and `Name` methods\n> - **Rationale**: Strategy pattern allows runtime algorithm switching while keeping implementation details encapsulated within each algorithm\n> - **Consequences**: Enables easy addition of new algorithms and runtime reconfiguration, but requires careful handling of algorithm-specific state\n\n| Algorithm Interface Options | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|---------|\n| Single Method Interface | Simple to implement and use | Cannot handle algorithm-specific configuration or state | No |\n| Strategy Pattern | Clean separation, runtime switching, extensible | Slightly more complex state management | **Yes** |\n| Plugin Architecture | Ultimate flexibility, external algorithms possible | Complex loading, versioning, and security concerns | No |\n\n> **Decision: Algorithm State Management**\n> - **Context**: Algorithms need to maintain state (counters, weights, connection counts) that must be thread-safe and persistent across requests\n> - **Options Considered**: Global shared state, Per-algorithm state encapsulation, Stateless algorithms only\n> - **Decision**: Encapsulate state within each algorithm implementation using appropriate synchronization primitives\n> - **Rationale**: Encapsulation prevents state conflicts between algorithms and allows each to optimize its synchronization strategy\n> - **Consequences**: Each algorithm manages its own thread safety, but state is isolated and easier to reason about\n\n> **Decision: Runtime Algorithm Switching**\n> - **Context**: Administrators need to change load balancing algorithms without restarting the load balancer or dropping connections\n> - **Options Considered**: Restart required, Graceful transition, Immediate switch, Dual-algorithm mode\n> - **Decision**: Implement immediate switching with state preservation where possible\n> - **Rationale**: Immediate switching provides operational flexibility without service disruption, most algorithm state can be safely discarded\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rapid response to changing traffic patterns but may cause temporary distribution irregularities during transitions\n\n**Algorithm Selection Strategy:**\n\nThe load balancer supports runtime selection of the active algorithm through configuration updates. When switching algorithms, the system preserves connection counts (for least connections) but resets algorithm-specific state like round-robin counters and weighted round-robin current weights.\n\n| Algorithm Switching | Current State | New Algorithm | State Handling |\n|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Round Robin → Weighted | Counter reset | Weights initialized | Smooth transition |\n| Least Connections → Round Robin | Connections preserved | Counter starts at 0 | Distribution temporarily uneven |\n| IP Hash → Random | Mappings cleared | No state needed | Immediate random selection |\n| Any → Least Connections | State varies | Connection tracking starts | Gradual accuracy improvement |\n\n**Thread Safety Architecture:**\n\nEach algorithm implementation manages its own thread safety using appropriate synchronization primitives. Atomic operations are preferred for simple counters, while mutexes protect complex data structures like weight maps and connection count tables.\n\n**Algorithm Performance Characteristics:**\n\n| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Thread Contention | Best Use Case |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Round Robin | O(1) | O(1) | Low (atomic counter) | Uniform requests, equal backends |\n| Weighted Round Robin | O(n) backends | O(n) state | Medium (mutex) | Different backend capacities |\n| Least Connections | O(n) comparison | O(n) counters | High (frequent updates) | Variable request processing times |\n| IP Hash | O(1) hash + O(1) select | O(1) | Low (stateless) | Session affinity required |\n| Random | O(1) | O(1) | Low (minimal state) | Simple, stateless applications |\n\n![Request Processing Sequence](./diagrams/request-flow.svg)\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Round Robin Counter Race Conditions**\n\nA common mistake is using non-atomic operations to increment the round-robin counter, leading to race conditions where multiple goroutines read the same counter value and select the same backend simultaneously. This breaks the even distribution guarantee.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Non-atomic counter increments create race conditions where two concurrent requests might get the same counter value, causing uneven distribution and potentially overloading specific backends.\n\n**How to fix**: Use `atomic.AddInt64()` to both read and increment the counter in a single atomic operation:\n```go\n// Wrong: Race condition possible\nnextIndex := rr.counter\nrr.counter = (rr.counter + 1) % len(backends)\n\n// Correct: Atomic operation\nnextIndex := atomic.AddInt64(&rr.counter, 1) % int64(len(backends))\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Weighted Round Robin Integer Overflow**\n\nWeighted round-robin implementations often fail to handle integer overflow when current weights grow large over time. With high weights and many requests, current weight values can exceed integer limits and wrap to negative numbers.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Integer overflow causes current weights to become negative, breaking the weight comparison logic and potentially causing panics or incorrect selections.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement weight normalization that resets all current weights to their relative positions when approaching overflow limits, or use larger integer types with overflow detection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Least Connections Count Drift**\n\nFailing to properly decrement connection counts when requests complete, fail, or time out leads to connection count drift where backends appear permanently busy even when idle.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Connection counts that drift upward prevent backends from receiving new requests, eventually making them appear overloaded when they're actually idle.\n\n**How to fix**: Use defer statements to ensure connection counts are decremented regardless of how request processing completes:\n```go\n// Increment when starting request\natomic.AddInt64(backend.ActiveConnections, 1)\n\n// Always decrement on completion\ndefer atomic.AddInt64(backend.ActiveConnections, -1)\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: IP Hash Inconsistency After Backend Changes**\n\nSimple IP hash implementations using modulo arithmetic produce completely different mappings when backends are added or removed, breaking session affinity for most clients.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: When backend count changes, modulo arithmetic causes most IP addresses to map to different backends, losing session state and breaking user experience.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement consistent hashing or provide graceful degradation where IP hash falls back to other algorithms when backend pool changes are detected.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Hash Function Predictability**\n\nUsing simple hash functions or predictable seeds makes the IP hash algorithm vulnerable to deliberate traffic concentration attacks where attackers generate requests from IP addresses that all hash to the same backend.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Predictable hashing allows malicious clients to concentrate traffic on specific backends, creating denial-of-service conditions.\n\n**How to fix**: Use cryptographically secure hash functions with random seeds that change on each load balancer restart, and consider rate limiting per-IP to prevent concentration attacks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Algorithm State Not Cleared on Pool Changes**\n\nWhen the backend pool changes (servers added/removed), algorithm state like round-robin counters and weight mappings may contain references to invalid backends or incorrect indices.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Stale algorithm state can cause index out-of-bounds errors, selections of non-existent backends, or skewed distribution patterns.\n\n**How to fix**: Reset algorithm state when backend pool changes are detected, or implement algorithms that validate backend references before selection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: No Healthy Backends Handling**\n\nAlgorithms often fail to handle the case where no backends are currently healthy, leading to panics, infinite loops, or incorrect error responses.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: When all backends are unhealthy, selection algorithms may panic on empty slices or return nil pointers that cause segmentation faults.\n\n**How to fix**: Always check for empty or nil backend slices before selection and return appropriate errors or default responses when no backends are available.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe load balancing algorithms form the decision-making core of the load balancer, determining how incoming requests are distributed across available backend servers. Each algorithm optimizes for different traffic patterns and operational requirements.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

algorithms based on your specific requirements:\n\n- **Round Robin**: Use when backends are identical and request processing times are uniform\n- **Weighted Round Robin**: Use when backends have different capacities or you want to favor certain servers\n- **Least Connections**: Use when request processing times vary significantly or during long-polling/websocket scenarios  \n- **IP Hash**: Use when you need session affinity and backend servers maintain client-specific state\n- **Random**: Use for simple stateless applications where you want minimal overhead\n\n**Language-Specific Implementation Hints:**\n\nFor Go implementations:\n- Use `sync/atomic` for all counter operations to ensure thread safety\n- Prefer `sync.RWMutex` over `sync.Mutex` for read-heavy operations like backend selection\n- Use `crypto/rand` for cryptographically secure random number generation in production\n- Consider using `sync.Pool` for frequently allocated temporary objects in high-throughput scenarios\n- Handle integer overflow explicitly in weighted algorithms using checked arithmetic\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint (Milestone 2: Round Robin Distribution):**\n\nAfter implementing round-robin selection:\n\n1. **Start the load balancer** with multiple backend servers configured\n2. **Send 100 test requests** using a tool like curl or ab: `for i in {1..100}; do curl http://localhost:8080/test; done`\n3. **Check backend logs** to verify each backend received approximately 33-34 requests (for 3 backends)\n4. **Verify thread safety** by running concurrent requests: `ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/test`\n5. **Expected behavior**: Request distribution should be even (within ±5%) and no race conditions should occur\n\nSigns something is wrong:\n- **Uneven distribution**: Check for race conditions in counter increment\n- **Panic on empty backends**: Add nil/empty slice checks\n- **Same backend always selected**: Verify modulo operation and counter increment\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint (Milestone 4: Additional Algorithms):**\n\nAfter implementing all algorithms:\n\n1. **Test algorithm switching**: Change configuration from round_robin to weighted_round_robin and reload\n2. **Verify weighted distribution**: Configure backends with weights 3:2:1 and confirm proportional traffic\n3. **Test session affinity**: Use IP hash and verify the same client IP always hits the same backend  \n4. **Test least connections**: Start backends with different response delays and verify faster backends get more requests\n5. **Performance test**: Run `ab -n 10000 -c 100` to test under load\n\nExpected results:\n- **Algorithm switching** works without dropping connections\n- **Weighted distribution** matches configured ratios within 10%\n- **IP hash** provides 100% consistency for same IP\n- **Least connections** adapts to backend performance differences\n\n\n## Health Checking System\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3 (Health Checks) — this section implements active health monitoring that enables the load balancer to detect backend failures and exclude unhealthy servers from request distribution\n\n### Mental Model: Medical Checkups\n\nThink of the health checking system as a **medical monitoring program** for a professional sports team. Just as team doctors conduct regular checkups on athletes to ensure they're fit to play, our health checker continuously monitors backend servers to ensure they're ready to handle requests.\n\nIn this analogy, each backend server is like an athlete on the team roster. The health checker acts as the team doctor, performing scheduled examinations at regular intervals. Just as a doctor might check an athlete's pulse, reflexes, and stamina, our health checker sends HTTP requests to verify that backends can respond properly. When an athlete fails multiple checkups in a row, the doctor declares them unfit for play and removes them from the active lineup. Similarly, when a backend fails consecutive health checks, it gets marked as unhealthy and removed from the request distribution pool.\n\nThe recovery process mirrors an injured athlete's return to play. Just as an athlete must pass several consecutive medical clearances before rejoining the active roster, a previously unhealthy backend must succeed on multiple consecutive health checks before being restored to the available backend pool. This prevents flapping — rapidly switching between healthy and unhealthy states — which would disrupt the stability of request distribution.\n\nThe health checking system operates independently from request processing, much like how medical checkups happen during training sessions rather than during games. This separation ensures that health monitoring doesn't interfere with live request handling, and that failed health checks don't block ongoing traffic to healthy backends.\n\n![Core Data Structures](./diagrams/data-model.svg)\n\n### Periodic Health Probes\n\nThe **periodic health probes** form the foundation of active health monitoring, implementing scheduled HTTP requests to verify backend server availability. Unlike passive health checking that waits for request failures to detect problems, active probing discovers issues before they impact live traffic.\n\nThe health probe mechanism operates on a configurable interval, typically ranging from 5 to 60 seconds depending on the required detection speed and acceptable overhead. Each probe consists of an HTTP GET request sent to a designated health endpoint on the backend server, usually something like `/health` or `/status`. The probe includes specific headers to identify itself as a health check rather than regular application traffic.\n\n| Health Probe Component | Purpose | Implementation Details |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Probe Scheduler | Manages timing of health checks | Uses `time.Ticker` with configurable interval |\n| HTTP Client | Sends health check requests | Separate client with short timeout (2-5 seconds) |\n| Response Evaluator | Determines probe success/failure | Checks status code, response time, optional body content |\n| State Updater | Records probe results | Updates `HealthState` with atomic operations |\n| Failure Classifier | Categorizes different failure types | Distinguishes connection errors, timeouts, and HTTP errors |\n\nThe probe scheduler maintains independent timers for each backend server to prevent synchronized checking that could create load spikes. This **staggered scheduling** spreads health check traffic evenly over time, reducing the impact on backend servers and network infrastructure.\n\n> **Decision: Dedicated Health Check HTTP Client**\n> - **Context**: Health probes need different timeout and retry characteristics than request forwarding\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Reuse the main HTTP client from request forwarding\n>   2. Create a dedicated HTTP client for health checks\n>   3. Use raw TCP connections for simple connectivity testing\n> - **Decision**: Dedicated HTTP client with short timeouts\n> - **Rationale**: Health checks should fail fast (2-5 second timeout vs 30+ seconds for requests), need different retry logic, and shouldn't interfere with connection pooling for live traffic\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more memory overhead but better isolation and more appropriate timeout behavior for health monitoring\n\nEach health probe follows a structured sequence of operations designed to minimize false positives while detecting real failures quickly:\n\n1. The probe scheduler triggers a health check for a specific backend server based on the configured interval\n2. The health checker creates an HTTP GET request to the backend's health endpoint with appropriate headers\n3. A dedicated HTTP client sends the request with a short timeout (typically 2-5 seconds)\n4. The response evaluator examines the HTTP status code, comparing it against the expected healthy status (usually 200)\n5. Optional response body validation checks for specific content patterns that indicate application readiness\n6. The probe duration is measured and recorded for latency monitoring and timeout tuning\n7. The result (success or failure with error details) is passed to the failure detection logic\n8. The next probe is scheduled based on the configured interval, independent of the current result\n\nResponse evaluation goes beyond simple HTTP status code checking to provide more comprehensive health assessment. A backend might return HTTP 200 but include an error message in the response body indicating database connectivity issues or resource exhaustion. Advanced health probe configurations allow specifying expected response body patterns, response time thresholds, and custom headers that must be present.\n\n| Response Evaluation Criteria | Healthy Condition | Unhealthy Condition |\n|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| HTTP Status Code | Matches expected status (default 200) | Any other status code |\n| Response Time | Under configured threshold (default 5s) | Exceeds timeout threshold |\n| Response Body | Contains expected pattern (if configured) | Missing pattern or contains error indicators |\n| Connection | Successful TCP connection established | Connection refused, timeout, or network error |\n| Content Type | Matches expected type (if configured) | Unexpected content type header |\n\nThe health probe system handles various failure scenarios gracefully, categorizing them to enable appropriate response strategies:\n\n**Connection Failures**: These include DNS resolution failures, connection refused errors, and network timeouts. Connection failures typically indicate infrastructure problems or complete backend unavailability and result in immediate failure classification.\n\n**HTTP Protocol Errors**: These encompass invalid HTTP responses, malformed headers, and protocol violations. While less common than connection failures, protocol errors suggest backend application issues and also result in failure classification.\n\n**Application-Level Failures**: These occur when the HTTP request succeeds but the application reports unhealthy status through error codes (500, 503) or response body content. Application-level failures often indicate partial outages or degraded performance.\n\n> The health probe timeout should be significantly shorter than the request forwarding timeout. A backend that takes 10 seconds to respond to a health check will likely perform poorly for real requests, so it should be marked unhealthy even if it eventually responds.\n\n### Failure Detection Logic\n\nThe **failure detection logic** processes individual probe results to determine when a backend should be marked as unhealthy and removed from the active pool. Rather than making decisions based on single probe failures, the system uses **consecutive failure counting** to avoid false positives caused by temporary network glitches or brief backend hiccups.\n\nThe failure detection mechanism maintains a running count of consecutive failures for each backend server. When a health probe succeeds, the consecutive failure count resets to zero. When a probe fails, the count increments. Once the consecutive failure count reaches the configured **unhealthy threshold**, the backend transitions to the unhealthy state and gets excluded from request distribution.\n\n| Failure Detection State | Consecutive Failures | Action Taken | Next State Trigger |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Healthy Monitoring | 0 to (threshold - 1) | Continue normal checking | Failure count reaches unhealthy threshold |\n| Transitioning to Unhealthy | Equals unhealthy threshold | Mark backend unhealthy, remove from pool | Additional failure (stays unhealthy) or success (start recovery) |\n| Unhealthy Confirmed | Greater than unhealthy threshold | Keep backend out of pool | First successful probe (start recovery process) |\n| Recovery Monitoring | Varies during recovery | Keep out of pool but continue checking | Consecutive successes reach healthy threshold |\n\nThe consecutive failure approach provides several important benefits for production load balancer stability:\n\n**False Positive Reduction**: Temporary network hiccups, brief CPU spikes, or momentary resource contention won't immediately remove a healthy backend from service. The system tolerates transient issues while still detecting sustained problems.\n\n**Configurable Sensitivity**: Different environments require different failure detection speeds. A development environment might use a threshold of 2 consecutive failures for quick feedback, while a production system might use 5 consecutive failures to prioritize stability over immediate response.\n\n**Gradual Response**: The system doesn't immediately panic when a single probe fails. Instead, it continues monitoring and only takes action when multiple consecutive probes confirm a persistent problem.\n\n> **Decision: Consecutive Failure Counting vs. Sliding Window**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance quick failure detection with false positive avoidance\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single failure triggers unhealthy state (immediate response)\n>   2. Consecutive failure counting (current approach)\n>   3. Sliding window percentage (e.g., 80% failures in last 10 probes)\n> - **Decision**: Consecutive failure counting with configurable threshold\n> - **Rationale**: Simpler to understand and configure than sliding windows, more stable than single-failure triggering, and maps well to common operational expectations\n> - **Consequences**: May be slower to detect intermittent failures compared to sliding windows, but provides predictable behavior and lower false positive rates\n\nThe failure detection logic tracks multiple types of information for each backend to support both operational decisions and debugging:\n\n```\nHealthState Structure Components:\n- Healthy: Current overall health status (boolean)\n- ConsecutiveSuccesses: Count of consecutive successful probes\n- ConsecutiveFailures: Count of consecutive failed probes  \n- LastCheckTime: Timestamp of most recent probe attempt\n- LastSuccessTime: Timestamp of most recent successful probe\n- LastFailureTime: Timestamp of most recent failed probe\n- LastError: Error message from most recent failure\n- TotalChecks: Lifetime count of all probe attempts\n- TotalSuccesses: Lifetime count of successful probes\n- TotalFailures: Lifetime count of failed probes\n- StateChanges: Historical log of healthy/unhealthy transitions\n```\n\nThe state transition algorithm follows a clear decision tree for each probe result:\n\n1. **Receive probe result** with timestamp, success/failure status, and error details (if failure)\n2. **Update timing information** by recording the probe timestamp and updating last success/failure times\n3. **Increment counters** for both total checks and either total successes or total failures\n4. **Process success path** (if probe succeeded): Reset consecutive failure count to zero, increment consecutive success count, and check if recovery conditions are met\n5. **Process failure path** (if probe failed): Reset consecutive success count to zero, increment consecutive failure count, and record error details\n6. **Evaluate state transition**: Compare consecutive failure count against unhealthy threshold to determine if backend should be marked unhealthy\n7. **Execute state change** (if threshold crossed): Update healthy status, log state change with reason, and notify backend manager of status change\n8. **Update statistics** including failure rate calculations and availability metrics for monitoring\n\nError classification during failure detection helps operators understand the types of problems affecting their backends:\n\n| Error Category | Detection Pattern | Typical Causes | Operational Response |\n|----------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Connection Refused | TCP connection fails immediately | Backend process stopped, port not listening | Restart backend service, check process status |\n| Timeout | No response within configured time limit | Backend overloaded, network congestion | Check backend CPU/memory, investigate network |\n| DNS Failure | Cannot resolve backend hostname | DNS server issues, incorrect configuration | Verify DNS configuration, check name resolution |\n| HTTP Error | Connection succeeds but HTTP status indicates failure | Application-level problems, database issues | Check backend application logs, verify dependencies |\n| Protocol Error | Invalid HTTP response format | Backend returning malformed responses | Investigate backend application code, check for corruption |\n\n### Recovery Detection Logic\n\nThe **recovery detection logic** manages the process of bringing previously unhealthy backends back into the active pool once they demonstrate sustained recovery. This process mirrors the failure detection logic but operates in reverse, requiring multiple consecutive successful probes before restoring a backend to healthy status.\n\nRecovery detection serves several critical functions in load balancer operation:\n\n**Preventing Flapping**: Without requiring consecutive successes, a backend could rapidly oscillate between healthy and unhealthy states, causing request distribution instability and potentially overwhelming the recovering server with sudden traffic.\n\n**Verifying Sustained Recovery**: A single successful probe might indicate temporary improvement rather than full recovery. Requiring multiple consecutive successes ensures the backend can handle sustained operation.\n\n**Gradual Traffic Restoration**: The recovery process provides a natural ramp-up period where the backend proves its stability before receiving full traffic allocation.\n\n![Backend Health State Machine](./diagrams/backend-health-states.svg)\n\nThe recovery process maintains its own configurable threshold, typically called the **healthy threshold**, which determines how many consecutive successful probes are required to restore a backend to healthy status. This threshold can be different from (and often smaller than) the unhealthy threshold to create asymmetric behavior.\n\n| Recovery Phase | Consecutive Successes | Backend Status | Traffic Handling |\n|----------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Initial Failure | 0 | Unhealthy | Excluded from all traffic |\n| Recovery Attempt | 1 to (healthy threshold - 1) | Still Unhealthy | Excluded from traffic, monitoring progress |\n| Recovery Success | Equals healthy threshold | Transitioning to Healthy | About to rejoin active pool |\n| Healthy Restored | Maintained above threshold | Healthy | Receiving normal traffic distribution |\n\n> **Decision: Asymmetric Thresholds for Failure vs Recovery**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance quick recovery with stability during backend restoration\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Use same threshold for both failure detection and recovery (symmetric)\n>   2. Use lower threshold for recovery than failure detection (favor quick recovery)\n>   3. Use higher threshold for recovery than failure detection (favor stability)\n> - **Decision**: Configurable thresholds with recommended asymmetric defaults (failure: 3, recovery: 2)\n> - **Rationale**: Backends should be quickly restored once they show signs of recovery, but not so quickly that transient improvements cause flapping\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex configuration but better operational characteristics in most environments\n\nThe recovery detection algorithm processes successful probe results when a backend is currently in the unhealthy state:\n\n1. **Verify current state** by confirming the backend is currently marked as unhealthy (recovery only applies to unhealthy backends)\n2. **Process successful probe** by resetting the consecutive failure count and incrementing the consecutive success count\n3. **Check recovery threshold** by comparing consecutive successes against the configured healthy threshold\n4. **Execute recovery transition** (if threshold met) by marking backend as healthy, logging the state change, and notifying the backend manager\n5. **Reset recovery counters** by clearing consecutive success count and preparing for normal healthy monitoring\n6. **Log recovery event** with timestamp, number of probes required, and duration of unhealthy period for operational analysis\n\nThe system tracks detailed recovery statistics to support operational analysis and threshold tuning:\n\n```\nRecovery Tracking Information:\n- RecoveryStartTime: When first successful probe occurred after unhealthy state\n- RecoveryProbeCount: Number of successful probes during recovery process  \n- UnhealthyDuration: Total time spent in unhealthy state\n- RecoveryDuration: Time from first success to healthy restoration\n- RecoveryAttempts: Number of times recovery was attempted (may fail and restart)\n- LastRecoveryTime: Timestamp when backend was last restored to healthy status\n```\n\nRecovery can be interrupted if a probe fails during the recovery process. When this happens, the consecutive success count resets to zero, and the backend remains unhealthy. This interrupted recovery gets logged as a separate event to help identify backends with intermittent problems.\n\n**Partial Recovery Scenarios** occur when a backend begins recovering but then fails again before reaching the healthy threshold:\n\n1. **Recovery Interruption**: A probe fails after some successful probes during recovery, resetting progress\n2. **Recovery Restart**: The system begins counting consecutive successes again from zero\n3. **Pattern Analysis**: Multiple interrupted recoveries might indicate underlying instability requiring investigation\n\nThe recovery logic also implements **gradual traffic restoration** strategies to prevent overwhelming a recently recovered backend:\n\n**Immediate Full Restoration**: The backend immediately receives its full share of traffic distribution once marked healthy. This approach is simple but risks overwhelming a backend that's still stabilizing.\n\n**Warming Period**: Some implementations include a warming period where a newly recovered backend receives reduced traffic initially, gradually increasing to full allocation. This isn't implemented in the basic version but represents a common production enhancement.\n\n> During recovery detection, continue performing health checks at the same interval as for healthy backends. Don't increase the frequency just because a backend is recovering — this could overwhelm a backend that's struggling to stabilize.\n\n### Health Check Configuration\n\nThe **health check configuration** provides comprehensive control over all aspects of the health monitoring system, enabling operators to tune behavior for different environments, backend characteristics, and availability requirements. Proper configuration balances quick failure detection with system stability and resource efficiency.\n\nThe configuration system organizes health check parameters into logical groups that correspond to different aspects of the monitoring process:\n\n| Configuration Category | Purpose | Key Parameters |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Probe Behavior | Controls how health checks are performed | Interval, timeout, HTTP method, endpoint path |\n| Failure Detection | Determines when backends are marked unhealthy | Unhealthy threshold, failure classification rules |\n| Recovery Detection | Controls when backends are restored to healthy status | Healthy threshold, recovery validation rules |\n| Response Validation | Defines what constitutes a successful probe | Expected status codes, body patterns, headers |\n| Resource Management | Manages health checking overhead | Concurrent check limits, client pool size |\n\nThe **probe timing configuration** requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between detection speed and system overhead:\n\n```\nHealthCheckConfig Timing Parameters:\n- Interval: Time between health checks (default: 30s, range: 5s-300s)\n- Timeout: Maximum time to wait for probe response (default: 5s, range: 1s-30s)  \n- Jitter: Random variation in interval to prevent synchronization (default: 10%)\n- InitialDelay: Wait time before starting health checks for new backends (default: 0s)\n- MaxCheckDuration: Overall timeout including retries and processing (default: 2x timeout)\n```\n\n> **Decision: Health Check Interval Selection**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance quick failure detection with resource overhead and backend load\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fixed short interval (5-10 seconds) for fast detection\n>   2. Fixed long interval (60+ seconds) for low overhead  \n>   3. Adaptive interval based on backend health history\n>   4. Configurable interval with reasonable defaults (current approach)\n> - **Decision**: Configurable interval with 30-second default and 5-300 second range\n> - **Rationale**: Different environments have different requirements; development needs fast feedback while production prioritizes stability\n> - **Consequences**: Requires operators to understand interval trade-offs, but provides flexibility for diverse environments\n\nThe **endpoint configuration** specifies how and where health checks are performed:\n\n```\nHealth Check Endpoint Configuration:\n- Path: HTTP path for health checks (default: \"/health\")\n- Method: HTTP method to use (default: \"GET\", options: \"GET\", \"HEAD\", \"POST\")\n- Headers: Custom headers to include in health check requests\n- UserAgent: User-Agent header value (default: \"LoadBalancer-HealthCheck/1.0\")  \n- Host: Host header override (optional, uses backend hostname by default)\n- Scheme: Protocol scheme override (default: \"http\", option: \"https\")\n```\n\nResponse validation configuration determines what constitutes a successful health check beyond basic connectivity:\n\n| Validation Type | Configuration | Success Criteria | Use Cases |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-----------|\n| Status Code | ExpectedStatus (default: 200) | HTTP response matches expected code | Basic application responsiveness |\n| Response Time | MaxResponseTime (optional) | Response received within time limit | Performance-based health assessment |\n| Body Content | ExpectedBodyPattern (optional regex) | Response body matches pattern | Application-specific readiness checks |\n| Header Presence | RequiredHeaders (list) | Specified headers present in response | Custom application health indicators |\n| Content Type | ExpectedContentType (optional) | Response has expected content type | Ensure proper application response format |\n\n**Threshold configuration** provides fine-grained control over failure and recovery detection sensitivity:\n\n```\nThreshold Configuration Parameters:\n- UnhealthyThreshold: Consecutive failures required to mark backend unhealthy (default: 3)\n- HealthyThreshold: Consecutive successes required to restore backend to healthy (default: 2)  \n- MaxConsecutiveFailures: Cap on failure count for statistics (default: 100)\n- FailureRateThreshold: Percentage failure rate over time window (optional)\n- MinCheckCount: Minimum checks before applying failure rate threshold (default: 10)\n```\n\nThe configuration system supports **environment-specific profiles** that provide appropriate defaults for different deployment scenarios:\n\n| Environment Profile | Interval | Timeout | Unhealthy Threshold | Healthy Threshold | Use Case |\n|---------------------|----------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|\n| Development | 10s | 3s | 2 | 1 | Fast feedback, frequent code changes |\n| Staging | 15s | 5s | 3 | 2 | Balance between speed and stability |\n| Production | 30s | 5s | 3 | 2 | Stability over speed, avoid false positives |\n| High-Frequency | 5s | 2s | 5 | 3 | Critical services requiring immediate detection |\n| Low-Overhead | 60s | 10s | 2 | 2 | Resource-constrained environments |\n\n**Dynamic configuration updates** allow operators to modify health check behavior without restarting the load balancer:\n\n1. **Configuration Validation**: New configuration is validated for parameter ranges, consistency, and required fields\n2. **Gradual Application**: Changes are applied to health checkers as their current check cycles complete\n3. **Backward Compatibility**: Running health checks complete with old parameters before adopting new ones\n4. **Rollback Capability**: Invalid configurations are rejected and previous settings maintained\n5. **Change Logging**: All configuration changes are logged with timestamps and operator identification\n\n> When changing health check intervals, don't immediately apply the new interval to all backends. Instead, let current check cycles complete naturally to avoid creating synchronized load spikes or missing critical health transitions.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe health checking system incorporates several key architecture decisions that significantly impact its behavior, performance, and operational characteristics. These decisions reflect trade-offs between competing requirements such as detection speed, resource efficiency, false positive rates, and implementation complexity.\n\n> **Decision: Active vs Passive Health Checking**\n> - **Context**: Need to detect backend failures before they impact live traffic\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Passive health checking (detect failures from live request errors)\n>   2. Active health checking with periodic probes (current approach)\n>   3. Hybrid approach combining both active and passive detection\n> - **Decision**: Active health checking with periodic HTTP probes\n> - **Rationale**: Active checking detects problems before they impact users, provides consistent monitoring regardless of traffic patterns, and enables predictable failure detection timing\n> - **Consequences**: Higher resource overhead due to probe traffic, but better user experience and more reliable failure detection\n\nThe **concurrent vs sequential checking** decision fundamentally affects both performance characteristics and resource utilization patterns:\n\n| Approach | Pros | Cons | Resource Impact |\n|----------|------|------|-----------------|\n| Concurrent Checking | Faster overall check completion, independent timing per backend | Higher instantaneous resource usage, potential thundering herd | High CPU/network burst, more goroutines |\n| Sequential Checking | Lower resource peaks, simpler resource management | Slower failure detection for later backends in sequence | Steady resource usage, fewer goroutines |\n| Batched Checking | Balanced resource usage, tunable concurrency | More complex implementation, requires batch size tuning | Configurable resource usage patterns |\n\n> **Decision: Concurrent Health Checking with Semaphore Limiting**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance fast failure detection with resource consumption limits\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fully sequential checking (check backends one at a time)\n>   2. Fully concurrent checking (check all backends simultaneously)  \n>   3. Concurrent with semaphore limiting (current approach)\n> - **Decision**: Concurrent checking with configurable semaphore limit (default: 10 concurrent checks)\n> - **Rationale**: Provides fast detection when needed while preventing resource exhaustion with large backend pools\n> - **Consequences**: Requires semaphore management but provides tunable resource usage and good detection speed\n\nThe **health check isolation** decision determines how health checking interacts with the main request processing pipeline:\n\n> **Decision: Separate HTTP Client for Health Checks**\n> - **Context**: Health checks have different requirements than request forwarding (timeouts, connection pooling, retry behavior)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Share HTTP client with request forwarding\n>   2. Separate HTTP client dedicated to health checks (current approach)\n>   3. Custom TCP-level health checking without HTTP\n> - **Decision**: Dedicated HTTP client with health-check-specific configuration\n> - **Rationale**: Health checks need short timeouts and different connection management, sharing could cause interference\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher memory usage but better isolation and more appropriate timeout/retry behavior\n\n**State management architecture** affects both performance and correctness under concurrent access:\n\nThe health checking system must handle concurrent access from multiple goroutines: the health checker updating states, the request router reading healthy backend lists, and administrative interfaces querying statistics. This requires careful synchronization to prevent data races while maintaining good performance.\n\n```\nState Management Approach:\n- HealthState embedded in Backend struct with atomic fields for counters\n- RWMutex protecting state transitions and complex updates\n- Atomic operations for frequently accessed counters (consecutive failures/successes)  \n- Copy-on-read for expensive operations like generating healthy backend lists\n- Channel-based state change notifications to avoid polling\n```\n\n> **Decision: Embedded vs Separate Health State Storage**\n> - **Context**: Need to associate health state with backend instances while supporting efficient updates\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Separate health state map with backend ID keys\n>   2. Embed HealthState directly in Backend struct (current approach)\n>   3. Health state stored in external database/cache\n> - **Decision**: Embed HealthState as pointer field in Backend struct\n> - **Rationale**: Ensures state stays associated with backend, simplifies memory management, and enables atomic pointer swapping for state updates\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly larger Backend structs but better data locality and simpler state management\n\nThe **error handling and logging architecture** determines how health check problems are diagnosed and monitored:\n\n| Error Handling Aspect | Design Choice | Rationale |\n|----------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| Error Categorization | Structured error types (ConnectionError, TimeoutError, HTTPError) | Enables appropriate responses and better debugging |\n| Error Persistence | Store last error message and timestamp in HealthState | Provides debugging information without expensive logging |\n| Logging Strategy | Log state transitions and periodic summaries, not individual checks | Reduces log noise while preserving important events |\n| Metrics Integration | Expose health check metrics via standard interfaces | Enables monitoring and alerting on health check performance |\n| Circuit Breaking | Temporary health check suspension after repeated infrastructure failures | Prevents wasting resources on systemically unreachable backends |\n\n**Recovery coordination** affects how quickly backends rejoin the active pool and whether this causes stability issues:\n\n> **Decision: Independent Recovery vs Coordinated Restoration**\n> - **Context**: Multiple backends might recover simultaneously, potentially overwhelming the system\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Independent recovery (each backend restored as soon as it meets threshold)\n>   2. Coordinated recovery (limit number of backends restored simultaneously)\n>   3. Gradual traffic restoration (restored backends receive reduced traffic initially)\n> - **Decision**: Independent recovery with monitoring for mass recovery events\n> - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, faster restoration of capacity, with logging to detect and address mass recovery scenarios\n> - **Consequences**: Potential for traffic spikes when multiple backends recover simultaneously, but maintains simplicity and fast recovery\n\n![Health Check Process Flow](./diagrams/health-check-process.svg)\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nThe health checking system presents several common implementation and configuration pitfalls that can significantly impact load balancer reliability and performance. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid subtle bugs and operational issues that often emerge only under specific conditions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Overwhelming Backends**\n\nA frequently encountered problem occurs when health check traffic itself causes backend performance degradation or failure. This happens when health check intervals are too aggressive, health check endpoints are too expensive, or the health checking system doesn't account for backend capacity limits.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Health checks run continuously regardless of backend load, and poorly configured intervals can generate significant additional traffic. For example, checking 100 backends every 5 seconds with a 30-second timeout creates sustained load that might overwhelm already-stressed backends.\n\n**How to Detect**: Monitor backend server logs for high health check request volume, observe correlation between health check frequency and backend response times, or notice that backends fail health checks during high traffic periods but recover during low traffic periods.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Configure reasonable check intervals (30+ seconds for production), implement lightweight health check endpoints that don't perform expensive operations, use jitter to distribute check timing, and monitor health check traffic as a percentage of total backend load.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Health State Updates**\n\nConcurrent access to health state information can create race conditions where multiple goroutines read and modify state simultaneously, leading to inconsistent state transitions or lost updates.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Health check updates, request routing decisions, and administrative queries all access backend health state concurrently. Without proper synchronization, the health checker might mark a backend unhealthy while the request router is simultaneously reading it as healthy.\n\n**How to Detect**: Inconsistent health state reports between different system components, backends that seem to flicker between healthy and unhealthy states, or occasional panics related to concurrent map access.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Use appropriate synchronization primitives (RWMutex for state transitions, atomic operations for counters), implement copy-on-read for expensive operations, and ensure state changes are atomic from the perspective of other system components.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Thundering Herd During Recovery**\n\nWhen multiple backends recover simultaneously after a shared outage (network partition, dependency failure), they can overwhelm the system with sudden traffic spikes, potentially causing a cascade failure.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: All backends fail health checks simultaneously during an infrastructure outage, then all begin recovery at roughly the same time when the outage resolves. Without coordination, they all rejoin the active pool simultaneously, receiving full traffic allocation immediately.\n\n**How to Detect**: Sudden traffic spikes coinciding with backend recovery events, performance degradation immediately after outage resolution, or repeated cycles of recovery and failure.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Implement jitter in recovery timing, consider gradual traffic restoration for recently recovered backends, monitor for mass recovery events and implement rate limiting when detected, or use longer healthy thresholds to spread recovery timing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Endpoint Doesn't Reflect Application Health**\n\nHealth check endpoints that only verify basic connectivity (returning 200 OK) without checking application dependencies can create false positives where backends appear healthy but can't actually serve requests successfully.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Simple health checks might only verify that the HTTP server is running without checking database connectivity, external service availability, or resource availability (memory, disk space).\n\n**How to Detect**: Backends pass health checks but return errors for actual requests, user-facing errors that don't correlate with health check failures, or performance issues that aren't reflected in health check results.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Design health check endpoints to verify critical dependencies, implement multiple levels of health checking (shallow for basic connectivity, deep for application readiness), and consider separate endpoints for different health aspects.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inappropriate Threshold Configuration**\n\nIncorrectly configured failure and recovery thresholds can cause either excessive sensitivity (frequent false positives) or insufficient sensitivity (slow failure detection), both of which degrade system reliability.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Thresholds are often set based on intuition rather than measurement, different environments require different sensitivity levels, and threshold requirements change as system scale and reliability requirements evolve.\n\n**How to Detect**: Frequent backend state flapping indicating overly sensitive thresholds, delayed failure detection causing user impact indicating insufficient sensitivity, or correlation between network conditions and health state changes.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Start with conservative thresholds and tune based on observed behavior, implement different threshold profiles for different environments, monitor threshold effectiveness through failure detection time and false positive rates, and document threshold rationale for future tuning.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Health State History**\n\nAccumulating health check history, state changes, and error messages without proper cleanup can cause memory usage to grow unbounded over time, particularly in systems with many backends or long uptimes.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Health state structures accumulate historical data for debugging and analysis, but without cleanup policies this data grows indefinitely. State change logs, error message histories, and statistical counters can consume significant memory.\n\n**How to Detect**: Gradually increasing memory usage over time, memory usage that correlates with system uptime rather than current load, or large amounts of memory attributed to health checking structures.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Implement retention policies for historical data (keep last N state changes, limit error message storage), use ring buffers for historical data instead of unlimited slices, periodically clean up old statistical data, and monitor memory usage of health checking components.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Timeout Longer Than Request Timeout**\n\nConfiguring health check timeouts that are longer than request forwarding timeouts creates a situation where backends might appear healthy to the health checker but still fail user requests due to slowness.\n\n**Why This Occurs**: Health check and request forwarding timeouts are often configured independently, and it's counterintuitive that health checks should have shorter timeouts than actual requests.\n\n**How to Detect**: Backends that pass health checks but frequently time out on user requests, user-reported slow response times that don't correlate with health check failures.\n\n**Prevention and Fix**: Set health check timeouts to be 50-80% of request timeouts, consider separate performance-based health checking that measures response times, and monitor correlation between health check performance and request success rates.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe health checking system requires careful implementation to handle concurrent operations, manage resource usage, and provide reliable failure detection. This guidance provides concrete implementation patterns for building a robust health monitoring system.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

checkpoints:\n\n**Basic Health Checking Test:**\n```bash\n# Start load balancer with health checking enabled\ngo run cmd/loadbalancer/main.go --config config/development.json\n\n# In another terminal, check health status endpoint\ncurl http://localhost:8080/admin/backends\n\n# Expected output: JSON showing all backends with health states\n# Verify that healthy backends show \"healthy\": true\n```\n\n**Health Check Failure Simulation:**\n```bash\n# Stop one backend server (if using Docker)\ndocker stop backend-server-1\n\n# Wait for unhealthy threshold * interval seconds\n# Check backend status again\ncurl http://localhost:8080/admin/backends\n\n# Expected: Backend-1 should show \"healthy\": false\n# Expected: Consecutive failures count should equal unhealthy threshold\n```\n\n**Recovery Testing:**\n```bash\n# Restart the stopped backend\ndocker start backend-server-1\n\n# Wait for healthy threshold * interval seconds\n# Check status again\ncurl http://localhost:8080/admin/backends\n\n# Expected: Backend-1 should return to \"healthy\": true\n# Expected: State change log should show unhealthy -> healthy transition\n```\n\n**Signs of Correct Implementation:**\n- Backends transition to unhealthy after configured consecutive failures\n- Healthy backends remain available for request distribution\n- State transitions are logged with timestamps and reasons\n- Recovery requires configured consecutive successes\n- Health check requests appear in backend server logs\n\n**Common Issues and Debugging:**\n- **Health checks not running**: Verify `Enabled: true` in configuration and check for startup errors\n- **All backends marked unhealthy**: Check network connectivity and health endpoint paths\n- **Frequent state flapping**: Increase failure/success thresholds or check health endpoint reliability\n- **Memory usage growth**: Verify state change history is limited and old entries are cleaned up\n\n\n## Request Router Integration\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — the request router serves as the central coordinator that integrates HTTP proxying (Milestone 1), backend selection algorithms (Milestone 2), health checking (Milestone 3), and advanced routing features (Milestone 4) into a unified request processing pipeline\n\n### Mental Model: Airport Control Tower\n\nThink of the request router as an airport control tower coordinating the complex dance of aircraft arrivals and departures. Just as an air traffic controller receives incoming flight requests, checks runway availability, weather conditions, and aircraft capabilities before directing each plane to the appropriate runway, the request router receives HTTP requests, checks backend health status, applies load balancing algorithms, and directs each request to the most suitable backend server.\n\nThe control tower doesn't fly the planes itself — it coordinates between multiple specialized systems. Weather monitoring provides current conditions (health checking system), runway management tracks capacity and availability (backend pool manager), and flight planning algorithms determine optimal routing (load balancing algorithms). The controller integrates information from all these systems to make real-time routing decisions while handling edge cases like emergency landings (error responses) and runway closures (backend failures).\n\nThis coordination role is critical because individual components work well in isolation, but the real complexity emerges in their integration. The request router must handle timing issues (what happens when a backend becomes unhealthy between selection and request forwarding?), resource coordination (ensuring connection limits are respected), and failure scenarios (graceful degradation when multiple systems experience problems simultaneously).\n\n### Request Processing Pipeline\n\n![Request Processing Sequence](./diagrams/request-flow.svg)\n\nThe request router orchestrates a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that transforms incoming HTTP requests into successful responses through careful coordination of specialized components. Understanding this pipeline is essential because each stage introduces potential failure points and requires different error handling strategies.\n\nThe **request reception stage** begins when the HTTP server accepts an incoming connection and parses the request headers, body, and metadata. The request router immediately creates a request context containing the original request, client connection information, and timing metadata. This context travels with the request through every subsequent stage, ensuring that timeouts, logging, and cleanup operations can be performed correctly even if intermediate stages fail.\n\nDuring the **backend selection stage**, the request router queries the `BackendManager` for the current list of healthy backends, then invokes the active load balancing algorithm to choose the most appropriate target. This stage requires careful error handling because the backend pool can change between the health check and the selection call. The router must handle cases where no healthy backends are available, where the selected backend becomes unhealthy after selection but before connection, and where algorithm state becomes inconsistent due to concurrent updates.\n\nThe **request enhancement stage** prepares the original request for forwarding by adding necessary proxy headers, adjusting the request URL to point to the selected backend, and applying any request transformations required by the proxy configuration. The router adds standard headers like `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and `X-Forwarded-Host`, while preserving all original headers that should be forwarded to the backend. Connection-specific headers like `Connection` and `Proxy-Connection` must be handled specially to prevent forwarding connection management directives meant for the proxy itself.\n\nThe **connection management stage** establishes or reuses an HTTP connection to the selected backend server. The request router works with the reverse proxy component's connection pool to minimize connection overhead while respecting per-backend connection limits configured in the `BackendConfig`. This stage tracks active connections for algorithms like least connections and enforces timeout policies to prevent resource exhaustion. Connection establishment failures trigger immediate fallback to error response generation without attempting to forward the request.\n\nDuring the **request forwarding stage**, the enhanced request is transmitted to the backend server with appropriate timeout monitoring. The request router must handle various failure scenarios: connection timeouts during request transmission, backend servers that accept connections but never respond, and backends that respond with partial data before failing. The router maintains request context throughout this process to enable proper cleanup and logging regardless of how the forwarding attempt concludes.\n\nThe **response processing stage** receives the backend response and prepares it for transmission back to the original client. The router removes backend-specific headers that shouldn't be exposed to clients, adds any required proxy response headers, and begins streaming the response body back to the client. Response processing must handle cases where backends return invalid HTTP responses, where the client connection is lost during response streaming, and where backends close connections unexpectedly during response transmission.\n\nFinally, the **cleanup and logging stage** ensures that all resources are properly released, connection counts are accurately decremented, and comprehensive request logs are generated for monitoring and debugging purposes. This stage executes regardless of whether the request succeeded or failed, making it critical for preventing resource leaks and maintaining accurate system state.\n\nThe pipeline stages are designed with **explicit handoff points** where control and responsibility transfer between components. Each handoff includes validation that prerequisites are met and that the receiving component has the information needed to proceed or handle failures gracefully. This design ensures that failures in one stage don't cascade unpredictably to other stages.\n\n| Pipeline Stage | Input | Output | Failure Modes | Recovery Strategy |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Request Reception | HTTP connection | Parsed request + context | Malformed HTTP, oversized request | Return 400 Bad Request immediately |\n| Backend Selection | Request context + healthy backends | Selected backend + algorithm state | No healthy backends available | Return 503 Service Unavailable |\n| Request Enhancement | Original request + selected backend | Enhanced request ready for forwarding | Header processing errors | Log warning, continue with original headers |\n| Connection Management | Enhanced request + backend config | Active connection to backend | Connection timeout, connection limit exceeded | Return 502 Bad Gateway or 503 Service Unavailable |\n| Request Forwarding | Enhanced request + active connection | Response from backend | Backend timeout, connection lost | Return 502 Bad Gateway, decrement connection count |\n| Response Processing | Backend response + client connection | Client response stream | Invalid response headers, client disconnect | Log error, close connections cleanly |\n| Cleanup and Logging | Request context + final status | Resource cleanup + log entries | Logging system failure | Continue cleanup, fallback to stderr logging |\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: The request router maintains request context throughout the entire pipeline to ensure that timeouts, resource cleanup, and error logging work correctly even when individual stages fail unexpectedly. This context includes the original request timestamp, selected backend information, connection references, and accumulated timing data.\n\n### Error Response Handling\n\n![Error Handling Decision Tree](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\nError response handling represents one of the most complex aspects of request router integration because errors can originate from multiple sources simultaneously, and the appropriate response depends on the timing and nature of each failure. The request router must generate HTTP responses that accurately reflect the underlying problem while providing useful information for debugging without exposing internal system details.\n\nThe **error classification system** categorizes failures into distinct types that require different response strategies. **Client errors** (4xx responses) occur when the incoming request is malformed, oversized, or otherwise invalid — these are detected during request reception and should be handled immediately without attempting backend forwarding. **Backend unavailability errors** (503 Service Unavailable) occur when no healthy backends are available or when all backends are at connection capacity — these indicate temporary system overload. **Backend communication errors** (502 Bad Gateway) occur when backends are selected successfully but fail during connection establishment or request processing — these indicate problems with specific backend servers. **Timeout errors** can manifest as either 504 Gateway Timeout responses when backends are slow to respond, or as connection timeouts that appear as 502 errors when backends never establish connections.\n\nThe **error detection pipeline** monitors for failures at each stage of request processing and applies different detection strategies based on the failure type. Connection errors are detected through standard network error handling, examining error types returned by the HTTP client to distinguish between connection refused (backend down), connection timeout (backend overloaded), and DNS resolution failures (configuration problems). Response validation errors are detected by examining HTTP status codes, header formats, and response streaming behavior from backends. Resource exhaustion errors are detected through connection pool monitoring, memory usage tracking, and active request count monitoring.\n\n**Error response generation** follows HTTP specifications while providing actionable information for debugging. The request router maintains a structured error response format that includes appropriate HTTP status codes, descriptive error messages that don't expose internal architecture details, and correlation IDs that enable request tracing across log files. Error responses include standard headers like `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Connection` management headers, while avoiding headers that might confuse HTTP clients or proxy chains.\n\n| Error Category | HTTP Status | Response Headers | Body Content | When to Use |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Invalid Request | 400 Bad Request | `Content-Type: text/plain` | \"Bad Request: Invalid HTTP request format\" | Malformed HTTP, oversized headers, invalid methods |\n| Backend Unavailable | 503 Service Unavailable | `Retry-After: 30` | \"Service Unavailable: No backend servers available\" | Zero healthy backends, all at capacity |\n| Backend Connection Failed | 502 Bad Gateway | `Content-Type: text/plain` | \"Bad Gateway: Unable to connect to backend server\" | Connection refused, DNS failure, connection timeout |\n| Backend Response Timeout | 504 Gateway Timeout | `Content-Type: text/plain` | \"Gateway Timeout: Backend server response timeout\" | Backend accepts request but never responds |\n| Backend Invalid Response | 502 Bad Gateway | `Content-Type: text/plain` | \"Bad Gateway: Invalid response from backend server\" | Malformed HTTP response, connection closed during headers |\n| Internal Router Error | 500 Internal Server Error | `Content-Type: text/plain` | \"Internal Server Error: Request processing failed\" | Algorithm failures, configuration errors, resource exhaustion |\n\nThe **error correlation system** generates unique request IDs that are included in error responses and logged with sufficient detail to enable effective debugging. Each error log entry includes the request ID, client IP address, requested URL, selected backend (if any), error category, detailed error message, and timing information for each pipeline stage. This correlation data enables operators to trace problematic requests through the entire system and identify patterns in error occurrence.\n\n**Graceful degradation strategies** determine how the request router behaves when multiple error conditions occur simultaneously. When the health checking system fails, the router can continue operating with the last known healthy backend list, gradually marking backends as unhealthy based on connection failures observed during request forwarding. When the backend selection algorithm fails due to corrupted state, the router can fall back to simple round-robin selection to maintain service availability. When the logging system fails, the router continues processing requests while writing error information to standard error streams.\n\n> **Decision: Error Response Timing**\n> - **Context**: Error responses must be generated quickly to prevent client timeouts while including sufficient diagnostic information for debugging\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate error responses with minimal detail, delayed responses with comprehensive diagnostic data, or adaptive timing based on error type\n> - **Decision**: Generate immediate error responses with essential information while logging comprehensive diagnostic data asynchronously\n> - **Rationale**: Client applications typically have short timeout expectations (5-30 seconds), making response speed critical for user experience, while comprehensive diagnostic data is needed for operational debugging\n> - **Consequences**: Enables fast client error handling while maintaining debugging capabilities, but requires careful log correlation to match error responses with diagnostic details\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe request router integration design requires several critical architectural decisions that fundamentally impact system behavior, performance, and maintainability. These decisions involve trade-offs between consistency, performance, and operational complexity.\n\n> **Decision: Request Context Management**\n> - **Context**: Request contexts must carry information through the processing pipeline while enabling cleanup and timeout handling across component boundaries\n> - **Options Considered**: Thread-local storage with global request state, immutable context objects passed between functions, or request-scoped dependency injection containers\n> - **Decision**: Use immutable context objects with explicit passing between pipeline stages\n> - **Rationale**: Immutable contexts prevent accidental state modification that could affect concurrent requests, explicit passing makes data flow clear for debugging, and context objects can carry cancellation signals for timeout handling\n> - **Consequences**: Enables clean timeout handling and resource cleanup, makes request flow explicit for debugging, but requires disciplined context passing throughout the codebase\n\n| Context Management Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Thread-local storage | Simple access, no parameter passing | Hidden dependencies, difficult testing | No |\n| Immutable context objects | Explicit data flow, clean cancellation | Requires consistent parameter passing | **Yes** |\n| Dependency injection | Flexible component wiring | Complex configuration, runtime overhead | No |\n\n> **Decision: Error Response Format Standardization**\n> - **Context**: Error responses must provide consistent format for client applications while including sufficient information for debugging without exposing internal architecture\n> - **Options Considered**: Standard HTTP status codes only, JSON error responses with structured data, or plain text responses with correlation IDs\n> - **Decision**: Plain text error responses with HTTP status codes and correlation IDs in headers\n> - **Rationale**: Plain text responses are universally compatible with HTTP clients, correlation IDs in headers enable request tracing without requiring clients to parse response bodies, and avoiding JSON prevents content-type negotiation complexity\n> - **Consequences**: Maximizes client compatibility and simplifies error handling, enables effective debugging through correlation IDs, but provides less structured error information than JSON responses would\n\n> **Decision: Backend Selection Timing**\n> - **Context**: Backend selection must occur at an optimal point in the request pipeline to balance load distribution accuracy with failure recovery capabilities\n> - **Options Considered**: Select backend during request reception, select backend immediately before connection establishment, or pre-select backends and cache selections\n> - **Decision**: Select backend immediately before connection establishment with fallback selection on connection failure\n> - **Rationale**: Late selection incorporates the most recent health check information and connection count data, enables fallback to different backends on connection failure, and avoids holding backend selections during request parsing overhead\n> - **Consequences**: Maximizes selection accuracy and enables connection-level fallback, but requires handling backend selection failures during request processing and increases latency for backend selection overhead\n\n| Backend Selection Timing | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| During request reception | Simple pipeline, early failure detection | Stale health data, no connection-level fallback | No |\n| Before connection establishment | Fresh health data, connection fallback possible | Selection failure during processing | **Yes** |\n| Pre-selected with caching | Minimal per-request overhead | Stale selections, complex cache invalidation | No |\n\n> **Decision: Connection Pool Integration**\n> - **Context**: Connection pooling must be integrated with backend selection algorithms while respecting per-backend connection limits and providing accurate connection counting\n> - **Options Considered**: Global connection pool shared across backends, per-backend connection pools with separate management, or algorithm-managed connection pools with custom lifecycle\n> - **Decision**: Per-backend connection pools with centralized connection count tracking\n> - **Rationale**: Per-backend pools enable independent connection management and timeout policies, centralized counting provides accurate data for least-connections algorithm, and separate pools prevent connection starvation between backends with different performance characteristics\n> - **Consequences**: Enables accurate connection-based load balancing and independent backend tuning, but requires coordination between connection pool management and backend health state updates\n\n> **Decision: Request Retry Logic**\n> - **Context**: Failed requests could potentially be retried with different backends to improve success rates, but retry logic introduces complexity and potential for request amplification\n> - **Options Considered**: No retry logic with single-attempt forwarding, automatic retry with exponential backoff, or configurable retry with idempotency detection\n> - **Decision**: No automatic retry logic in the request router, delegating retry decisions to client applications\n> - **Rationale**: HTTP requests may have side effects that make retries unsafe without idempotency guarantees, automatic retries can amplify load during backend failures, and client applications have better context for determining retry appropriateness\n> - **Consequences**: Simplifies request router logic and prevents unsafe request amplification, but requires client applications to implement retry logic and handle transient failures\n\n| Retry Logic Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| No retry logic | Simple, prevents unsafe retries | Clients must handle failures | **Yes** |\n| Automatic retry with backoff | Improved success rates | Unsafe for non-idempotent requests | No |\n| Configurable retry with idempotency detection | Safe retries, configurable behavior | Complex implementation, difficult configuration | No |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nRequest router integration involves coordination between multiple concurrent systems, making it particularly susceptible to subtle bugs that only manifest under specific timing conditions or failure scenarios. Understanding these common pitfalls helps prevent difficult-to-reproduce issues in production environments.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Request Context Loss During Error Handling**\n\nThe most frequent integration mistake is losing request context information when errors occur, making it impossible to perform proper cleanup or generate meaningful log entries. This typically happens when error handling code paths bypass the normal context passing mechanisms or when panic recovery doesn't preserve context data.\n\nFor example, when a backend selection algorithm throws an exception due to corrupted internal state, the error handling code might generate a 500 error response without access to the original request context. This results in connection leaks (because connection counts can't be decremented without knowing which backend was selected), incomplete log entries (because request timing and client information is lost), and difficult debugging (because error correlation becomes impossible).\n\nThe fix requires implementing comprehensive error handling that preserves request context throughout all failure scenarios. Error handling code must receive the same context object as success paths, and panic recovery mechanisms must capture context from the goroutine or thread stack. All error response generation must include request correlation IDs from the preserved context.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions Between Health Updates and Request Routing**\n\nBackend health states can change between the time a backend is selected by the load balancing algorithm and when the actual connection attempt is made. This creates a race condition where the router attempts to connect to a backend that has just been marked unhealthy by the health checking system.\n\nThe symptom is intermittent connection failures that seem to contradict the load balancer's health checking logic — clients receive 502 Bad Gateway responses even when health checks show all backends as healthy. This happens because health state updates and request routing operate on different timelines and use different data synchronization mechanisms.\n\nThe fix requires implementing connection-time health validation that double-checks backend health immediately before connection establishment. If the selected backend has become unhealthy since selection, the request router should attempt fallback selection to choose a different healthy backend. The health checking system must also use appropriate synchronization primitives to ensure that health state updates are visible to concurrent request processing threads.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Improper Error Response Headers**\n\nGenerating error responses with incorrect or missing HTTP headers can cause problems for client applications, proxy chains, and debugging tools. Common header mistakes include missing `Content-Length` headers for error response bodies, incorrect `Content-Type` headers, missing `Connection` management headers, and accidentally forwarding backend-specific headers in error responses.\n\nFor example, when a backend connection fails, the request router might generate a 502 error response but forget to set appropriate `Content-Type: text/plain` headers. Client applications that expect JSON responses might then attempt to parse the plain text error message as JSON, leading to client-side parsing errors that obscure the original backend connection problem.\n\nThe fix requires implementing standardized error response generation that always includes appropriate headers for each error type. Error response generation should use template-based approaches that ensure header consistency and should never forward headers from failed backend responses. Error responses should include correlation headers that enable request tracing without exposing internal architecture details.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Leaks During Connection Failures**\n\nWhen backend connections fail after successful establishment but before request completion, the request router must carefully manage resource cleanup to prevent connection leaks and inaccurate connection counting. Failed connection cleanup often introduces subtle resource leaks that accumulate over time and eventually cause connection pool exhaustion.\n\nThe symptom is gradually increasing connection counts that never decrease properly, eventually leading to \"too many open files\" errors or connection pool exhaustion. This often occurs during periods of backend instability when many connections are being established and torn down rapidly.\n\nThe fix requires implementing comprehensive resource cleanup using defer statements or try-finally blocks that execute regardless of how the request processing concludes. Connection counting must be decremented in all code paths that increment it, including error paths and panic recovery handlers. Connection cleanup must also handle partially established connections that fail during HTTP handshaking.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Request Processing Pipeline**\n\nRequest processing pipelines that include blocking operations without appropriate timeout handling can cause cascading failures where slow or unresponsive backends affect the router's ability to handle other requests. This is particularly problematic when backend selection algorithms or health state updates perform blocking operations during request processing.\n\nFor example, if the backend selection algorithm needs to acquire a lock on internal state and that lock is held by a goroutine performing a slow health check operation, all incoming requests will block waiting for backend selection to complete. This turns a problem with one component into a system-wide availability issue.\n\nThe fix requires implementing non-blocking patterns for all operations in the request processing pipeline, using timeouts for any operations that might block, and designing component interfaces to avoid holding locks during external operations. Backend selection should use lock-free algorithms where possible, and health state updates should use optimistic concurrency control rather than long-held exclusive locks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Logging During Failure Scenarios**\n\nRequest routing failures often result in incomplete or inconsistent log entries that make debugging difficult, especially when multiple error conditions occur simultaneously. This happens when different components use different logging formats, when error handling code paths don't include proper logging, or when log correlation data is lost during failure scenarios.\n\nThe symptom is log files that contain error messages without sufficient context to understand what went wrong, making it difficult to identify patterns in failures or correlate related events. Production debugging becomes particularly challenging when the information needed to understand a failure is spread across multiple log entries with different formats.\n\nThe fix requires implementing structured logging with consistent correlation IDs throughout the request processing pipeline. All error handling code paths must generate log entries with the same format and correlation data as success paths. Log entries should include sufficient context information to understand the failure without requiring correlation with other log entries, while still providing correlation IDs to enable cross-component tracing when needed.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe request router integration serves as the central coordinator that must handle complex interactions between multiple concurrent systems while maintaining high performance and reliability. This section provides concrete implementation guidance for building a robust request router that can handle the complexities of production traffic.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n- Use `context.WithTimeout()` to enforce request-level timeouts that propagate through the entire pipeline\n- Implement `defer` statements for resource cleanup that must execute in all code paths\n- Use `atomic.AddInt64()` for connection counting and metrics that need thread-safe updates  \n- Clone HTTP requests with `r.Clone(ctx)` to avoid modifying the original request during enhancement\n- Use `http.Error()` for simple error responses, but implement custom error response formatting for consistency\n- Handle `context.Canceled` and `context.DeadlineExceeded` explicitly to distinguish client disconnects from timeouts\n- Use buffered channels for component communication to prevent blocking in the request processing pipeline\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the request router integration:\n\n1. **Start the load balancer server**: `go run cmd/server/main.go`\n2. **Test basic request routing**: `curl -v http://localhost:8080/test` should return a response from a backend server\n3. **Verify error handling**: Stop all backend servers, then `curl -v http://localhost:8080/test` should return `503 Service Unavailable`\n4. **Check request correlation**: Look for `X-Request-ID` headers in responses and matching correlation IDs in log files\n5. **Validate pipeline stages**: Log entries should show progression through pipeline stages (reception → selection → forwarding → response)\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- Successful requests return backend responses with added proxy headers\n- Backend failures result in appropriate 5xx error responses with correlation IDs\n- Request metrics increment properly for both successful and failed requests\n- Log entries contain sufficient context for debugging without being overly verbose\n- Connection counts reflect actual backend connections and decrease after request completion\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- Missing correlation IDs in error responses indicates context loss during error handling\n- Connection counts that never decrease suggests resource leaks in cleanup code\n- Log entries without request context suggests error handling bypassing normal logging\n- Responses missing proxy headers indicates request enhancement stage failures\n- High memory usage over time suggests resource leaks in connection management\n\n**G. Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Requests hang indefinitely | Missing timeout handling in pipeline stages | Check for blocking operations without context timeouts | Add context.WithTimeout to all external calls |\n| Error responses missing correlation IDs | Context loss during error handling paths | Trace error handling code for context parameter passing | Ensure all error handlers receive and use request context |\n| Connection count constantly increasing | Resource leaks in connection cleanup | Monitor connection increment/decrement in logs | Add defer statements for connection cleanup in all code paths |\n| 502 errors for healthy backends | Race condition between health checks and routing | Check timing of health updates vs. request processing | Add connection-time health validation before forwarding |\n| Inconsistent load distribution | Algorithm state corruption during errors | Examine algorithm state after error scenarios | Implement proper error recovery in algorithm state management |\n| Memory usage growing over time | Request contexts not being garbage collected | Profile memory usage and examine context lifecycle | Ensure request contexts don't hold references to large objects |\n\n\n## Configuration and Runtime Control\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — configuration management is essential throughout the project, supporting backend registration (Milestone 2), health check parameters (Milestone 3), and algorithm selection (Milestone 4) with hot reload capabilities\n\n### Mental Model: Theater Program Changes\n\nThink of running a load balancer like managing a live theater production. During a performance, the theater director occasionally needs to make changes to the program — perhaps adding an understated actor when someone calls in sick, adjusting the lighting cues, or changing the intermission timing. These changes must happen seamlessly without stopping the show or disrupting the audience experience.\n\nIn a theater, the stage manager receives updated instructions from the director, validates that the changes make sense (the understudy knows the role, the new lighting cue won't blind the actors), and then coordinates with the crew to implement the changes during appropriate moments — perhaps between scenes or during natural breaks. The audience never sees the coordination happening behind the scenes.\n\nSimilarly, a load balancer must accept configuration updates while continuing to serve live traffic. When operators need to add new backend servers, adjust health check intervals, or switch load balancing algorithms, these changes should take effect without dropping existing connections or causing service interruptions. The configuration system acts like the stage manager, validating changes and coordinating their implementation across all components.\n\nJust as the theater maintains a master program that all crew members reference, the load balancer maintains a central configuration that all components — the HTTP proxy, backend manager, health checker, and algorithm engines — use as their source of truth. When this configuration changes, each component must gracefully adopt the new settings while preserving its current operational state.\n\n### Configuration Loading\n\nThe configuration loading system provides the foundation for how the load balancer discovers its operational parameters and validates their correctness before applying them. This system must handle both initial startup configuration and runtime updates, ensuring that invalid configurations never compromise system stability.\n\n**File-Based Configuration Structure**\n\nThe primary configuration mechanism uses structured files that operators can edit and deploy through standard configuration management tools. The configuration file contains all parameters needed to operate the load balancer, organized into logical sections that correspond to system components.\n\n| Configuration Section | Purpose | Key Parameters |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Port | HTTP listener configuration | Port number, bind address |\n| Backends | Backend server definitions | URLs, weights, connection limits, timeouts |\n| Algorithm | Load balancing strategy | Algorithm name, algorithm-specific parameters |\n| HealthCheck | Health monitoring settings | Intervals, thresholds, probe endpoints |\n| Proxy | HTTP proxy behavior | Timeouts, header limits, connection pooling |\n| Logging | Observability configuration | Log levels, output formats, destinations |\n\nThe `Config` structure represents the complete system configuration with strongly typed fields that enable compile-time validation and IDE assistance. Each backend server gets its own `BackendConfig` entry with comprehensive connection and timeout parameters that allow fine-tuning for different backend characteristics.\n\n**Configuration Validation Logic**\n\nBefore any configuration takes effect, the validation system performs comprehensive checks to ensure operational safety and logical consistency. This validation happens in multiple phases, from basic syntax checking to complex inter-dependency validation.\n\nThe validation process follows this sequence:\n\n1. **Syntax Validation**: Parse the configuration file format and verify all required fields are present with correct data types\n2. **Range Validation**: Check that numeric values fall within acceptable ranges (positive timeouts, valid port numbers)\n3. **URL Validation**: Verify that backend URLs are well-formed and use supported protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)\n4. **Dependency Validation**: Ensure referenced components exist (algorithm names match implemented algorithms)\n5. **Consistency Validation**: Check that related settings make logical sense together (health check timeout less than interval)\n6. **Resource Validation**: Verify that the configuration is achievable with available system resources\n\n| Validation Type | Check Performed | Example Failure | Recovery Action |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Syntax | JSON/YAML parsing | Malformed JSON | Reject configuration, keep current |\n| Range | Numeric bounds | Negative timeout | Reject configuration, log specific error |\n| URL Format | Backend URL parsing | Invalid hostname | Reject configuration, identify bad URL |\n| Algorithm | Known algorithm name | Typo in algorithm | Reject configuration, suggest alternatives |\n| Consistency | Cross-field validation | Timeout > interval | Reject configuration, explain conflict |\n| Resource | System capability | Too many backends | Reject configuration, suggest limits |\n\n**Error Handling and Fallback Behavior**\n\nWhen configuration loading encounters errors, the system must maintain operational stability while providing clear feedback about what went wrong. The error handling strategy prioritizes service availability over configuration updates.\n\n> **Critical Design Principle**: Configuration errors never bring down a running load balancer. Invalid updates are rejected while the current configuration remains active.\n\nThe error handling system categorizes failures by severity and recoverability:\n\n- **Fatal Errors**: Problems that prevent any operation (missing configuration file at startup)\n- **Validation Errors**: Invalid configuration content that can be corrected (bad syntax, invalid values)\n- **Warning Conditions**: Suboptimal but workable configuration (single backend server, very short timeouts)\n\nFor each error category, the system provides detailed diagnostic information including the specific configuration element that failed, the nature of the problem, and suggested corrections. This feedback helps operators quickly identify and fix configuration issues.\n\n> **Decision: Configuration Validation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Configuration errors can cause service outages or unpredictable behavior, but overly strict validation might prevent legitimate configurations\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Strict validation that rejects any questionable configuration\n>   2. Permissive validation that allows dubious but syntactically correct configuration\n>   3. Layered validation with errors vs warnings\n> - **Decision**: Implement layered validation with clear error/warning distinction\n> - **Rationale**: This approach prevents dangerous configurations while allowing operators flexibility for unusual but valid setups. Warning messages help operators understand potential issues without blocking deployments.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex validation logic but better operator experience and safer deployments\n\n### Hot Reload Mechanism\n\nThe hot reload mechanism enables configuration updates without service interruption, allowing operators to modify load balancer behavior while maintaining existing connections and preserving service availability. This capability is essential for production environments where downtime is unacceptable.\n\n![Configuration Hot Reload Sequence](./diagrams/configuration-update.svg)\n\n**Configuration Change Detection**\n\nThe hot reload system monitors for configuration changes through multiple mechanisms that accommodate different operational workflows. File-based monitoring watches for changes to configuration files on disk, while API-based updates provide programmatic configuration management integration.\n\nThe change detection system uses file system notifications (inotify on Linux, fsevents on macOS) to avoid polling overhead while ensuring rapid response to configuration updates. When file system notifications are unavailable, the system falls back to periodic file modification time checking with configurable intervals.\n\n| Detection Method | Mechanism | Latency | Use Case |\n|------------------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| File System Events | inotify/fsevents | < 100ms | Development, manual updates |\n| API Endpoint | HTTP POST | < 50ms | Automated deployment, orchestration |\n| Periodic Polling | Stat() calls | 1-30s | Fallback, network filesystems |\n| Signal Handling | SIGHUP | < 10ms | Traditional Unix administration |\n\n**Graceful Configuration Transitions**\n\nWhen a configuration update is detected and validated, the system must coordinate the transition across all components while preserving operational state. This coordination happens through a carefully orchestrated sequence that minimizes disruption.\n\nThe transition process follows these phases:\n\n1. **Preparation Phase**: Load and validate the new configuration without affecting current operations\n2. **Coordination Phase**: Notify all components of the pending configuration change and allow them to prepare\n3. **Transition Phase**: Switch components to the new configuration in dependency order\n4. **Validation Phase**: Verify that all components successfully adopted the new configuration\n5. **Cleanup Phase**: Release resources associated with the old configuration\n\nEach component implements a configuration transition interface that supports atomic updates with rollback capability. If any component fails to adopt the new configuration, the entire update is rolled back to maintain consistency.\n\n**Backend Pool Updates**\n\nBackend pool changes represent the most common configuration updates and require special handling to manage existing connections gracefully. When backend servers are added, removed, or modified, the system must update its internal state while respecting active connections.\n\nAdding new backend servers involves creating new `Backend` instances, initializing their health state, and registering them with the health checker before making them available for request routing. This process ensures that new backends are verified as healthy before receiving traffic.\n\nRemoving backend servers requires a more complex process to handle existing connections gracefully:\n\n1. **Mark for Removal**: Flag the backend as no longer accepting new requests\n2. **Drain Connections**: Allow existing requests to complete naturally\n3. **Health Check Cleanup**: Remove the backend from active health monitoring\n4. **Resource Cleanup**: Close connection pools and release backend-specific resources\n\nBackend configuration changes (weight adjustments, timeout modifications) can often be applied immediately since they don't affect connection state. However, changes that affect connection behavior (timeouts, limits) may require connection pool recreation.\n\n| Update Type | Immediate Effect | Graceful Actions | Rollback Requirements |\n|-------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Add Backend | Health check start | Register with algorithms | Remove from pool |\n| Remove Backend | Mark unavailable | Drain connections | Re-add to pool |\n| Weight Change | Update algorithms | None | Revert weight value |\n| Timeout Change | Update proxy config | Recreate connection pools | Revert timeouts |\n\n**Algorithm Switching**\n\nChanging load balancing algorithms during operation requires careful state management since different algorithms maintain different internal state structures. The algorithm switching process must preserve request distribution fairness while transitioning to the new selection strategy.\n\nThe switching process coordinates with the request router to ensure that in-flight requests complete using the current algorithm while new requests use the updated algorithm. This prevents inconsistent behavior during the transition window.\n\nSome algorithm transitions require state migration or reset:\n\n- **Round Robin to Weighted Round Robin**: Preserve current position in rotation\n- **Least Connections to IP Hash**: Reset connection tracking, build hash state\n- **Any Algorithm to Random**: No state preservation needed\n\n> **Decision: Algorithm State Preservation vs Reset**\n> - **Context**: When switching algorithms, existing state might be incompatible with the new algorithm's requirements\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Always preserve state and attempt migration\n>   2. Always reset state on algorithm changes\n>   3. Preserve when possible, reset when necessary\n> - **Decision**: Preserve compatible state, reset incompatible state with clear logging\n> - **Rationale**: This provides the best balance of consistency and performance. Compatible transitions maintain fairness, while incompatible transitions are handled safely with clear operator feedback.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex transition logic but better operational experience and fewer traffic distribution surprises\n\n**Health Check Parameter Updates**\n\nHealth check configuration changes affect the monitoring behavior for all backend servers and must be applied consistently across the entire backend pool. These updates can significantly impact system behavior, so they require careful coordination.\n\nInterval changes take effect at the next scheduled check cycle to avoid disrupting the current check timing. Threshold changes (healthy/unhealthy counts) are applied immediately but may trigger state reevaluation for backends near threshold boundaries.\n\nThe health checker must handle parameter updates atomically to prevent inconsistent checking behavior:\n\n1. **Pause Scheduling**: Stop scheduling new health checks temporarily\n2. **Update Configuration**: Apply new intervals, timeouts, and thresholds\n3. **Reevaluate State**: Check if current backend states remain valid under new thresholds\n4. **Resume Scheduling**: Restart periodic checking with new parameters\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe configuration and runtime control system involves several critical architecture decisions that affect both operational flexibility and implementation complexity. Each decision represents a trade-off between different operational requirements.\n\n> **Decision: Configuration Format Choice**\n> - **Context**: The configuration format affects both human readability and machine processing, with implications for validation, tooling, and operator experience\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. JSON for simplicity and universal parsing support\n>   2. YAML for human readability and comment support\n>   3. TOML for simplicity with better human readability than JSON\n> - **Decision**: Support both JSON and YAML with automatic format detection\n> - **Rationale**: JSON provides universal tooling support and parsing reliability, while YAML offers better operator experience with comments and readability. Supporting both accommodates different operational preferences and integration requirements.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex parsing logic but better flexibility for different deployment scenarios and operator preferences\n\n| Format | Pros | Cons | Best Use Case |\n|--------|------|------|---------------|\n| JSON | Universal support, strict syntax | No comments, less readable | Automated generation, APIs |\n| YAML | Human readable, supports comments | More complex parsing, indentation sensitive | Manual editing, documentation |\n| TOML | Simple syntax, good readability | Less widespread support | Small configurations |\n\n> **Decision: Hot Reload vs Restart Requirement**\n> - **Context**: Configuration updates can be handled either through service restart (simpler) or hot reload (more complex but zero downtime)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Require full service restart for all configuration changes\n>   2. Support hot reload for safe changes, restart for others\n>   3. Support hot reload for all configuration changes\n> - **Decision**: Implement hot reload for all changes with atomic rollback on failure\n> - **Rationale**: Production load balancers cannot afford downtime for routine configuration updates. Complete hot reload support enables operational flexibility and reduces deployment risk.\n> - **Consequences**: Significantly more complex implementation but essential for production operation and continuous deployment workflows\n\n> **Decision: Configuration Validation Strictness**\n> - **Context**: Configuration validation can be strict (reject questionable configs) or permissive (allow operator flexibility)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Strict validation that rejects any potentially problematic configuration\n>   2. Permissive validation that allows any syntactically correct configuration\n>   3. Layered validation with mandatory checks and optional warnings\n> - **Decision**: Implement layered validation with clear error vs warning classification\n> - **Rationale**: This approach prevents dangerous configurations while preserving operator flexibility for legitimate edge cases. Warning messages provide guidance without blocking valid but unusual configurations.\n> - **Consequences**: More nuanced validation logic but better operator experience and fewer false positives that block legitimate deployments\n\n**Configuration Storage and Persistence**\n\nThe configuration storage strategy determines how the system maintains authoritative configuration state and handles persistence across restarts. This decision affects both operational complexity and reliability requirements.\n\nThe system maintains configuration state in memory for runtime performance while persisting validated configurations to disk for restart recovery. This dual storage approach provides fast access for request processing while ensuring configuration durability.\n\n| Storage Location | Purpose | Update Frequency | Backup Requirements |\n|------------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Memory | Runtime access | Every request | Not applicable |\n| Local File | Persistence | On validation | Regular filesystem backup |\n| External Store | Centralized management | On deploy | Distributed backup |\n| Version Control | Change tracking | On commit | Repository backup |\n\n**Configuration Distribution in Multi-Instance Deployments**\n\nWhen multiple load balancer instances operate together, configuration distribution ensures consistency across all instances while accommodating network partitions and deployment timing differences.\n\nThe configuration distribution strategy must handle several challenges:\n\n- **Consistency**: All instances should eventually converge to the same configuration\n- **Availability**: Instance startup should not depend on external configuration services\n- **Versioning**: Configuration updates should be applied atomically across instances\n- **Rollback**: Failed deployments should be recoverable across all instances\n\n> **Decision: Configuration Distribution Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Multi-instance deployments need consistent configuration across all load balancer instances\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Centralized configuration service with polling\n>   2. File-based distribution with shared storage\n>   3. Each instance manages its own configuration independently\n> - **Decision**: File-based configuration with shared storage and local caching\n> - **Rationale**: This provides good consistency with operational simplicity. Shared storage handles distribution while local caching ensures availability during storage outages. Standard deployment tools can manage file distribution effectively.\n> - **Consequences**: Dependency on shared storage but simpler architecture than distributed configuration services\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nConfiguration and runtime control systems are prone to several categories of errors that can cause service disruptions or unpredictable behavior. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid common implementation mistakes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Partial Configuration Application**\n\nA common mistake is applying configuration updates partially when some components succeed in adopting new settings while others fail. This creates an inconsistent system state where different components operate with different configuration assumptions.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Partial configuration application can cause request routing failures, connection mismatches, and health check inconsistencies. For example, if the backend pool updates successfully but the health checker fails to adopt new thresholds, backends might be incorrectly marked as unhealthy.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement atomic configuration updates with all-or-nothing semantics. If any component fails to adopt the new configuration, roll back all changes and maintain the previous consistent state. Use two-phase configuration updates: validate all changes first, then apply all changes together.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Configuration Validation Race Conditions**\n\nWhen multiple configuration updates arrive simultaneously, validation logic can interfere with itself, leading to corrupted validation state or inconsistent rejection decisions.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Race conditions in validation can cause the system to accept invalid configurations or reject valid ones. This creates unpredictable behavior that's difficult to debug and can compromise system reliability.\n\n**How to fix**: Serialize configuration updates using a mutex or queue to ensure that only one configuration change is processed at a time. Validate against a consistent snapshot of current state rather than live state that might be changing during validation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks During Configuration Updates**\n\nEach configuration update creates new objects (backend instances, algorithm state, connection pools) but may fail to clean up old objects properly, leading to memory leaks over time.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Memory leaks eventually cause the load balancer to exhaust available memory and crash. Even small leaks become significant problems over time in production systems with frequent configuration updates.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement explicit lifecycle management for all configuration-related objects. Use reference counting or ownership tracking to ensure that old configurations are fully cleaned up when new configurations are applied. Include memory usage monitoring to detect leaks early.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Invalid Default Value Assumptions**\n\nConfiguration loading often assumes that missing configuration values should use \"reasonable\" defaults, but these defaults might not be appropriate for all deployment scenarios.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Inappropriate defaults can cause performance problems (timeouts too short), security issues (permissive settings), or operational difficulties (verbose logging). Operators might not realize that critical settings are using defaults rather than explicit values.\n\n**How to fix**: Make critical configuration explicit rather than defaulted. Provide clear documentation about default values and their implications. Consider requiring explicit values for settings that significantly affect behavior rather than silently applying defaults.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Configuration File Format Lock-in**\n\nChoosing a single configuration file format without considering future requirements can create operational difficulties when integration needs change.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Different operational tools and deployment pipelines have preferences for different configuration formats. Forcing operators to use an incompatible format creates unnecessary friction and may prevent integration with existing workflows.\n\n**How to fix**: Support multiple configuration formats or choose formats with broad tooling support. Implement format detection so operators can use their preferred format without explicit format specification. Document the trade-offs between different formats clearly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Configuration Inconsistencies**\n\nWhen health check parameters are updated, existing backend health states might become invalid under the new configuration, but the system continues using stale state information.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Stale health state can cause backends to remain in incorrect states (healthy when they should be unhealthy or vice versa) until the next natural state transition. This defeats the purpose of configuration updates and can impact traffic distribution.\n\n**How to fix**: Reevaluate all backend health states when health check configuration changes. Reset consecutive success/failure counters appropriately when thresholds change. Document which configuration changes trigger health state reevaluation.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe configuration and runtime control system requires careful implementation to balance flexibility, reliability, and performance.

`encoding/json` for JSON parsing and `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for YAML support\n- Implement custom `UnmarshalJSON` methods for duration fields to support human-readable formats like \"30s\", \"5m\"\n- Use `sync/atomic` for configuration pointer swapping to enable lock-free reads during updates\n- Use `context.Context` for cancellable file watching and configuration update operations\n- Leverage Go's zero values for optional configuration fields and document the behavior clearly\n\n**Validation Implementation Patterns**:\n\n```go\n// Example custom duration unmarshaling for human-readable timeouts\nfunc (d *Duration) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {\n    var v interface{}\n    if err := json.Unmarshal(b, &v); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    \n    switch value := v.(type) {\n    case float64:\n        *d = Duration(time.Duration(value) * time.Second)\n    case string:\n        duration, err := time.ParseDuration(value)\n        if err != nil {\n            return err\n        }\n        *d = Duration(duration)\n    default:\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"invalid duration format\")\n    }\n    \n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Configuration

Just as a hospital has protocols for different types of emergencies — cardiac arrest requires immediate CPR, while a broken bone needs stabilization and transport — the load balancer must recognize different failure patterns and respond appropriately. The triage nurse (error classifier) quickly assesses each situation, the emergency protocols (graceful degradation) keep critical systems running even when some equipment fails, and the circuit breaker acts like an automatic fire suppression system that stops spreading damage before it can cascade throughout the facility.\n\nThe key insight is that not all failures are created equal. A single backend timing out is like a patient with a minor injury — handle it quietly and move on. But when multiple backends start failing simultaneously, it's like a mass casualty event requiring coordinated response to prevent the entire system from collapse.\n\n### Failure Mode Analysis\n\nThe load balancer operates in a complex environment where failures can occur at multiple levels and cascade in unpredictable ways. Understanding the complete spectrum of possible failures allows the system to respond appropriately rather than treating all errors as equivalent catastrophes.\n\n**Network-Level Failures** represent the most common category of issues the load balancer encounters. Connection failures occur when the load balancer cannot establish TCP connections to backend servers, typically manifesting as connection refused errors when backends are down or connection timeout errors when backends are overloaded but still accepting connections slowly. DNS resolution failures can occur when backend hostnames cannot be resolved, either due to DNS server issues or misconfigured backend addresses. Network partitions represent more severe scenarios where network connectivity exists but is unreliable, leading to intermittent failures that can be particularly challenging to diagnose.\n\n**Backend Server Failures** encompass issues originating from the application servers themselves. Complete backend unavailability occurs when servers crash, are shut down for maintenance, or become completely unresponsive. Partial backend degradation happens when servers are running but experiencing high load, returning errors for some requests while successfully processing others. Application-level errors manifest as HTTP 5xx responses from backends that are otherwise healthy, indicating internal application issues rather than infrastructure problems. Resource exhaustion on backends can cause them to reject new connections or respond with errors even when the load balancer's health checks pass.\n\n**Load Balancer Internal Failures** can critically impact the entire system's operation. Algorithm selection failures occur when the chosen load balancing algorithm cannot select a backend, typically because no healthy backends are available or algorithm state has become corrupted. Health checker failures can leave the system with stale health information, potentially routing traffic to failed backends or excluding healthy ones from rotation. Configuration errors can cause the load balancer to operate with invalid backend lists, incorrect timeouts, or malformed routing rules.\n\n**Resource Exhaustion Scenarios** affect the load balancer's ability to handle incoming requests. Connection pool exhaustion occurs when all available connections to backends are in use, preventing new requests from being processed. Memory exhaustion can cause the load balancer itself to become unstable or crash. File descriptor exhaustion prevents new connections from being established either from clients or to backends.\n\n![Error Handling Decision Tree](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\nThe following table catalogs the primary failure modes, their detection mechanisms, and immediate impact on system operation:\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | System Impact | Time to Detect | Recovery Complexity |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Backend Connection Refused | TCP connection error | Request fails immediately | < 1 second | Low - automatic retry |\n| Backend Connection Timeout | Connect timeout expires | Request delayed then fails | 5-30 seconds | Medium - may indicate overload |\n| Backend Response Timeout | Read timeout expires | Request fails after delay | 30-120 seconds | Medium - backend may be struggling |\n| DNS Resolution Failure | Hostname lookup error | All requests to backend fail | 1-5 seconds | High - infrastructure issue |\n| Backend Returns 5xx Error | HTTP status code | Request fails with error | < 1 second | Low - application level |\n| All Backends Unhealthy | Health check failures | Service completely unavailable | 30-180 seconds | High - requires manual intervention |\n| Health Checker Failure | Health check process crash | Stale health information | Varies | High - monitoring blind spot |\n| Algorithm State Corruption | Selection returns null/error | Request routing fails | Immediate | Medium - algorithm reset needed |\n| Load Balancer Memory Exhaustion | Memory monitoring alerts | Performance degradation/crash | Minutes | High - requires restart |\n| Configuration File Corruption | Config parsing errors | Cannot reload configuration | Immediate | Medium - fix config and reload |\n\n**Cascade Failure Scenarios** represent the most dangerous category where initial failures trigger additional failures throughout the system. The classic scenario begins when one backend fails, increasing load on remaining backends, which may cause additional backends to fail under the increased pressure, eventually leading to complete service unavailability. Health check storms can occur when many backends fail simultaneously and then recover, causing a thundering herd of traffic that immediately overwhelms the recovering backends. Client retry storms happen when the load balancer starts returning errors, causing upstream clients to retry requests, multiplying the load on an already stressed system.\n\n**Timing-Related Failures** introduce subtle bugs that can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose. Race conditions in algorithm state updates can cause inconsistent backend selection or connection counting. Health check timing issues can cause backends to flap between healthy and unhealthy states. Configuration update races can leave the system in inconsistent states where different components are operating with different configuration versions.\n\n> The most critical insight for failure analysis is that the load balancer sits at a convergence point where failures from many different systems and layers can manifest. A single client request might fail due to DNS issues, network problems, backend overload, application bugs, or load balancer resource exhaustion. The error handling system must be sophisticated enough to distinguish between these different failure classes and respond appropriately to each.\n\n### Graceful Degradation Strategies\n\nGraceful degradation ensures the load balancer continues providing service even when operating under adverse conditions. The fundamental principle is to maintain the highest possible level of service availability by sacrificing non-essential functionality when resources become constrained or components fail.\n\n**Adaptive Backend Selection** represents the first line of defense against backend failures. When the health checking system identifies failed backends, the load balancer immediately excludes them from the selection pool, ensuring that client requests are only routed to backends capable of handling them. However, this simple approach can create problems if implemented naively. When backend capacity is reduced, the load balancer must account for the increased load on remaining backends and potentially implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent cascade failures.\n\nThe system implements a tiered backend classification approach rather than the binary healthy/unhealthy model. Backends are classified as: Primary (fully healthy, normal response times), Secondary (healthy but experiencing elevated response times or error rates), Degraded (functional but unreliable, use only if no better options), and Failed (completely unavailable). This classification allows the algorithm to prefer better backends while still utilizing degraded ones when necessary.\n\n**Request Admission Control** provides protection against overwhelming the system during high load or reduced backend capacity. Rather than accepting all incoming requests and allowing them to fail at backend selection time, the load balancer can implement admission control that rejects requests early when system capacity is constrained. This approach is counterintuitive but essential — by rejecting some requests immediately with proper error responses, the system can successfully process more requests than if it attempted to handle all incoming traffic.\n\nThe admission control mechanism monitors several key metrics: current backend capacity (number of healthy backends multiplied by their individual capacity), request queue depth, average response time, and error rate trends. When these metrics indicate the system is approaching overload, admission control begins rejecting a percentage of incoming requests, starting with the least critical traffic if request prioritization is configured.\n\n**Degraded Mode Operations** allow the load balancer to continue functioning even when supporting systems fail. When the health checking system fails, the load balancer can operate in static mode using the last known good health states, gradually reducing confidence in this information over time. If configuration hot reloading fails, the system continues operating with the current configuration while logging errors and attempting periodic reload retries.\n\nDuring degraded operations, the system reduces functionality rather than failing completely. Complex algorithms like least connections may fall back to simpler round-robin selection if connection tracking becomes unreliable. Detailed request logging might be disabled to reduce I/O load. Non-essential monitoring endpoints may return simplified responses to reduce processing overhead.\n\n**Circuit Breaker Integration** prevents the load balancer from repeatedly attempting operations that are likely to fail, reducing resource waste and improving response times. Each backend has an associated circuit breaker that monitors error rates and response times. When error thresholds are exceeded, the circuit breaker opens, immediately failing requests to that backend without attempting connection. This prevents the load balancer from wasting time and resources on backends that are known to be failing.\n\nThe circuit breaker implements three states: Closed (normal operation), Open (failing fast), and Half-Open (testing recovery). In the closed state, requests proceed normally while the circuit breaker monitors error rates. When failure thresholds are exceeded, the circuit opens, immediately returning errors for all requests to that backend. After a configured timeout period, the circuit enters half-open state, allowing a limited number of test requests through. If these succeed, the circuit closes and normal operation resumes. If they fail, the circuit reopens for another timeout period.\n\n**Partial Service Availability** ensures that even when some functionality is unavailable, the core request routing capability continues operating. If the health checking system fails completely, the load balancer can continue routing requests using the last known backend health states, with appropriate warnings in responses indicating degraded operation. If specific load balancing algorithms fail due to state corruption, the system can fall back to simpler algorithms that require less state management.\n\nThe following table outlines the degradation strategies for different failure scenarios:\n\n| Failure Scenario | Degradation Strategy | Functionality Retained | Functionality Lost | Recovery Trigger |\n|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Single Backend Failed | Exclude from rotation | Full service with reduced capacity | None - transparent to clients | Backend health recovery |\n| Multiple Backends Failed | Admission control + reduced capacity | Core routing with selective rejection | Full request handling guarantee | Backend capacity restoration |\n| Health Checker Failed | Static health state + gradual degradation | Request routing with stale data | Automatic failure detection | Health checker restart |\n| Primary Algorithm Failed | Fallback to simple round-robin | Basic load distribution | Advanced algorithm features | Algorithm state recovery |\n| Configuration System Failed | Continue with last known config | Stable operation | Configuration updates | Config system restoration |\n| Partial Network Connectivity | Route to reachable backends only | Service to accessible regions | Global load distribution | Network connectivity restoration |\n\n> The key insight for graceful degradation is that availability is more valuable than perfection. A load balancer that serves 80% of requests successfully is infinitely better than one that fails completely while trying to maintain 100% functionality. The art lies in determining which 80% to serve and how to fail gracefully for the remaining 20%.\n\n**Progressive Degradation Levels** provide a structured approach to reducing functionality as conditions worsen. Level 0 represents normal operation with all features enabled. Level 1 disables non-essential features like detailed metrics collection and verbose logging. Level 2 simplifies algorithms and reduces health check frequency. Level 3 implements admission control and disables advanced routing features. Level 4 represents minimal functionality with only basic round-robin distribution and static backend lists.\n\nEach degradation level has clear entry and exit criteria based on system health metrics. The system automatically transitions between levels based on conditions, but also provides manual override capabilities for operational control during maintenance or emergency situations.\n\n### Circuit Breaker Pattern\n\nThe circuit breaker pattern provides a critical protection mechanism that prevents the load balancer from repeatedly attempting operations that are likely to fail, while also providing a pathway for automatic recovery when conditions improve. Unlike simple timeout mechanisms that wait for each request to fail individually, circuit breakers learn from failure patterns and proactively prevent resource waste.\n\n**Circuit Breaker State Management** implements a state machine with three distinct states, each optimized for different failure scenarios. The Closed state represents normal operation where requests flow through to backends normally, but the circuit breaker continuously monitors error rates, response times, and other health indicators. Statistical tracking includes rolling windows of success/failure counts, recent response time percentiles, and consecutive failure streaks.\n\nWhen failure thresholds are exceeded in the Closed state, the circuit immediately transitions to Open state. In the Open state, all requests to the affected backend fail immediately with circuit breaker errors, preventing resource waste on operations that are likely to fail. This provides immediate feedback to clients while protecting backend servers from additional load that might prevent their recovery. The circuit breaker maintains the Open state for a configured timeout period, allowing the backend time to recover without additional request pressure.\n\nAfter the timeout period expires, the circuit enters Half-Open state, which serves as a careful testing phase for backend recovery. In Half-Open state, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests through to the backend while continuing to fail-fast for all other requests. If the test requests succeed, indicating the backend has recovered, the circuit transitions back to Closed state and normal operation resumes. If the test requests fail, the circuit immediately returns to Open state for another timeout period.\n\n**Per-Backend Circuit Breaker Configuration** recognizes that different backends may have different failure characteristics and recovery patterns. High-capacity backends might tolerate higher error rates before circuit breaking, while smaller backends might need more aggressive protection. Database backends might have longer recovery times requiring extended Open state timeouts, while stateless web services might recover quickly.\n\nThe circuit breaker configuration includes several key parameters: failure rate threshold (percentage of requests that must fail to open the circuit), minimum request count (circuits don't open until sufficient data is available), timeout duration (how long to stay in Open state), half-open request count (number of test requests in recovery phase), and monitoring window duration (time period for calculating failure rates).\n\n```\nCircuit Breaker State Transitions:\nClosed → Open: failure_rate > threshold AND request_count >= minimum\nOpen → Half-Open: timeout_duration elapsed\nHalf-Open → Closed: test_requests_successful >= required_successes  \nHalf-Open → Open: any_test_request_failed\n```\n\n**Integration with Health Checking** creates a comprehensive backend protection system where circuit breakers provide immediate failure response while health checks provide longer-term backend monitoring. Circuit breakers react to request-level failures within seconds, while health checks monitor backend availability over minutes. The two systems complement each other — circuit breakers prevent immediate damage from failed requests, while health checks provide the authoritative backend health state for load balancing decisions.\n\nWhen a circuit breaker opens for a backend, this information influences but doesn't override health check status. A backend might be healthy according to health checks but have an open circuit breaker due to high error rates under load. Conversely, a backend marked unhealthy by health checks will have its circuit breaker opened to prevent any test traffic until health recovery is confirmed.\n\n**Circuit Breaker Metrics and Observability** provide essential visibility into failure patterns and system protection effectiveness. Key metrics include circuit state transitions over time, failure rates leading to circuit opening, recovery success rates, and request volume reduction during circuit open periods. These metrics help operators understand system behavior and tune circuit breaker parameters for optimal protection.\n\nThe circuit breaker maintains detailed logs of state transitions including timestamps, triggering conditions, and relevant metrics at transition time. This information proves invaluable for post-incident analysis and system tuning. Circuit breaker dashboards should display current state for all backends, recent state transition history, and trending metrics that might indicate approaching threshold breaches.\n\n**Advanced Circuit Breaker Patterns** extend the basic three-state model to handle more complex failure scenarios. Adaptive thresholds adjust failure rate requirements based on overall system load and backend capacity. During high load periods, circuits might tolerate higher error rates before opening, recognizing that some failures are inevitable under stress.\n\nCascading circuit breakers coordinate between related backends to prevent failure spread. When a primary backend's circuit opens, related backup backends might automatically reduce their failure thresholds, recognizing that they're likely to experience increased load and potential secondary failures.\n\nThe following table describes circuit breaker behavior for different failure patterns:\n\n| Failure Pattern | Circuit Breaker Response | Protection Provided | Recovery Strategy | Monitoring Focus |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Intermittent Errors | Remains closed until threshold | None - errors passed through | Automatic - no action needed | Error rate trending |\n| Steady High Error Rate | Opens after threshold breach | Immediate fail-fast | Half-open testing after timeout | Error rate stability |\n| Complete Backend Failure | Opens immediately on 100% errors | Full protection from dead backend | Coordinated with health checks | Backend recovery signals |\n| Slow Response Times | Opens based on timeout thresholds | Prevents request queuing | Response time improvement | Latency percentiles |\n| Resource Exhaustion | Opens on connection/resource errors | Prevents resource waste | Backend capacity restoration | Resource utilization metrics |\n| Cascade Failure | Coordinated opening across backends | System-wide protection | Staged recovery testing | Cross-backend correlation |\n\n> The circuit breaker pattern embodies the principle of failing fast and recovering gracefully. By quickly detecting failure patterns and stopping wasteful operations, circuit breakers not only protect the load balancer's resources but often help backends recover more quickly by reducing the load pressure that contributed to their failure.\n\n**Circuit Breaker Implementation Considerations** address the practical challenges of implementing effective circuit breaking in a high-throughput load balancer. Thread safety becomes critical when multiple concurrent requests might simultaneously detect failure conditions and attempt to change circuit state. The implementation uses atomic operations for state changes and careful synchronization around shared data structures.\n\nMemory management for circuit breaker statistics requires attention to prevent memory leaks from accumulating failure data. Rolling windows for error rate calculation must efficiently add new data points while discarding old ones. The implementation uses circular buffers and periodic cleanup to maintain bounded memory usage even during extended operation periods.\n\nIntegration with load balancing algorithms requires careful coordination to ensure circuit breaker state changes are immediately reflected in backend selection decisions. When a circuit opens, the backend must be immediately excluded from algorithm consideration. When circuits close, backends should be gradually reintroduced rather than immediately receiving full traffic allocation.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Treating All Errors Equally**\nMany load balancer implementations handle all errors with the same generic \"502 Bad Gateway\" response, losing valuable diagnostic information. A DNS resolution failure indicates a configuration problem requiring immediate attention, while a backend timeout might indicate normal load fluctuation. The error handling system must classify errors appropriately and generate responses that help operators and clients understand the underlying issue. Implement specific error classification logic that examines error types, sources, and contexts to provide meaningful error responses.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circuit Breaker Thundering Herd**\nWhen multiple circuit breakers transition from Open to Half-Open simultaneously, the resulting test traffic can immediately overwhelm recovering backends, causing them to fail again and preventing successful recovery. This occurs when multiple backends fail and recover simultaneously, or when circuit breaker timeouts are configured with identical values. Implement jittered timeout values and coordinated recovery strategies that stagger test traffic across time and backends.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Masking Circuit Breaker State**\nHealth checks that only test basic connectivity may report backends as healthy even when they're experiencing high error rates under load, leading to circuit breaker conflicts where backends appear healthy but circuits remain open. Design health checks to include load testing elements that simulate real request patterns, and ensure circuit breaker state influences backend availability decisions even when health checks pass.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Error Context Propagation**\nError responses that don't include correlation IDs, backend identifiers, or failure timestamps make debugging nearly impossible in distributed environments. When a request fails, operators need to understand which backend failed, what type of failure occurred, and how to correlate the failure with logs and monitoring systems. Implement comprehensive error context that includes request correlation IDs, backend selection details, failure classifications, and timestamps.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cascading Timeout Configuration**\nWhen load balancer timeouts are longer than client timeouts, clients give up and retry while the load balancer continues processing the original request, leading to resource waste and duplicate processing. Conversely, when load balancer timeouts are too short compared to backend processing times, requests that would eventually succeed are prematurely failed. Carefully configure timeout hierarchies where each layer has appropriate timeout values that account for downstream processing times and expected client behavior.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Error Tracking**\nError tracking systems that accumulate failure statistics without bounds can consume unbounded memory over time, especially in high-traffic environments with frequent failures. Circuit breaker statistics, error rate calculations, and failure logs must implement proper cleanup and bounded data structures. Use rolling windows with fixed sizes, periodic cleanup of old error data, and memory usage monitoring to prevent error tracking from becoming a source of failures.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling implementation requires careful integration with all load balancer components while maintaining clear separation of concerns and comprehensive failure coverage.\n\n**A.

Just as a car manufacturer tests individual components (engine, brakes, transmission) in isolation before integrating them into a complete vehicle for road testing, we must validate load balancer components independently before testing the entire system end-to-end.\n\nThe **unit testing** stage resembles testing individual car parts on specialized benches — we verify each algorithm, health checker, and proxy component works correctly in controlled conditions with predictable inputs. The **integration testing** stage is like road testing the complete vehicle — we run the assembled load balancer against real HTTP servers, inject failures, and verify it handles complex real-world scenarios. The **milestone validation** checkpoints act like quality gates between assembly line stages — each component must pass specific criteria before moving to the next integration level.\n\nThis layered approach ensures that when something breaks during complex integration testing, we can quickly isolate whether the problem lies in individual component logic or in the interaction between components. Just as automotive quality assurance catches defects early when they're cheapest to fix, our testing strategy identifies load balancer issues at the appropriate level of granularity.\n\n### The Testing Philosophy\n\nA comprehensive testing strategy for a load balancer must address the unique challenges of distributed systems testing. Unlike testing a simple web application, load balancer testing involves multiple moving parts: backend servers that can fail, network connections that can timeout, concurrent requests that can create race conditions, and health checks that must detect failures accurately without overwhelming backends.\n\nThe testing pyramid for load balancers has three distinct layers, each serving different purposes. **Unit tests** verify individual algorithms and components work correctly in isolation with mocked dependencies. **Integration tests** validate that components work together correctly and handle real network failures, server responses, and timing issues. **Milestone validation checkpoints** provide structured verification that each development phase produces working functionality before moving to more complex features.\n\nThe key insight is that load balancer testing must simulate failure conditions extensively, since the primary value of load balancing is handling backend failures gracefully. A load balancer that works perfectly when all backends are healthy but fails catastrophically when backends go down is worse than no load balancer at all. Therefore, our testing strategy emphasizes failure injection, concurrent request handling, and edge case validation.\n\n> **Design Principle**: Test failure scenarios as thoroughly as success scenarios. A load balancer's value comes from handling failures gracefully, so failure conditions must be first-class citizens in the test suite.\n\n### Testing Challenges and Approaches\n\nLoad balancer testing presents several unique challenges that require specialized approaches. **Race condition detection** is critical because multiple concurrent requests can expose subtle bugs in counter incrementation, connection tracking, and backend selection. **Timing-sensitive behavior** like health check intervals and circuit breaker timeouts requires careful test design to avoid flaky tests that fail intermittently. **Network simulation** must replicate real-world conditions like connection timeouts, DNS failures, and partial response reads.\n\nOur testing approach addresses these challenges through deterministic mocking for unit tests, controlled integration environments with fault injection capabilities, and structured milestone validation that builds confidence incrementally. The testing strategy emphasizes **reproducible failure scenarios** where we can reliably trigger specific error conditions, measure the system's response, and verify recovery behavior.\n\n## Unit Testing Approach\n\nUnit testing for load balancer components focuses on testing individual algorithms, health checkers, and request forwarders in isolation with predictable, controlled inputs. The goal is to verify that each component's core logic works correctly without dependencies on network I/O, timing, or external services.\n\n### Algorithm Testing Strategy\n\nLoad balancing algorithm testing requires validating both correctness and concurrency safety. Each algorithm must demonstrate correct selection behavior under normal conditions and maintain consistency under concurrent access patterns that simulate real load balancer usage.\n\n**Round Robin Algorithm Testing** focuses on verifying sequential selection with proper wraparound behavior. The test suite creates a pool of mock backends and verifies that the `RoundRobin` algorithm selects each backend exactly once before cycling back to the first. Concurrency testing spawns multiple goroutines making simultaneous selection calls and verifies that no backend is skipped and the distribution remains even within acceptable variance.\n\n| Test Scenario | Input | Expected Output | Verification Method |\n|--------------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Sequential Selection | 3 backends, 6 requests | Backends selected in order: 0,1,2,0,1,2 | Assert sequence matches expected pattern |\n| Empty Backend Pool | Empty slice | Error or nil return | Verify graceful handling without panic |\n| Single Backend | 1 backend, 5 requests | Same backend selected 5 times | Assert all selections return same backend |\n| Concurrent Access | 1000 concurrent requests | Even distribution ±5% | Statistical analysis of selection counts |\n| Counter Overflow | Max int64 counter value | Proper wraparound behavior | Verify counter resets without errors |\n\n**Weighted Round Robin Algorithm Testing** validates proportional distribution according to backend weights. The algorithm must ensure that over a sufficient number of selections, each backend receives requests proportional to its weight while avoiding burst selections of high-weight backends (smooth weighted round robin behavior).\n\n| Test Scenario | Backend Weights | Request Count | Expected Distribution | Tolerance |\n|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Equal Weights | [5,5,5] | 300 requests | [100,100,100] | ±5% |\n| Unequal Weights | [1,2,3] | 600 requests | [100,200,300] | ±5% |\n| Zero Weight | [1,0,2] | 300 requests | [100,0,200] | ±5% |\n| Large Weight Difference | [1,100] | 1010 requests | [10,1000] | ±2% |\n| Weight Changes | [1,1] → [1,3] | Before/after distribution | Smooth transition | Manual verification |\n\n**Least Connections Algorithm Testing** verifies selection of backends with minimum active connections. The test suite manually sets connection counts for mock backends and verifies that the algorithm consistently selects the backend with the fewest active connections, with proper tie-breaking behavior when multiple backends have equal connection counts.\n\n**IP Hash Algorithm Testing** validates consistent client-to-backend mapping. The same client IP must always map to the same backend (session affinity), and the hash distribution should be reasonably uniform across different IP addresses. Testing includes edge cases like IPv4 vs IPv6 addresses and hash collision handling.\n\n### Health Checker Component Testing\n\nHealth checker testing focuses on the `HealthChecker` component's ability to track backend health state accurately and transition between healthy and unhealthy states according to configured thresholds. Since health checking involves timing and network I/O, unit tests use mock HTTP clients and controllable time sources.\n\n**Health State Transitions** testing verifies the state machine behavior defined in the `HealthState` structure. Tests manually trigger probe successes and failures to verify that backends transition from healthy to unhealthy after exceeding the `UnhealthyThreshold` consecutive failures, and back to healthy after exceeding the `HealthyThreshold` consecutive successes.\n\n| Current State | Event | Expected New State | Additional Verifications |\n|--------------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Healthy | Single failure | Healthy | `ConsecutiveFailures` = 1 |\n| Healthy | 3 consecutive failures | Unhealthy | `LastFailureTime` updated |\n| Unhealthy | Single success | Unhealthy | `ConsecutiveSuccesses` = 1 |\n| Unhealthy | 2 consecutive successes | Healthy | `LastSuccessTime` updated |\n| Healthy | Success after failure | Healthy | Counters reset properly |\n\n**Probe Result Processing** testing validates the `HTTPProber` component's ability to interpret HTTP responses correctly. Tests use a mock HTTP server that returns controlled status codes, timeouts, and connection errors to verify that the prober classifies responses correctly as healthy or unhealthy according to the configured `ExpectedStatus`.\n\n**Concurrent Health Checking** testing verifies thread safety when multiple health check operations run simultaneously. Tests spawn multiple goroutines calling health check methods concurrently and verify that health state updates are atomic and no race conditions corrupt the backend health tracking data structures.\n\n### Backend Pool Manager Testing\n\nThe `BackendManager` component requires testing of backend registration, health state tracking, and thread-safe access to the backend pool. Unit tests focus on the core logic without network dependencies by using mock backends and health checkers.\n\n**Backend Registration** testing verifies the `AddBackend` and `RemoveBackend` methods work correctly. Tests add backends with various configurations, verify they appear in the pool with correct initial state, remove backends, and verify they no longer appear in selection results.\n\n**Health State Integration** testing validates that the backend manager correctly integrates with health checking results. Tests simulate health state changes and verify that `GetHealthyBackends` returns only currently healthy backends, and that unhealthy backends are excluded from algorithm selection.\n\n**Connection Tracking** testing verifies the `IncrementConnections` and `DecrementConnections` methods maintain accurate connection counts per backend. Tests simulate concurrent connection establishment and closure to verify that connection counting is thread-safe and accurate.\n\n| Test Operation Sequence | Expected Connection Count | Verification Method |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| Increment, Increment, Decrement | 1 | Assert `GetActiveConnections()` returns 1 |\n| 100 concurrent increments | 100 | Verify no race condition corruption |\n| Decrement below zero | 0 | Verify count doesn't go negative |\n| Reset backend state | 0 | Verify counter resets properly |\n\n### Request Forwarding Testing\n\nThe `ReverseProxy` component's HTTP request forwarding logic requires testing of header manipulation, request body handling, and error response generation. Unit tests use mock HTTP servers and clients to verify request forwarding behavior without real network dependencies.\n\n**Header Forwarding** testing verifies that HTTP headers are copied correctly between client requests and backend requests. Tests create requests with various header combinations and verify that all headers are forwarded, forbidden headers are filtered out, and forwarding headers like `X-Forwarded-For` are added correctly.\n\n**Request Body Handling** testing validates that request bodies of various sizes and content types are forwarded correctly without corruption. Tests use requests with JSON payloads, binary data, and streaming bodies to verify that the proxy correctly streams request data to backends without buffering limitations.\n\n**Error Response Generation** testing verifies that various backend failure modes result in appropriate HTTP error responses to clients. Tests simulate connection failures, timeouts, and invalid responses to verify that the proxy returns correct status codes (502 Bad Gateway, 504 Gateway Timeout) with appropriate error messages.\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Unit Testing\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Testing with Real Network I/O**\nMany developers write unit tests that make actual HTTP requests to localhost servers or external services. This makes tests slow, flaky, and dependent on network conditions. Instead, use mock HTTP servers that return controlled responses, or mock the HTTP client interface entirely to return predetermined responses and errors.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Race Conditions**\nLoad balancer algorithms involve shared state (counters, connection counts, health states) that can be corrupted by concurrent access. Tests must specifically verify thread safety by spawning multiple goroutines and checking that results remain consistent. A test that passes in single-threaded execution may fail under concurrent load.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Error Scenario Coverage**\nDevelopers often test only the happy path where all backends are healthy and responsive. Load balancers must handle various failure modes gracefully, so unit tests must cover scenarios like empty backend pools, all backends unhealthy, network timeouts, and invalid responses.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Non-Deterministic Test Assertions**\nTests that rely on exact timing, random number generation, or hash functions may produce different results on different runs or platforms. Use controlled time sources, seeded random number generators, and statistical assertions (within tolerance ranges) rather than exact equality checks.\n\n## Integration Testing\n\nIntegration testing validates that load balancer components work together correctly in realistic environments with actual HTTP servers, network connections, and failure injection. Unlike unit tests that use mocks, integration tests exercise the complete request processing pipeline from client request receipt through backend selection, health checking, and response forwarding.\n\n### End-to-End Request Processing\n\nIntegration tests must verify the complete request lifecycle through the load balancer system. This involves starting a real load balancer instance, configuring it with multiple backend servers, sending HTTP requests from test clients, and verifying that requests are distributed correctly and responses are returned properly.\n\n**Multi-Backend Distribution Testing** creates multiple HTTP test servers (typically 3-5 backends) that return unique responses identifying which backend served the request. Test clients send a series of requests through the load balancer and verify that requests are distributed according to the configured algorithm (round-robin, weighted, etc.) and that all responses are received correctly.\n\nThe test environment setup involves starting backend servers on different ports, configuring the load balancer with the backend addresses, waiting for health checks to mark all backends healthy, then executing the request sequence. Each backend server logs incoming requests so that distribution patterns can be verified independently of response analysis.\n\n| Test Scenario | Backend Count | Request Count | Algorithm | Verification Method |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Round Robin Distribution | 3 backends | 30 requests | `round_robin` | Each backend gets 10 requests ±1 |\n| Weighted Distribution | 3 backends (weights 1:2:3) | 60 requests | `weighted_round_robin` | Distribution 10:20:30 ±5% |\n| Least Connections | 3 backends | Variable load | `least_connections` | Requests flow to least loaded |\n| IP Hash Consistency | 3 backends | Same client IP | `ip_hash` | All requests to same backend |\n| Algorithm Switching | 3 backends | Before/after switch | Runtime change | Distribution changes correctly |\n\n**Header and Body Preservation** testing verifies that HTTP requests are forwarded to backends without corruption. Test clients send requests with various header combinations, different content types, and request bodies of varying sizes. Backend servers echo back the received headers and bodies so that the test can verify no information is lost or modified during forwarding.\n\nCritical headers to test include `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, custom application headers, and headers containing special characters or Unicode content. Request bodies to test include JSON payloads, form data, binary content, and large bodies that exceed typical buffer sizes to verify streaming behavior.\n\n### Failure Injection and Recovery\n\nIntegration testing must validate that the load balancer handles various failure modes gracefully and recovers properly when backends return to healthy state. This requires controlled failure injection that simulates real-world backend problems.\n\n**Backend Server Failures** are simulated by stopping backend servers during active request processing. Tests verify that in-flight requests to the failed backend receive appropriate error responses (502 Bad Gateway), new requests are redirected to healthy backends, and the failed backend is marked unhealthy by the health checking system.\n\nThe test sequence involves establishing steady request traffic across all backends, stopping one backend server, verifying that requests continue to be served by remaining backends with minimal error rate, then restarting the backend and verifying that it's restored to the rotation after successful health checks.\n\n**Network Partition Simulation** tests scenarios where backends are reachable but respond slowly or partially. This is implemented using proxy servers that introduce controlled delays, drop connections at specific points, or return partial responses. The load balancer must handle these conditions with appropriate timeouts and error responses.\n\n| Failure Mode | Simulation Method | Expected Behavior | Recovery Verification |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Backend crash | Kill backend process | 502 errors, traffic redirected | Health checks restore backend |\n| Slow response | Add response delay | Timeouts, failover to healthy backends | Fast backends handle load |\n| Connection drops | Close connections mid-response | Connection errors, retry logic | New connections succeed |\n| Invalid responses | Return malformed HTTP | Parse errors, backend marked unhealthy | Valid responses restore health |\n| DNS failure | Invalid backend hostname | Connection failures, backend excluded | DNS resolution restores backend |\n\n**Health Check Validation** testing verifies that the health checking system accurately detects backend problems and recovers backends appropriately. Tests configure backends to return different health check responses (success, failure, timeout) and verify that the health checker transitions backend states correctly according to the configured thresholds.\n\nThe test setup includes mock backends that can be controlled to return specific health check responses on command. Tests verify that backends are marked unhealthy after the configured number of consecutive failures, excluded from request routing while unhealthy, and restored after consecutive successful health checks.\n\n### Concurrent Load Testing\n\nLoad balancer integration testing must verify correct behavior under concurrent request load that simulates realistic production conditions. This involves spawning multiple client goroutines that send requests simultaneously while monitoring for race conditions, uneven distribution, and performance degradation.\n\n**High Concurrency Distribution** testing spawns hundreds of concurrent client goroutines that each send multiple requests through the load balancer. The test verifies that request distribution remains statistically correct under high concurrency and that no backends are overwhelmed while others remain idle.\n\nThe test monitors backend request counts in real-time and calculates distribution variance across backends. For round-robin algorithms, the variance should remain low even under high concurrent load. For weighted algorithms, the distribution should match configured weights within acceptable tolerance.\n\n**Race Condition Detection** focuses on scenarios that can expose subtle concurrency bugs in counter incrementation, backend selection, and health state updates. Tests specifically design request patterns that maximize the likelihood of race conditions, such as synchronized request bursts and rapid backend state changes.\n\n| Concurrency Test | Concurrent Clients | Requests per Client | Duration | Success Criteria |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|\n| Distribution Accuracy | 100 goroutines | 10 requests each | 30 seconds | ±5% distribution variance |\n| Race Condition Detection | 500 goroutines | 20 requests each | 60 seconds | No panics, consistent counters |\n| Mixed Algorithm Load | 200 goroutines | Continuous requests | 2 minutes | Algorithm switching works |\n| Health Check Integration | 100 goroutines | Continuous requests | 5 minutes | Health changes don't break distribution |\n| Connection Tracking | 300 goroutines | Keep-alive requests | 90 seconds | Connection counts accurate |\n\n**Backend Failure During Load** combines high concurrent request load with backend failures to verify that the load balancer maintains service availability and doesn't cascade failures. Tests establish high request rates across all backends, then systematically fail backends while monitoring error rates and response times.\n\n### Configuration and Runtime Changes\n\nIntegration testing must validate that configuration changes can be applied during operation without dropping existing connections or causing service interruption. This includes adding and removing backends, changing algorithms, and updating health check settings.\n\n**Hot Configuration Reload** testing modifies the load balancer configuration file while the system is actively processing requests. Tests verify that configuration changes take effect without interrupting ongoing requests and that new requests use the updated configuration immediately.\n\nThe test procedure involves establishing steady request traffic, modifying configuration parameters (backend list, algorithm, health check intervals), triggering configuration reload, and verifying that behavior changes appropriately without connection drops or request failures.\n\n**Backend Pool Updates** testing adds and removes backends from the pool during active request processing. Tests verify that new backends are integrated smoothly after health checks confirm they're healthy, and removed backends don't receive new requests but complete existing requests properly.\n\n### Performance and Resource Usage\n\nIntegration testing includes performance validation to ensure the load balancer doesn't introduce excessive latency or resource consumption. Performance tests measure request latency, throughput, memory usage, and connection overhead compared to direct backend access.\n\n**Latency Impact Measurement** compares response times for requests sent directly to backends versus requests processed through the load balancer. The load balancer should add minimal latency overhead (typically <5ms) for request processing and forwarding.\n\n**Throughput Testing** measures the maximum request rate the load balancer can sustain while maintaining correct distribution and error handling. Tests gradually increase request rate until error rates exceed acceptable thresholds or response times degrade significantly.\n\n**Memory Usage Monitoring** tracks memory consumption during extended operation to verify that the load balancer doesn't have memory leaks in connection pooling, health checking, or request processing. Tests run for extended periods (hours) while monitoring memory usage patterns.\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Integration Testing\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Test Environment Isolation**\nIntegration tests often fail when run concurrently or on shared systems because they compete for ports, file descriptors, or other system resources. Each test should use unique port ranges, temporary directories, and isolated configuration to avoid conflicts with other tests or system services.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Test Setup**\nTests that start multiple servers and immediately begin sending requests may fail because servers haven't finished initializing or health checks haven't completed. Include proper synchronization to wait for all components to be ready before starting test operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unrealistic Failure Scenarios**\nTests that simulate failures by immediately killing processes or cutting network connections may not reflect realistic failure modes where backends degrade gradually or become partially responsive. Include tests for gradual degradation, intermittent failures, and partial response scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Cleanup**\nIntegration tests that don't properly clean up started servers, open connections, or temporary files can cause resource exhaustion and test failures. Implement proper test teardown that ensures all resources are released even if tests fail or panic.\n\n## Milestone Validation Checkpoints\n\nMilestone validation checkpoints provide structured verification that each development phase produces working functionality before proceeding to more complex features. Each checkpoint includes specific behavioral criteria, testing commands, and debugging guidance to ensure learners can validate their progress systematically.\n\n### Milestone 1: HTTP Proxy Foundation Validation\n\nThe HTTP Proxy Foundation milestone validation ensures that basic reverse proxy functionality works correctly for single-backend forwarding before implementing load balancing algorithms.\n\n**Functional Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Start Backend Server**: Launch a simple HTTP server on port 8081 that returns a JSON response containing the request path and timestamp: `{\"path\": \"/test\", \"backend\": \"server1\", \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z\"}`.\n\n2. **Configure Load Balancer**: Create configuration file specifying the single backend server and start the load balancer on port 8080 with logging enabled for all proxied requests.\n\n3. **Basic Request Forwarding**: Send GET request to `http://localhost:8080/hello` and verify that the response contains the expected JSON from the backend with path \"/hello\".\n\n4. **Header Preservation**: Send request with custom headers (`X-Test-Header: value123`) and verify that the backend receives these headers correctly by examining backend logs.\n\n5. **Request Body Forwarding**: Send POST request with JSON body to the proxy and verify that the backend receives the complete request body without corruption.\n\n6. **Error Response Handling**: Stop the backend server and send a request to the proxy. Verify that the client receives a 502 Bad Gateway response with appropriate error message.\n\n| Test Case | Request | Expected Response | Verification Method |\n|-----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|\n| GET forwarding | `GET /api/status` | Backend response with path \"/api/status\" | Response body contains correct path |\n| Header forwarding | Custom headers present | Backend logs show received headers | Check backend request logs |\n| POST body forwarding | JSON payload | Backend receives complete payload | Backend echoes received body |\n| Backend failure | Backend stopped | 502 Bad Gateway | HTTP status code verification |\n| Request logging | Any request | Log entry with timestamp, method, path | Check load balancer logs |\n\n**Command Line Validation:**\n\n```bash\n# Start backend server (port 8081)\ngo run backend-server.go -port=8081\n\n# Start load balancer (port 8080, single backend)\ngo run main.go -config=milestone1-config.json\n\n# Test basic forwarding\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080/test\n# Expected: 200 response with backend JSON\n\n# Test header forwarding\ncurl -H \"X-Custom: test123\" http://localhost:8080/headers\n# Expected: Backend receives X-Custom header\n\n# Test POST body\ncurl -X POST -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:8080/api/data\n# Expected: Backend receives JSON body correctly\n\n# Test error handling (stop backend first)\ncurl http://localhost:8080/test\n# Expected: 502 Bad Gateway\n```\n\n**Success Criteria Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are forwarded correctly\n- [ ] Request headers including custom headers are preserved\n- [ ] Request bodies of various sizes are forwarded without corruption\n- [ ] Response headers and status codes are returned to client\n- [ ] Connection failures result in 502 responses, not crashes\n- [ ] All requests are logged with required information (timestamp, method, path, backend, response status)\n- [ ] Keep-alive connections are handled properly\n- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation\n\n### Milestone 2: Round Robin Distribution Validation\n\nThe Round Robin Distribution milestone validation ensures that requests are distributed evenly across multiple backends using the round-robin algorithm.\n\n**Multi-Backend Setup:**\n\n1. **Start Multiple Backends**: Launch three backend servers on ports 8081, 8082, 8083, each returning responses that identify which backend served the request.\n\n2. **Configure Round Robin**: Update load balancer configuration with all three backends and set algorithm to `round_robin`.\n\n3. **Distribution Verification**: Send 30 requests and verify that each backend receives exactly 10 requests with no skipped backends.\n\n4. **Concurrent Request Testing**: Use multiple concurrent clients to send requests simultaneously and verify that distribution remains even under concurrent load.\n\n5. **Backend Configuration Changes**: Add a fourth backend and verify that round-robin distribution adapts to include the new backend without disrupting existing request handling.\n\n**Distribution Testing Commands:**\n\n```bash\n# Start three backend servers\ngo run backend-server.go -port=8081 -id=backend1 &\ngo run backend-server.go -port=8082 -id=backend2 &\ngo run backend-server.go -port=8083 -id=backend3 &\n\n# Start load balancer with round-robin configuration\ngo run main.go -config=milestone2-config.json\n\n# Test sequential distribution\nfor i in {1..30}; do\n    curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | jq .backend_id\ndone\n# Expected: Cycling pattern backend1, backend2, backend3, backend1, ...\n\n# Test concurrent distribution\nseq 1 100 | xargs -n1 -P10 -I{} curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | jq .backend_id | sort | uniq -c\n# Expected: Approximately 33-34 requests per backend\n\n# Test backend addition\n# Add fourth backend to config and reload\ncurl http://localhost:8080/reload-config\n# Send more requests and verify 4-backend distribution\n```\n\n**Success Criteria Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Sequential requests cycle through backends in order\n- [ ] Distribution variance is less than 5% over 1000 requests\n- [ ] Concurrent requests maintain even distribution\n- [ ] Counter increment is thread-safe (no race conditions)\n- [ ] Configuration changes update backend list correctly\n- [ ] Empty backend pool handled gracefully\n- [ ] Single backend configuration works correctly\n\n### Milestone 3: Health Checks Validation\n\nThe Health Checks milestone validation ensures that backend health monitoring works correctly and unhealthy backends are excluded from request routing.\n\n**Health Check Testing Procedure:**\n\n1. **Configure Health Checking**: Set up health checks with 10-second interval, 2-failure threshold, and `/health` endpoint.\n\n2. **Verify Healthy State**: Start all backends with healthy `/health` endpoints returning 200 OK and verify all backends receive requests in round-robin order.\n\n3. **Simulate Backend Failure**: Make one backend return 500 errors on health check endpoint and verify it's excluded from request routing after configured failure threshold.\n\n4. **Test Recovery**: Restore the backend to return healthy responses and verify it's restored to rotation after successful health checks.\n\n5. **Health Check Endpoint Testing**: Verify health checks don't interfere with normal request processing and use appropriate timeouts.\n\n**Health Status Monitoring:**\n\n```bash\n# Configure health checks (10s interval, /health endpoint)\n# Start load balancer with health checking enabled\ngo run main.go -config=milestone3-config.json\n\n# Monitor health check logs\ntail -f loadbalancer.log | grep \"health_check\"\n\n# Check health status endpoint\ncurl http://localhost:8080/admin/health\n# Expected: All backends marked healthy initially\n\n# Simulate backend failure (make backend return 500 on /health)\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/set-health-status -d '{\"healthy\": false}'\n\n# Wait for health check interval and verify backend excluded\n# Monitor request distribution - should skip failed backend\n\n# Restore backend health\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/set-health-status -d '{\"healthy\": true}'\n\n# Verify backend restored to rotation\n```\n\n**Success Criteria Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Health checks run at configured intervals\n- [ ] Backends marked unhealthy after consecutive failures exceed threshold\n- [ ] Unhealthy backends excluded from request routing\n- [ ] Backends restored after consecutive successful health checks\n- [ ] Health check timeouts handled properly\n- [ ] Health checking doesn't overwhelm backends\n- [ ] No healthy backends scenario handled gracefully\n- [ ] Health state changes logged appropriately\n\n### Milestone 4: Additional Algorithms Validation\n\nThe Additional Algorithms milestone validation ensures that multiple load balancing algorithms work correctly and can be switched at runtime.\n\n**Algorithm Testing Matrix:**\n\nEach algorithm requires specific validation scenarios that demonstrate its unique characteristics and verify correct implementation of the selection logic.\n\n| Algorithm | Test Scenario | Validation Method | Expected Behavior |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|------------------|\n| `weighted_round_robin` | Backends with weights 1:2:3 | 600 requests, count distribution | 100:200:300 requests ±5% |\n| `least_connections` | Variable backend load | Monitor connection counts | Requests flow to least loaded backend |\n| `ip_hash` | Same client IP | Multiple requests from same source | All requests to same backend |\n| `random` | Large request sample | Statistical distribution analysis | Approximately even distribution |\n\n**Weighted Round Robin Testing:**\n\n```bash\n# Configure backends with different weights\n# Backend1: weight=1, Backend2: weight=2, Backend3: weight=3\ngo run main.go -config=weighted-config.json\n\n# Send 600 requests and analyze distribution\nseq 1 600 | xargs -n1 -P1 -I{} curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | \\\n    jq -r .backend_id | sort | uniq -c\n# Expected output:\n# 100 backend1\n# 200 backend2  \n# 300 backend3\n```\n\n**Least Connections Testing:**\n\n```bash\n# Start load balancer with least_connections algorithm\ngo run main.go -config=least-connections-config.json\n\n# Create uneven load by sending long-running requests to some backends\ncurl http://localhost:8080/slow-endpoint &  # Creates connection to one backend\ncurl http://localhost:8080/slow-endpoint &  # Creates connection to another backend\n\n# Send new request - should go to backend with fewest connections\ncurl http://localhost:8080/test\n# Verify request goes to backend with lowest connection count\n```\n\n**IP Hash Consistency Testing:**\n\n```bash\n# Configure ip_hash algorithm\ngo run main.go -config=ip-hash-config.json\n\n# Send multiple requests from same source IP\nfor i in {1..20}; do\n    curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | jq .backend_id\ndone\n# Expected: All requests return same backend_id\n\n# Test different source IPs (using X-Forwarded-For simulation)\ncurl -H \"X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.100\" http://localhost:8080/test\ncurl -H \"X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.101\" http://localhost:8080/test\n# Expected: Different IPs may map to different backends, but consistent per IP\n```\n\n**Runtime Algorithm Switching:**\n\n```bash\n# Start with round_robin algorithm\ngo run main.go -config=initial-config.json\n\n# Send requests and observe round-robin distribution\nseq 1 15 | xargs -n1 -I{} curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | jq .backend_id\n# Expected: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3\n\n# Switch to weighted_round_robin algorithm\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/set-algorithm -d '{\"algorithm\": \"weighted_round_robin\"}'\n\n# Send requests and observe weighted distribution\nseq 1 60 | xargs -n1 -I{} curl -s http://localhost:8080/test | \\\n    jq -r .backend_id | sort | uniq -c\n# Expected: Distribution according to configured weights\n```\n\n**Success Criteria Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Weighted round robin distributes proportionally to weights\n- [ ] Least connections tracks active connections accurately\n- [ ] IP hash provides consistent client-to-backend mapping\n- [ ] Random selection distributes approximately evenly\n- [ ] Algorithm switching works without service interruption\n- [ ] All algorithms handle concurrent requests correctly\n- [ ] Edge cases (zero weights, equal connections) handled properly\n- [ ] Algorithm-specific statistics available via admin interface\n\n### Debugging Common Validation Issues\n\n**Request Distribution Problems:**\n- **Symptom**: Uneven distribution in round-robin\n- **Likely Cause**: Race condition in counter increment or modulo operation with changing backend count\n- **Diagnosis**: Add detailed logging of counter values and selected backend indices\n- **Fix**: Use atomic operations for counter increment and ensure modulo calculation uses consistent backend count\n\n**Health Check Issues:**\n- **Symptom**: Backends not marked unhealthy despite health check failures\n- **Likely Cause**: Health check threshold logic incorrect or consecutive failure counting reset improperly\n- **Diagnosis**: Log all health check results and state transitions with timestamps\n- **Fix**: Verify threshold comparison logic and ensure failure counters only reset on successful checks\n\n**Algorithm Selection Errors:**\n- **Symptom**: Wrong algorithm behavior after runtime switching\n- **Likely Cause**: Algorithm state not reset properly or interface methods not implemented correctly\n- **Diagnosis**: Verify algorithm interface implementation and state initialization\n- **Fix**: Implement proper `Reset()` method for each algorithm and call during algorithm switching\n\n**Connection Tracking Problems:**\n- **Symptom**: Least connections algorithm selects wrong backends\n- **Likely Cause**: Connection increment/decrement not called at correct times or race conditions in connection counting\n- **Diagnosis**: Add logging for all connection count changes with request correlation\n- **Fix**: Ensure connection counting occurs in proper request lifecycle phases and use atomic operations\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe testing strategy implementation requires setting up comprehensive test infrastructure that supports both unit testing with mocks and integration testing with real servers.\n\n#### A.

Just as a doctor systematically examines symptoms, runs tests, and narrows down the root cause before prescribing treatment, debugging a load balancer requires methodical observation of symptoms, targeted diagnostic tests, and systematic elimination of potential causes. The load balancer exhibits \"symptoms\" like failed requests or uneven distribution, and we use \"diagnostic tools\" like logs, metrics, and network traces to identify the underlying \"disease\" — whether it's a configuration error, network issue, or algorithmic bug.\n\nThe debugging process follows the same systematic approach as medical diagnosis: first gather symptoms from multiple sources (logs, metrics, user reports), then form hypotheses about potential causes, design targeted tests to verify or eliminate each hypothesis, and finally apply the appropriate fix. Just as doctors maintain differential diagnosis lists, effective load balancer debugging requires maintaining a mental catalog of common failure modes and their characteristic symptoms.\n\n### Connection and Networking Issues\n\nNetwork connectivity problems represent the most fundamental category of load balancer failures. When the basic HTTP reverse proxy functionality fails to establish connections or properly forward requests, the entire system becomes non-functional regardless of how sophisticated the load balancing algorithms might be.\n\nConnection failures manifest in several distinct patterns, each requiring different diagnostic approaches. **Connection refused errors** typically indicate that the target backend server is not listening on the expected port, while **timeout errors** suggest that packets are being sent but no response is received within the configured time limit. **DNS resolution failures** prevent the load balancer from even attempting to connect to backends, and **TLS handshake failures** occur when HTTPS backends have certificate or protocol configuration issues.\n\nThe diagnostic process for connection issues follows a systematic bottom-up approach, starting with basic network connectivity and progressing through increasingly sophisticated layers. This layered approach ensures that we don't waste time debugging application-layer issues when the root cause lies in basic network configuration.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Primary Diagnostic Steps | Secondary Investigation |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| \"Connection refused\" errors | Backend not running or wrong port | Check backend service status, verify port binding | Examine firewall rules, network routing |\n| Timeout on all requests | Network routing issue or backend overload | Test direct backend connectivity, check network path | Monitor backend resource usage, examine proxy timeout settings |\n| DNS resolution failures | Incorrect backend hostnames or DNS server issues | Test DNS resolution manually, verify hostname configuration | Check DNS server connectivity, examine domain configuration |\n| TLS handshake failures | Certificate mismatch or protocol version incompatibility | Examine certificate validity and hostname matching | Check supported TLS versions, cipher suite compatibility |\n| Intermittent connection failures | Backend intermittently unavailable or network instability | Monitor backend availability over time, check network stability | Examine backend startup/shutdown patterns, investigate network infrastructure |\n| Port binding errors | Load balancer port already in use or permission issues | Check port availability, verify user permissions | Examine other processes using the port, check system limits |\n\n**Connection Pool Management Issues**\n\nConnection pooling problems create particularly subtle debugging challenges because they often manifest as performance degradation rather than outright failures. The `ReverseProxy` component maintains connection pools to backend servers for efficiency, but misconfigured pooling can cause resource exhaustion, connection leaks, or unnecessary connection churn.\n\nConnection leaks occur when HTTP connections to backends are opened but never properly closed, gradually exhausting the available connection pool. This typically manifests as gradually increasing response times followed by eventual connection timeouts as the pool becomes exhausted. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring the active connection count over time and examining connection lifecycle management in the proxy code.\n\n**Port Binding and Permission Problems**\n\nLoad balancer startup failures often stem from port binding issues that prevent the HTTP server from accepting incoming connections. These problems require examining both the network configuration and system-level permissions that control port access.\n\n> **Key Insight**: Port binding failures during load balancer startup are often the first indication of configuration conflicts or permission issues. A systematic approach to port diagnostics can quickly identify whether the problem lies in port availability, user permissions, or network interface configuration.\n\n| Error Type | Diagnostic Command | Expected Output | Troubleshooting Steps |\n|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Port already in use | `netstat -tlnp \\| grep :8080` | Shows process using port 8080 | Identify conflicting process, change port, or terminate conflict |\n| Permission denied | `sudo netstat -tlnp \\| grep :80` | Requires root to bind privileged ports | Run as root, use port >1024, or configure capabilities |\n| Interface binding failure | `ip addr show` | Lists available network interfaces | Verify interface exists, check interface configuration |\n| IPv6/IPv4 configuration | `ss -tlnp \\| grep :8080` | Shows listening addresses and protocols | Configure correct IP version, verify dual-stack support |\n\n**Network Routing and Connectivity**\n\nBackend connectivity issues often stem from network routing problems that prevent the load balancer from reaching backend servers. These issues require systematic testing of network paths and routing configuration.\n\nThe diagnostic process for routing issues involves testing connectivity at progressively higher network layers. We start with basic IP connectivity using ping, progress to port-level connectivity using telnet or nc, and finally test HTTP-level connectivity using curl or similar tools. This layered approach helps isolate whether problems exist at the network, transport, or application layer.\n\n| Test Level | Command Example | Success Indication | Failure Diagnosis |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| IP connectivity | `ping backend1.example.com` | Packets received with normal latency | Check routing tables, firewall rules, DNS resolution |\n| Port connectivity | `telnet backend1.example.com 8080` | Successfully connected | Examine service binding, port configuration, local firewall |\n| HTTP connectivity | `curl -I http://backend1.example.com:8080/health` | HTTP status code returned | Check HTTP service configuration, request handling, application firewall |\n| TLS connectivity | `openssl s_client -connect backend1.example.com:8443` | TLS handshake completes | Examine certificate configuration, TLS version compatibility |\n\n### Load Distribution Problems\n\nLoad distribution issues represent algorithmic and concurrency problems in the backend selection logic. Unlike connection issues which prevent any request processing, distribution problems allow some requests to succeed while creating uneven traffic patterns or algorithmic failures that compromise the load balancer's effectiveness.\n\nDistribution problems typically manifest as statistical anomalies in request routing patterns. The `RoundRobin` algorithm should distribute requests evenly across healthy backends, but race conditions in the counter increment or modulo operation can create clustering or skipped backends. The `WeightedRoundRobin` algorithm should respect configured weight ratios over time, but implementation bugs can cause disproportionate distribution or integer overflow issues.\n\n**Round Robin Counter Race Conditions**\n\nThe most common distribution problem involves race conditions in the round robin counter increment operation. When multiple goroutines simultaneously increment the `counter` field in the `RoundRobin` struct without proper synchronization, the atomic increment operation can be lost or duplicated, leading to uneven distribution patterns.\n\nRace condition symptoms typically appear under concurrent load rather than during sequential testing. Single-threaded tests might show perfect distribution while concurrent load tests reveal significant skew. The diagnostic approach involves examining distribution statistics over large request volumes and monitoring counter increment behavior under concurrent access.\n\n| Distribution Pattern | Root Cause | Diagnostic Approach | Verification Method |\n|---------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Some backends never receive requests | Counter increment race condition causing skipped values | Monitor counter increments vs backend selection, check for gaps | Load test with request tracking, verify each backend receives requests |\n| Clustering of requests to single backend | Modulo operation using stale counter value | Examine counter read/increment timing, check atomic operation usage | Track sequential backend selections, look for repeated selections |\n| Uneven distribution over time | Integer overflow in counter causing negative modulo results | Monitor counter value growth, check for overflow conditions | Test with large request volumes, monitor counter wraparound behavior |\n| Random distribution instead of round robin | Multiple counter increments per request | Trace counter increments per request processing, verify single increment | Add counter increment logging, ensure one increment per selection |\n\n**Algorithm Selection and State Management**\n\nAlgorithm switching problems occur when the load balancer attempts to change from one selection algorithm to another during runtime. The `RequestRouter` coordinates between different algorithm implementations, but state inconsistencies can cause selection failures or incorrect algorithm behavior.\n\nAlgorithm state corruption often occurs during transitions when the previous algorithm's state remains cached or when the new algorithm initializes with incorrect state. The `WeightedRoundRobin` algorithm maintains complex internal state in the `currentWeights` map that must be properly reset when switching algorithms or updating backend configurations.\n\n**Weight Configuration and Calculation Errors**\n\nWeighted distribution algorithms face additional complexity from weight calculation and normalization logic. The `WeightedRoundRobin` implementation must handle weight configuration changes, zero weights, and weight ratio calculations without introducing mathematical errors or division-by-zero conditions.\n\n> **Key Insight**: Weight-based algorithms are particularly susceptible to configuration errors and edge cases. A backend configured with zero weight should be excluded from selection, while negative weights typically indicate configuration errors that should be detected during validation rather than causing runtime failures.\n\n| Weight Configuration Issue | Symptom | Root Cause Analysis | Resolution Strategy |\n|---------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Backend with zero weight receives requests | Selection algorithm ignores weight values | Check weight application in selection logic | Implement weight validation, exclude zero-weight backends |\n| Integer overflow in weight calculations | Sudden distribution changes or selection failures | Monitor weight sum calculations, check for overflow | Use appropriate integer types, implement overflow detection |\n| Negative weights cause selection failures | Algorithm exceptions or undefined behavior | Examine weight validation during configuration loading | Add configuration validation, reject negative weights |\n| Weight changes not reflected in distribution | Algorithm uses cached weight values | Check weight update propagation to selection logic | Implement proper weight update notification |\n\n**Backend Pool Synchronization Issues**\n\nBackend pool management creates complex synchronization challenges when backends are added, removed, or have their health status updated while requests are being processed. The `BackendManager` must coordinate between health checking updates and algorithm selection requests without introducing race conditions or inconsistent state.\n\nSynchronization problems typically manifest as selection of unavailable backends or failure to utilize newly added healthy backends. The diagnostic approach involves examining the timing relationship between backend state changes and selection algorithm state updates.\n\n### Health Check Debugging\n\nHealth checking systems introduce temporal complexity into load balancer debugging because health state changes occur asynchronously relative to request processing. The `HealthChecker` component runs periodic probes against backend servers and updates health state based on consecutive success or failure counts, creating multiple timing-dependent failure modes.\n\nHealth check false positives occur when healthy backends are marked as unhealthy due to transient network issues, overly aggressive failure thresholds, or health check implementation problems. False negatives occur when unhealthy backends remain marked as healthy, continuing to receive traffic and generate client-visible failures.\n\n**Health Check False Positives and Negatives**\n\nFalse positive health check failures create availability problems by unnecessarily removing healthy backends from the rotation. This typically occurs when health check timeouts are too aggressive for the network environment, when health check intervals create excessive load on backend servers, or when health endpoints don't accurately reflect backend health.\n\nThe diagnostic process for false positives involves comparing health check results with actual backend availability and examining the correlation between health check timing and backend performance. Manual health endpoint testing often reveals discrepancies between health check logic and actual service availability.\n\n| False Positive Pattern | Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Corrective Actions |\n|------------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Healthy backends marked unhealthy during peak load | Health check timeout too aggressive | Compare health check timing with backend response times under load | Increase health check timeout, implement adaptive timeouts |\n| Intermittent false failures on stable backends | Network instability affecting health checks | Monitor network path to backends, compare with direct connectivity tests | Increase consecutive failure threshold, implement jittered retry logic |\n| All backends fail health checks simultaneously | Health check implementation error or network partition | Examine health check implementation, test health endpoints manually | Fix health check logic, implement network connectivity verification |\n| New backends never pass initial health checks | Health endpoint configuration mismatch | Verify health endpoint paths and expected responses | Correct health endpoint configuration, implement endpoint discovery |\n\n**Health State Transition Problems**\n\nBackend health state management involves complex transition logic between healthy, unhealthy, and recovery states based on consecutive success and failure counts. The `HealthState` structure tracks multiple counters and timestamps that must be updated atomically to prevent inconsistent state transitions.\n\nState transition bugs often manifest as backends that become \"stuck\" in unhealthy states despite successful health checks, or backends that rapidly alternate between healthy and unhealthy states due to inadequate hysteresis in the transition logic. This \"flapping\" behavior can cause traffic disruption and excessive logging.\n\n**Health Check Endpoint Configuration Issues**\n\nHealth check configuration problems stem from mismatches between the health check implementation and backend server health endpoint design. The `HealthCheckConfig` specifies the expected HTTP path, status code, and response characteristics, but backends may implement health endpoints with different semantics.\n\nConfiguration debugging involves verifying that health check requests match the exact format expected by backend health endpoints. This includes HTTP method, request headers, expected response codes, and response body validation logic.\n\n| Configuration Mismatch | Symptom | Verification Method | Solution |\n|-----------------------|---------|-------------------|----------|\n| Wrong health endpoint path | All health checks return 404 | Manual curl test of health endpoint | Correct health check path configuration |\n| Incorrect expected status code | Health checks fail despite healthy backend | Compare expected vs actual response codes | Update expected status code in configuration |\n| Missing required headers | Backend rejects health check requests | Examine backend access logs for health check requests | Add required headers to health check configuration |\n| Response timeout too short | Health checks timeout on slow but healthy backends | Monitor health check response times vs timeout setting | Increase health check timeout or optimize backend health endpoint |\n\n**Health Check Timing and Frequency Issues**\n\nHealth check timing configuration requires balancing between rapid failure detection and avoiding excessive load on backend servers. The `DefaultInterval` of 30 seconds provides a reasonable starting point, but production environments may require different timing based on failure tolerance and backend capacity.\n\nOverly frequent health checks can overwhelm backend servers, particularly during startup or high load conditions. This creates a feedback loop where health checks contribute to backend overload, causing legitimate health check failures that remove backends from rotation. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring backend resource usage during health check intervals and correlating health check timing with backend performance metrics.\n\n### Debugging Tools and Techniques\n\nEffective load balancer debugging requires a systematic toolkit of logging strategies, monitoring approaches, and diagnostic techniques tailored to distributed system challenges. Unlike debugging single-process applications, load balancer debugging must account for network timing, concurrent request processing, and interactions between multiple backend servers.\n\nThe foundation of load balancer debugging lies in comprehensive logging that provides correlation between client requests, backend selection decisions, and response outcomes. The `RequestContext` structure carries correlation information throughout the request processing pipeline, enabling end-to-end request tracing even when requests span multiple components and goroutines.\n\n**Structured Logging and Request Correlation**\n\nRequest correlation represents the most critical debugging capability for load balancer systems. Each incoming request receives a unique request ID that gets logged at every processing stage, enabling reconstruction of the complete request flow from initial receipt through backend selection, health checking, and response forwarding.\n\nThe logging strategy must balance between providing sufficient detail for debugging while avoiding performance impact under high request volumes. Structured logging formats like JSON enable programmatic log analysis while maintaining human readability for interactive debugging sessions.\n\n| Log Level | Information Captured | Example Entry | Use Case |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------|----------|\n| DEBUG | Detailed algorithm selection, health check probes, connection pool operations | `{\"level\":\"debug\",\"time\":\"2023-10-15T10:30:45Z\",\"request_id\":\"req-123\",\"event\":\"backend_selected\",\"algorithm\":\"round_robin\",\"backend\":\"backend-2\",\"counter\":42}` | Algorithm debugging, performance analysis |\n| INFO | Request processing, backend health changes, configuration updates | `{\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2023-10-15T10:30:45Z\",\"request_id\":\"req-123\",\"event\":\"request_completed\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"path\":\"/api/users\",\"backend\":\"backend-2\",\"status\":200,\"duration_ms\":45}` | Operational monitoring, request tracking |\n| WARN | Health check failures, backend unavailability, configuration issues | `{\"level\":\"warn\",\"time\":\"2023-10-15T10:30:45Z\",\"event\":\"backend_unhealthy\",\"backend\":\"backend-1\",\"consecutive_failures\":3,\"last_error\":\"connection_timeout\"}` | Early warning system, capacity planning |\n| ERROR | Request failures, connection errors, system failures | `{\"level\":\"error\",\"time\":\"2023-10-15T10:30:45Z\",\"request_id\":\"req-123\",\"event\":\"request_failed\",\"error\":\"no_healthy_backends\",\"total_backends\":3,\"healthy_backends\":0}` | Incident response, failure analysis |\n\n**Metrics Collection and Analysis**\n\nMetrics collection provides quantitative analysis capabilities that complement qualitative log analysis. The load balancer should expose metrics for request distribution patterns, backend health statistics, response time distributions, and error rates categorized by type and backend.\n\nRequest distribution metrics enable detection of algorithm implementation bugs by comparing actual distribution patterns against expected theoretical distributions. The round robin algorithm should show nearly equal request counts across all healthy backends over time, while weighted algorithms should show proportional distribution matching configured weights.\n\n**Performance Profiling and Resource Monitoring**\n\nLoad balancer performance profiling requires monitoring both internal component performance and overall system resource usage. Go's built-in pprof package provides CPU and memory profiling capabilities that help identify bottlenecks in request processing, algorithm selection, or health checking logic.\n\nMemory profiling becomes particularly important for connection pool management and health state tracking, where memory leaks can gradually degrade system performance. The diagnostic approach involves capturing memory profiles during different operational phases and identifying objects that persist longer than expected.\n\n| Resource Metric | Monitoring Method | Normal Range | Investigation Threshold |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| CPU utilization | System monitoring, pprof CPU profiles | <50% during normal load | >80% sustained |\n| Memory usage | Process memory monitoring, pprof heap profiles | Stable after warmup | Continuous growth indicating leaks |\n| Goroutine count | Runtime metrics, pprof goroutine profiles | Stable with request load | Unbounded growth |\n| File descriptor usage | System limits monitoring | <50% of system limits | >80% of available descriptors |\n| Network connection count | Netstat analysis, connection pool metrics | Matches expected backend connections | Excessive connection accumulation |\n\n**Network-Level Debugging Tools**\n\nNetwork-level debugging tools provide visibility into the actual HTTP traffic between the load balancer and backend servers. Tools like tcpdump, Wireshark, and curl enable examination of raw HTTP requests and responses, helping identify protocol-level issues that might not be apparent from application logs.\n\nNetwork debugging becomes essential when diagnosing subtle HTTP protocol issues like header forwarding problems, connection keep-alive behavior, or TLS handshake failures. The systematic approach involves capturing network traffic during problem reproduction and analyzing the packet-level interaction between components.\n\n**Automated Testing and Validation**\n\nAutomated testing tools enable systematic validation of load balancer behavior under various failure scenarios. The `TestServerPool` provides a foundation for creating controlled testing environments where backend failures, network issues, and load patterns can be simulated reproducibly.\n\nTesting automation should cover both normal operation validation and failure mode testing. Normal operation tests verify that request distribution matches algorithm expectations, that healthy backends receive appropriate traffic, and that response forwarding preserves HTTP semantics. Failure mode tests verify that backend failures are detected appropriately, that traffic fails over correctly, and that recovery behavior works as expected.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe debugging infrastructure for a load balancer requires careful instrumentation throughout the codebase combined with external tooling for monitoring and analysis. This implementation guidance provides complete debugging utilities and systematic troubleshooting procedures.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

implementation, demonstrating how the architectural decisions made throughout the project enable natural evolution and growth of the system's capabilities.\n\n### Mental Model: Growing Software Ecosystem\n\nThink of extending the load balancer like expanding a thriving city. The basic load balancer is like the city's foundational infrastructure — roads, utilities, and core services. Future extensions are like adding specialized districts: a financial district (SSL termination), a smart traffic management system (advanced routing), and a comprehensive monitoring network (observability features). Each extension builds on the existing foundation while adding new capabilities that serve different needs.\n\nJust as a well-planned city leaves room for growth with proper zoning and infrastructure corridors, the load balancer's modular architecture creates natural extension points. The component boundaries, interface abstractions, and data models established in earlier sections provide the \"zoning laws\" that guide where and how new features can be integrated without disrupting existing functionality.\n\nThe key insight is that extensions should feel like natural evolution rather than awkward retrofitting. When the core architecture is designed with extensibility in mind, new features integrate smoothly and leverage existing components rather than working around them.\n\n### SSL/TLS Termination: Adding HTTPS Support and Certificate Management\n\nThe **SSL/TLS termination** extension transforms the load balancer from a simple HTTP proxy into a comprehensive HTTPS gateway that handles encryption, certificate management, and secure client communications. This extension addresses the critical requirement for secure web traffic while offloading encryption overhead from backend servers.\n\nIn modern web architectures, SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer provides significant operational advantages. It centralizes certificate management, reduces computational load on backend servers, and enables the load balancer to inspect encrypted traffic for routing decisions. The load balancer becomes the security boundary, handling all client-facing encryption while communicating with backends over internal networks using HTTP.\n\nThe SSL termination capability integrates naturally with the existing `ReverseProxy` component by adding a TLS layer before HTTP processing. The current request flow of client → load balancer → backend becomes client → TLS termination → load balancer → backend, with the load balancer now responsible for the cryptographic handshake and session management.\n\n**Certificate Management Architecture**\n\nThe certificate management system requires several new components that work together to provide automated certificate lifecycle management:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Integration Point |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| CertificateStore | Manages certificate storage, loading, and rotation | Integrates with Config loading system |\n| TLSListener | Handles TLS handshakes and client connections | Replaces HTTP listener in ReverseProxy |\n| CertificateValidator | Validates certificate chains and expiration | Used by HealthChecker for certificate monitoring |\n| AutoRenewal | Automatic certificate renewal via ACME protocol | Runs as background service alongside HealthChecker |\n| SNIRouter | Routes requests based on Server Name Indication | Integrates with request routing pipeline |\n\nThe certificate store manages multiple certificates simultaneously, enabling the load balancer to serve multiple domains from a single instance. This is particularly important in microservices environments where a single load balancer might front dozens of different services, each with their own domain and certificate requirements.\n\n```go\ntype TLSConfig struct {\n    Enabled           bool                    `json:\"enabled\"`\n    CertificatesPath  string                  `json:\"certificates_path\"`\n    PrivateKeyPath    string                  `json:\"private_key_path\"`\n    CipherSuites      []uint16                `json:\"cipher_suites\"`\n    MinTLSVersion     uint16                  `json:\"min_tls_version\"`\n    MaxTLSVersion     uint16                  `json:\"max_tls_version\"`\n    ClientAuth        tls.ClientAuthType      `json:\"client_auth\"`\n    Certificates      []CertificateConfig     `json:\"certificates\"`\n    ACME              ACMEConfig             `json:\"acme\"`\n    OCSP              OCSPConfig             `json:\"ocsp\"`\n}\n\ntype CertificateConfig struct {\n    Domain           string    `json:\"domain\"`\n    CertificatePath  string    `json:\"certificate_path\"`\n    PrivateKeyPath   string    `json:\"private_key_path\"`\n    ExpirationTime   time.Time `json:\"expiration_time\"`\n    AutoRenew        bool      `json:\"auto_renew\"`\n    Backends         []string  `json:\"backends\"`\n}\n```\n\n**ACME Protocol Integration**\n\nAutomatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) integration enables the load balancer to automatically obtain and renew certificates from Certificate Authorities like Let's Encrypt. This removes the operational burden of manual certificate management while ensuring certificates remain current.\n\nThe ACME integration requires careful coordination with the existing health checking system. The load balancer must temporarily serve ACME challenge responses while maintaining normal traffic flow. This creates an interesting architectural challenge where the request router must distinguish between ACME challenges and normal application traffic.\n\n> **Design Insight: ACME Challenge Routing**\n> \n> ACME HTTP-01 challenges require the load balancer to serve specific content at `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` paths. This creates a conflict with normal request forwarding, as these requests must be handled locally rather than forwarded to backends. The solution is to add ACME challenge detection to the request routing pipeline, creating a short-circuit path for challenge requests.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Certificate Storage Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: File-Based Certificate Storage with In-Memory Caching**\n> - **Context**: Certificates need persistent storage for restart survival and fast access during TLS handshakes\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Database storage with encrypted certificate data\n>   - File-based storage with periodic reload\n>   - In-memory only with external certificate injection\n> - **Decision**: File-based storage with automatic reload detection and in-memory caching\n> - **Rationale**: File-based storage provides simplicity and compatibility with standard certificate management tools, while in-memory caching ensures TLS handshake performance isn't degraded by disk I/O\n> - **Consequences**: Enables standard certificate management workflows while maintaining performance, but requires file system security and backup considerations\n\n**TLS Performance Considerations**\n\nTLS termination significantly impacts load balancer performance due to the computational overhead of cryptographic operations. Modern approaches use hardware acceleration where available and optimize connection reuse to amortize handshake costs across multiple requests.\n\nThe integration with the existing connection pooling system becomes more complex with TLS termination. While backend connections can remain HTTP and benefit from existing pooling, client-facing TLS connections require different management strategies. TLS session resumption and connection reuse become critical for maintaining acceptable performance levels.\n\n**Client Certificate Authentication**\n\nAdvanced TLS configurations support mutual authentication where clients present certificates for verification. This creates additional integration points with the request routing system, as certificate-based identity can influence backend selection and routing decisions.\n\nThe client certificate validation integrates with the error handling system established in earlier sections. Certificate validation failures generate appropriate error responses while maintaining security by avoiding information disclosure about the specific failure reasons.\n\n### Advanced Routing Rules: Path-Based, Header-Based, and Content-Aware Distribution\n\nThe **advanced routing rules** extension transforms the load balancer from simple request distribution into intelligent application-aware traffic management. This extension enables sophisticated routing decisions based on request content, enabling use cases like API versioning, canary deployments, and multi-tenant architectures.\n\nCurrent load balancing algorithms focus purely on backend selection without considering request characteristics. Advanced routing adds a decision layer that examines request properties before applying load balancing algorithms, creating a two-stage process: first route to the appropriate backend pool, then apply load balancing within that pool.\n\n**Routing Rule Architecture**\n\nThe routing rule system introduces several new concepts that extend the existing data model:\n\n| Concept | Description | Integration Point |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|\n| RoutingRule | Defines conditions and actions for request routing | Added to Config structure |\n| RequestMatcher | Evaluates whether requests match rule conditions | Integrated with RequestRouter |\n| BackendPool | Groups backends for specific routing rules | Extends existing Backend grouping |\n| RoutingAction | Defines what happens when rule matches | Applied before algorithm selection |\n| RulePriority | Determines evaluation order for multiple rules | Managed by request processing pipeline |\n\nThe routing rule evaluation happens early in the request processing pipeline, immediately after request parsing but before backend selection. This positioning allows routing decisions to influence which backend pool is considered for load balancing, while still benefiting from health checking and algorithm selection within the chosen pool.\n\n```go\ntype RoutingConfig struct {\n    Rules            []RoutingRule     `json:\"rules\"`\n    DefaultPool      string            `json:\"default_pool\"`\n    FailureHandling  string            `json:\"failure_handling\"`\n    RuleEvaluation   RuleEvalConfig    `json:\"rule_evaluation\"`\n}\n\ntype RoutingRule struct {\n    ID               string            `json:\"id\"`\n    Priority         int               `json:\"priority\"`\n    Conditions       []RuleCondition   `json:\"conditions\"`\n    Actions          []RuleAction      `json:\"actions\"`\n    Enabled          bool              `json:\"enabled\"`\n    Description      string            `json:\"description\"`\n    CreatedAt        time.Time         `json:\"created_at\"`\n    Statistics       RuleStats         `json:\"statistics\"`\n}\n\ntype RuleCondition struct {\n    Type             string            `json:\"type\"`\n    Field            string            `json:\"field\"`\n    Operator         string            `json:\"operator\"`\n    Value            string            `json:\"value\"`\n    CaseSensitive    bool              `json:\"case_sensitive\"`\n    Negate           bool              `json:\"negate\"`\n}\n```\n\n**Path-Based Routing Implementation**\n\nPath-based routing enables different URL paths to route to different backend pools, supporting microservices architectures where different services handle different API endpoints. This routing strategy is essential for API gateways and service mesh implementations.\n\nThe path matching system supports various matching strategies:\n\n| Matching Strategy | Example | Use Case |\n|-------------------|---------|----------|\n| Exact Match | `/api/users` | Specific endpoint routing |\n| Prefix Match | `/api/v1/*` | API version routing |\n| Regex Match | `/users/\\d+/profile` | Pattern-based routing |\n| Wildcard Match | `/static/**` | Static content routing |\n\nPath-based routing integrates naturally with the existing request processing pipeline. The URL path is available immediately after request parsing, enabling early routing decisions without requiring request body inspection or complex header analysis.\n\n**Header-Based Routing Implementation**\n\nHeader-based routing enables routing decisions based on HTTP headers, supporting use cases like API versioning through Accept headers, tenant routing through custom headers, and device-specific routing through User-Agent headers.\n\nHeader-based routing is particularly powerful for implementing canary deployments and A/B testing. Requests can be routed to experimental backend pools based on specific header values, enabling controlled rollouts and feature flagging at the load balancer level.\n\nThe header matching system requires careful consideration of header normalization and case sensitivity. HTTP headers are case-insensitive by specification, but different clients and frameworks may use different casing conventions. The routing rule system normalizes headers for consistent matching while preserving original header values for forwarding to backends.\n\n**Content-Aware Distribution**\n\nContent-aware distribution represents the most sophisticated routing capability, enabling decisions based on request body content. This capability supports use cases like routing GraphQL queries to specialized backends, directing large file uploads to high-capacity storage services, and implementing content-based sharding.\n\nContent-aware routing requires careful integration with the existing request forwarding system. Reading request bodies for routing decisions means the body must be buffered and made available for both routing evaluation and subsequent forwarding to backends. This creates memory and performance implications that must be carefully managed.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Request Body Buffering Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Content-aware routing requires access to request bodies, but HTTP proxying typically streams bodies to avoid memory consumption\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Always buffer bodies in memory for routing evaluation\n>   - Stream bodies while extracting routing-relevant content\n>   - Conditional buffering based on content-type and size\n> - **Decision**: Conditional buffering with configurable size limits and content-type filtering\n> - **Rationale**: Provides content-aware routing capabilities while limiting memory impact and maintaining streaming performance for large uploads\n> - **Consequences**: Enables sophisticated routing at the cost of increased memory usage and latency for content-inspected requests\n\n**Routing Rule Evaluation Engine**\n\nThe routing rule evaluation engine processes rules in priority order, applying the first matching rule's action. This requires careful consideration of rule ordering and conflict resolution to ensure predictable behavior.\n\nThe evaluation engine integrates with the existing request context system, adding routing decisions to the request correlation data for observability and debugging. Failed routing evaluations are logged with sufficient detail to enable troubleshooting of complex rule interactions.\n\n**Backend Pool Management**\n\nAdvanced routing requires extending the backend management system to support multiple named pools rather than a single backend list. Each pool can have its own load balancing algorithm, health check configuration, and operational parameters.\n\nThe backend pool concept extends naturally from the existing `BackendManager`, creating a hierarchical structure where the manager contains multiple pools, each containing multiple backends. This structure maintains backward compatibility while enabling advanced routing scenarios.\n\n### Monitoring and Metrics: Adding Detailed Metrics, Monitoring Endpoints, and Observability Features\n\nThe **monitoring and metrics** extension transforms the load balancer from a black box into a fully observable system that provides deep insights into traffic patterns, performance characteristics, and operational health. This extension addresses the critical operational requirement for visibility into system behavior and performance.\n\nObservability becomes increasingly important as load balancers handle more traffic and support more complex routing logic. Operators need visibility into request distribution, backend health patterns, algorithm performance, and error trends to effectively manage and optimize the system. The monitoring extension provides this visibility through metrics collection, monitoring endpoints, and integration with external observability systems.\n\n**Metrics Architecture**\n\nThe metrics system introduces several new components that integrate with existing load balancer functionality:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Integration Point |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| MetricsCollector | Collects and aggregates metrics from all components | Integrated throughout request processing pipeline |\n| MetricsRegistry | Manages metric definitions and storage | Singleton service used by all components |\n| MetricsExporter | Exports metrics in standard formats (Prometheus, JSON) | HTTP endpoint handler for metrics scraping |\n| HistogramManager | Manages latency and duration histograms | Integrated with request timing |\n| AlertingEngine | Evaluates metric thresholds and generates alerts | Background service monitoring metrics |\n\nThe metrics collection system requires minimal performance impact while providing comprehensive visibility. This creates a design challenge where metrics collection must be efficient enough to run on every request without significantly impacting load balancer performance.\n\n```go\ntype MetricsConfig struct {\n    Enabled          bool                    `json:\"enabled\"`\n    CollectionInterval time.Duration        `json:\"collection_interval\"`\n    RetentionPeriod  time.Duration          `json:\"retention_period\"`\n    Exporters        []ExporterConfig       `json:\"exporters\"`\n    Histograms       HistogramConfig        `json:\"histograms\"`\n    Alerting         AlertingConfig         `json:\"alerting\"`\n    CustomMetrics    []CustomMetricConfig   `json:\"custom_metrics\"`\n}\n\ntype LoadBalancerMetrics struct {\n    TotalRequests        int64                    `json:\"total_requests\"`\n    SuccessfulRequests   int64                    `json:\"successful_requests\"`\n    FailedRequests       int64                    `json:\"failed_requests\"`\n    RequestRate          float64                  `json:\"request_rate\"`\n    ErrorRate            float64                  `json:\"error_rate\"`\n    ResponseTime         ResponseTimeMetrics     `json:\"response_time\"`\n    BackendMetrics       map[string]BackendMetrics `json:\"backend_metrics\"`\n    AlgorithmMetrics     AlgorithmMetrics        `json:\"algorithm_metrics\"`\n    HealthCheckMetrics   HealthCheckMetrics      `json:\"health_check_metrics\"`\n    ConnectionMetrics    ConnectionMetrics       `json:\"connection_metrics\"`\n}\n```\n\n**Request-Level Metrics Collection**\n\nRequest-level metrics provide the foundation for understanding load balancer behavior and performance. These metrics capture every aspect of request processing, from initial receipt through backend selection to response delivery.\n\nThe request metrics collection integrates with the existing `RequestContext` system established in earlier sections. Each request context carries a metrics collection object that accumulates timing, status, and routing information throughout the request lifecycle.\n\n| Metric Category | Examples | Collection Point |\n|-----------------|----------|------------------|\n| Request Volume | Requests per second, total requests | Request start/completion |\n| Response Times | P50, P95, P99 latency | Request start/end timing |\n| Status Codes | 2xx, 4xx, 5xx response counts | Response processing |\n| Backend Selection | Algorithm choice, backend distribution | Algorithm selection |\n| Error Rates | Connection failures, timeouts, health check failures | Error handling points |\n\n**Backend Performance Metrics**\n\nBackend performance metrics provide visibility into individual backend server behavior and health patterns. These metrics enable operators to identify problematic backends, understand capacity utilization, and optimize backend pool configuration.\n\nBackend metrics collection extends the existing `Backend` data structure with metrics collection capabilities. Each backend maintains its own metrics collector that aggregates performance data over configurable time windows.\n\nThe backend metrics integrate with the health checking system to provide correlation between health check results and actual request performance. This correlation enables more sophisticated health assessment that considers both probe success and actual request performance.\n\n**Load Balancing Algorithm Metrics**\n\nAlgorithm-specific metrics provide insights into how different load balancing strategies perform under various traffic patterns. These metrics enable operators to choose appropriate algorithms and tune algorithm parameters for optimal performance.\n\nEach algorithm implementation extends the base `Algorithm` interface with metrics collection capabilities. The metrics collected vary by algorithm type but generally include selection patterns, decision timing, and effectiveness measures.\n\n| Algorithm | Key Metrics | Purpose |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| RoundRobin | Selection distribution, counter resets | Verify even distribution |\n| WeightedRoundRobin | Weight utilization, smooth distribution | Optimize weight settings |\n| LeastConnections | Connection count accuracy, selection efficiency | Validate connection tracking |\n| IPHash | Hash distribution, consistency maintenance | Assess hash function quality |\n| Random | Distribution uniformity, selection performance | Evaluate randomness quality |\n\n**Health Check Metrics**\n\nHealth check metrics provide detailed visibility into backend health patterns, failure detection accuracy, and recovery behavior. These metrics are essential for tuning health check parameters and understanding system reliability characteristics.\n\nThe health check metrics extend the existing `HealthState` data structure with additional statistical information. Historical health data enables trend analysis and predictive health assessment.\n\n**Performance Impact Considerations**\n\nMetrics collection must balance comprehensiveness with performance impact. The metrics system uses several strategies to minimize overhead:\n\n- **Atomic counters**: Use atomic operations for high-frequency metrics to avoid locking overhead\n- **Batched updates**: Aggregate metrics in memory and flush periodically rather than updating external systems synchronously\n- **Sampling**: For very high-traffic scenarios, sample a percentage of requests rather than collecting metrics on every request\n- **Lock-free data structures**: Use lock-free ring buffers and other concurrent data structures for metrics collection\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Metrics Collection Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Comprehensive metrics are essential for operations, but collection overhead can impact load balancer performance\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Synchronous metrics with external system updates on every request\n>   - Asynchronous metrics with in-memory aggregation and periodic export\n>   - Sampling-based metrics collection with configurable sample rates\n> - **Decision**: Asynchronous collection with in-memory aggregation and multiple export formats\n> - **Rationale**: Provides comprehensive metrics while maintaining performance, with flexibility in how metrics are consumed by external systems\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rich observability without performance penalties, but requires careful memory management for metrics storage\n\n**Prometheus Integration**\n\nPrometheus integration enables the load balancer to export metrics in the industry-standard Prometheus format, enabling integration with existing monitoring infrastructure and alerting systems.\n\nThe Prometheus integration requires exposing a `/metrics` endpoint that serves metrics in Prometheus text format. This endpoint integrates with the existing HTTP server infrastructure while providing access to all collected metrics.\n\n**Custom Metrics and Extensibility**\n\nThe metrics system provides extensibility for application-specific metrics that operators may want to collect. Custom metrics can be defined through configuration and collected at various points in the request processing pipeline.\n\nCustom metrics support enables advanced use cases like business metrics collection (e.g., API usage by customer tier) and application-specific performance metrics (e.g., cache hit rates for cached responses).\n\n**Alerting Integration**\n\nThe alerting engine evaluates metric thresholds and generates alerts when conditions are met. Alerting rules can be defined for any collected metric, enabling operators to create comprehensive monitoring coverage.\n\nThe alerting system integrates with external notification systems through webhooks and standard protocols. Alert conditions can include simple threshold checks, trend analysis, and complex multi-metric conditions.\n\n**Dashboard and Visualization Support**\n\nThe metrics export system provides data in formats suitable for popular dashboard systems like Grafana. Pre-built dashboard templates enable operators to quickly establish comprehensive load balancer monitoring.\n\nThe dashboard integration includes both real-time metrics for operational monitoring and historical data for capacity planning and performance analysis.\n\n### Integration Points with Existing Architecture\n\nAll three extension areas integrate naturally with the existing load balancer architecture through well-defined extension points established in the original design.\n\n**Configuration Extension Points**\n\nThe `Config` structure established in earlier sections uses Go's struct embedding to enable extension:\n\n```go\ntype ExtendedConfig struct {\n    Config                    // Embed existing configuration\n    TLS        *TLSConfig     `json:\"tls,omitempty\"`\n    Routing    *RoutingConfig `json:\"routing,omitempty\"`\n    Metrics    *MetricsConfig `json:\"metrics,omitempty\"`\n}\n```\n\nThis approach maintains backward compatibility while enabling new functionality through configuration.\n\n**Component Integration Patterns**\n\nEach extension integrates with existing components through established interfaces and patterns:\n\n- **Middleware Pattern**: SSL termination and routing rules act as middleware layers in the request processing pipeline\n- **Observer Pattern**: Metrics collection observes events throughout the system without modifying core logic\n- **Strategy Pattern**: Advanced routing rules extend the existing algorithm selection strategy\n- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensions can be enabled/disabled through configuration without code changes\n\n**Data Flow Extensions**\n\nThe extensions modify the request processing pipeline by adding new stages while preserving the core flow:\n\n1. **Original Flow**: Client → HTTP Proxy → Backend Selection → Backend Request → Response\n2. **Extended Flow**: Client → TLS Termination → Routing Rules → Metrics Collection → HTTP Proxy → Backend Selection → Metrics Collection → Backend Request → Response → Metrics Collection\n\nEach extension adds processing stages without disrupting the fundamental request flow, maintaining system reliability while adding new capabilities.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe future extensions build naturally on the foundation established in the core load balancer implementation. Each extension represents a significant enhancement that can be tackled as an independent project phase.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Extension | Simple Option | Advanced Option

connections work: `curl -k https://localhost:8443/health`\n- Check certificate loading: Look for certificate validation messages in logs\n- Test SNI support: Configure multiple certificates for different domains\n- Validate TLS metrics: Check that SSL handshake metrics are collected\n\nAfter implementing advanced routing:\n- Test path-based routing: Configure rules for different URL paths and verify backend selection\n- Test header-based routing: Send requests with different headers and verify routing decisions\n- Validate rule priority: Configure overlapping rules and verify highest

trigger appropriately\n- Validate dashboard integration: Import metrics into Grafana and verify visualization\n\n**Common Extension Pitfalls**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: SSL Performance Degradation**\nAdding SSL termination can significantly impact performance due to cryptographic overhead. Monitor request latency and throughput after enabling SSL. Use hardware acceleration when available and optimize TLS configuration for performance. Consider connection reuse and session resumption to amortize handshake costs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Routing Rule Conflicts**\nComplex routing rules can interact in unexpected ways, causing requests to route to wrong backends. Implement rule validation that checks for conflicts and ambiguous conditions. Provide clear error messages when rules conflict. Test routing decisions thoroughly with comprehensive request scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Metrics Collection Memory Leaks**\nUnbounded metrics collection can cause memory leaks, especially for response time histograms and per-backend metrics. Implement metric retention policies with automatic cleanup of old data. Use sampling for high-frequency metrics. Monitor metrics collector memory usage and implement circuit breakers if needed.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Extension Configuration Complexity**\nMultiple extensions can create configuration files that are difficult to understand and maintain. Design configuration schemas that are hierarchical and well-documented. Provide configuration validation that gives clear error messages. Consider configuration templates and examples for common use cases.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Backward Compatibility Breaks**\nExtensions should not break existing configurations or APIs. Use configuration versioning and provide migration tools when necessary. Test extensively with existing configurations to ensure compatibility. Document any breaking changes clearly and provide upgrade paths.\n\nThe future extensions demonstrate the value of thoughtful architectural design in the original load balancer implementation. By establishing clear component boundaries, extensible interfaces, and modular data models, the core system provides natural extension points that enable sophisticated functionality without architectural disruption.\n\nEach extension represents a significant enhancement that addresses real operational requirements in production load balancer deployments. The SSL termination extension enables secure communications, the advanced routing extension supports complex application architectures, and the monitoring extension provides essential operational visibility.\n\n\n## Glossary\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) — this glossary defines technical terms, acronyms, and domain-specific vocabulary used throughout the load balancer design and implementation\n\n### Mental Model: Technical Dictionary\n\nThink of this glossary as a technical dictionary for a specialized field. Just as medical professionals have precise terminology like \"myocardial infarction\" instead of \"heart attack,\" load balancing has specific vocabulary that carries exact meaning. Each term represents a concept that has been refined through years of distributed systems practice, and using the correct terminology helps communicate complex ideas precisely between engineers.\n\nThe terminology in load balancing draws from multiple domains — networking (Layer 4 vs Layer 7), distributed systems (graceful degradation, circuit breakers), and algorithms (round-robin, consistent hashing). Understanding these terms deeply helps engineers discuss trade-offs, debug issues, and design systems that behave predictably under various conditions.\n\n### Core Load Balancing Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **load balancer** | A system that distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. Acts as a traffic director that makes intelligent routing decisions based on configured algorithms and backend health status. | Central component of the entire system |\n| **reverse proxy** | A server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to backends and returning backend responses to clients. Unlike a forward proxy that acts on behalf of clients, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of servers. | Core functionality implemented in Milestone 1 |\n| **backend server** | An application server that sits behind the load balancer and processes the actual business logic for client requests. Backend servers are the ultimate destination for forwarded requests. | Target destinations for all load-balanced traffic |\n| **backend pool** | A collection of backend servers that are available to receive forwarded requests. The pool is dynamically managed based on configuration changes and health check results. | Managed by the Backend Pool Manager component |\n| **upstream server** | Alternative term for backend server, commonly used in nginx and other proxy contexts. Refers to servers that are \"upstream\" in the request processing flow from the load balancer's perspective. | Synonym for backend server |\n| **session affinity** | A load balancing strategy that routes requests from the same client to the same backend server consistently. Also known as \"sticky sessions,\" this is essential for applications that store session state locally. | Implemented through IP hash algorithm |\n| **graceful degradation** | The ability of a system to maintain partial functionality when some components fail, rather than failing completely. In load balancing, this means continuing to serve requests with fewer backends when some become unhealthy. | Key principle in error handling and system resilience |\n\n### HTTP and Networking Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **Layer 4 load balancing** | Load balancing that operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP) and makes routing decisions based only on IP addresses and ports. Cannot inspect HTTP headers or content. | Alternative approach not used in this project |\n| **Layer 7 load balancing** | Load balancing that operates at the application layer (HTTP) and can make routing decisions based on HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and request content. | The approach implemented in this project |\n| **connection pooling** | Reusing established HTTP connections for multiple requests instead of creating new connections for each request. Improves performance by avoiding the overhead of TCP handshakes and SSL negotiations. | Optimization technique in HTTP proxy implementation |\n| **header forwarding** | The process of copying HTTP headers from the original client request to the backend request, and from the backend response to the client response. Critical for preserving client context. | Essential part of proper reverse proxying |\n| **X-Forwarded-For** | HTTP header that contains the IP addresses of clients and intermediate proxies in a request chain. Allows backend servers to identify the original client IP address. | Added by the request enhancement process |\n| **X-Forwarded-Proto** | HTTP header that indicates the original protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) used by the client to connect to the load balancer. Important for applications that need to generate correct URLs. | Added by the request enhancement process |\n| **request forwarding** | The process of receiving an HTTP request from a client and sending a corresponding request to a backend server, preserving the essential request properties. | Core functionality of the reverse proxy |\n| **response streaming** | Transferring response data from backend to client without buffering the entire response in memory. Essential for handling large responses efficiently. | Performance optimization in response handling |\n\n### Load Balancing Algorithm Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **load balancing algorithm** | A strategy or method for selecting which backend server should receive each incoming request. Different algorithms optimize for different goals like even distribution or session consistency. | Core component with multiple implementations |\n| **round-robin** | A load balancing algorithm that cycles through backend servers in sequential order, giving each server an equal number of requests over time. Simple and effective for homogeneous backends. | Primary algorithm implemented in Milestone 2 |\n| **weighted distribution** | A load balancing approach where backends receive traffic proportional to assigned weights. Higher-capacity servers receive proportionally more requests. | Advanced algorithm variation |\n| **least connections** | An algorithm that routes each request to the backend server currently handling the fewest active connections. Useful when request processing times vary significantly. | Implemented in Milestone 4 |\n| **smooth weighted round robin** | A refined weighted algorithm that avoids burst selections of high-weight backends by gradually adjusting selection probabilities. Provides more even distribution than naive weighted approaches. | Advanced weighted algorithm implementation |\n| **connection tracking** | Monitoring the number of active HTTP connections or requests being processed by each backend server. Required for implementing least connections algorithm effectively. | Supporting mechanism for connection-based algorithms |\n| **hash consistency** | The property that the same input (like client IP address) consistently maps to the same backend server, even when the backend pool changes. Essential for session affinity. | Key property of IP hash algorithm |\n| **atomic operations** | Thread-safe operations that complete entirely or not at all, without interference from other concurrent operations. Critical for maintaining consistent counters in multi-threaded environments. | Required for thread-safe algorithm implementations |\n| **algorithm switching** | The ability to change the active load balancing algorithm at runtime without restarting the service or dropping existing connections. | Runtime configuration capability |\n\n### Health Checking Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **health check** | A periodic verification mechanism that determines whether a backend server is available and capable of processing requests. Can be active (proactive probing) or passive (based on request failures). | Core monitoring mechanism implemented in Milestone 3 |\n| **active health checking** | A proactive monitoring approach where the load balancer periodically sends health check requests to backend servers, independent of client traffic. | Primary health checking approach |\n| **passive health checking** | A monitoring approach that infers backend health from the success or failure of actual client requests, without sending dedicated health check probes. | Alternative approach not implemented |\n| **consecutive failure counting** | Tracking the number of sequential health check failures for each backend to determine when it should be marked unhealthy. Prevents marking backends unhealthy due to transient failures. | State transition logic in health checking |\n| **recovery detection** | The process of monitoring unhealthy backends for signs of recovery and restoring them to the active rotation when they become healthy again. | Critical for automatic system recovery |\n| **probe** | A single health check request sent to a backend server to verify its availability and responsiveness. Typically a simple HTTP GET request to a dedicated health endpoint. | Basic unit of health checking |\n| **failure detection** | The overall process of identifying when backend servers become unavailable or unresponsive, including both health check failures and request-time failures. | System reliability mechanism |\n| **thundering herd** | A problematic scenario where many clients or processes simultaneously attempt to access a resource that has just become available, potentially overwhelming it. | Common pitfall in health check recovery |\n| **health endpoint** | A dedicated URL path on backend servers that responds to health check requests with status information. Typically lightweight and doesn't perform complex business logic. | Backend server responsibility |\n| **state flapping** | Rapid alternation between healthy and unhealthy states, often due to a backend server that is marginally functional or experiencing intermittent issues. | Problem mitigated by consecutive check thresholds |\n\n### Request Processing Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **request router** | The central coordinator component that integrates HTTP proxy functionality, backend selection, and health checking to route requests effectively through the complete processing pipeline. | Central orchestration component |\n| **request processing pipeline** | A multi-stage flow that handles requests from initial reception through backend selection, request forwarding, response processing, and final client delivery. | Overall request handling architecture |\n| **request context** | Correlation data and metadata carried through the processing pipeline for a single request, including request ID, timing information, and selected backend details. | Request tracking and debugging aid |\n| **error response handling** | The process of generating appropriate HTTP error responses for various failure scenarios, including backend failures, timeouts, and configuration issues. | Error management strategy |\n| **backend selection** | The process of choosing an appropriate backend server for an incoming request using the configured load balancing algorithm and considering backend health status. | Algorithm application point |\n| **request enhancement** | The process of adding proxy-specific headers (like X-Forwarded-For) and modifying the original client request to prepare it for forwarding to a backend server. | Request preparation step |\n| **connection management** | Establishing, maintaining, and properly closing HTTP connections to backend servers, including connection pooling and timeout handling for efficiency and reliability. | Resource management concern |\n| **resource cleanup** | Proper deallocation of resources like HTTP connections, goroutines, and memory buffers when requests complete or fail, preventing resource leaks. | Memory and connection management |\n| **error correlation** | The practice of tracking requests through system logs using correlation IDs, making it possible to trace a single request's path through all system components. | Debugging and monitoring aid |\n\n### Configuration and Runtime Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **hot reload** | The capability to update system configuration without interrupting service operation or dropping existing connections. Changes take effect immediately without restart. | Runtime configuration management |\n| **configuration validation** | The process of checking configuration correctness, completeness, and internal consistency before applying changes to the running system. | Safety mechanism for configuration changes |\n| **atomic updates** | Configuration changes that either succeed completely or fail completely, without leaving the system in an inconsistent intermediate state. | Reliability pattern for configuration management |\n| **configuration distribution** | The process of spreading configuration updates across multiple system components and ensuring all components receive consistent configuration information. | Multi-component coordination |\n| **file watcher** | A mechanism that monitors configuration files for changes and triggers reload processes when modifications are detected. | Automated configuration update trigger |\n| **rollback capability** | The ability to revert to a previous working configuration when a configuration update causes problems or fails validation. | Safety mechanism for configuration management |\n| **two-phase updates** | A configuration update process that first validates changes across all components, then applies them only if validation succeeds everywhere. | Consistency mechanism for complex updates |\n\n### Error Handling and Reliability Terms\n\n| Term | Definition | Context |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **error classification** | The process of categorizing errors by type, source, and appropriate handling strategy. Different error types require different response approaches. | Systematic error management |\n| **circuit breaker** | A design pattern that prevents repeated failed operations by \"opening\" when failure rates exceed thresholds, failing fast instead of wasting resources on doomed operations. | Failure prevention pattern |\n| **failure mode analysis** | A systematic catalog and study of all possible ways a system can fail, including their causes, detection methods, and recovery strategies. | Comprehensive reliability engineering |\n| **cascade failure** | A failure scenario where initial failures trigger additional failures in dependent components, potentially leading to total system failure. | System reliability risk |\n| **admission control** | The practice of rejecting requests early when the system is operating at or near capacity, rather than accepting requests that cannot be processed successfully. | Load management strategy |\n| **fail-fast** | A design principle of

state** | An intermediate circuit breaker state where limited requests are allowed through to test whether a previously failing service has recovered. | Circuit breaker recovery mechanism |\n\n###

When building your load balancer, use these exact terms consistently throughout code, comments, documentation, and discussions.\n\n#### Terminology Usage Guidelines\n\n| Context | Guideline | Example |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| **Code Comments** | Use precise technical terms from the glossary | `// Implement round-robin algorithm with atomic counter for thread safety` |\n| **Configuration Keys** | Use standardized terms for consistency | `\"algorithm\": \"round_robin\"` instead of `\"strategy\": \"rotating\"` |\n| **Log Messages** | Use consistent terminology for operational clarity | `\"backend_health_changed\"` with `\"healthy\": false` |\n| **Error Messages** | Use classification terms for systematic error handling | `ErrorTypeConnection` for network-related failures |\n| **API Responses** | Use standard terminology in JSON responses | `{\"backend_pool\": [...], \"health_state\": \"healthy\"}` |\n| **Test Names** | Use descriptive terms that map to requirements | `TestRoundRobinAlgorithmThreadSafety` |\n\n#### Common Terminology Mistakes\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Terminology**\nUsing different terms for the same concept throughout the codebase creates confusion and makes debugging more difficult. For example, mixing \"backend server,\" \"upstream,\" and \"target server\" to refer to the same thing makes logs and documentation harder to follow.\n\n**How to avoid**: Establish a project glossary early and use consistent terminology throughout. Use linters or code review processes to catch terminology inconsistencies.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overloading Generic Terms**\nUsing generic terms like \"server,\" \"error,\" or \"request\" without qualification can be ambiguous in complex systems. This makes troubleshooting and system understanding more difficult.\n\n**How to avoid**: Use qualified terms like \"backend server,\" \"ErrorTypeConnection,\" and \"health check request\" to provide precise meaning.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inventing Custom Terminology**\nCreating project-specific terms for well-established concepts makes it harder for new team members to understand the system and reduces the value of external documentation and resources.\n\n**How to avoid**: Use industry-standard terminology from this glossary. When you need to extend concepts, build on established terms rather than creating entirely new ones.\n\n#### Terminology Integration Checklist\n\nUse this checklist when implementing each milestone to ensure consistent terminology usage:\n\n**Milestone 1 - HTTP Proxy Foundation:**\n- [ ] Use \"reverse proxy\" in code and documentation\n- [ ] Implement \"header forwarding\" with X-Forwarded headers\n- [ ] Use \"request forwarding\" and \"response streaming\" terminology\n- [ ] Handle \"ErrorTypeConnection\" for backend failures\n\n**Milestone 2 - Round Robin Distribution:**\n- [ ] Use \"round_robin\" as algorithm identifier constant\n- [ ] Implement \"backend pool\" management\n- [ ] Use \"atomic operations\" for thread-safe counters\n- [ ] Use \"backend selection\" terminology in method names\n\n**Milestone 3 - Health Checks:**\n- [ ] Use \"active health checking\" terminology\n- [ ] Implement \"consecutive failure counting\"\n- [ ] Use \"probe\" for individual health check requests\n- [ ] Handle \"recovery detection\" logic\n\n**Milestone 4 - Additional Algorithms:**\n- [ ] Use standard algorithm constants: \"least_connections,\" \"weighted_round_robin,\" \"ip_hash,\" \"random\"\n- [ ] Implement \"connection tracking\" for least connections\n- [ ] Use \"hash consistency\" for IP hash algorithm\n- [ ] Support \"algorithm switching\" at runtime\n\n#### Code Documentation Standards\n\nWhen documenting your implementation, use this glossary as the authoritative reference for technical terms. This ensures that your documentation remains consistent with industry standards and facilitates knowledge transfer between team members.\n\n**Function Documentation Template:**\n```go\n// SelectBackend chooses a backend server from the healthy backend pool\n// using the configured load balancing algorithm.
