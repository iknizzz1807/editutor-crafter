This system solves the critical challenge of allowing applications to access user data without exposing user credentials, while maintaining strong security guarantees through cryptographic tokens and standardized flows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This provides foundational context for all milestones (1-4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-digital-valet-key-system\">Mental Model: Digital Valet Key System</h3>\n<p>Before diving into the technical complexities of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, let&#39;s establish an intuitive mental model that will help us understand the core authorization problem these protocols solve.</p>\n<p>Imagine you&#39;re visiting a luxury hotel and need to leave your car with the valet. You could hand over your main car key, but that would give the valet complete access to everything: they could drive to Las Vegas, access your glove compartment, adjust your seat settings, and even steal your car. Instead, modern cars provide a <strong>valet key</strong> - a special key that starts the engine and unlocks the doors, but cannot access the trunk or glove compartment, and often has speed limitations programmed into the car&#39;s computer.</p>\n<p>This valet key system embodies the core principle of OAuth2: <strong>delegated authorization with limited scope</strong>. Just as the valet key grants specific, limited access to your car without compromising your full ownership, OAuth2 allows applications to access specific user data without requiring the user&#39;s complete credentials.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s extend this analogy to understand the key participants in OAuth2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You (the car owner)</strong> represent the <strong>Resource Owner</strong> - the user who owns the data</li>\n<li><strong>Your car</strong> represents the <strong>Protected Resource</strong> - the user&#39;s data (photos, contacts, emails)  </li>\n<li><strong>The valet service</strong> represents the <strong>Client Application</strong> - the third-party app requesting access</li>\n<li><strong>The valet key</strong> represents the <strong>Access Token</strong> - a limited-capability credential</li>\n<li><strong>The hotel&#39;s key management system</strong> represents the <strong>Authorization Server</strong> - the OAuth2 provider that issues tokens</li>\n<li><strong>The car&#39;s computer that validates the valet key</strong> represents the <strong>Resource Server</strong> - the API that hosts the protected data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you authorize the valet service, you&#39;re not giving them your master key (password). Instead, the hotel&#39;s key management system creates a temporary, limited-capability key specifically for this interaction. The car&#39;s computer can verify this key&#39;s authenticity and enforce its limitations automatically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: OAuth2 eliminates the need for password sharing by introducing a token-based delegation system where the user grants specific, revocable permissions to applications without exposing their primary credentials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This mental model helps us understand why building a secure OAuth2 provider is challenging - we&#39;re essentially building the entire &quot;hotel key management system&quot; that can issue various types of limited-capability keys, track their usage, enforce their restrictions, and revoke them when necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-authentication-approaches\">Existing Authentication Approaches</h3>\n<p>To appreciate why OAuth2 represents a significant improvement in application security, let&#39;s examine the authentication approaches that preceded it and understand their fundamental limitations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"password-sharing-approach\">Password Sharing Approach</h4>\n<p>The most primitive approach to third-party application authorization involves users sharing their actual username and password with the requesting application. While simple to implement, this approach creates severe security and usability problems.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Password Sharing Approach</th>\n<th>Problems</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>User Experience</strong></td>\n<td>User enters their Facebook/Google password directly into third-party app</td>\n<td>Users must trust every app with their most sensitive credentials</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Access Control</strong></td>\n<td>App gains complete access to user&#39;s account</td>\n<td>No way to limit what the app can do - it can read, modify, or delete anything</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Credential Management</strong></td>\n<td>App must store user&#39;s actual password (often in plaintext)</td>\n<td>Creates honey pot targets for attackers; password breaches affect all apps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Revocation</strong></td>\n<td>User must change their password to revoke access</td>\n<td>Breaks access for ALL apps and devices, not just the compromised one</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Auditability</strong></td>\n<td>No distinction between user actions and app actions</td>\n<td>Impossible to track which actions came from which app</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Password Rotation</strong></td>\n<td>User changing password breaks all connected apps</td>\n<td>Forces users to avoid password rotation, weakening overall security</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Consider a concrete scenario: Sarah wants to use a photo printing service that can access her Google Photos. Under the password sharing model, she would enter her Google username and password into PhotoPrint&#39;s website. Now PhotoPrint can read her Gmail, modify her Google Drive files, change her account settings, and even lock her out by changing her password. If PhotoPrint&#39;s database gets breached, Sarah&#39;s Google credentials are compromised, forcing her to change her password and reconfigure every device and application that accesses her Google account.</p>\n<h4 id=\"api-key-approach\">API Key Approach</h4>\n<p>Recognizing the problems with password sharing, many services introduced API keys - long-lived tokens that applications could use instead of passwords. While an improvement, this approach still has significant limitations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>API Key Approach</th>\n<th>Limitations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Scope Control</strong></td>\n<td>API key typically grants broad access to user&#39;s account</td>\n<td>Limited ability to restrict access to specific resources or actions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>User Involvement</strong></td>\n<td>User must manually generate and copy-paste API keys</td>\n<td>Complex setup process; users often confused about key generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Expiration</strong></td>\n<td>Keys often never expire or have very long lifespans</td>\n<td>Compromised keys remain valid indefinitely; no automatic rotation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Granular Permissions</strong></td>\n<td>Single key for all operations</td>\n<td>Cannot grant read-only access or limit to specific data types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Revocation</strong></td>\n<td>User must manually revoke keys through provider&#39;s interface</td>\n<td>No standardized way for apps to check if key is still valid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-User Apps</strong></td>\n<td>Each user must generate separate API keys</td>\n<td>Apps must manage complex key-to-user mapping; no unified flow</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The API key approach works reasonably well for developer-to-service integration (like accessing a weather API), but breaks down for consumer applications that need to access data from multiple users across different services.</p>\n<h4 id=\"oauth2-approach\">OAuth2 Approach</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 fundamentally changes the authorization model by introducing a standardized delegation protocol that addresses the limitations of both password sharing and API keys.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>OAuth2 Approach</th>\n<th>Benefits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Credential Security</strong></td>\n<td>User never shares password with third-party apps</td>\n<td>Eliminates password exposure; apps receive opaque tokens instead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Granular Permissions</strong></td>\n<td>Apps request specific scopes (read photos, send emails)</td>\n<td>Users can approve limited access; principle of least privilege</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Time-Limited Access</strong></td>\n<td>Access tokens have short expiration times (15 minutes - 1 hour)</td>\n<td>Reduces blast radius of compromised tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Standardized Flow</strong></td>\n<td>Consistent authorization experience across all providers</td>\n<td>Users learn one flow; developers implement one protocol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Revocation</strong></td>\n<td>Users can revoke access per-application without affecting others</td>\n<td>Fine-grained access control; easy to remove misbehaving apps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Refresh Capability</strong></td>\n<td>Refresh tokens allow apps to get new access tokens</td>\n<td>Long-running apps don&#39;t need user re-authorization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Auditability</strong></td>\n<td>Clear separation between user actions and app actions</td>\n<td>Providers can track which app performed which operations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The OAuth2 flow works like this: when PhotoPrint wants to access Sarah&#39;s Google Photos, it redirects her to Google&#39;s authorization server. Google authenticates Sarah using her normal credentials (which PhotoPrint never sees), shows her exactly what PhotoPrint is requesting access to, and asks for her approval. If she approves, Google issues PhotoPrint a limited-capability access token that can only read photos from her account. This token expires after an hour, and Sarah can revoke it at any time through her Google account settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: OAuth2&#39;s key innovation is the introduction of an intermediary (the authorization server) that translates user consent into limited-capability tokens, enabling secure delegation without credential sharing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"core-security-challenges\">Core Security Challenges</h3>\n<p>Building a secure OAuth2 provider involves solving several complex security challenges that don&#39;t exist in simpler authentication systems. Understanding these challenges is crucial for implementing a system that can withstand real-world attacks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cryptographic-token-management\">Cryptographic Token Management</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 providers must generate, sign, validate, and revoke millions of tokens while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees. This presents several specific challenges:</p>\n<p><strong>Secure Random Number Generation</strong>: Authorization codes, client secrets, and tokens must be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators. Weak randomness can enable attackers to predict future tokens or brute-force existing ones. The provider must ensure sufficient entropy is available and that the random number generator is properly seeded.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Signing and Verification</strong>: Access tokens implemented as JWTs require asymmetric cryptography for signing and verification. The provider must securely manage private keys used for signing, ensure proper key rotation, and handle signature verification edge cases. Additionally, the choice of signing algorithm (RS256, ES256, etc.) affects both security and performance characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Binding and Replay Protection</strong>: Tokens must be cryptographically bound to specific clients and contexts to prevent replay attacks. This involves validating that the entity presenting a token is the same entity it was issued to, which becomes complex in distributed systems with multiple resource servers.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Security Property</th>\n<th>Challenge</th>\n<th>OAuth2 Solution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Confidentiality</strong></td>\n<td>Tokens contain sensitive authorization information</td>\n<td>Opaque tokens for authorization codes; signed JWTs for access tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Integrity</strong></td>\n<td>Prevent token modification by attackers</td>\n<td>Cryptographic signatures; constant-time comparison for validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Authenticity</strong></td>\n<td>Verify tokens were issued by legitimate authorization server</td>\n<td>Asymmetric signatures; well-known public key endpoints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Non-repudiation</strong></td>\n<td>Prove which entity performed which action</td>\n<td>Token-to-client binding; audit logs with token identifiers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Freshness</strong></td>\n<td>Prevent replay of old tokens</td>\n<td>Short expiration times; timestamp validation; nonce handling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"distributed-security-state-management\">Distributed Security State Management</h4>\n<p>Unlike simple session-based authentication where state exists on a single server, OAuth2 providers must maintain security-critical state across distributed systems and time periods.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Code State</strong>: Authorization codes must be single-use, short-lived, and bound to specific clients and redirect URIs. The provider must track which codes have been used and prevent replay attacks, while handling the race conditions that can occur when multiple systems attempt to exchange the same code simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Family Tracking</strong>: Refresh token rotation requires tracking &quot;token families&quot; - chains of related refresh tokens issued for the same authorization grant. If an old refresh token is reused (indicating possible token theft), the entire token family must be revoked. This requires maintaining historical token relationships across potentially millions of active sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>Consent and Scope Management</strong>: The provider must remember which users have granted which permissions to which clients, enabling features like &quot;skip consent screen for previously authorized scopes&quot; while ensuring scope creep doesn&#39;t occur when apps request additional permissions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State Management Challenge</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Failure Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Cross-Server Consistency</strong></td>\n<td>Multiple servers must see token revocations immediately</td>\n<td>Revoked tokens remain valid on some servers; security breach</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Partial System Failures</strong></td>\n<td>Network partitions, database failures, cache inconsistencies</td>\n<td>Users locked out; tokens valid longer than intended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Race Conditions</strong></td>\n<td>Concurrent token exchanges, refresh operations, revocations</td>\n<td>Double-spending of authorization codes; token family corruption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>State Explosion</strong></td>\n<td>Millions of tokens, codes, and consent records</td>\n<td>Memory exhaustion; slow lookups; data consistency challenges</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"protocol-level-attack-resistance\">Protocol-Level Attack Resistance</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 and OpenID Connect specifications address numerous attack vectors, but implementing these defenses correctly requires deep understanding of web security principles.</p>\n<p><strong>PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)</strong>: Modern OAuth2 implementations must support PKCE to protect against authorization code interception attacks, particularly on mobile devices and single-page applications. This requires generating cryptographically secure code challenges, properly validating code verifiers using SHA256 hashing, and enforcing PKCE for public clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect URI Validation</strong>: One of the most critical security controls in OAuth2 is strict validation of redirect URIs. The provider must perform exact string matching against pre-registered URIs, resist various bypass attempts (subdomain attacks, open redirects, homograph attacks), and handle edge cases like custom URL schemes for mobile apps.</p>\n<p><strong>State Parameter Handling</strong>: The state parameter prevents CSRF attacks by allowing clients to verify that authorization responses correspond to their requests. The provider must preserve state values across the authorization flow and ensure they are validated by clients.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Principle</strong>: OAuth2 security depends on the weakest link in a complex chain of validations. A single bypass in redirect URI validation, PKCE verification, or token binding can compromise the entire system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"real-world-implementation-pitfalls\">Real-World Implementation Pitfalls</h4>\n<p>The OAuth2 and OIDC specifications leave many security-critical implementation details to the provider, creating opportunities for subtle vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Timing Attack Vulnerabilities</strong>: Token validation, client secret verification, and authorization code lookup must use constant-time comparison algorithms to prevent timing-based attacks where attackers can determine valid prefixes of secrets by measuring response times.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Leakage Through Logs</strong>: Access tokens and refresh tokens must never appear in application logs, error messages, or debugging output. This requires careful sanitization of log entries and error responses while maintaining sufficient debugging information for operational support.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptographic Agility</strong>: The provider must support algorithm evolution (moving from RS256 to ES256, increasing key sizes) without breaking existing clients. This requires versioned key management and graceful algorithm migration strategies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attack Vector</th>\n<th>Technical Challenge</th>\n<th>Mitigation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Authorization Code Injection</strong></td>\n<td>Attacker intercepts codes via network, malware, or device sharing</td>\n<td>PKCE implementation; short code lifetimes; TLS enforcement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Token Sidejacking</strong></td>\n<td>Tokens stolen via XSS, network interception, or server logs</td>\n<td>Secure token storage; SameSite cookies; log sanitization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redirect URI Manipulation</strong></td>\n<td>Bypass redirect validation to send codes to attacker domains</td>\n<td>Exact string matching; homograph detection; scheme validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scope Creep</strong></td>\n<td>Apps gradually request more permissions than originally granted</td>\n<td>Consent re-prompting; scope diff detection; audit logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Client Impersonation</strong></td>\n<td>Malicious apps pretend to be legitimate clients</td>\n<td>Client authentication; app attestation; dynamic registration controls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The complexity of these security challenges explains why many organizations choose to use hosted OAuth2 providers (like Auth0, Okta, or cloud provider services) rather than building their own. However, understanding these challenges is essential for developers who need to implement custom authorization logic, integrate with existing systems, or meet specific compliance requirements that hosted solutions cannot address.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Philosophy</strong>: A secure OAuth2 provider must assume that every component can be compromised and design defenses that limit the blast radius of any single point of failure. This defense-in-depth approach requires multiple layers of validation, cryptographic protection, and audit logging.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology Recommendations</h4>\n<p>Building a production-ready OAuth2 provider requires careful selection of cryptographic libraries, storage systems, and web frameworks that provide the security primitives needed for token management.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Web Framework</strong></td>\n<td><code>net/http</code> with <code>gorilla/mux</code> for routing</td>\n<td><code>gin-gonic/gin</code> or <code>echo</code> for middleware support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cryptography</strong></td>\n<td>Go&#39;s <code>crypto</code> package for JWT signing</td>\n<td><code>golang-jwt/jwt/v5</code> for JWT convenience methods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Database</strong></td>\n<td>SQLite with <code>database/sql</code> for development</td>\n<td>PostgreSQL with <code>lib/pq</code> for production</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Caching</strong></td>\n<td>In-memory <code>sync.Map</code> for token blacklist</td>\n<td>Redis with <code>go-redis/redis/v8</code> for distributed cache</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Secure Random</strong></td>\n<td><code>crypto/rand</code> for all token generation</td>\n<td>Hardware security module (HSM) integration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Password Hashing</strong></td>\n<td><code>golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt</code> for client secrets</td>\n<td><code>golang.org/x/crypto/argon2</code> for stronger protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Configuration</strong></td>\n<td>Environment variables with <code>os.Getenv</code></td>\n<td><code>viper</code> for structured configuration management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Logging</strong></td>\n<td>Standard <code>log</code> package with careful sanitization</td>\n<td><code>logrus</code> or <code>zap</code> for structured logging</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h4>\n<p>Organize your OAuth2 provider codebase to separate concerns clearly and make testing straightforward.

id=\"goals-and-non-goals\">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section establishes the scope for all milestones (1-4), defining success criteria and boundaries</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section establishes clear boundaries for what our OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider will accomplish. Think of this as signing a contract with stakeholders - we&#39;re committing to specific capabilities while explicitly declining to solve certain problems. This clarity prevents scope creep and ensures we build a focused, secure system rather than an over-engineered monster that tries to solve every possible identity use case.</p>\n<p>The goals are organized into three categories: functional requirements that define what the system does, security requirements that define how it protects users and data, and explicit non-goals that define what we will not build. Each goal maps to specific acceptance criteria in our milestones, creating a clear path from high-level objectives to concrete implementation tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-goals-required-oauth2oidc-features-and-flows\">Functional Goals: Required OAuth2/OIDC Features and Flows</h3>\n<p>Our OAuth2 provider must implement the core authorization flows and endpoints required for modern web and mobile applications. These functional goals represent the minimum viable feature set for a production-ready identity provider that third-party applications can rely on for user authorization.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-oauth2-authorization-flows\">Core OAuth2 Authorization Flows</h4>\n<p>The system must support the <strong>authorization code grant flow</strong> as the primary mechanism for web applications to obtain user consent and access tokens. This flow involves redirecting users to our authorization server, displaying a consent screen, generating a short-lived authorization code, and exchanging that code for tokens. This is the most secure flow for applications that can protect a client secret.</p>\n<p>We must implement <strong>Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</strong> as a mandatory security extension for all authorization requests. PKCE prevents authorization code interception attacks by requiring clients to prove they initiated the original authorization request. Public clients like mobile apps and single-page applications cannot protect secrets, making PKCE their primary defense against token theft.</p>\n<p>The <strong>client credentials grant flow</strong> enables machine-to-machine authentication where no user interaction is required. Background services, APIs calling other APIs, and automated systems use this flow to authenticate using only their client ID and secret. This flow bypasses user consent since the client owns the data it&#39;s accessing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"token-management-and-lifecycle\">Token Management and Lifecycle</h4>\n<p>Our token endpoint must generate <strong>JWT access tokens</strong> with proper claims, signatures, and expiration times. JWTs enable resource servers to validate tokens locally without calling back to our authorization server, reducing latency and improving scalability. Each JWT must contain standard claims like subject (user ID), issuer (our server), audience (intended recipient), expiration time, and granted scopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh token rotation</strong> provides long-term access while maintaining security through token family tracking. When a client uses a refresh token to obtain a new access token, we must issue a new refresh token and invalidate the old one. If an old refresh token is reused (indicating potential theft), we revoke the entire token family associated with that user and client.</p>\n<p>The system must implement <strong>token introspection</strong> per RFC 7662, allowing resource servers to check token validity and retrieve metadata. This endpoint accepts an access or refresh token and returns whether it&#39;s active, along with information like expiration time, scopes, and client ID. Protected by client authentication, this endpoint serves as the authoritative source for token status.</p>\n<p><strong>Token revocation</strong> per RFC 7009 enables users and clients to immediately invalidate tokens. When a user logs out, uninstalls an app, or revokes consent, the associated tokens must become unusable instantly. This prevents lingering access after authorization is withdrawn.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-management-and-registration\">Client Management and Registration</h4>\n<p>The system must provide <strong>client registration APIs</strong> that create OAuth2 client records with generated credentials and configured parameters. Each client receives a unique client ID, a securely hashed client secret (for confidential clients), and a list of allowed redirect URIs where users can be sent after authorization.</p>\n<p><strong>Client authentication</strong> must validate client credentials during token requests using HTTP Basic authentication or form parameters. We must support both confidential clients (web applications with secrets) and public clients (mobile apps and SPAs without secrets) with appropriate security measures for each type.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect URI validation</strong> prevents authorization code theft by ensuring authorization responses only go to pre-registered, exact-match URIs. Partial matches, subdomain wildcards, and dynamic redirect URIs are explicitly rejected to prevent malicious clients from intercepting authorization codes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"openid-connect-identity-layer\">OpenID Connect Identity Layer</h4>\n<p>As an <strong>OpenID Connect provider</strong>, we must implement the identity layer on top of OAuth2. This includes issuing ID tokens (JWTs containing user authentication information), providing a UserInfo endpoint for accessing user profile claims, and supporting OIDC discovery through well-known configuration endpoints.</p>\n<p>The <strong>UserInfo endpoint</strong> returns user profile information based on the scopes granted during authorization. If a client receives consent for the &quot;email&quot; scope, the UserInfo endpoint returns the user&#39;s email address. If granted &quot;profile&quot; scope, it returns name and other profile fields. This scope-to-claims mapping ensures clients only access data they&#39;ve been authorized to see.</p>\n<p><strong>OIDC discovery</strong> through the <code>/.well-known/openid-configuration</code> endpoint enables client applications to automatically configure themselves by retrieving our server&#39;s capabilities, endpoints, and cryptographic keys. This reduces manual configuration and ensures clients stay synchronized with our server&#39;s capabilities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"user-consent-and-authorization\">User Consent and Authorization</h4>\n<p>The system must present <strong>user consent screens</strong> that clearly display what data and permissions an application is requesting. Users must be able to approve or deny each authorization request with full understanding of the implications. The consent screen shows the requesting application&#39;s name, the specific permissions (scopes) requested, and allows granular approval or complete denial.</p>\n<p><strong>Consent persistence</strong> remembers user authorization decisions so returning users aren&#39;t repeatedly prompted for the same client and scopes. If Alice previously granted the &quot;Calendar App&quot; access to her email and calendar, subsequent authorizations for the same permissions proceed automatically without re-prompting.</p>\n<p><strong>Consent revocation</strong> enables users to withdraw previously granted permissions through a management interface. When consent is revoked, associated tokens must be invalidated, and future authorization requests must re-prompt for user approval.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Functional Goal</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Associated Milestone</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authorization Code Grant</td>\n<td>Redirect user to consent, generate codes, exchange for tokens</td>\n<td>Milestone 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE Implementation</td>\n<td>Validate code challenges, enforce for public clients</td>\n<td>Milestone 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Credentials Grant</td>\n<td>Authenticate clients, issue tokens without user consent</td>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT Access Tokens</td>\n<td>Generate signed JWTs with proper claims and expiration</td>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refresh Token Rotation</td>\n<td>Issue new refresh tokens, invalidate old ones, track families</td>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Introspection</td>\n<td>RFC 7662 compliant endpoint returning token metadata</td>\n<td>Milestone 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Revocation</td>\n<td>RFC 7009 compliant endpoint invalidating tokens immediately</td>\n<td>Milestone 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserInfo Endpoint</td>\n<td>Return user claims based on granted scopes</td>\n<td>Milestone 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consent Management</td>\n<td>Display consent screens, persist decisions, enable revocation</td>\n<td>Milestone 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OIDC Discovery</td>\n<td>Publish well-known configuration with endpoints and keys</td>\n<td>Milestone 4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"security-goals-security-properties-the-system-must-maintain\">Security Goals: Security Properties the System Must Maintain</h3>\n<p>Security represents the most critical aspect of an identity provider - any compromise could expose user data across multiple applications. Our security goals establish the non-negotiable properties that the system must maintain under all circumstances, including attack scenarios and operational failures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cryptographic-security-properties\">Cryptographic Security Properties</h4>\n<p>All <strong>client secrets must be stored using cryptographically strong hashing</strong> with per-secret salts. We will never store plaintext secrets that could be compromised in a data breach. Client secret verification must use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about secret values.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization codes must be cryptographically random</strong> with sufficient entropy to resist brute force attacks. Codes must be single-use only and expire within 10 minutes to minimize the attack window. Each code must be cryptographically bound to the specific client and redirect URI to prevent theft and misuse.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT access tokens must be signed</strong> using asymmetric cryptography (RS256 or ES256) to enable distributed verification by resource servers. Private keys must be securely stored and never exposed through APIs or logs. Token signatures prevent tampering and ensure authenticity without requiring resource servers to contact our authorization server.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh tokens must have high entropy</strong> and be unpredictable to resist guessing attacks. Unlike JWTs, refresh tokens should be opaque strings stored in our database with associated metadata like expiration time, client ID, and user ID.</p>\n<h4 id=\"attack-resistance-requirements\">Attack Resistance Requirements</h4>\n<p>The system must resist <strong>authorization code interception attacks</strong> through mandatory PKCE implementation. Even if an attacker intercepts an authorization code through app link hijacking or network sniffing, they cannot exchange it for tokens without the original code verifier that only the legitimate client possesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection</strong> must be enforced through mandatory state parameters in authorization requests. Clients must provide unpredictable state values that are validated when users return from the authorization server. This prevents attackers from tricking users into authorizing malicious applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Token replay attack prevention</strong> requires tracking used authorization codes and implementing refresh token rotation. Once an authorization code is exchanged for tokens, it becomes permanently invalid. Similarly, refresh tokens become invalid after a single use, requiring clients to use the newly issued refresh token for subsequent refreshes.</p>\n<p><strong>Timing attack resistance</strong> mandates constant-time comparison for all secret validation operations. Whether comparing client secrets, authorization codes, or any other sensitive values, the comparison time must not leak information about correct vs. incorrect values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"data-protection-requirements\">Data Protection Requirements</h4>\n<p><strong>Sensitive data must never appear in JWT payloads</strong> since JWTs are base64-encoded, not encrypted. Access tokens should contain only non-sensitive claims like user ID, expiration time, and granted scopes. Detailed user information like email addresses, phone numbers, or profile data must only be available through the protected UserInfo endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Audit logging</strong> must record all security-relevant events including client registrations, authorization grants, token issuances, token revocations, and authentication failures. Logs must include sufficient context for forensic analysis while avoiding sensitive data like tokens or user passwords.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure credential storage</strong> requires that all persistent sensitive data uses appropriate encryption or hashing. Client secrets use bcrypt or similar password hashing. Refresh tokens should be stored as hashed values to prevent compromise even if the database is breached.</p>\n<h4 id=\"session-and-state-management-security\">Session and State Management Security</h4>\n<p><strong>Authorization code binding</strong> ensures codes cannot be used by unintended parties. Each code must be cryptographically bound to the specific client ID, redirect URI, user ID, and PKCE code challenge that were present during authorization. Attempts to use codes with different parameters must fail validation.</p>\n<p><strong>Token family tracking</strong> for refresh tokens enables breach detection. When a client exchanges a refresh token, we track the old and new tokens as part of the same family. If the old token is later used (indicating theft), we immediately revoke all tokens in that family to limit the blast radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent session limits</strong> prevent token proliferation by limiting how many active refresh tokens a single user can have with each client. When limits are exceeded, the oldest tokens are automatically revoked, ensuring users maintain control over their authorization grants.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Security Property</th>\n<th>Implementation Requirement</th>\n<th>Attack Prevention</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client Secret Security</td>\n<td>bcrypt hashing, constant-time comparison</td>\n<td>Database breach, timing attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization Code Security</td>\n<td>Cryptographic randomness, single-use, 10-minute expiry</td>\n<td>Code interception, replay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT Signature Security</td>\n<td>Asymmetric signing (RS256/ES256), secure key storage</td>\n<td>Token tampering, forgery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE Enforcement</td>\n<td>Mandatory for all flows, SHA256 code challenge</td>\n<td>Code interception</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CSRF Protection</td>\n<td>Mandatory state parameter validation</td>\n<td>Cross-site request forgery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Replay Prevention</td>\n<td>Single-use codes, refresh token rotation</td>\n<td>Replay attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timing Attack Resistance</td>\n<td>Constant-time secret comparison</td>\n<td>Information leakage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Exposure Prevention</td>\n<td>No sensitive data in JWTs, protected UserInfo endpoint</td>\n<td>Unintended data disclosure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audit Trail</td>\n<td>Security event logging with context</td>\n<td>Forensic analysis support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Family Tracking</td>\n<td>Refresh token breach detection and revocation</td>\n<td>Token theft mitigation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: The security of an OAuth2 provider extends beyond just protecting its own data - any compromise could expose user data across every application that trusts our tokens. This responsibility amplifies the importance of defense-in-depth strategies and assumes-breach security models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"non-goals-features-explicitly-excluded-from-this-implementation\">Non-Goals: Features explicitly excluded from this implementation</h3>\n<p>Clearly defining what we will not build prevents scope creep and manages stakeholder expectations. These non-goals represent valuable features that could be added in future iterations but are explicitly excluded from our initial implementation to maintain focus on core security and functionality.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-oauth2-grant-types-and-flows\">Advanced OAuth2 Grant Types and Flows</h4>\n<p>We will <strong>not implement the implicit grant flow</strong> which directly returns access tokens in the URL fragment without an authorization code exchange step. While historically used for single-page applications, the implicit flow has known security vulnerabilities and has been superseded by the authorization code flow with PKCE for all client types.</p>\n<p><strong>Device authorization grant (RFC 8628)</strong> for input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices is excluded. This flow involves displaying codes on one device while users complete authorization on a separate device with better input capabilities. While useful for modern IoT scenarios, it adds complexity without being essential for web and mobile applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Owner Password Credentials grant</strong> where users directly provide their username and password to client applications is explicitly rejected. This grant type undermines the fundamental OAuth2 principle of never sharing user credentials with third parties and should only be used when no redirect-based flow is possible.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-security-and-enterprise-features\">Advanced Security and Enterprise Features</h4>\n<p><strong>Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)</strong> from RFC 9126, which allows clients to push authorization request parameters directly to the authorization server instead of passing them through browser redirects, is not included. While PAR improves security by keeping request parameters confidential, it adds complexity and is not required for basic OAuth2 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Rich Authorization Requests</strong> that support fine-grained permissions beyond simple scopes (e.g., &quot;access calendar events from January to March for work calendar only&quot;) are excluded. The standard scope-based authorization model provides sufficient granularity for most applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial-grade API (FAPI) compliance</strong> with its additional security requirements like mutual TLS authentication, signed request objects, and enhanced token binding is not included. FAPI represents the highest security tier for financial applications but exceeds the requirements for general-purpose identity providers.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-tenant architecture</strong> supporting multiple isolated organizations within a single deployment is excluded. Each deployment will serve a single organization or user base, simplifying data isolation and access control models.</p>\n<h4 id=\"identity-federation-and-protocol-integration\">Identity Federation and Protocol Integration</h4>\n<p><strong>SAML 2.0 integration</strong> for enterprise single sign-on scenarios is not included. While SAML remains important in enterprise environments, supporting it would require implementing an entirely different protocol stack alongside OAuth2/OIDC.</p>\n<p><strong>Social login providers</strong> like &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; or &quot;Login with Facebook&quot; are excluded from the core implementation. While valuable for user experience, integrating external identity providers adds operational dependencies and complexity that can be addressed through separate modules.</p>\n<p><strong>LDAP or Active Directory integration</strong> for enterprise user stores is not included in the initial scope. The system will maintain its own user database, though the architecture should allow for pluggable user stores in future versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-domain identity federation</strong> protocols like SAML federation or OpenID Connect federation are excluded. Our provider will serve as an authoritative identity source rather than participating in federated trust relationships with other providers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-user-experience-and-management-features\">Advanced User Experience and Management Features</h4>\n<p><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> during the authorization flow is excluded from core functionality. Users may have MFA configured in their user accounts, but the OAuth2 authorization flow itself will not enforce or manage additional authentication factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive consent</strong> where applications can request additional scopes after initial authorization without full re-consent is not implemented. Each authorization request is treated independently, requiring explicit user consent for any new or changed scope requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Administrative interfaces</strong> for managing clients, viewing user consents, monitoring token usage, or configuring server settings are excluded. Initial deployments will rely on direct database access or API calls for administrative tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>User self-service portals</strong> for managing authorized applications, reviewing permissions, or configuring account settings are not included. Consent revocation will be available through API endpoints but not through a web interface.</p>\n<h4 id=\"operational-and-deployment-features\">Operational and Deployment Features</h4>\n<p><strong>High availability clustering</strong> with leader election, state synchronization, and automatic failover is excluded. Initial deployments assume single-instance operation with traditional database backup and recovery procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics and monitoring integration</strong> with systems like Prometheus, Grafana, or application performance monitoring (APM) tools is not included. Basic logging will be available, but structured metrics export requires additional development.</p>\n<p><strong>Database migration tooling</strong> for upgrading schemas, migrating between database engines, or handling data transformations during version upgrades is excluded. Schema changes will require manual database administration.</p>\n<p><strong>Containerization and orchestration</strong> support with Docker images, Kubernetes manifests, or cloud-native deployment patterns is not included in the core deliverable. The application will be designed as a standard executable that can be containerized separately.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Non-Goal Category</th>\n<th>Excluded Feature</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Grant Types</td>\n<td>Implicit Grant Flow</td>\n<td>Security vulnerabilities, superseded by PKCE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grant Types</td>\n<td>Device Authorization Grant</td>\n<td>Complexity without broad necessity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grant Types</td>\n<td>Password Credentials Grant</td>\n<td>Violates OAuth2 security principles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>Pushed Authorization Requests</td>\n<td>Adds complexity beyond basic compliance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>Financial-grade API (FAPI)</td>\n<td>Exceeds general-purpose requirements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security</td>\n<td>Rich Authorization Requests</td>\n<td>Standard scopes provide sufficient granularity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Federation</td>\n<td>SAML 2.0 Integration</td>\n<td>Different protocol stack, enterprise complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Federation</td>\n<td>Social Login Providers</td>\n<td>External dependencies, operational complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Federation</td>\n<td>LDAP/AD Integration</td>\n<td>Enterprise complexity, pluggable in future</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Experience</td>\n<td>Multi-factor Authentication</td>\n<td>Authentication vs. authorization separation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Experience</td>\n<td>Administrative Web Interface</td>\n<td>API-first approach sufficient initially</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Experience</td>\n<td>User Self-service Portal</td>\n<td>Core functionality focus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operations</td>\n<td>High Availability Clustering</td>\n<td>Single-instance operational model</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operations</td>\n<td>Built-in Metrics/Monitoring</td>\n<td>External tooling integration preferred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operations</td>\n<td>Database Migration Tools</td>\n<td>Manual administration acceptable initially</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Philosophy</strong>: By explicitly excluding these features, we&#39;re prioritizing a secure, compliant, and maintainable core implementation over feature completeness. Each excluded item represents a potential future enhancement that can be added without compromising the foundational architecture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Pitfall: Scope Creep Through &quot;Simple&quot; Additions</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is treating excluded features as &quot;quick additions&quot; during development. For example, adding implicit grant support &quot;just for testing&quot; or including basic MFA &quot;since we&#39;re already handling user authentication.&quot; Each excluded feature was deliberately omitted due to complexity, security implications, or maintenance burden. Resist the temptation to include them without proper design and testing - they inevitably consume more effort than anticipated and can compromise the security or maintainability of core features.</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Pitfall: Misunderstanding OAuth2 vs. OIDC Scope</strong></p>\n<p>Developers sometimes confuse OAuth2 authorization with general authentication features. OAuth2 is specifically about delegating access to resources, not about user authentication, password management, or session handling. Features like password reset, account lockout, or user registration are authentication concerns that exist outside the OAuth2 specification. Keep the OAuth2 provider focused on authorization delegation rather than expanding into a general authentication system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides concrete technology recommendations and starter code to begin implementing the goals outlined above.

Architecture</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section provides architectural foundation for all milestones (1-4), establishing the component structure that will be built incrementally</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-digital-bank-infrastructure\">Mental Model: Digital Bank Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Think of our OAuth2 provider as a <strong>digital bank infrastructure</strong> that manages authorization rather than money. Just as a physical bank has distinct departments working together - the front desk registers new customers, the loan department approves credit applications, the vault manages assets, and the audit department tracks all transactions - our OAuth2 provider has specialized components that collaborate to securely manage digital permissions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Authorization Endpoint</strong> is like the loan application desk where customers (users) come to approve third-party access requests. The <strong>Token Endpoint</strong> acts like the vault, exchanging approved authorizations for valuable digital tokens. The <strong>Client Registration</strong> component functions like the business accounts department, vetting and registering third-party applications that want to access customer data. The <strong>UserInfo Endpoint</strong> operates like the customer service desk, providing account information to authorized parties.</p>\n<p>Each department has its own specialized storage systems, security protocols, and communication channels, but they all work together through well-defined interfaces to ensure that every authorization transaction is secure, auditable, and follows banking regulations (OAuth2/OIDC specifications).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-component-diagram.svg\" alt=\"OAuth2 Provider System Components\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview-main-components-and-their-responsibilities\">Component Overview: Main Components and Their Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>Our OAuth2 provider consists of six primary components that work together to implement the complete authorization server functionality. Each component has distinct responsibilities and maintains its own data while communicating through well-defined interfaces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-authorization-components\">Core Authorization Components</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Authorization Endpoint Component</strong> serves as the entry point for OAuth2 flows, handling initial authorization requests from client applications. This component validates client credentials, manages PKCE security mechanisms, presents consent screens to users, and generates authorization codes bound to specific clients and users. It implements the authorization server role defined in RFC 6749, ensuring that all authorization requests follow proper security protocols and user consent is obtained before any access is granted.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Token Endpoint Component</strong> functions as the secure token exchange facility, responsible for converting authorization codes into JWT access tokens and refresh tokens. This component handles multiple OAuth2 grant types including authorization code grant and client credentials grant, implements refresh token rotation for enhanced security, and generates cryptographically signed JWTs with appropriate claims and expiration times. It serves as the primary interface for client applications to obtain the credentials they need to access protected resources.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Client Registration Component</strong> manages the lifecycle of OAuth2 client applications, handling registration, credential generation, and ongoing client management. This component generates unique client identifiers, securely hashes and stores client secrets, validates redirect URIs, and maintains client configuration including allowed grant types and scopes. It ensures that only properly registered and authenticated clients can participate in OAuth2 flows.</p>\n<h4 id=\"token-management-components\">Token Management Components</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Token Introspection and Revocation Component</strong> provides RFC 7662 and RFC 7009 compliant endpoints for token validation and invalidation. The introspection functionality allows resource servers to validate tokens and retrieve metadata about their status and associated permissions. The revocation functionality enables immediate token invalidation for security incidents or user-initiated logouts, with support for refresh token family tracking to detect token theft.</p>\n<p>The <strong>UserInfo and Consent Management Component</strong> implements the OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint and manages user consent decisions throughout their lifecycle. This component maps granted scopes to specific user claims, filters profile information based on authorized permissions, and maintains persistent records of user consent decisions. It ensures that users retain control over their data and can revoke previously granted permissions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"supporting-infrastructure-components\">Supporting Infrastructure Components</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Data Storage Layer</strong> provides persistent storage for all system entities including clients, users, tokens, authorization codes, and consent records. This layer abstracts the underlying storage technology and provides consistent interfaces for data access, ensuring data integrity and supporting concurrent access patterns required by the OAuth2 flows.</p>\n<p>Each component maintains clear boundaries and communicates through well-defined interfaces, enabling the system to scale horizontally and be maintained by different development teams. The architecture supports both synchronous request-response patterns for user-facing flows and asynchronous processing for token cleanup and audit logging.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component Name</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Data Managed</th>\n<th>External Interfaces</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authorization Endpoint</td>\n<td>Handle authorization requests, PKCE, consent</td>\n<td>Authorization codes, PKCE challenges</td>\n<td>HTTP endpoints for auth flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Endpoint</td>\n<td>Exchange codes for tokens, refresh flows</td>\n<td>Access tokens, refresh tokens, JWT signing</td>\n<td>HTTP endpoints for token operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Registration</td>\n<td>Register and authenticate OAuth2 clients</td>\n<td>Client credentials, redirect URIs, scopes</td>\n<td>Registration API, client validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Introspection/Revocation</td>\n<td>Validate and invalidate tokens</td>\n<td>Token status, revocation lists</td>\n<td>RFC 7662/7009 compliant endpoints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserInfo/Consent</td>\n<td>Provide user claims, manage consent</td>\n<td>User profiles, consent decisions</td>\n<td>OIDC UserInfo endpoint, consent UI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Storage</td>\n<td>Persist all system entities</td>\n<td>Clients, users, tokens, codes, consent</td>\n<td>Storage interfaces for all components</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"component-interaction-patterns\">Component Interaction Patterns</h4>\n<p>Components interact through <strong>synchronous HTTP APIs</strong> for user-facing operations and <strong>shared data storage</strong> for state coordination. The Authorization Endpoint communicates with Client Registration to validate client applications and with Data Storage to persist authorization codes. The Token Endpoint retrieves authorization codes and client information from storage while generating new tokens that are tracked by the Introspection component.</p>\n<p><strong>Event-driven patterns</strong> handle asynchronous operations like token cleanup and audit logging. When tokens are created, revoked, or expire, events are published to trigger appropriate cleanup actions and security monitoring. This ensures that the system can scale beyond simple request-response patterns while maintaining consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Security boundaries</strong> are enforced at component interfaces, with each component validating inputs and applying appropriate security controls. Client authentication is centralized in the Client Registration component, token validation is handled by the Introspection component, and user authentication is managed by the Authorization Endpoint.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Microservice vs Monolith Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: OAuth2 providers can be built as single monolithic services or distributed microservice architectures</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Single process monolith, containerized microservices, serverless functions</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Start with modular monolith, architect for microservice extraction</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: OAuth2 flows require tight consistency and low latency between components. A monolith reduces network overhead and simplifies deployment while maintaining clear component boundaries for future extraction</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Faster development and simpler operations initially, with ability to extract high-load components (like token validation) into separate services as scale requirements emerge</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-file-structure-how-to-organize-the-codebase-for-maintainability\">Recommended File Structure: How to Organize the Codebase for Maintainability</h3>\n<p>A well-organized file structure is crucial for an OAuth2 provider because the codebase must handle complex security protocols, multiple HTTP endpoints, cryptographic operations, and data persistence while remaining maintainable as the system evolves. The structure should clearly separate concerns, make dependencies explicit, and support both unit testing and integration testing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"project-root-organization\">Project Root Organization</h4>\n<p>The project follows Go&#39;s standard layout conventions with clear separation between application entry points, internal business logic, external APIs, and supporting infrastructure.

The choices made here will impact both the development experience and the operational characteristics of the system in production environments.</p>\n<h4 id=\"core-technology-decisions\">Core Technology Decisions</h4>\n<p><strong>Go</strong> serves as the primary implementation language due to its excellent HTTP server capabilities, strong cryptographic standard library, built-in concurrency support, and static binary deployment model. Go&#39;s explicit error handling reduces the risk of security bugs common in OAuth2 implementations, while its performance characteristics support the high-throughput token operations required by authorization servers.</p>\n<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> provides the primary data store for persistent entities like clients, users, tokens, and consent records. PostgreSQL offers ACID transactions required for consistent token operations, JSON column support for flexible client metadata storage, and excellent performance for the read-heavy workloads common in OAuth2 systems. The robust ecosystem and operational tooling make it suitable for production deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Redis</strong> serves as the caching layer and session store for temporary data like authorization codes, rate limiting counters, and revoked token tracking. Redis provides the sub-second latency required for authorization flows and supports automatic expiration for time-bounded entities like authorization codes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Technology Category</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n<th>Recommendation for Learning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Framework</td>\n<td><code>net/http</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>gin-gonic/gin</code> or <code>gorilla/mux</code></td>\n<td>Start with <code>net/http</code> for clarity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Database</td>\n<td>SQLite for development</td>\n<td>PostgreSQL for production</td>\n<td>SQLite initially, PostgreSQL for Milestone 3+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caching</td>\n<td>In-memory maps</td>\n<td>Redis with persistence</td>\n<td>In-memory for Milestones 1-2, Redis for production</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT Library</td>\n<td><code>golang-jwt/jwt/v4</code></td>\n<td>Custom implementation with <code>crypto/</code></td>\n<td>Use <code>golang-jwt/jwt/v4</code> for reliability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Password Hashing</td>\n<td><code>golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt</code></td>\n<td><code>golang.org/x/crypto/argon2</code></td>\n<td>bcrypt for simplicity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>Environment variables</td>\n<td><code>spf13/viper</code> with multiple sources</td>\n<td>Environment variables initially</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Logging</td>\n<td><code>log/slog</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>sirupsen/logrus</code> or <code>uber-go/zap</code></td>\n<td><code>log/slog</code> for structured logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Testing</td>\n<td><code>testing</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>stretchr/testify</code> for assertions</td>\n<td>Standard library with <code>testify</code> for convenience</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"http-server-and-routing\">HTTP Server and Routing</h4>\n<p>The HTTP server foundation handles OAuth2 protocol endpoints, serves consent UI, and provides administrative interfaces. The choice between standard library and frameworks involves trade-offs between simplicity and convenience features.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard Library Approach</strong> (<code>net/http</code>): Using Go&#39;s built-in HTTP server provides complete control over request handling, middleware chains, and error responses. This approach requires more boilerplate but offers better understanding of HTTP fundamentals and fewer dependencies. For learning OAuth2 concepts, this transparency is valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>Framework Approach</strong> (<code>gin-gonic/gin</code>): Web frameworks provide convenient request binding, middleware systems, and response helpers that reduce boilerplate for OAuth2 endpoint implementations.

This supports both containerized deployments (environment variables) and traditional deployments (configuration files).</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Management</strong>: Sensitive values like JWT signing keys and database passwords are loaded from secure sources like HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes secrets, or cloud provider secret managers rather than being stored in configuration files.</p>\n<p><strong>Environment-Specific Settings</strong>: Different deployment environments (development, staging, production) require different token lifetimes, security policies, and integration endpoints. The configuration system supports environment-specific overrides while maintaining consistent base settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: JWT Signing Algorithm Selection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: OAuth2 access tokens can use symmetric (HS256) or asymmetric (RS256/ES256) signing algorithms</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: HS256 with shared secret, RS256 with RSA keypair, ES256 with ECDSA keypair</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use RS256 for access tokens, HS256 for internal tokens</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: RS256 enables distributed token validation by resource servers without sharing secrets, while HS256 is sufficient for internal tokens like refresh tokens where the authorization server is the only validator</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires RSA key management and slightly higher CPU costs for signing/verification, but enables proper OAuth2 architecture with independent resource servers</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This technology stack provides a solid foundation for implementing a production-ready OAuth2 provider while maintaining code clarity for learning purposes.

architectural foundation provides the structure and infrastructure needed to implement the OAuth2 provider components in the subsequent milestones, with clear separation of concerns and proper security foundations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"data-model\">Data Model</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section establishes the foundational data structures for all milestones (1-4), providing the schema that will be implemented incrementally</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model-diagram.svg\" alt=\"Data Model Relationships\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-library-card-system\">Mental Model: Library Card System</h3>\n<p>Think of the OAuth2 data model as a sophisticated library card system. When you register for a library card, the library creates a record with your personal information and what sections you&#39;re allowed to access. The library issues you a physical card (client credentials) that proves you&#39;re registered. When you want to check out a book, you present your card to authorize the transaction, and the librarian gives you a temporary checkout slip (authorization code) that you can exchange at the front desk for an actual book loan record (access token). The library keeps track of all your current loans (active tokens) and your borrowing history (consent records). If you lose your card or want to return all your books early, the library can revoke your access immediately.</p>\n<p>In OAuth2, registered client applications are like library cardholders, authorization codes are like temporary checkout slips, access tokens are like active loan records, and the consent system tracks what data access permissions users have granted to each application. Just as a library needs to track cards, loans, and patron permissions, our OAuth2 provider needs robust data structures to manage clients, tokens, users, and consent decisions securely.</p>\n<p>The data model serves as the foundation for all OAuth2 operations. Every authorization request, token exchange, and user consent decision depends on these core structures. Getting the data model right is critical because security vulnerabilities often stem from incomplete data validation, missing relationships between entities, or improper lifecycle management of sensitive credentials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oauth-client-registration\">OAuth Client Registration</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 <strong>client registration</strong> establishes the foundation of trust between the authorization server and third-party applications. When an application wants to use OAuth2, it must first register with the authorization server to obtain credentials and declare its intended behavior. This registration process creates a <strong>client record</strong> that defines the application&#39;s identity, capabilities, and security constraints.</p>\n<p>The client registration data model captures both the public metadata that identifies the application and the confidential credentials used for authentication. This dual nature reflects OAuth2&#39;s support for different client types - public clients like mobile apps that cannot securely store secrets, and confidential clients like server-side web applications that can protect their credentials.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-entity-structure\">Client Entity Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>Client</code> entity represents a registered OAuth2 application with all the metadata necessary for secure authorization flows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique public identifier for the OAuth2 application, generated as a cryptographically random 32-character string</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ClientSecret</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Original plaintext secret returned only during registration, used for client authentication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SecretHash</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Bcrypt hash of the client secret stored permanently, used for credential verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Human-readable application name displayed on consent screens and administrative interfaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RedirectURIs</td>\n<td>[]string</td>\n<td>Whitelist of exact URIs where authorization codes can be delivered, prevents authorization code interception</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GrantTypes</td>\n<td>[]string</td>\n<td>OAuth2 grant types this client is authorized to use (authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scopes</td>\n<td>[]string</td>\n<td>Maximum scopes this client can request, acts as an upper bound for authorization requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Timestamp when the client was registered, used for auditing and lifecycle management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ClientID</code> serves as the public identifier for the application and is included in all OAuth2 flows. It must be cryptographically random and globally unique to prevent client impersonation attacks. The 32-character length provides sufficient entropy while remaining manageable for developers who need to configure it in their applications.</p>\n<p>The separation between <code>ClientSecret</code> and <code>SecretHash</code> follows security best practices for credential storage. The plaintext <code>ClientSecret</code> is returned only once during registration and should be stored securely by the client application. The authorization server stores only the bcrypt <code>SecretHash</code>, which provides one-way verification without exposing the original secret even to system administrators.</p>\n<p>The <code>RedirectURIs</code> array enforces strict validation of where authorization codes can be delivered. Each URI must match exactly - no wildcards, partial matches, or subdomain matching is allowed. This prevents authorization code interception attacks where malicious actors register similar domains to capture codes intended for legitimate applications.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-types-and-security-profiles\">Client Types and Security Profiles</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 distinguishes between <strong>confidential clients</strong> that can securely store credentials and <strong>public clients</strong> that cannot. This distinction affects how the authorization server validates client authentication and enforces security measures:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Client Type</th>\n<th>Authentication Method</th>\n<th>PKCE Requirement</th>\n<th>Secret Storage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Confidential</td>\n<td>Client ID + Secret</td>\n<td>Recommended</td>\n<td>Server-side secure storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Client ID only</td>\n<td>Mandatory</td>\n<td>No secret issued</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Native Mobile</td>\n<td>Client ID only</td>\n<td>Mandatory</td>\n<td>App cannot store secrets securely</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single Page App</td>\n<td>Client ID only</td>\n<td>Mandatory</td>\n<td>Browser cannot store secrets securely</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Confidential clients receive both a <code>ClientID</code> and <code>ClientSecret</code> during registration. They must authenticate using both credentials when exchanging authorization codes for tokens. Examples include traditional web applications with server-side code that can store the secret in environment variables or secure configuration files.</p>\n<p>Public clients receive only a <code>ClientID</code> and cannot authenticate with a secret. To maintain security, they must use <strong>PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)</strong> for all authorization requests. The <code>CodeChallenge</code> and <code>CodeChallengeMethod</code> fields in authorization flows provide cryptographic proof that the same client that initiated the authorization flow is the one exchanging the code for tokens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Principle: Defense in Depth</strong></p>\n<p>Client registration implements multiple layers of security validation. Even if one check fails (like redirect URI validation), other mechanisms (like PKCE verification for public clients) prevent successful attacks. This layered approach ensures that single vulnerabilities don&#39;t compromise the entire system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Bcrypt for Client Secret Hashing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client secrets need secure storage that prevents recovery even by system administrators while allowing verification during authentication</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Store plaintext secrets for simple comparison</li>\n<li>Use SHA-256 hash for fast verification</li>\n<li>Use bcrypt with configurable work factor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Bcrypt with work factor 12</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Bcrypt provides adaptive cost that can increase over time as hardware improves. The work factor of 12 balances security (resists brute force) with performance (sub-100ms verification). Unlike SHA-256, bcrypt includes salt automatically and resists rainbow table attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly slower client authentication (acceptable for OAuth2 flows), but dramatically improved security against credential database breaches. Work factor can be increased in future deployments without changing the verification logic.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Plaintext</td>\n<td>Simple implementation, fast verification</td>\n<td>Catastrophic security risk if database compromised</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SHA-256</td>\n<td>Fast hashing and verification</td>\n<td>Vulnerable to rainbow tables, no adaptive cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bcrypt</td>\n<td>Salt included, adaptive cost, industry standard</td>\n<td>Slower than plain hashing, requires bcrypt library</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Exact String Matching for Redirect URIs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Redirect URI validation must prevent authorization code interception while allowing legitimate client deployments</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Exact string matching only</li>\n<li>Domain-based matching (allow subdomains)</li>\n<li>Regex pattern matching for flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Exact string matching with no wildcards or patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: OAuth2 security depends critically on preventing redirect URI manipulation. Even sophisticated pattern matching has edge cases that attackers exploit. The principle of least privilege suggests allowing only exactly what&#39;s needed. Exact matching eliminates entire classes of bypass attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clients must register separate URIs for different environments (dev, staging, production), but this actually improves security by making each deployment explicit. Slightly more complex client configuration but eliminates redirect URI attack surface.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact matching</td>\n<td>No bypass vulnerabilities, clear security boundary</td>\n<td>Requires separate URIs per environment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domain matching</td>\n<td>Flexible for subdomains</td>\n<td>Complex parsing, potential bypass via subdomain takeover</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Regex patterns</td>\n<td>Maximum flexibility</td>\n<td>High complexity, regex injection risks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"token-data-structures\">Token Data Structures</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 tokens represent different stages of the authorization process, each with specific security properties and lifecycle requirements. The token data model encompasses <strong>authorization codes</strong> (temporary credentials for token exchange), <strong>access tokens</strong> (credentials for accessing protected resources), and <strong>refresh tokens</strong> (credentials for obtaining new access tokens). Each token type has distinct expiration policies, validation requirements, and security constraints.</p>\n<p>The token lifecycle follows a progression from broad permissions to specific capabilities. Authorization codes represent a user&#39;s consent to grant access but cannot directly access resources. Access tokens represent specific, time-limited permissions to access particular resources. Refresh tokens represent long-term authorization to obtain new access tokens without re-prompting the user for consent.</p>\n<h4 id=\"authorization-code-structure\">Authorization Code Structure</h4>\n<p>Authorization codes are <strong>temporary credentials</strong> issued after successful user authentication and consent. They serve as proof that a user has authorized a specific client to access specific scopes. The code must be exchanged quickly for tokens and can only be used once to prevent replay attacks:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Code</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Cryptographically random 43-character string using URL-safe base64 encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client that initiated the authorization request, must match during token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User who granted authorization, becomes the &#39;sub&#39; claim in issued access tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RedirectURI</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Exact redirect URI from the authorization request, must match during token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Space-delimited scopes the user authorized, may be subset of requested scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CodeChallenge</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Base64URL-encoded SHA256 hash of the client&#39;s PKCE code verifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CodeChallengeMethod</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Method used to generate challenge, always &quot;S256&quot; for SHA256 hashing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ExpiresAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Absolute expiration time, typically 10 minutes from creation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Used</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Prevents replay attacks - set to true after successful token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Creation timestamp for auditing and cleanup of expired codes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The 43-character <code>Code</code> provides 256 bits of entropy when base64-encoded, making brute force attacks computationally infeasible. The code binds together all the authorization parameters (<code>ClientID</code>, <code>RedirectURI</code>, <code>Scope</code>) so that the token endpoint can verify that the exchange request matches exactly what the user authorized.</p>\n<p>The PKCE fields (<code>CodeChallenge</code>, <code>CodeChallengeMethod</code>) provide cryptographic proof that the same client that initiated the authorization flow is the one exchanging the code. This prevents authorization code interception attacks, particularly important for mobile applications where redirect URIs might be intercepted by malicious apps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Property: Single Use Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Once an authorization code is exchanged for tokens, it must never be usable again. The <code>Used</code> flag provides this guarantee. If an already-used code is presented again, it indicates either a replay attack or that the code was intercepted. In either case, all tokens issued from that authorization code should be revoked immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"access-token-structure-jwt-format\">Access Token Structure (JWT Format)</h4>\n<p>Access tokens are implemented as <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</strong> containing claims about the authorized access. JWTs provide stateless verification - resource servers can validate tokens cryptographically without calling back to the authorization server:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Claim Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>iss (Issuer)</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Authorization server identifier, typically the server&#39;s base URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sub (Subject)</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User identifier from the authorization, uniquely identifies the resource owner</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>aud (Audience)</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Intended recipient of the token, typically the resource server&#39;s identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>exp (Expiration)</td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Unix timestamp when token expires, typically 15-60 minutes from issuance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iat (Issued At)</td>\n<td>int64</td>\n<td>Unix timestamp when token was issued, prevents token pre-dating attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>jti (JWT ID)</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique token identifier, enables revocation tracking and prevents replay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>scope</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Space-delimited permissions granted to the client for this user</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>client_id</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client identifier, allows resource servers to log which app accessed data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The JWT structure follows the standard format: <code>header.payload.signature</code>. The header specifies the signing algorithm (typically RS256 or ES256 for asymmetric signatures). The payload contains the claims listed above as base64-encoded JSON. The signature provides cryptographic proof that the token was issued by the authorization server and hasn&#39;t been tampered with.</p>\n<p>The <code>exp</code> claim enforces token expiration, limiting the blast radius if tokens are compromised. Short expiration times (15-60 minutes) balance security with user experience - users don&#39;t need to re-authenticate frequently, but compromised tokens become useless quickly.</p>\n<p>The <code>jti</code> claim enables token revocation even though JWTs are stateless. When a token is revoked, the authorization server adds the <code>jti</code> to a revocation list. Resource servers can check this list during token validation to reject revoked tokens immediately.</p>\n<h4 id=\"refresh-token-structure\">Refresh Token Structure</h4>\n<p>Refresh tokens enable <strong>long-term access</strong> without requiring users to re-authenticate repeatedly. They&#39;re stored on the authorization server and used to obtain new access tokens when the current ones expire:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Token</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Cryptographically random 43-character string using URL-safe base64 encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client authorized to use this refresh token, validated during refresh requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User who originally granted authorization, maintains consistent identity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Authorized scopes that can be refreshed, may be subset of original grant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ExpiresAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Long-term expiration, typically 30-90 days from creation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TokenFamily</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Refresh token family identifier for rotation tracking and breach detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ParentToken</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Previous refresh token in the rotation chain, null for initial token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revoked</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Revocation status - once true, token and entire family become invalid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Creation timestamp for lifecycle management and auditing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastUsedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent usage for detecting suspicious patterns and inactive cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Refresh tokens use <strong>token rotation</strong> for enhanced security. Each time a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, a new refresh token is issued and the old one is invalidated. This creates a &quot;token family&quot; chain that enables breach detection - if an old refresh token is used after a new one has been issued, it indicates the token family has been compromised and all tokens in the family should be revoked.</p>\n<p>The <code>TokenFamily</code> identifier groups related refresh tokens together. When token theft is detected (old token reused), the entire family can be revoked instantly, preventing further abuse. The <code>ParentToken</code> field creates the chain linkage that enables tracing the rotation history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Insight: Token Family Breach Detection</strong></p>\n<p>Token rotation creates a security property where legitimate usage forms a linear chain (each token used exactly once), but theft creates a branch (old token reused after new token issued). Detecting these branches enables automatic revocation of compromised token families before significant damage occurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"token-lifecycle-state-machine\">Token Lifecycle State Machine</h4>\n<p>Tokens progress through defined states that determine their validity and usability:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Issued</td>\n<td>Normal usage</td>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Update LastUsedAt timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Expiration time reached</td>\n<td>Expired</td>\n<td>Token becomes invalid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Explicit revocation</td>\n<td>Revoked</td>\n<td>Add to revocation list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Refresh (for refresh tokens)</td>\n<td>Rotated</td>\n<td>Issue new token, invalidate current</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Issued/Active</td>\n<td>System breach detection</td>\n<td>Revoked</td>\n<td>Revoke token family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expired</td>\n<td>Cleanup process</td>\n<td>Deleted</td>\n<td>Remove from storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revoked</td>\n<td>Cleanup process (after expiry)</td>\n<td>Deleted</td>\n<td>Remove from revocation list</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This state machine ensures that tokens have clear validity rules and that state transitions maintain security invariants. The cleanup transitions prevent the database from growing indefinitely with expired tokens while maintaining revocation lists long enough to catch late-arriving requests with revoked tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"user-and-consent-models\">User and Consent Models</h3>\n<p>The user and consent data models capture the <strong>resource owner</strong> information and track their authorization decisions over time. In OAuth2, the resource owner (typically a human user) controls access to their protected data and makes consent decisions about which applications can access what information. The data model must support both identity management for authentication and fine-grained consent tracking for authorization.</p>\n<p>User consent represents the cornerstone of OAuth2&#39;s security model. Users must explicitly authorize each application&#39;s access to their data, and they retain control over these permissions throughout the application lifecycle. The consent system must track not just current permissions but also the history of authorization decisions to support revocation and auditing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"user-profile-structure\">User Profile Structure</h4>\n<p>The user profile stores identity information and authentication credentials for resource owners:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>UserID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique user identifier, becomes &#39;sub&#39; claim in tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Username</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Human-readable username for authentication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Email address for contact and identity verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EmailVerified</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether email address has been verified through confirmation process</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PasswordHash</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Bcrypt hash of user password for authentication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GivenName</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User&#39;s first name for OIDC standard claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FamilyName</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User&#39;s last name for OIDC standard claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Picture</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>URL to user&#39;s profile picture for OIDC claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Locale</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User&#39;s preferred language/locale for OIDC claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CreatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Account creation timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UpdatedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Last profile modification timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether account is enabled and can authenticate</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The user profile follows <strong>OpenID Connect standard claims</strong> to ensure compatibility with OIDC clients. The <code>UserID</code> serves as the stable identifier that appears in the <code>sub</code> claim of access tokens and ID tokens. It should never change even if other profile fields are updated.</p>\n<p>The email verification status is critical for security flows like password reset and account recovery. Unverified emails should not be used for sensitive operations, and the verification status should be included in OIDC claims when email scope is granted.</p>\n<h4 id=\"consent-record-structure\">Consent Record Structure</h4>\n<p>Consent records track user authorization decisions for each client application:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>UserID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User who granted the consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client application that received the consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Space-delimited scopes the user authorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GrantedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>When the user originally granted consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastUsedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent authorization using this consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ExpiresAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>Optional consent expiration for time-limited grants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revoked</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether user has revoked this consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RevokedAt</td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>When consent was revoked (null if still active)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The consent record enables <strong>consent reuse</strong> - if a user has previously authorized a client for specific scopes, future authorization requests for the same or subset of scopes can skip the consent screen. This improves user experience while maintaining security through explicit authorization tracking.</p>\n<p>Scope handling in consent records follows the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong>. If a client requests scopes beyond what the user previously consented to, a new consent screen must be presented for the additional scopes. The system stores the exact scopes granted, not just the fact that consent was given.</p>\n<h4 id=\"scope-to-claims-mapping\">Scope to Claims Mapping</h4>\n<p>The scope-to-claims mapping defines which user profile fields are accessible for each OAuth2 scope:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Claims Included</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>openid</td>\n<td>sub</td>\n<td>Required for OIDC, provides user identifier only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>profile</td>\n<td>sub, given_name, family_name, picture, locale</td>\n<td>Basic profile information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>email</td>\n<td>email, email_verified</td>\n<td>Email address and verification status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>phone</td>\n<td>phone_number, phone_number_verified</td>\n<td>Phone contact information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>address</td>\n<td>address</td>\n<td>Formatted postal address information</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This mapping ensures that <strong>scope-based access control</strong> is enforced consistently. The UserInfo endpoint uses this mapping to filter the response based on the scopes granted in the access token. Only claims corresponding to granted scopes are included in the response.</p>\n<p>The mapping supports <strong>incremental authorization</strong> where applications can request additional scopes over time. Each new scope request triggers a consent screen showing only the new permissions being requested, with previously granted scopes noted as already authorized.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Privacy Principle: Minimal Disclosure</strong></p>\n<p>Users should understand exactly what information they&#39;re sharing and with whom. The scope-to-claims mapping provides granular control so users can authorize access to their email without also sharing their profile picture, or share basic profile information without revealing their phone number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate User Authentication from OAuth Authorization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Users need to authenticate to the OAuth provider before they can authorize third-party applications</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Combine user authentication with OAuth flows in single endpoint</li>\n<li>Separate authentication system with session management</li>\n<li>Delegate authentication to external identity provider</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate authentication system with secure session cookies</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: OAuth2 specification assumes user is already authenticated when they reach the authorization endpoint. Separating concerns allows different authentication methods (password, MFA, SSO) without affecting OAuth flows. Session-based authentication provides better UX than re-authenticating for each OAuth request.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Additional complexity in session management, but cleaner separation of authentication and authorization concerns. Enables future integration with enterprise SSO without changing OAuth implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Combined flow</td>\n<td>Simpler implementation</td>\n<td>Tight coupling, harder to extend authentication methods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Separate with sessions</td>\n<td>Clean separation, flexible auth methods</td>\n<td>Session management complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>External delegation</td>\n<td>Leverage existing systems</td>\n<td>External dependency, integration complexity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Consent Expiration and Revocation Model</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: User consent should not last forever, and users need ability to revoke previously granted permissions</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Permanent consent until explicitly revoked</li>\n<li>Time-limited consent with configurable expiration</li>\n<li>Consent tied to token lifetime (expires with refresh token)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Optional time-limited consent with user-controlled revocation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Different use cases need different consent durability. High-security applications might want consent to expire annually, while trusted applications might receive long-term consent. User revocation must always be available regardless of expiration policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex consent management, but provides flexibility for different security requirements.

Even system administrators shouldn&#39;t be able to recover client secrets.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: If an attacker gains database access, they can impersonate any registered client and potentially access all user data. Regulatory compliance frameworks often require credential hashing as a basic security control.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Always hash client secrets using bcrypt with a work factor of at least 10. Store only the hash and compare submitted secrets against the hash during authentication. Return the plaintext secret only once during registration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Flexible Redirect URI Matching</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing substring matching, wildcard matching, or regex patterns for redirect URI validation seems developer-friendly but creates security vulnerabilities that attackers regularly exploit.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Even sophisticated pattern matching has edge cases. Substring matching allows <code>evil.com/callback</code> to match <code>good.com/callback</code>. Wildcard matching can be bypassed through subdomain takeover attacks. These bypasses enable authorization code interception.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement exact string matching only. Clients must register separate URIs for each environment (development, staging, production). This improves security by making each deployment explicit and eliminates entire classes of redirect URI manipulation attacks.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Long-Lived Authorization Codes</strong></p>\n<p>Setting authorization code expiration to 30 minutes or longer seems reasonable for user experience, but significantly increases the attack window for code interception and replay attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Authorization codes can be intercepted through HTTP referrer headers, browser history, server logs, or man-in-the-middle attacks. The longer the code remains valid, the more time attackers have to exploit it.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Set authorization code expiration to 10 minutes maximum, preferably 5 minutes. Modern applications can complete the code exchange quickly. Use PKCE for all clients to provide additional protection against code interception.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Token Family Revocation</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing refresh token rotation without family tracking allows compromised tokens to continue working even after legitimate users obtain new tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: If a refresh token is stolen but the user continues using the application, both the legitimate user and the attacker will obtain valid refresh tokens. Without family tracking, there&#39;s no way to detect this compromise and revoke the stolen tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement token families with breach detection. When an old refresh token is used after a new one has been issued, revoke the entire token family immediately. This automatically stops attacks when they&#39;re detected.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: JWT Payload Security Misconceptions</strong></p>\n<p>Storing sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private keys in JWT payload because &quot;JWTs are secure tokens.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: JWT payload is base64-encoded, not encrypted. Anyone who obtains the token can decode the payload and read all claims. JWTs provide integrity (through signatures) but not confidentiality.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Include only non-sensitive claims in JWTs: user ID, scopes, expiration times, issuer information. Store sensitive user data in your database and access it using the user ID from the token&#39;s <code>sub</code> claim.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overly Broad Scope Grants</strong></p>\n<p>Granting all requested scopes to applications without considering the principle of least privilege or allowing scope escalation in refresh flows.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Applications might request more permissions than they actually need, either due to over-engineering or malicious intent. Once granted, these excessive permissions increase the impact of potential security breaches.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement scope validation that checks requested scopes against the client&#39;s registered maximum scopes. Display clear descriptions of what each scope allows on consent screens. Never allow refresh token flows to grant scopes beyond what was originally authorized.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This subsection provides concrete implementation patterns and starter code to translate the data model design into working Go code.

id=\"client-registration-component\">Client Registration Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 - Client Registration &amp; Authorization Endpoint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-business-license-system\">Mental Model: Business License System</h3>\n<p>Think of OAuth2 client registration like a business licensing system at your local city hall. When a new restaurant wants to operate, they can&#39;t just start serving customers - they must first register with the city, provide their business details, and receive official credentials that prove their legitimacy. The city issues them a business license number (like a <code>client_id</code>) and a confidential tax ID (like a <code>client_secret</code>) that they&#39;ll use for all official transactions.</p>\n<p>Just as the city maintains strict records of where each restaurant is allowed to operate (their permitted addresses), OAuth2 client registration maintains strict records of where each application is allowed to redirect users after authorization (their registered <code>redirect_uri</code> values). A restaurant with a downtown license can&#39;t suddenly start operating in the suburbs without updating their registration - similarly, an OAuth2 client can&#39;t redirect to unregistered URIs without updating their client record.</p>\n<p>The registration authority (whether city hall or OAuth2 provider) acts as the trusted source of truth. When other parties need to verify a business&#39;s legitimacy (like suppliers checking credentials), they contact the registration authority. Similarly, when your OAuth2 provider receives an authorization request, it validates the client&#39;s identity and permissions against the authoritative registration records.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps explain why client registration is foundational - without proper registration and credential management, there&#39;s no way to distinguish legitimate applications from malicious ones attempting to steal user data or impersonate trusted services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"registration-interface\">Registration Interface</h3>\n<p>The client registration interface provides the foundational API for OAuth2 applications to establish their identity with the authorization server. This interface serves as the entry point for all client applications, whether they&#39;re confidential clients (backend web applications with secure secret storage) or public clients (mobile apps and single-page applications that cannot securely store secrets).</p>\n<p>The registration process follows a structured workflow that ensures security while remaining accessible to developers. Applications provide essential metadata about their identity, intended usage patterns, and technical capabilities. The OAuth2 provider validates this information, generates cryptographically secure credentials, and establishes the trust relationship that enables all subsequent OAuth2 flows.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>RegisterClient</code></td>\n<td><code>store ClientStore</code>, <code>name string</code>, <code>redirectURIs []string</code></td>\n<td><code>*Client</code>, <code>error</code></td>\n<td>Creates new OAuth2 client with generated credentials and validates redirect URIs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreateClient</code></td>\n<td><code>ctx context.Context</code>, <code>client *Client</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Persists client record to storage with proper indexing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetClient</code></td>\n<td><code>ctx context.Context</code>, <code>clientID string</code></td>\n<td><code>*Client</code>, <code>error</code></td>\n<td>Retrieves client by client_id for validation during flows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UpdateClient</code></td>\n<td><code>ctx context.Context</code>, <code>clientID string</code>, <code>updates *ClientUpdate</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Modifies existing client configuration (name, redirectURIs, scopes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DeleteClient</code></td>\n<td><code>ctx context.Context</code>, <code>clientID string</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Soft deletes client and revokes all associated tokens</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>Client</code> data structure captures all essential information about a registered OAuth2 application:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ClientID</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Unique public identifier, 32-byte cryptographically random string</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ClientSecret</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Confidential credential for client authentication (empty for public clients)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SecretHash</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>bcrypt hash of client secret for secure storage and validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Name</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable application name displayed on consent screens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RedirectURIs</code></td>\n<td><code>[]string</code></td>\n<td>Exact URIs where authorization codes can be delivered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GrantTypes</code></td>\n<td><code>[]string</code></td>\n<td>Permitted OAuth2 flows (authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Scopes</code></td>\n<td><code>[]string</code></td>\n<td>Maximum scopes this client can request (subset enforcement)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreatedAt</code></td>\n<td><code>time.Time</code></td>\n<td>Registration timestamp for auditing and lifecycle management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registration workflow follows these detailed steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Request Validation</strong>: The registration handler validates that required fields are present and properly formatted. Application names must be non-empty and reasonable length (1-100 characters). Redirect URIs must be absolute HTTPS URLs (HTTP allowed only for localhost development). The handler rejects registrations with obviously malicious or misconfigured parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Credential Generation</strong>: The system generates a cryptographically secure <code>client_id</code> using 32 bytes of random data, encoded as a URL-safe base64 string. For confidential clients, it generates an equally strong <code>client_secret</code> and immediately hashes it using bcrypt with a work factor of 12. Public clients (mobile and single-page applications) receive no secret, as they cannot store credentials securely.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>URI Validation</strong>: Each provided redirect URI undergoes strict validation. The system requires HTTPS schemes for production (with localhost HTTP allowed for development). It rejects URIs with fragments, as OAuth2 specifications prohibit fragment-based redirects. The validation ensures URIs are absolute, properly formatted, and don&#39;t contain suspicious patterns that might enable redirect attacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Default Configuration</strong>: The registration process applies sensible defaults for grant types and scopes based on client type. Confidential clients receive <code>authorization_code</code>, <code>refresh_token</code>, and optionally <code>client_credentials</code> grants. Public clients receive only <code>authorization_code</code> with PKCE enforcement. Default scopes include basic profile access, with additional scopes requiring explicit approval.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Storage and Indexing</strong>: The system persists the complete client record with proper database indexing on <code>ClientID</code> for fast lookups during authorization flows. It stores the bcrypt hash rather than plaintext secrets, ensuring credential security even if storage is compromised. The storage layer supports atomic operations to prevent partial registrations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Response Generation</strong>: Successful registrations return the complete client record including the generated <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> (for confidential clients). This is the only time the plaintext secret is revealed - clients must store it securely as it cannot be retrieved later, only regenerated through a separate rotation process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The registration interface includes comprehensive error handling for common failure scenarios:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Response</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Missing application name</td>\n<td><code>invalid_request</code></td>\n<td>Application name is required for consent screen display</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid redirect URI</td>\n<td><code>invalid_redirect_uri</code></td>\n<td>URI must be absolute HTTPS (or localhost HTTP)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duplicate client name</td>\n<td><code>invalid_request</code></td>\n<td>Application names must be unique within the provider</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Storage failure</td>\n<td><code>server_error</code></td>\n<td>Database unavailable or constraint violation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rate limit exceeded</td>\n<td><code>temporarily_unavailable</code></td>\n<td>Too many registrations from same source</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"credential-storage-and-hashing\">Credential Storage and Hashing</h3>\n<p>Credential storage represents one of the most security-critical aspects of the OAuth2 provider, as compromised client credentials can enable widespread attacks against user data. The storage system must protect client secrets with the same rigor applied to user passwords, while supporting the high-throughput access patterns required during OAuth2 flows.</p>\n<p>The credential storage architecture employs multiple layers of protection to ensure client secret security. At the core lies a cryptographically sound hashing strategy that renders stored secrets useless to attackers even in the event of database compromise. The system combines this with secure random generation, constant-time validation, and comprehensive audit logging.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Generation and Hashing Process:</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>GenerateClientSecret</code> function implements a secure two-phase process that creates both the plaintext secret returned to the client and the hash stored in the database:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Random Generation</strong>: The system generates 32 bytes of cryptographically random data using the operating system&#39;s secure random number generator. This provides approximately 256 bits of entropy, far exceeding the security requirements for client authentication. The raw bytes are encoded using URL-safe base64 to create a string suitable for HTTP transmission and storage in configuration files.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>bcrypt Hashing</strong>: The plaintext secret immediately undergoes bcrypt hashing with a work factor of 12. bcrypt provides several critical security properties: it&#39;s computationally expensive (requiring ~250ms on modern hardware), includes automatic salt generation to prevent rainbow table attacks, and uses a proven algorithm resistant to both brute-force and cryptanalytic attacks. The work factor of 12 represents a careful balance between security and performance - high enough to significantly slow brute-force attempts while remaining fast enough for interactive authentication flows.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Secure Cleanup</strong>: After hashing, the system immediately clears the plaintext secret from memory and returns both the original secret (for client storage) and the hash (for database storage). This minimizes the window during which plaintext secrets exist in memory.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Storage Schema and Indexing:</strong></p>\n<p>The client credentials storage employs a carefully designed schema that supports both security and performance requirements:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Index</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td><code>VARCHAR(64)</code></td>\n<td>PRIMARY KEY</td>\n<td>Unique identifier, base64-encoded random bytes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>secret_hash</code></td>\n<td><code>VARCHAR(72)</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>bcrypt hash of client secret (60 chars + NULL)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td><code>VARCHAR(255)</code></td>\n<td>UNIQUE</td>\n<td>Application name for consent screens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>redirect_uris</code></td>\n<td><code>JSON</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Array of permitted redirect destinations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>grant_types</code></td>\n<td><code>JSON</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Array of permitted OAuth2 flows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scopes</code></td>\n<td><code>JSON</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Array of maximum permitted scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td><code>TIMESTAMP</code></td>\n<td>INDEX</td>\n<td>Registration time for auditing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>last_used_at</code></td>\n<td><code>TIMESTAMP</code></td>\n<td>INDEX</td>\n<td>Most recent authentication for cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>active</code></td>\n<td><code>BOOLEAN</code></td>\n<td>INDEX</td>\n<td>Soft deletion flag</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The indexing strategy optimizes for the OAuth2 flow access patterns. The primary key on <code>client_id</code> enables O(1) lookups during authorization and token requests. The unique index on <code>name</code> prevents duplicate application names that could confuse users. Indexes on timestamp fields support efficient cleanup of unused clients and audit queries.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Validation Process:</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>VerifyClientSecret</code> function implements constant-time secret validation that prevents timing attacks while maintaining compatibility with standard bcrypt libraries:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Hash Retrieval</strong>: The system retrieves the stored bcrypt hash for the provided <code>client_id</code>. If no client exists, it performs a dummy bcrypt operation against a fake hash to maintain constant timing behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>bcrypt Comparison</strong>: The bcrypt library&#39;s constant-time compare function validates the provided secret against the stored hash. This comparison takes consistent time regardless of how much of the secret matches, preventing attackers from using timing differences to guess secrets character by character.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Result Handling</strong>: The function returns a boolean result without leaking information about why validation failed. Whether the client doesn&#39;t exist, the secret is wrong, or the client is disabled, the result appears identical to potential attackers.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Audit Logging and Monitoring:</strong></p>\n<p>The credential storage system maintains comprehensive audit logs that enable security monitoring and forensic analysis:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Event Type</th>\n<th>Logged Data</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client Registration</td>\n<td><code>client_id</code>, <code>name</code>, source IP, timestamp</td>\n<td>Track new client creation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication Success</td>\n<td><code>client_id</code>, source IP, timestamp</td>\n<td>Monitor normal usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication Failure</td>\n<td>attempted <code>client_id</code>, source IP, timestamp</td>\n<td>Detect brute-force attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Secret Rotation</td>\n<td><code>client_id</code>, old/new secret hashes, timestamp</td>\n<td>Track credential changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Deletion</td>\n<td><code>client_id</code>, <code>name</code>, deletion reason, timestamp</td>\n<td>Audit client lifecycle</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The monitoring system analyzes these logs to detect suspicious patterns such as repeated authentication failures from the same IP address, authentication attempts for non-existent clients, or unusual geographic patterns in client usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Backup and Recovery Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Client credential storage requires special handling in backup and recovery scenarios. Database backups containing client records must be encrypted at rest and protected with the same security measures as production systems. The recovery process must validate that restored client hashes remain valid and haven&#39;t been corrupted during backup or restoration.</p>\n<p>For disaster recovery scenarios, the system supports client secret rotation workflows that allow legitimate clients to re-establish their credentials without requiring manual intervention from every application developer. This involves secure out-of-band communication channels and cryptographic proof of client ownership.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p>The client registration component requires several critical design decisions that significantly impact the security, performance, and usability of the entire OAuth2 provider. Each decision involves careful trade-offs between competing concerns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Client Secret Hashing Algorithm</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client secrets must be stored securely to prevent credential theft in case of database compromise, while supporting high-throughput authentication during OAuth2 flows. The hashing algorithm must balance computational cost, security strength, and implementation complexity.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Plain storage (no hashing), SHA-256 with salt, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2id</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use bcrypt with work factor 12 for client secret hashing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: bcrypt provides proven security with widespread library support and excellent resistance to both rainbow table and brute-force attacks. Work factor 12 requires ~250ms per hash on modern hardware, adding meaningful cost for attackers while remaining acceptable for interactive OAuth2 flows (which typically involve 1-2 client authentications per user session). Unlike memory-hard functions (scrypt/Argon2id), bcrypt&#39;s CPU-only approach suits deployment environments with constrained memory.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables secure credential storage with acceptable performance overhead. Requires careful work factor tuning for different deployment environments. Provides upgrade path to stronger algorithms in the future through algorithm versioning.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Plain storage</td>\n<td>Zero computational overhead</td>\n<td>Catastrophic security failure if database compromised</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SHA-256 + salt</td>\n<td>Fast, simple implementation</td>\n<td>Vulnerable to GPU-accelerated brute force attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bcrypt (chosen)</td>\n<td>Proven security, tunable cost, wide support</td>\n<td>Fixed memory usage, slower than simple hashes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>scrypt</td>\n<td>Memory-hard, resistant to ASIC attacks</td>\n<td>Complex tuning, higher memory requirements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Argon2id</td>\n<td>Latest standard, excellent security properties</td>\n<td>Limited library support, complex parameterization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Client ID Generation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client IDs must be unique, unpredictable, and suitable for use in URLs and HTTP headers. They serve as public identifiers that appear in authorization URLs and audit logs, so they must not leak sensitive information about the client or provider.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Sequential integers, UUIDs (v4), cryptographically random strings, hash of client metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use 32-byte cryptographically random strings, base64url-encoded</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Cryptographic randomness provides maximum security against enumeration and prediction attacks. 32 bytes offers 256 bits of entropy, making collisions mathematically impossible at any realistic scale. Base64url encoding creates URL-safe strings without padding characters. This approach avoids UUID overhead while providing stronger security guarantees than standard UUID v4 (which uses only 122 bits of randomness).</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Eliminates enumeration attacks and ensures global uniqueness without coordination. Creates slightly longer identifiers than UUIDs (43 vs 36 characters) but provides superior security. Requires cryptographically secure random number generator.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sequential integers</td>\n<td>Short, simple, predictable ordering</td>\n<td>Trivial enumeration, leaks registration volume</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UUIDs v4</td>\n<td>Standard format, good uniqueness</td>\n<td>Only 122 bits entropy, longer than needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Random strings (chosen)</td>\n<td>Maximum entropy, customizable length</td>\n<td>Non-standard format, requires careful encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hashed metadata</td>\n<td>Deterministic, prevents duplicates</td>\n<td>Vulnerable to rainbow tables, complex collision handling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Redirect URI Validation Strictness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: OAuth2 redirect URI validation prevents authorization code interception attacks, but overly strict validation can break legitimate use cases. The validation must balance security against developer usability, particularly for development and testing scenarios.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Exact string matching only, prefix matching, pattern matching with wildcards, runtime URI validation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Exact string matching with localhost HTTP exception for development</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Exact matching provides the strongest security guarantee by preventing any form of redirect manipulation. The OAuth2 specification strongly recommends exact matching to prevent subtle attack vectors. Allowing HTTP for localhost URIs supports local development without compromising production security. This approach eliminates entire classes of redirect-based attacks while remaining practical for legitimate development workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Maximizes security against redirect attacks but requires clients to register all redirect URIs upfront. Development environments can use HTTP localhost without security compromise. Clients needing dynamic redirects must implement application-level routing after the OAuth2 redirect.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact matching (chosen)</td>\n<td>Maximum security, spec-compliant</td>\n<td>Requires registering all URIs, less flexible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prefix matching</td>\n<td>More flexible for path-based routing</td>\n<td>Vulnerable to path traversal attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wildcard patterns</td>\n<td>Very flexible, supports complex routing</td>\n<td>Complex implementation, many attack vectors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Runtime validation</td>\n<td>Ultimate flexibility</td>\n<td>Cannot validate at registration time, complex security model</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Public Client Secret Handling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Public clients (mobile apps, single-page applications) cannot securely store client secrets, but the OAuth2 specification allows both secret-based and secret-less authentication. The provider must handle both client types while maintaining security.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Require secrets for all clients, allow empty secrets for public clients, separate registration endpoints, client type declaration</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Allow empty client secrets with mandatory PKCE for public clients</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Following OAuth2 Security Best Current Practice, public clients should not receive secrets and must use PKCE for security. Empty secrets clearly indicate public client status and eliminate any temptation to embed secrets in client-side code. Mandatory PKCE provides equivalent security to client secrets for public clients. This approach aligns with current OAuth2 security guidance and modern application architectures.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables secure mobile and SPA integration without compromising security. Requires PKCE implementation and validation. Creates two distinct client authentication paths that must be properly handled throughout the system.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Require all secrets</td>\n<td>Simple, uniform authentication model</td>\n<td>Impossible for public clients to implement securely</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty secrets (chosen)</td>\n<td>Clear public client indication, spec-compliant</td>\n<td>Requires dual authentication logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Separate endpoints</td>\n<td>Clear separation of client types</td>\n<td>Duplicated registration logic, more complex API</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client type declaration</td>\n<td>Explicit client capability declaration</td>\n<td>Additional complexity, potential misconfiguration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Client Name Uniqueness Enforcement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client names appear on consent screens to help users identify applications requesting access. Duplicate names could enable phishing attacks where malicious applications impersonate legitimate ones. However, legitimate applications might have naming conflicts.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: No uniqueness requirement, global uniqueness enforcement, namespace-based uniqueness, user confirmation for duplicates</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Enforce global uniqueness of client names with case-insensitive comparison</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Global uniqueness prevents impersonation attacks where malicious clients use names identical to popular applications. Case-insensitive comparison prevents near-duplicate names that could confuse users. This approach prioritizes user security over developer convenience, as confused users might grant inappropriate permissions to impersonator applications.

These pitfalls often arise from misunderstanding the threat model or making seemingly reasonable optimizations that introduce vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Storing Plaintext Client Secrets</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations store client secrets in plaintext or with reversible encryption, reasoning that the secrets need to be compared during authentication. This creates catastrophic vulnerability if the database is compromised, as attackers gain immediate access to all client credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Client secrets function like passwords and should never be recoverable. Unlike user passwords, client secrets don&#39;t need account recovery workflows - they can be regenerated if lost. Storing plaintext secrets means a single database breach exposes every registered application&#39;s credentials.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Always hash client secrets using bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2id before storage. Store only the hash and compare provided secrets against the hash using the library&#39;s constant-time comparison function. Never implement custom hashing or comparison logic.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Weak Client ID Generation</strong></p>\n<p>Using predictable client ID generation (sequential numbers, timestamps, or weak random generators) enables enumeration attacks where adversaries can guess valid client IDs and attempt to exploit them in authorization flows.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Client IDs appear in authorization URLs and logs, making them observable to attackers. Predictable IDs allow attackers to discover all registered clients and potentially launch targeted attacks against specific applications. Even UUID v4 provides insufficient randomness (122 bits) for high-security environments.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Generate client IDs using cryptographically secure random number generators with at least 256 bits of entropy. Use base64url encoding to create URL-safe strings. Never use sequential numbers, timestamps, or application names as client ID components.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Loose Redirect URI Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing flexible redirect URI validation (prefix matching, wildcard support, or runtime validation) seems developer-friendly but introduces authorization code interception vulnerabilities where attackers can redirect authorization codes to attacker-controlled endpoints.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> The redirect URI is the primary security boundary preventing authorization code theft. Any flexibility in validation creates attack opportunities. Even seemingly safe approaches like prefix matching can be exploited through path traversal or subdomain attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Implement exact string matching for redirect URIs. Allow HTTP only for localhost addresses during development. Require applications to register all possible redirect URIs at registration time. Document this limitation clearly and provide guidance on application-level routing after OAuth2 redirects.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Client Type Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Mixing confidential and public client authentication logic without clear separation leads to security vulnerabilities where public clients might authenticate using missing or weak credentials, or confidential clients might bypass proper authentication.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Confidential and public clients have fundamentally different security models. Confidential clients rely on secret-based authentication, while public clients depend on PKCE. Inconsistent handling can allow authentication bypasses or force insecure authentication methods.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Clearly distinguish client types at registration time. Store client type explicitly in the client record. Implement separate authentication paths that enforce appropriate security measures for each client type. Never allow public clients to authenticate with secrets, and never allow confidential clients to skip secret authentication.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Client Secret Rotation Support</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to implement client secret rotation capabilities creates operational security problems when secrets are compromised, accidentally exposed, or need regular rotation for compliance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Client secrets will eventually need rotation due to security breaches, compliance requirements, or operational accidents. Without rotation support, the only option is deleting and re-creating clients, which breaks all existing deployments and requires coordination across multiple teams.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Implement client secret rotation endpoints that generate new secrets while temporarily accepting both old and new secrets during a transition period. Provide secure out-of-band notification mechanisms for secret rotation. Include secret version tracking to support gradual rollout of new secrets.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Rate Limiting on Registration</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing unlimited client registration enables abuse where attackers create large numbers of clients to exhaust storage, create confusion in audit logs, or launch distributed attacks using many different client IDs.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Client registration should be a relatively rare operation, but unlimited registration enables various abuse scenarios. Mass client creation can exhaust storage quotas, make audit logs unusable, and provide attackers with numerous client IDs for distributed attack campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Implement rate limiting on client registration endpoints based on source IP, user account, and global registration rate. Consider requiring manual approval for client registration in high-security environments. Monitor registration patterns for abuse and implement automated detection of suspicious registration activity.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Exposing Internal Client Information</strong></p>\n<p>Returning internal database fields, sensitive configuration details, or other clients&#39; information in registration responses creates information disclosure vulnerabilities that can aid attackers in understanding the system or launching targeted attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Client registration responses should contain only the information needed by the registering application. Exposing internal IDs, configuration details, or information about other clients provides intelligence that attackers can use for reconnaissance or privilege escalation attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Carefully design registration response objects to include only public information needed by clients. Never include database internal IDs, other clients&#39; information, or sensitive configuration. Implement response filtering that explicitly allowlists returned fields rather than blocklisting sensitive ones.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Redirect URI Format Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Accepting malformed URIs, URIs with fragments, or non-HTTP(S) schemes in redirect URI registration creates potential security vulnerabilities and protocol violations that can be exploited in authorization flows.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> OAuth2 specifications explicitly prohibit certain URI formats (particularly those with fragments) and require absolute URIs. Accepting invalid formats can lead to protocol violations, security vulnerabilities, or interoperability problems with client applications.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Implement comprehensive URI validation that checks scheme (HTTPS required, HTTP only for localhost), absolute format, absence of fragments, and proper encoding. Reject registrations with invalid URIs rather than attempting to correct them. Provide clear error messages explaining validation requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology

Tips:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>JSON Handling</strong>: Use struct tags to control JSON serialization. The <code>json:&quot;-&quot;</code> tag prevents sensitive fields from appearing in responses. The <code>omitempty</code> tag excludes nil pointers and empty values.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Database Integration</strong>: Use the <code>db</code> struct tags with libraries like <code>sqlx</code> for automatic scanning. Store JSON arrays as PostgreSQL JSON columns or comma-separated strings for SQLite.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Wrap errors with <code>fmt.Errorf(&quot;context: %w&quot;, err)</code> to maintain error chains. Use custom error types for OAuth2-specific errors that need special HTTP status codes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Context Usage</strong>: Always pass <code>context.Context</code> to database operations for timeout and cancellation support. Use <code>context.Background()</code> only in tests or main functions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Security Libraries</strong>: Use <code>golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt</code> for password hashing, never implement custom crypto. Use <code>crypto/rand</code> for random generation, never <code>math/rand</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: Use table-driven tests for validation functions. Use <code>testify/mock</code> for mocking the ClientStore interface. Use <code>httptest</code> for testing HTTP handlers.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-checkpoint\">Milestone Checkpoint</h4>\n<p>After implementing the client registration component, verify the

Authorization Endpoint</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-bank-authorization-process\">Mental Model: Bank Authorization Process</h3>\n<p>Think of the OAuth2 authorization endpoint like a bank&#39;s signature card verification process. When you want to give someone permission to access your bank account (like setting up automatic bill payments), you don&#39;t just hand over your debit card PIN. Instead, you visit the bank with proper identification, review exactly what permissions the company is requesting, and then sign an authorization form that grants specific, limited access to your account.</p>\n<p>The authorization endpoint serves as this secure &quot;bank branch&quot; where the real account owner (resource owner) can review what a third-party application is requesting and make an informed decision. Just as the bank verifies your identity before processing any authorization, the OAuth2 provider must authenticate the user before showing them the consent screen. The bank also validates that the company requesting access is legitimate (registered business) and that their request form (authorization request) contains all required information and matches their registered details.</p>\n<p>The authorization code that gets generated is like a signed authorization form with a unique reference number. This form can only be used once, expires quickly (typically within 10 minutes), and must be exchanged by the legitimate business at the bank&#39;s separate &quot;account setup&quot; window (token endpoint) to receive the actual account access credentials. The authorization code itself provides no account access - it&#39;s merely proof that the account owner approved the request under specific terms.</p>\n<p>This mental model highlights several critical security properties: the authorization decision is always made by the authenticated account owner, the authorization is specific to one requesting party and their stated purpose, and the authorization proof (code) cannot be directly used to access protected resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pkce-implementation\">PKCE Implementation</h3>\n<p><strong>Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</strong> addresses a fundamental security weakness in the original OAuth2 authorization code flow. When mobile applications or single-page applications initiate an authorization request, they cannot securely store a client secret (since anyone can inspect the app binary or JavaScript source). Without PKCE, an attacker who intercepts an authorization code could potentially exchange it for tokens without being the legitimate client.</p>\n<p>PKCE solves this by creating a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism that proves the client exchanging the authorization code is the same client that initiated the authorization request. The process works like a secure handshake where the client demonstrates knowledge of a secret without ever transmitting that secret over potentially insecure channels.</p>\n<p>The <strong>code challenge generation</strong> begins when the client creates a cryptographically random string called a <code>code_verifier</code>. This verifier must be between 43 and 128 characters long and use unreserved characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;_&#39;, &#39;~&#39;). The client then applies a one-way transformation to create a <code>code_challenge</code>. While the OAuth2 specification allows &quot;plain&quot; transformation (where challenge equals verifier), security best practices mandate using &quot;S256&quot; method where the challenge is the base64url-encoded SHA256 hash of the verifier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fpkce-flow-diagram.svg\" alt=\"PKCE Flow Implementation\"></p>\n<p>During the <strong>authorization request phase</strong>, the client includes the <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> parameters in the authorization URL. The authorization server stores these values alongside the generated authorization code. An attacker intercepting this request only sees the hashed challenge, not the original verifier, making it computationally infeasible to generate a valid verifier.</p>\n<p>The <strong>verification process</strong> occurs during token exchange when the client presents the original <code>code_verifier</code> to the token endpoint. The authorization server retrieves the stored <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> for that authorization code, recomputes the challenge by applying the same transformation to the provided verifier, and compares the results. Only if the computed challenge matches the stored challenge does the server proceed with token issuance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PKCE Parameter</th>\n<th>Source</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Property</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>code_verifier</code></td>\n<td>Client-generated</td>\n<td>Proves client identity during token exchange</td>\n<td>High entropy secret never transmitted during authorization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge</code></td>\n<td>SHA256 hash of verifier</td>\n<td>Binds authorization code to client</td>\n<td>One-way transformation prevents verifier derivation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge_method</code></td>\n<td>Always &quot;S256&quot;</td>\n<td>Specifies hash algorithm</td>\n<td>Ensures cryptographic binding, not plaintext</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>PKCE enforcement policies</strong> must distinguish between different client types. Public clients (mobile apps, SPAs) should be required to use PKCE for all authorization requests, as they cannot securely store client secrets. Confidential clients (server-side web applications) that can authenticate with client secrets may optionally use PKCE as defense-in-depth, but the authorization server should not reject requests lacking PKCE parameters from properly authenticated confidential clients.</p>\n<p>The <strong>code challenge validation</strong> implementation must use constant-time comparison operations to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about the expected challenge value. Additionally, the authorization server must store the PKCE parameters securely alongside authorization codes and ensure they are properly cleaned up when codes expire or are consumed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: PKCE transforms OAuth2 from relying solely on client authentication (which public clients cannot do securely) to cryptographic proof of request initiation, making the authorization code flow secure even for clients that cannot keep secrets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: PKCE Enforcement Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Mandatory PKCE for Public Clients with Graceful Confidential Client Support</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Different OAuth2 client types have different security capabilities. Public clients (mobile, SPA) cannot securely store secrets while confidential clients can authenticate via client secrets.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Mandatory PKCE for all clients</li>\n<li>Optional PKCE for all clients  </li>\n<li>Mandatory for public clients, optional for confidential clients</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Require PKCE for clients without client secrets, allow optional PKCE for confidential clients</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maximizes security for vulnerable public clients while maintaining compatibility with existing confidential clients that rely on client secret authentication</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires client type detection logic and different validation paths, but provides appropriate security for each client category</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Security Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Mandatory for all</td>\n<td>Uniform security model, future-proof</td>\n<td>Breaks existing confidential clients</td>\n<td>Highest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Optional for all</td>\n<td>Maximum compatibility</td>\n<td>Public clients remain vulnerable</td>\n<td>Lowest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type-specific (chosen)</td>\n<td>Appropriate security per client type</td>\n<td>Complex validation logic</td>\n<td>Optimal balance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"user-consent-screen\">User Consent Screen</h3>\n<p>The <strong>consent screen interface</strong> serves as the critical trust boundary where users make informed decisions about granting access to their protected resources. This interface must clearly communicate what the requesting application wants to access, who is making the request, and what the consequences of approval or denial will be. The design must balance security transparency with usability to avoid consent fatigue that leads users to blindly approve all requests.</p>\n<p><strong>Essential consent screen elements</strong> include the requesting application&#39;s verified name and description, a clear list of requested scopes translated into human-readable permissions, visual indicators of data sensitivity levels, and explicit approval/denial buttons that make the user&#39;s choice unambiguous. The screen must also display the user&#39;s current authentication context and provide a secure way to change accounts if needed.</p>\n<p>The <strong>scope presentation strategy</strong> transforms technical OAuth2 scope strings into meaningful descriptions that non-technical users can understand. Rather than showing &quot;user:email repo:public_repo&quot;, the screen should display &quot;Access your email address&quot; and &quot;Read your public repositories&quot;. Each permission description should include specific examples of what the application will be able to do and, importantly, what it will NOT be able to do with the granted access.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Technical Name</th>\n<th>User-Friendly Description</th>\n<th>Data Sensitivity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Profile basic info</td>\n<td><code>profile</code></td>\n<td>View your name and profile picture</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Email address</td>\n<td><code>email</code></td>\n<td>Access your email address for notifications</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repository access</td>\n<td><code>repo</code></td>\n<td>Read and modify your code repositories</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Admin privileges</td>\n<td><code>admin:org</code></td>\n<td>Manage organization settings and members</td>\n<td>Critical</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Consent persistence logic</strong> determines when to show the consent screen versus when to rely on previously granted permissions. The system should store consent decisions with sufficient granularity to detect when new permissions are requested or when significant time has passed since the last consent. Users should never be surprised by applications having access they don&#39;t remember granting.</p>\n<p>A robust consent system maintains <strong>consent records</strong> that track not just the granted scopes, but also when consent was given, when it was last used, and under what circumstances. This enables features like consent expiration, suspicious activity detection, and detailed access logs that users can review to maintain control over their data.</p>\n<p>The <strong>consent flow state machine</strong> manages the user journey from initial authorization request through consent decision to final redirect. The system must handle edge cases like users navigating away mid-flow, session timeouts during consent review, and attempts to manipulate consent parameters through browser developer tools.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>User Action</th>\n<th>System Response</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Request Received</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Validate parameters, authenticate user</td>\n<td>Show Consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Show Consent</td>\n<td>Approve</td>\n<td>Generate authorization code, redirect</td>\n<td>Flow Complete</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Show Consent</td>\n<td>Deny</td>\n<td>Send access_denied error, redirect</td>\n<td>Flow Complete</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Show Consent</td>\n<td>Navigate away</td>\n<td>Clean up pending state</td>\n<td>Request Expired</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Timeout</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Require re-authentication</td>\n<td>Authenticate User</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection</strong> in the consent flow relies heavily on the OAuth2 <code>state</code> parameter, but the consent screen itself may require additional protection if implemented as an HTML form. The authorization server must validate that consent decisions originate from legitimate user interactions, not from malicious scripts or cross-site attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authorization-code-generation\">Authorization Code Generation</h3>\n<p><strong>Cryptographically secure random generation</strong> forms the foundation of authorization code security. Authorization codes must be indistinguishable from random data to prevent attackers from predicting or brute-forcing valid codes. The system must use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) that draws entropy from the operating system&#39;s secure random source.</p>\n<p>The <strong>authorization code format</strong> should prioritize security over human readability. A 32-byte random value encoded as base64url (resulting in a 43-character string) provides approximately 256 bits of entropy, making brute-force attacks computationally infeasible. The encoding must use base64url rather than standard base64 to ensure the codes are URL-safe without requiring additional percent-encoding.</p>\n<p><strong>Code binding mechanisms</strong> associate each authorization code with the specific authorization request parameters that generated it. This binding prevents authorization code injection attacks where an attacker attempts to use a legitimate code with different parameters than originally authorized. The system must store and validate the client ID, redirect URI, requested scopes, and PKCE challenge alongside each code.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bound Parameter</th>\n<th>Storage Requirement</th>\n<th>Validation Point</th>\n<th>Attack Prevention</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client ID</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>Token exchange</td>\n<td>Prevents cross-client code reuse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redirect URI</td>\n<td>Exact match</td>\n<td>Token exchange</td>\n<td>Prevents code interception</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>Original requested scopes</td>\n<td>Token exchange</td>\n<td>Prevents privilege escalation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE Challenge</td>\n<td>SHA256 hash + method</td>\n<td>Token exchange</td>\n<td>Proves client identity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User ID</td>\n<td>Internal user identifier</td>\n<td>Token exchange</td>\n<td>Prevents user confusion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Authorization code lifecycle management</strong> enforces strict temporal and usage constraints to minimize the window of vulnerability. Codes must expire within 10 minutes of generation (RFC recommendation) and become invalid immediately after one successful exchange attempt. The system should also implement cleanup processes to purge expired codes and prevent storage exhaustion.</p>\n<p>The <strong>single-use enforcement</strong> mechanism must be atomic to prevent race conditions where the same code could be exchanged multiple times simultaneously. This typically requires database-level constraints or atomic compare-and-swap operations that mark codes as used in the same transaction that validates their availability.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization code storage security</strong> requires protecting codes both at rest and in transit. While codes are temporary and cannot directly access resources, they represent valuable authentication artifacts that attackers might attempt to steal. Storage should use appropriate database security measures, and codes should never appear in application logs or error messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: State Parameter Validation Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Cryptographically Secure State Generation with Round-Trip Validation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The OAuth2 state parameter provides CSRF protection but implementation approaches vary from simple timestamps to cryptographic tokens</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Client-provided state with no server validation</li>\n<li>Server-generated random state with session storage</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach allowing client state with server validation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Accept client-provided state parameters while strongly recommending cryptographically random values and providing validation guidance</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maintains OAuth2 specification compliance while enabling flexible client implementations, with clear security guidance preventing weak state implementations</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires client education about state security but provides maximum compatibility with diverse client architectures</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>CSRF Protection</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Client Flexibility</th>\n<th>Chosen</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client-only state</td>\n<td>Variable (depends on client)</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server-generated state</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid validation</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Authorization Code Expiration Strategy</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Short-Lived Codes with Aggressive Cleanup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Authorization codes represent a security risk while valid, but overly short expiration can cause usability issues with network latency</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>10-minute expiration (RFC 6749 recommendation)</li>\n<li>5-minute expiration for enhanced security</li>\n<li>Adaptive expiration based on client risk profile</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: 10-minute expiration with 5-minute option for high-security deployments, plus immediate cleanup on first use</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances security with practical network delays and mobile application backgrounding scenarios while maintaining RFC compliance</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires robust cleanup mechanisms and clear client guidance on timely code exchange</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision Record: Redirect URI Validation Strictness</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Exact String Matching with No Wildcards or Partial Matches</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Redirect URI validation prevents authorization code interception but strict validation can cause deployment difficulties</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Exact string matching only</li>\n<li>Allow subdomain wildcards (*.example.com)</li>\n<li>Allow path prefix matching</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Enforce exact string matching with multiple allowed URIs per client</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Exact matching eliminates entire classes of redirect URI manipulation attacks while multiple URI registration provides deployment flexibility</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful client configuration but provides strongest security guarantees against redirect attacks</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Level</th>\n<th>Security Strength</th>\n<th>Configuration Flexibility</th>\n<th>Attack Surface</th>\n<th>Chosen</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact matching</td>\n<td>Highest</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Minimal</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subdomain wildcards</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Path prefixes</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Highest</td>\n<td>Significant</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Using Predictable Authorization Code Generation</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations attempt to create &quot;readable&quot; authorization codes by using timestamps, sequential numbers, or weak random number generators. This creates a critical vulnerability where attackers can predict or enumerate valid codes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Authorization codes with insufficient entropy can be brute-forced or predicted, allowing attackers to obtain tokens for arbitrary users without their consent.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create codes with at least 128 bits of entropy. In Go, use <code>crypto/rand</code> rather than <code>math/rand</code>. Encode the result as base64url for URL safety.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient PKCE Challenge Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Implementations sometimes skip PKCE validation for &quot;trusted&quot; clients or use string equality comparison that&#39;s vulnerable to timing attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Weak PKCE validation defeats the entire purpose of the security mechanism, leaving public clients vulnerable to authorization code interception attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Always validate PKCE parameters when present, use constant-time comparison operations, and require PKCE for all public clients (those without client secrets).</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Storing User Passwords in Consent Context</strong></p>\n<p>Some implementations attempt to &quot;streamline&quot; the consent flow by storing user credentials or authentication state insecurely to avoid re-authentication.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Storing authentication credentials beyond the immediate authentication session creates unnecessary credential exposure risks and violates security best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use secure session management with time-limited authentication tokens. Require re-authentication for sensitive operations rather than caching credentials.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Authorization Code Binding</strong></p>\n<p>Implementations might generate authorization codes without properly binding them to the original request parameters, allowing codes to be used with different clients or redirect URIs than intended.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Unbound authorization codes can be stolen and used by different clients, leading to token theft and unauthorized access.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Store all critical request parameters (client ID, redirect URI, scope, PKCE challenge) alongside each authorization code and validate these parameters during token exchange.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Exposing Authorization Codes in Logs or Error Messages</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization codes might inadvertently appear in application logs, error messages, or debugging output, creating an information disclosure vulnerability.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Logged authorization codes can be extracted by attackers with log access and used to obtain unauthorized tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement careful logging practices that redact or hash sensitive parameters. Never include authorization codes in error messages returned to clients.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Weak State Parameter Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Clients might use predictable state values (like &quot;state=1234&quot;) or servers might not properly validate state round-trips, weakening CSRF protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Predictable or unvalidated state parameters allow cross-site request forgery attacks that can trick users into authorizing malicious applications.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Generate cryptographically random state values with sufficient entropy and validate that the returned state exactly matches the sent state. Consider binding state to user sessions for additional protection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology

When you arrive at a concert hall with a voucher (authorization code), you don&#39;t just walk into the show - you must first visit the box office to exchange that voucher for actual tickets that grant you specific access privileges.</p>\n<p>The authorization code is like a <strong>time-sensitive voucher</strong> that proves you&#39;ve already gone through the proper authorization process (getting approval from the venue&#39;s security desk). However, this voucher itself can&#39;t get you into the concert - it&#39;s just proof that you&#39;re authorized to receive the real tickets. The voucher has an expiration time (10 minutes maximum) and can only be used once to prevent fraud.</p>\n<p>When you present your voucher at the box office (token endpoint), the clerk (token service) performs several verification steps: they check that the voucher is genuine, hasn&#39;t expired, hasn&#39;t been used before, and matches the name on your ID (client authentication). They also verify that you&#39;re the same person who originally requested the voucher by checking your PKCE code verifier - think of this as a unique password you created when you first requested access.</p>\n<p>Once all verifications pass, the box office issues you two types of tickets: an <strong>access token</strong> (like a concert ticket with specific seat assignments and time validity) and a <strong>refresh token</strong> (like a season pass that allows you to get new concert tickets without going through the full authorization process again). The access token is short-lived but gives you immediate access to the specific resources (concert sections) you&#39;re authorized for. The refresh token is long-lived but can only be used to obtain new access tokens, not for direct resource access.</p>\n<p>For corporate clients (machine-to-machine scenarios), there&#39;s a special VIP box office where organizations with proper business credentials can directly purchase tickets without individual user vouchers - this is the client credentials grant flow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftoken-lifecycle-state-machine.svg\" alt=\"Token Lifecycle State Machine\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"jwt-access-token-generation\">JWT Access Token Generation</h3>\n<p>The heart of our token endpoint is the generation of <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</strong> that serve as cryptographically signed access tokens. Unlike opaque token formats, JWTs are self-contained credentials that carry all necessary information for resource servers to validate access without consulting the authorization server.</p>\n<p>A JWT consists of three base64url-encoded components separated by dots: header.payload.signature. The <strong>header</strong> specifies the signing algorithm and token type. The <strong>payload</strong> contains claims about the token&#39;s subject, issuer, audience, expiration, and granted scopes. The <strong>signature</strong> provides cryptographic proof that the token hasn&#39;t been tampered with and was issued by the legitimate authorization server.</p>\n<p>Our JWT generation process follows a carefully designed sequence to ensure both security and interoperability. When an authorization code is successfully exchanged, we construct the JWT payload with mandatory claims required by the OAuth2 and OIDC specifications, plus any additional claims specific to our implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Claims Structure:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Claim</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sub</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Subject identifier - the user ID who authorized the token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iss</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Issuer - our authorization server&#39;s identifier URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>aud</code></td>\n<td>string/array</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Audience - intended recipients (resource servers) for this token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exp</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Expiration time as Unix timestamp - when this token expires</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iat</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Issued at time as Unix timestamp - when this token was created</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jti</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>JWT ID - unique identifier for this specific token instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Space-separated list of scopes granted to this token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Client identifier that requested this token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_use</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Always &quot;access&quot; to distinguish from ID tokens</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The token generation algorithm follows these precise steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Claim Assembly</strong>: We start by constructing the base claims object with the subject (<code>sub</code>) field set to the user ID from the authorization code, the issuer (<code>iss</code>) set to our server&#39;s base URL, and the audience (<code>aud</code>) configured based on the intended resource servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Timestamp Calculation</strong>: We set the issued-at time (<code>iat</code>) to the current Unix timestamp and calculate the expiration time (<code>exp</code>) by adding our configured token lifetime (typically 15-60 minutes for access tokens).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Unique Identifier Generation</strong>: We generate a cryptographically secure random JWT ID (<code>jti</code>) that serves as a unique identifier for this token instance, enabling precise revocation tracking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Scope Inclusion</strong>: We copy the exact scope string from the authorization code into the <code>scope</code> claim, ensuring the token carries the precise permissions that were authorized by the user.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Header Construction</strong>: We build the JWT header specifying our chosen signing algorithm (RS256 for RSA signatures or ES256 for ECDSA) and the standard &quot;JWT&quot; token type.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Signature Generation</strong>: We serialize the header and payload, base64url-encode them, concatenate with a dot separator, and generate a cryptographic signature using our private key.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Token Assembly</strong>: Finally, we concatenate the encoded header, payload, and signature with dot separators to produce the final JWT access token.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>JWT Generation Service Interface:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>GenerateAccessToken</code></td>\n<td><code>userID string, clientID string, scope string, audience []string</code></td>\n<td><code>string, error</code></td>\n<td>Creates a signed JWT access token with specified claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GenerateRefreshToken</code></td>\n<td><code>userID string, clientID string, scope string, tokenFamily string</code></td>\n<td><code>*RefreshToken, error</code></td>\n<td>Creates a new refresh token with family tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ValidateJWT</code></td>\n<td><code>tokenString string</code></td>\n<td><code>*jwt.Claims, error</code></td>\n<td>Verifies JWT signature and extracts validated claims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RevokeToken</code></td>\n<td><code>jti string</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Adds JWT ID to revocation list until expiry</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: The JWT payload is only base64-encoded, not encrypted. Never include sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private user data in JWT claims. The signature prevents tampering but doesn&#39;t provide confidentiality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Token Signing Algorithm Selection:</strong></p>\n<p>Our implementation supports both RSA and ECDSA signing algorithms, each with distinct security and performance characteristics. RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) provides wide compatibility across OAuth2 clients and resource servers, making it the safer default choice for interoperability. ECDSA with P-256 (ES256) offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes and signatures, resulting in better performance and smaller tokens.</p>\n<p>For token generation, we maintain both a private key for signing and a corresponding public key that resource servers use for signature verification. The public key must be made available through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint that clients can discover and fetch.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Token Lifetime Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>Access tokens should be short-lived to limit the window of exposure if compromised. Industry best practices recommend 15 minutes to 1 hour maximum lifetime for access tokens. Shorter lifetimes provide better security by reducing the risk from stolen tokens, but increase the frequency of refresh token usage and potential performance impact.</p>\n<p>Our default configuration uses 30-minute access tokens as a balance between security and usability. Resource-intensive applications or high-security environments may prefer 15-minute tokens, while internal applications with lower risk profiles might use 1-hour tokens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"refresh-token-rotation\">Refresh Token Rotation</h3>\n<p>Refresh tokens enable applications to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication, but they represent a significant security risk if compromised since they typically have much longer lifetimes (days to months). To mitigate this risk, we implement <strong>refresh token rotation</strong> with family tracking - a security mechanism that detects and responds to token theft attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Family Concept:</strong></p>\n<p>Every initial authorization generates a new <strong>token family</strong> identified by a unique family ID. When a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, we generate a completely new refresh token and invalidate the old one. Critically, the new refresh token belongs to the same family as its parent, creating a chain of related tokens.</p>\n<p>This family relationship enables powerful security detection: if an application ever attempts to use an old (already rotated) refresh token, it indicates either a programming error or token theft. In response to this violation, we immediately revoke the entire token family, forcing the user to re-authenticate and preventing further abuse of any stolen tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Data Model:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Token</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Cryptographically random refresh token string</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ClientID</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client that this refresh token was issued to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UserID</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>User who authorized this token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Scope</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Scopes that can be granted when refreshing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ExpiresAt</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>When this refresh token expires</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TokenFamily</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique identifier linking related refresh tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ParentToken</code></td>\n<td>*string</td>\n<td>Previous refresh token in this family (null for initial)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Revoked</code></td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether this token has been revoked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreatedAt</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>When this refresh token was created</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastUsedAt</code></td>\n<td>*time.Time</td>\n<td>When this token was last used for refresh</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Rotation Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Token Validation</strong>: When a refresh request arrives, we first validate that the presented refresh token exists in our database, hasn&#39;t expired, and hasn&#39;t been marked as revoked.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Family Breach Detection</strong>: We check if the token has already been used (has a non-null <code>LastUsedAt</code> field). If so, this indicates a replay attack or programming error, triggering immediate family revocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>New Token Generation</strong>: For valid refresh requests, we generate a new cryptographically random refresh token string and create a new <code>RefreshToken</code> record with the same family ID as the current token.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Linking</strong>: We set the new token&#39;s <code>ParentToken</code> field to point to the current token being exchanged, maintaining the family chain for audit purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Current Token Invalidation</strong>: We mark the current refresh token&#39;s <code>LastUsedAt</code> field and set a flag indicating it has been consumed, preventing reuse.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Access Token Issuance</strong>: We generate a new JWT access token with the same scope and user information as the refresh token being exchanged.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Atomic Persistence</strong>: All database changes (new refresh token creation, old token invalidation, access token logging) must be performed atomically to prevent inconsistent state.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Family Revocation Process:</strong></p>\n<p>When we detect refresh token reuse, indicating potential compromise, we execute a family-wide revocation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Family Discovery</strong>: Starting with the compromised token&#39;s family ID, we query all refresh tokens belonging to that family.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Batch Revocation</strong>: We mark all tokens in the family as revoked and record the revocation timestamp for audit logging.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Active Token Invalidation</strong>: Any access tokens currently issued from this family should be added to a revocation list until their natural expiry.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Client Notification</strong>: We return an <code>invalid_grant</code> error to the client attempting the refresh, forcing them to restart the authorization flow.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Security Logging</strong>: We generate detailed audit logs including the compromised token, family size, and suspected breach time for security analysis.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Storage Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>Refresh tokens require persistent storage with efficient lookup capabilities. We need to support queries by token string (for refresh operations), by family ID (for revocation), and by user ID (for administrative operations). A relational database with proper indexing provides the necessary query flexibility and transactional guarantees.</p>\n<p>For high-throughput scenarios, consider implementing a write-through cache layer that stores recently active refresh tokens in memory while maintaining the database as the authoritative source. This reduces database load for frequent refresh operations while preserving the durability guarantees needed for security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"client-credentials-grant\">Client Credentials Grant</h3>\n<p>The <strong>client credentials grant</strong> provides a streamlined authentication flow for machine-to-machine scenarios where no human user is involved. This grant type allows confidential clients (servers, background services, APIs) to authenticate directly with the authorization server using their client credentials and receive access tokens for accessing protected resources.</p>\n<p>Unlike the authorization code flow, the client credentials grant bypasses user authorization entirely since the client is acting on its own behalf rather than on behalf of a user. This makes it ideal for server-to-server API calls, scheduled background jobs, and microservice authentication.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials Flow Sequence:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Direct Authentication</strong>: The client makes a POST request directly to the token endpoint with its client ID and client secret, along with the grant type set to &quot;client_credentials&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Client Authentication</strong>: We verify the client credentials using the same authentication methods as the authorization code flow (HTTP Basic or POST body parameters).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Scope Validation</strong>: We check that the requested scopes are within the client&#39;s registered allowed scopes, rejecting any scope escalation attempts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Token Generation</strong>: We generate a JWT access token with the client ID as the subject (no user ID since there&#39;s no user involved) and the requested scopes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Response</strong>: We return the access token directly to the client with the standard OAuth2 token response format.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials Token Claims:</strong></p>\n<p>For client credentials tokens, the JWT payload differs slightly from user-authorized tokens:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Claim</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sub</code></td>\n<td>client_id</td>\n<td>The client itself is the subject</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iss</code></td>\n<td>server_url</td>\n<td>Our authorization server identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>aud</code></td>\n<td>configured_audience</td>\n<td>Resource servers that accept these tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exp</code></td>\n<td>current_time + lifetime</td>\n<td>Token expiration (typically longer than user tokens)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iat</code></td>\n<td>current_time</td>\n<td>Token issuance time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jti</code></td>\n<td>random_uuid</td>\n<td>Unique token identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>requested_scopes</td>\n<td>Space-separated scope string</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>client_id</td>\n<td>Explicit client identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_use</code></td>\n<td>&quot;access&quot;</td>\n<td>Token type indicator</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>gty</code></td>\n<td>&quot;client_credentials&quot;</td>\n<td>Grant type used to obtain this token</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials vs Authorization Code Tokens:</strong></p>\n<p>The key differences between client credentials tokens and user-authorized tokens reflect their different security contexts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subject</strong>: Client credentials tokens have the client ID as the subject since there&#39;s no user involved</li>\n<li><strong>Lifetime</strong>: These tokens can have longer lifetimes (1-24 hours) since they represent ongoing service authorization rather than temporary user delegation</li>\n<li><strong>Refresh Tokens</strong>: Client credentials grants typically don&#39;t issue refresh tokens since clients can simply re-authenticate when needed</li>\n<li><strong>Scope Restrictions</strong>: Scopes are limited to what the client is pre-authorized for during registration, with no user consent step</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials Security Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p>Client credentials represent powerful, long-lived authentication mechanisms that require careful security handling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Principle</strong>: Client credentials tokens should be scoped to the minimum necessary permissions and should include rate limiting to prevent abuse if compromised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clients must securely store their client secrets using the same practices as database passwords or API keys.

ES256 offers better performance and smaller signatures but has less universal support.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables distributed token validation without secret sharing, requires RSA key pair management, slightly larger tokens than ECDSA but better client compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>JWT Algorithm Comparison:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n<th>Key Type</th>\n<th>Signature Size</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n<th>Compatibility</th>\n<th>Key Management</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HS256</td>\n<td>Symmetric</td>\n<td>32 bytes</td>\n<td>Fastest</td>\n<td>Universal</td>\n<td>Shared secrets (risky)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RS256</td>\n<td>RSA (2048-bit)</td>\n<td>256 bytes</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n<td>Public/private key pairs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ES256</td>\n<td>ECDSA P-256</td>\n<td>64 bytes</td>\n<td>Fast</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Public/private key pairs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Access Token Lifetime Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Access token lifetime affects security (shorter is safer) versus performance (longer reduces refresh frequency). Industry practices range from 5 minutes to 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Short-lived tokens (5-15 minutes) - maximum security</li>\n<li>Medium-lived tokens (30-60 minutes) - balanced approach</li>\n<li>Long-lived tokens (2-24 hours) - maximum performance</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Default to 30-minute access tokens with configurable lifetimes per client</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: 30 minutes provides reasonable security (limits exposure window if tokens are compromised) while avoiding excessive refresh token usage. Per-client configuration allows high-security clients to use shorter lifetimes and internal services to use longer lifetimes based on risk assessment.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Balances security and performance, requires refresh token rotation every 30 minutes for long-running applications, enables risk-based lifetime adjustment per client.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Refresh Token Storage and Family Tracking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Refresh tokens need persistent storage and family tracking for security. Options include database storage, encrypted cookies, or hybrid approaches.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Database storage with full family tracking - maximum security and auditability</li>\n<li>Encrypted stateless tokens - no database dependency but limited revocation</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with database references and encrypted tokens</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Database storage with comprehensive family tracking and revocation support</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Security requirements (immediate revocation, breach detection, audit logging) require persistent state that stateless approaches cannot provide. Database storage enables precise family tracking, immediate revocation, and comprehensive audit trails essential for production OAuth2 deployments.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires database operations for every refresh, enables immediate revocation and breach detection, supports comprehensive audit logging, scales with database performance characteristics.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Client Credentials Token Lifetime</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client credentials tokens represent service-to-service authentication and can have different lifetime requirements than user-authorized tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Same lifetime as user tokens (30 minutes) - consistent but potentially inefficient</li>\n<li>Longer lifetime (2-24 hours) - reduced authentication overhead</li>\n<li>Configurable per-client lifetime - maximum flexibility</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Default 2-hour lifetime with per-client configuration support</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Service-to-service authentication typically involves lower risk than user delegation and benefits from reduced authentication overhead. 2 hours provides reasonable security while minimizing unnecessary token refresh operations. Per-client configuration allows high-security services to use shorter lifetimes.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Reduces authentication overhead for service clients, requires revocation list maintenance for longer periods, enables risk-appropriate lifetime configuration per service.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Including Sensitive Data in JWT Payload</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is storing sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private user data in JWT claims. Since JWTs are only base64-encoded (not encrypted), anyone who obtains the token can decode and read the payload.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: JWT payloads are readable by anyone with access to the token. Base64 encoding provides no confidentiality - it&#39;s just a text encoding format, not encryption.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Only include non-sensitive claims in JWTs. Use the subject (<code>sub</code>) field to identify users and let resource servers look up detailed user information from secure databases using the subject identifier.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Implementing Proper Refresh Token Rotation</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations reuse the same refresh token multiple times instead of generating a new token on each refresh operation, missing critical security benefits of token rotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Reusing refresh tokens prevents detection of token theft. If a refresh token is compromised, the attacker can continue using it indefinitely without the legitimate client detecting the breach.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Generate a new refresh token on every refresh operation and invalidate the old one. Implement family tracking to detect when old tokens are reused and revoke the entire family when this occurs.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Using Weak Random Number Generation</strong></p>\n<p>Using predictable random number generators or insufficient entropy for token generation creates security vulnerabilities where tokens can be guessed or predicted.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Predictable tokens enable attackers to forge valid tokens or guess other users&#39; tokens, completely bypassing the authorization system.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use cryptographically secure random number generators (<code>crypto/rand</code> in Go) with sufficient entropy (at least 128 bits for authorization codes, 256 bits for refresh tokens). Never use <code>math/rand</code> or timestamp-based generation for security tokens.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Validating JWT Expiration with Clock Skew Tolerance</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing strict expiration checking without accounting for clock differences between servers can cause valid tokens to be rejected due to minor time synchronization issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Distributed systems have inevitable clock skew, and rejecting tokens due to minor time differences (1-2 minutes) creates unnecessary authentication failures.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement clock skew tolerance (typically 2-5 minutes) when validating JWT expiration times. Accept tokens that expired within the tolerance window while still enforcing meaningful expiration limits.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Atomic Database Operations for Token Rotation</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to use database transactions when rotating refresh tokens can create inconsistent states where both old and new tokens remain valid, or neither token is valid.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Race conditions during token rotation can leave the database in an inconsistent state, causing authentication failures or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use database transactions to atomically create new refresh tokens and invalidate old ones. Ensure that either both operations succeed or both fail, never leaving the system in a partially updated state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Implementing Proper Client Scope Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing clients to request any scope during client credentials grants without validating against registered scopes enables privilege escalation attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Clients could request scopes they weren&#39;t authorized for during registration, gaining access to resources beyond their intended permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Always validate that requested scopes are within the client&#39;s registered allowed scopes. Reject requests that attempt to escalate privileges beyond what was granted during client registration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology

When someone presents an access badge (access token) at a checkpoint, the security guard doesn&#39;t just look at the badge - they scan it in a verification system that checks multiple things: Is this badge authentic? Has it expired? Has it been reported stolen or lost? Is the person authorized for the specific area they&#39;re trying to access?</p>\n<p>Token introspection works the same way. When a resource server receives an access token, it can query the authorization server&#39;s introspection endpoint to verify the token&#39;s authenticity, check its expiration status, and confirm what permissions (scopes) it actually grants. The introspection endpoint acts like the central security database that knows the current status of every issued badge.</p>\n<p>Token revocation is like reporting a lost or stolen ID card. When someone&#39;s badge is compromised, stolen, or no longer needed, it gets added to a revocation list. The next time someone tries to use that badge, the verification system immediately rejects it, even if the badge itself looks valid and hasn&#39;t technically expired yet. In OAuth2, this happens when users revoke permissions, administrators disable access, or security incidents require immediate token invalidation.</p>\n<p>The critical insight here is that JWTs, while self-contained and verifiable through their cryptographic signatures, still need a way to be revoked before their natural expiration. Unlike a traditional session token stored in a database (where you can simply delete the record), JWTs carry their validity within themselves. This creates a tension between the stateless nature of JWTs and the security requirement to immediately invalidate compromised tokens. The solution involves maintaining a revocation list and providing introspection endpoints for real-time validation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introspection-endpoint\">Introspection Endpoint</h3>\n<p>The token introspection endpoint, defined by RFC 7662, provides a standardized way for resource servers to validate tokens by querying the authorization server. This endpoint bridges the gap between stateless JWT tokens and the need for real-time validity checking, including revocation status.</p>\n<p><strong>Introspection Request Processing</strong></p>\n<p>When a resource server receives an access token from a client, it may need to validate that token&#39;s current status beyond what can be determined from the JWT signature and claims alone. The resource server makes an introspection request to the authorization server, presenting the token for validation along with client credentials to authenticate the introspection request itself.</p>\n<p>The introspection endpoint processes these requests by first authenticating the requesting client. Not all clients should be able to introspect arbitrary tokens - typically, only resource servers and privileged clients receive this capability. The endpoint verifies the client&#39;s credentials using the same authentication mechanisms employed by the token endpoint.</p>\n<p>Once the client is authenticated, the endpoint examines the presented token. For JWT access tokens, this involves several validation steps: verifying the signature using the appropriate public key, checking standard claims like expiration (<code>exp</code>) and issued-at (<code>iat</code>), and validating that the issuer (<code>iss</code>) and audience (<code>aud</code>) claims match expected values.</p>\n<p><strong>Revocation Status Checking</strong></p>\n<p>A critical aspect of introspection is checking whether the token has been explicitly revoked. Since JWTs are stateless, the authorization server must maintain a revocation list - a data structure tracking tokens that have been invalidated before their natural expiration. This revocation list is indexed by the JWT&#39;s unique identifier (the <code>jti</code> claim) to enable fast lookups.</p>\n<p>The revocation list presents several implementation challenges. First, it grows continuously as tokens are revoked, but entries can be safely removed once the corresponding token&#39;s natural expiration time passes. Second, the list must be quickly accessible from the introspection endpoint, which may handle high request volumes.

The response always includes an <code>active</code> boolean field indicating whether the token is currently valid and usable. When <code>active</code> is true, the response includes additional metadata about the token, such as the scopes it grants, the client it was issued to, and its expiration time.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>active</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Whether the token is active and valid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Space-separated list of granted scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Client identifier the token was issued to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>username</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Human-readable user identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exp</code></td>\n<td>integer</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Token expiration timestamp (Unix epoch)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iat</code></td>\n<td>integer</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Token issued-at timestamp (Unix epoch)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sub</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Subject identifier (user ID)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>aud</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Audience the token is intended for</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iss</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Issuer identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jti</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Unique token identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_type</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Type of token (typically &quot;Bearer&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When a token is invalid, expired, or revoked, the response contains only <code>{&quot;active&quot;: false}</code>. This prevents information leakage about invalid tokens while still providing the binary validity information that resource servers need.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Authentication for Introspection</strong></p>\n<p>The introspection endpoint must authenticate clients making introspection requests to prevent unauthorized token validation attempts. This authentication typically uses the same client credential mechanisms as the token endpoint: HTTP Basic authentication with client ID and secret, or POST body parameters.</p>\n<p>Different clients may have different introspection privileges. Resource servers typically can introspect any token presented to them, while regular OAuth clients might only be able to introspect tokens they originally requested. This authorization policy is enforced after client authentication but before token validation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Require Client Authentication for Introspection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: RFC 7662 makes client authentication optional, but allowing unauthenticated introspection creates security risks</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Allow anonymous introspection for simplicity</li>\n<li>Require authentication for all introspection requests</li>\n<li>Support both modes with configuration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Require client authentication for all introspection requests</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Unauthenticated introspection enables token scanning attacks where malicious actors probe tokens to determine their validity. Client authentication provides accountability and enables fine-grained access control policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Increases complexity for resource servers (must have client credentials) but significantly improves security posture and enables audit logging</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"revocation-endpoint\">Revocation Endpoint</h3>\n<p>The token revocation endpoint, specified by RFC 7009, allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously issued token is no longer needed and should be considered invalid immediately. This endpoint is crucial for security scenarios where tokens may be compromised or when users explicitly revoke permissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Revocation Request Processing</strong></p>\n<p>Clients make revocation requests by posting the token they wish to revoke along with their client credentials for authentication. The revocation endpoint accepts both access tokens and refresh tokens, though the specific revocation behavior differs depending on token type.</p>\n<p>When a client submits a revocation request, the endpoint first authenticates the client using the same mechanisms as the token endpoint. The client must be authorized to revoke the presented token - typically meaning the client must be the same one that originally requested the token, or a privileged administrative client.</p>\n<p>The endpoint then processes the token to determine its type and current status. For JWT access tokens, this involves parsing the token structure, verifying the signature, and extracting the unique identifier (<code>jti</code> claim). For refresh tokens, the endpoint queries the refresh token store to retrieve the token record and verify its association with the requesting client.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Token Revocation</strong></p>\n<p>Revoking JWT access tokens presents unique challenges because these tokens are designed to be self-contained and stateless. The authorization server cannot directly invalidate a JWT that has already been issued and distributed to resource servers.</p>\n<p>Instead, access token revocation works by adding the token&#39;s unique identifier to a revocation list. When resource servers validate tokens (either through introspection or local validation), they must check this revocation list to determine if an otherwise-valid token has been explicitly revoked.</p>\n<p>The revocation process involves several steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Token Identification</strong>: Extract the <code>jti</code> claim from the JWT to obtain a unique identifier</li>\n<li><strong>Ownership Verification</strong>: Confirm that the requesting client has permission to revoke this specific token</li>\n<li><strong>Revocation Recording</strong>: Add the token identifier to the revocation list with metadata about when and why it was revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Cache Invalidation</strong>: If caching is used, invalidate any cached positive validation results for this token</li>\n<li><strong>Audit Logging</strong>: Record the revocation event for security monitoring and compliance</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Revocation Record Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>jti</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique token identifier being revoked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Client that requested the revocation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>revoked_at</code></td>\n<td>timestamp</td>\n<td>When the revocation occurred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>reason</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Why the token was revoked (user request, security incident, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expires_at</code></td>\n<td>timestamp</td>\n<td>When this revocation record can be cleaned up</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_type</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Whether this was an access token or refresh token</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Revocation</strong></p>\n<p>Refresh token revocation is more straightforward than access token revocation because refresh tokens are stored server-side and can be directly invalidated. However, refresh token revocation often has broader implications due to token family relationships.</p>\n<p>When a refresh token is revoked, the authorization server marks it as invalid in the refresh token store. Additionally, if the implementation uses refresh token rotation with family tracking, revoking one refresh token may trigger revocation of the entire token family. This is a security measure that assumes if one token in the family is compromised, all related tokens should be considered potentially compromised.</p>\n<p>The refresh token revocation process includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Token Lookup</strong>: Query the refresh token store to find the token record</li>\n<li><strong>Authorization Check</strong>: Verify the requesting client owns this token</li>\n<li><strong>Family Assessment</strong>: Determine if other tokens in the same family should be revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Database Update</strong>: Mark the token (and potentially family members) as revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Related Token Cleanup</strong>: Optionally revoke associated access tokens</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Token Family Revocation</strong></p>\n<p>Token families provide a security mechanism for detecting and responding to token theft scenarios. When refresh tokens are rotated (a new refresh token is issued each time the old one is used), all tokens issued from the same original authorization form a &quot;family&quot; with a shared family identifier.</p>\n<p>If an old refresh token from a family is presented for use after a newer token in the same family has already been used, this indicates a potential security breach - someone may be replaying a stolen token. In response, the authorization server revokes the entire token family, forcing the legitimate client to re-authenticate.</p>\n<p>Token family revocation extends to explicit revocation requests. When a user revokes consent for an application or an administrator terminates a session, revoking the entire token family ensures that all related tokens become invalid, regardless of where they might be stored or cached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Implement Token Family Revocation for Security Breach Detection</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Refresh token rotation creates families of related tokens, but detection of replay attacks requires family-level revocation</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Revoke only the specific token requested</li>\n<li>Revoke token families only on detected replay attacks</li>\n<li>Always revoke entire families for any revocation request</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Revoke entire token families when replay attacks are detected, individual tokens for explicit user/admin revocation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances security (detecting token theft) with usability (not over-revoking for legitimate revocation requests)</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires family tracking infrastructure but provides strong protection against token theft scenarios</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"jwt-validation-library\">JWT Validation Library</h3>\n<p>Resource servers need the ability to validate JWT access tokens locally without always requiring introspection calls to the authorization server. A JWT validation library provides this capability while properly handling the complexities of cryptographic verification, claims validation, and revocation checking.</p>\n<p><strong>Local JWT Validation Process</strong></p>\n<p>Local JWT validation offers significant performance and availability advantages over introspection-based validation. Resource servers can validate tokens independently, reducing network round-trips and eliminating dependencies on authorization server availability for routine token validation.</p>\n<p>The validation process involves multiple steps, each addressing different aspects of token integrity and authenticity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Token Structure Parsing</strong>: Parse the JWT into header, payload, and signature components</li>\n<li><strong>Header Validation</strong>: Verify algorithm specification matches expected values and extract key identifier</li>\n<li><strong>Signature Verification</strong>: Cryptographically verify the token signature using the appropriate public key</li>\n<li><strong>Standard Claims Validation</strong>: Check expiration (<code>exp</code>), not-before (<code>nbf</code>), and issued-at (<code>iat</code>) timestamps</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Claims Validation</strong>: Verify issuer (<code>iss</code>), audience (<code>aud</code>), and subject (<code>sub</code>) claims match expected values</li>\n<li><strong>Revocation Checking</strong>: Query revocation list or cache to confirm token hasn&#39;t been explicitly revoked</li>\n<li><strong>Scope Authorization</strong>: Verify that granted scopes authorize the requested resource access</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Step</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Failure Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Structure Parse</td>\n<td>Ensure valid JWT format</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Check</td>\n<td>Prevent algorithm substitution attacks</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature Verify</td>\n<td>Confirm token authenticity</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expiration Check</td>\n<td>Reject expired tokens</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audience Validate</td>\n<td>Ensure token intended for this resource</td>\n<td>403 Forbidden</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revocation Check</td>\n<td>Respect explicit token invalidation</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope Authorize</td>\n<td>Confirm permission for requested resource</td>\n<td>403 Forbidden</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Cryptographic Key Management</strong></p>\n<p>JWT validation requires access to the public keys used by the authorization server to sign tokens. The validation library must securely obtain and manage these keys, handling key rotation and multiple concurrent keys during transition periods.</p>\n<p>The authorization server typically publishes its public keys through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, following the well-known configuration pattern. The validation library fetches these keys and caches them locally, refreshing periodically or when encountering tokens signed with unknown key identifiers.</p>\n<p>Key management includes several critical security considerations. The library must validate that keys are obtained from the correct authorization server to prevent key substitution attacks. It should cache keys with appropriate expiration times to balance performance with security - too long and revoked keys remain trusted, too short and performance suffers from constant key fetching.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key Management Component</th>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Security Consideration</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>JWKS Client</td>\n<td>Fetch public keys from authorization server</td>\n<td>Verify HTTPS and certificate validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Cache</td>\n<td>Store keys locally for performance</td>\n<td>Implement reasonable TTL (1-24 hours)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Rotation Handler</td>\n<td>Detect and handle key changes</td>\n<td>Support multiple keys during rotation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Validator</td>\n<td>Ensure only secure algorithms accepted</td>\n<td>Reject symmetric algorithms (HS256)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key ID Resolver</td>\n<td>Map token <code>kid</code> to verification key</td>\n<td>Handle missing or unknown key IDs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Revocation Checking Integration</strong></p>\n<p>Even with local JWT validation, resource servers must still check token revocation status to handle tokens that have been explicitly invalidated before expiration. The validation library can implement this in several ways, each with different performance and consistency trade-offs.</p>\n<p>The most secure approach queries the introspection endpoint for every token validation, but this eliminates the performance benefits of local validation. A more balanced approach maintains a local cache of revoked token identifiers, periodically refreshed from the authorization server or updated through push notifications.</p>\n<p>For high-performance scenarios, the library might implement a bloom filter or similar probabilistic data structure to quickly eliminate tokens that definitely haven&#39;t been revoked, falling back to introspection only for tokens that might be revoked. This approach requires careful tuning to balance false positive rates with performance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Validation Result Caching</strong></p>\n<p>JWT validation involves computationally expensive operations, particularly signature verification. The validation library can cache successful validation results to avoid repeating these operations for frequently-used tokens, but this caching must be implemented carefully to maintain security properties.</p>\n<p>Validation result caching must consider token expiration times, ensuring cached results don&#39;t outlive the token&#39;s validity period. It should also integrate with revocation checking, invalidating cached results when tokens are revoked. The cache size should be limited to prevent memory exhaustion from token scanning attacks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Implement Validation Result Caching with Revocation Integration</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: JWT signature verification is computationally expensive, but caching validation results risks serving revoked tokens</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>No caching - validate every request completely</li>\n<li>Cache validation results with token expiration TTL</li>\n<li>Cache validation results with shorter TTL for revocation safety</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Cache validation results with TTL of min(token_expiration, 5_minutes) and invalidate on revocation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides significant performance improvement while maintaining revocation security through short cache windows</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires cache invalidation infrastructure but reduces CPU load by 80-90% for repeated token usage</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use Redis for Distributed Revocation List</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use Redis for Distributed Revocation List</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Token revocation must be consistent across multiple authorization server instances, and revocation lists need fast access for introspection</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Database-only storage with caching</li>\n<li>Redis with database backup</li>\n<li>In-memory with event propagation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Redis as primary revocation store with database backup for durability</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Redis provides sub-millisecond access times, built-in TTL for automatic cleanup, and pub/sub for cache invalidation.

Since JWT access tokens have limited lifetimes, revocation entries can be safely removed after the token&#39;s natural expiration time passes.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: The revocation list grows without bound, consuming memory and storage space. Eventually, the system runs out of resources or performance degrades due to large list sizes. Additionally, keeping expired revocation entries provides no security benefit since the tokens they reference are already naturally invalid.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Implement a cleanup process that runs periodically (hourly or daily) and removes revocation entries where the token&#39;s expiration time has passed. If using Redis, leverage the TTL feature to automatically expire entries. For database storage, use a background job that deletes old records based on the <code>expires_at</code> timestamp.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Token Scanning Through Unauthenticated Introspection</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing unauthenticated access to the introspection endpoint enables attackers to scan randomly generated tokens to determine which ones are valid. Even though the introspection response for invalid tokens only returns <code>{&quot;active&quot;: false}</code>, the difference in response timing or HTTP status codes can leak information about token validity.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: Attackers can systematically probe token values to discover valid tokens, then use those tokens to access protected resources. This is particularly dangerous if tokens use predictable formats or if the JWT structure reveals patterns that can be exploited in brute force attacks.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Always require client authentication for introspection requests. Implement rate limiting per client to prevent rapid scanning attempts. Use constant-time responses for both valid and invalid tokens to prevent timing-based information leakage. Consider implementing CAPTCHA or other anti-automation measures for suspicious request patterns.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Revocation Status in JWT Validation Libraries</strong></p>\n<p>When implementing JWT validation libraries for resource servers, developers often focus on cryptographic signature verification and claims validation while forgetting to check revocation status. This creates a security gap where revoked tokens continue to work until their natural expiration.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: Users who revoke permissions or administrators who disable access expect those actions to take immediate effect. If resource servers only validate JWT signatures and claims, revoked tokens remain functional, violating user expectations and security policies. This is particularly problematic for high-privilege tokens or sensitive resources.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Always include revocation checking as part of JWT validation. This can be implemented through periodic introspection calls, maintaining a local cache of revoked token IDs, or subscribing to revocation events from the authorization server. Design the validation library to fail securely - if revocation status cannot be determined, treat the token as potentially invalid.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-Caching Validation Results Without Revocation Consideration</strong></p>\n<p>To improve performance, validation libraries often cache JWT validation results to avoid repeated signature verification. However, long-lived caches can serve stale positive results for tokens that have been revoked, creating a window where revoked tokens remain functional.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: The security benefit of token revocation is negated if cached validation results aren&#39;t invalidated when tokens are revoked. Users who revoke permissions expect immediate effect, but cached results can extend token lifetime beyond revocation by hours or even days, depending on cache configuration.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Implement cache invalidation mechanisms that respond to revocation events. Use shorter cache TTLs (5-15 minutes maximum) for validation results. Consider implementing a two-tier approach where signature validation is cached longer but revocation status is checked more frequently. Provide cache invalidation APIs that can be called when tokens are revoked.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Token Family Revocation Logic</strong></p>\n<p>When implementing refresh token rotation with family tracking, developers sometimes implement inconsistent revocation logic - revoking individual tokens in some cases and entire families in others, without clear criteria for when each approach should be used.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: Inconsistent revocation behavior confuses users and creates security gaps. If replay attack detection revokes entire families but user-initiated revocation only revokes individual tokens, stolen tokens from the same family might remain valid. Conversely, over-aggressive family revocation can log out users unexpectedly from all their devices.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Establish clear rules for when individual tokens vs. entire families should be revoked. Typically: revoke entire families for security events (replay detection, breach response), revoke individual tokens for user-initiated actions (single device logout), and provide administrative options for both approaches. Document these behaviors clearly and implement them consistently across all revocation scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Exposing Sensitive Information in Introspection Responses</strong></p>\n<p>The introspection endpoint response format allows returning various claims and metadata about tokens. Developers sometimes include sensitive information like internal user IDs, detailed permission lists, or system-specific metadata that should not be exposed to resource servers.</p>\n<p>Why this breaks: Resource servers only need to know whether a token is valid and what scopes it grants. Additional information creates privacy risks and potential attack vectors. Internal user IDs might be used for user enumeration attacks, detailed permissions might reveal system architecture, and system metadata could assist in other attack vectors.</p>\n<p>How to fix: Only include necessary information in introspection responses. Standard fields like <code>scope</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>exp</code>, and <code>active</code> are usually sufficient. If additional claims are needed, carefully evaluate their security implications. Use different response formats for different types of clients - resource servers might receive minimal information while administrative tools get more detailed responses.</p>\n<h3

Endpoint &amp; Consent Management</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-medical-records-release\">Mental Model: Medical Records Release</h3>\n<p>Think of the UserInfo endpoint and consent management system like a hospital&#39;s medical records release department. When a patient (resource owner) visits a hospital, they accumulate various pieces of medical information - personal details, test results, treatment history, insurance data. Later, when external parties like insurance companies (client applications) or specialists (resource servers) need access to specific portions of this information, they must go through a formal request process.</p>\n<p>The patient doesn&#39;t give blanket access to their entire medical file. Instead, they carefully review each request and decide which specific types of information can be shared. The insurance company might get access to basic demographics and billing codes, but not detailed psychiatric notes. A consulting specialist might receive test results and treatment history, but not financial information. The medical records department maintains detailed logs of what information was shared with whom and when, and the patient can revoke these permissions at any time.</p>\n<p>In our OAuth2 system, the UserInfo endpoint serves as this medical records release department. The <code>User</code> profile contains various claims (like medical record fields), the scopes define categories of information that can be requested (like &quot;billing information&quot; or &quot;test results&quot;), and the consent records track what the user has authorized each client application to access. Just as hospitals maintain strict HIPAA compliance by only releasing authorized information, our system enforces scope-based filtering to ensure clients receive only the claims they&#39;ve been granted permission to access.</p>\n<p>This analogy helps explain why consent persistence is crucial - patients shouldn&#39;t have to re-authorize the same specialist every time they need a follow-up consultation, but they should be able to revoke access if they switch providers. Similarly, users shouldn&#39;t face consent fatigue from repeated authorization prompts, but they must retain control over their data sharing decisions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fconsent-management-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Consent Management Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"userinfo-endpoint-oidc-compliant-user-profile-claims-service\">UserInfo Endpoint: OIDC Compliant User Profile Claims Service</h3>\n<p>The <strong>UserInfo endpoint</strong> represents the crown jewel of OpenID Connect functionality - it&#39;s where client applications finally retrieve the user profile information they were granted access to during the authorization flow. This endpoint bridges the gap between authorization (what scopes were granted) and actual data access (which specific user claims are returned). The endpoint must implement RFC specifications precisely while maintaining security through proper token validation and scope-based filtering.</p>\n<p>The UserInfo endpoint serves a fundamentally different purpose than typical REST APIs. Rather than providing comprehensive user management functionality, it acts as a read-only, scope-filtered window into user profile data. Client applications present their access tokens, and the endpoint returns only those user claims that correspond to the scopes originally granted by the user. This design ensures that even if a client somehow obtains a valid access token, it cannot exceed the permissions the user explicitly authorized.</p>\n<p>The endpoint&#39;s security model relies entirely on <strong>bearer token authentication</strong> using the access tokens issued by our token endpoint. Unlike traditional API authentication that might use API keys or basic authentication, the UserInfo endpoint exclusively accepts OAuth2 access tokens in the Authorization header. This token-centric approach ensures that every data access request can be traced back to a specific user consent decision and that token revocation immediately terminates data access.</p>\n<p>The OIDC specification defines standard claim names and their expected formats, but our implementation must be flexible enough to handle custom claims while maintaining interoperability. Standard claims like <code>sub</code> (subject identifier), <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>picture</code>, and <code>locale</code> have defined semantics, but organizations often need to expose additional profile attributes. Our scope-to-claims mapping system accommodates both scenarios while ensuring consistent behavior for standard OIDC flows.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>UserInfo Endpoint Method</th>\n<th>HTTP Method</th>\n<th>Path</th>\n<th>Authentication</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>GetUserInfo</code></td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td><code>/userinfo</code></td>\n<td>Bearer Token</td>\n<td>Returns user claims filtered by granted scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetUserInfo</code></td>\n<td>POST</td>\n<td><code>/userinfo</code></td>\n<td>Bearer Token</td>\n<td>Alternative POST method for clients that prefer form data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The endpoint must handle both GET and POST requests to comply with OIDC specifications, though GET requests are more common. POST support accommodates clients that prefer sending the access token in the request body rather than headers, though this approach is less secure and generally discouraged.</p>\n<p>Token validation for the UserInfo endpoint involves multiple layers of verification. The endpoint must first extract and validate the JWT access token signature, then verify that the token hasn&#39;t expired, hasn&#39;t been revoked, and contains the required claims for user identification. Unlike other endpoints that might perform lightweight token checks, UserInfo requires comprehensive validation because it directly exposes user data.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Validation Step</th>\n<th>Check Performed</th>\n<th>Failure Response</th>\n<th>Error Code</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Token Extraction</td>\n<td>Authorization header present and properly formatted</td>\n<td><code>WWW-Authenticate: Bearer</code></td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT Signature</td>\n<td>Cryptographic signature verification against public key</td>\n<td><code>invalid_token</code></td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Expiration</td>\n<td>Current time before <code>exp</code> claim</td>\n<td><code>invalid_token</code></td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revocation Status</td>\n<td>Token ID not in revocation list</td>\n<td><code>invalid_token</code></td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Existence</td>\n<td>User ID from <code>sub</code> claim exists in user store</td>\n<td><code>invalid_token</code></td>\n<td>401</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope Validation</td>\n<td>Token contains valid scope claim</td>\n<td><code>insufficient_scope</code></td>\n<td>403</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The endpoint returns user claims as a JSON object, with claim names as keys and claim values following OIDC data type specifications. String claims are returned as JSON strings, boolean claims as JSON booleans, and numeric claims as JSON numbers. Array claims like <code>groups</code> or <code>roles</code> are returned as JSON arrays. The response must never include claims that weren&#39;t authorized by the granted scopes, even if the user profile contains additional data.</p>\n<p>Error handling for the UserInfo endpoint follows OIDC specifications rather than general OAuth2 error formats. When token validation fails, the endpoint returns a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> status with a <code>WWW-Authenticate: Bearer</code> header containing error details. When the token is valid but lacks sufficient scope for the requested operation, the endpoint returns <code>403 Forbidden</code> with an <code>insufficient_scope</code> error. These specific error responses help client applications distinguish between authentication failures and authorization failures.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The UserInfo endpoint serves as the trust boundary between authorization decisions and actual data access. While the authorization flow establishes what the user consented to share, the UserInfo endpoint enforces those decisions through cryptographic token validation and scope-based filtering. This separation of concerns allows the authorization system to focus on consent workflows while the UserInfo endpoint specializes in secure data delivery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Performance considerations for the UserInfo endpoint center around token validation overhead and user data retrieval patterns. Since every request requires full JWT validation and potential revocation checking, the endpoint benefits significantly from validation result caching and efficient revocation list lookups. However, caching must be balanced against security requirements - overly aggressive caching can delay the effects of token revocation or user profile updates.</p>\n<p>The endpoint must handle high request volumes efficiently since client applications often call UserInfo frequently to refresh user profile data. Connection pooling for database access, Redis caching for revocation lists, and JWT validation result caching become crucial for production performance. However, the endpoint should never cache actual user profile data, as user information changes must be reflected immediately in API responses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scope-to-claims-mapping-filtering-user-profile-data-based-on-granted-scopes\">Scope to Claims Mapping: Filtering User Profile Data Based on Granted Scopes</h3>\n<p>The <strong>scope to claims mapping</strong> system represents the enforcement mechanism that translates high-level user consent decisions into specific data access permissions. When a user grants the <code>profile</code> scope to a client application, they&#39;re not authorizing access to a generic &quot;profile&quot; - they&#39;re specifically authorizing access to claims like <code>name</code>, <code>family_name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, <code>picture</code>, and <code>locale</code>. This mapping system ensures that scope grants translate into precise, predictable data access patterns that users can understand and trust.</p>\n<p>OIDC defines several standard scopes with specific claim mappings that our implementation must honor for interoperability. The <code>openid</code> scope is mandatory for all OIDC flows and doesn&#39;t directly map to claims - instead, it signals that the client wants OIDC functionality rather than pure OAuth2. The remaining standard scopes have well-defined claim mappings that client applications rely on for consistent behavior across different identity providers.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>OIDC Standard Scope</th>\n<th>Associated Claims</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>User-Facing Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>openid</code></td>\n<td>None (enables OIDC)</td>\n<td>Signals OIDC request</td>\n<td>&quot;Confirm your identity&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>profile</code></td>\n<td><code>name</code>, <code>family_name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, <code>middle_name</code>, <code>nickname</code>, <code>preferred_username</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>picture</code>, <code>website</code>, <code>gender</code>, <code>birthdate</code>, <code>zoneinfo</code>, <code>locale</code>, <code>updated_at</code></td>\n<td>Basic profile information</td>\n<td>&quot;Access your basic profile information&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>email</code></td>\n<td><code>email</code>, <code>email_verified</code></td>\n<td>Email address and verification status</td>\n<td>&quot;Access your email address&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>address</code></td>\n<td><code>address</code> (structured object)</td>\n<td>Physical address information</td>\n<td>&quot;Access your address information&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>phone</code></td>\n<td><code>phone_number</code>, <code>phone_number_verified</code></td>\n<td>Phone number and verification status</td>\n<td>&quot;Access your phone number&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Beyond standard OIDC scopes, organizations often need custom scopes for application-specific data access. Our mapping system must accommodate custom scopes while maintaining the security properties of the standard mappings. Custom scopes like <code>employee_info</code>, <code>billing_data</code>, or <code>medical_records</code> can map to organization-specific user profile fields, but they must follow the same filtering principles as standard scopes.</p>\n<p>The mapping implementation must handle <strong>overlapping scopes</strong> correctly when clients request multiple scopes simultaneously. If a client requests both <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code> scopes, the resulting claim set includes the union of claims from both mappings, not their intersection. This additive behavior matches user expectations - granting additional scopes provides additional access rather than restricting it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Static vs. Dynamic Scope Mapping</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to decide whether scope-to-claims mappings should be hardcoded in application logic or stored in a configurable database table</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Static mappings in Go constants/maps for standard scopes only</li>\n<li>Database-driven mappings for all scopes with admin UI</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with static standard mappings and configurable custom mappings</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with static standard mappings and configurable custom mappings</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Standard OIDC scope mappings never change and benefit from compile-time validation, while custom organizational scopes need runtime flexibility. Hybrid approach provides both reliability and flexibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables OIDC compliance through guaranteed standard mappings while supporting organizational customization. Requires careful validation to prevent conflicts between standard and custom scope names.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Claim filtering must handle <strong>conditional claims</strong> where the availability of certain claims depends on user profile completeness or verification status. The <code>email_verified</code> claim should only be included when the user&#39;s email has been verified, and the claim value should reflect the actual verification status. Similarly, optional profile fields like <code>middle_name</code> or <code>website</code> should be omitted entirely when not present in the user profile, rather than returned with null values.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Claim Filtering Rule</th>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Behavior</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Standard Claim Present</td>\n<td>User profile contains claim value</td>\n<td>Include claim in response</td>\n<td><code>&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Smith&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard Claim Missing</td>\n<td>User profile lacks claim value</td>\n<td>Omit claim from response</td>\n<td><code>middle_name</code> not included</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Verification Claim</td>\n<td>Depends on verification status</td>\n<td>Include with boolean value</td>\n<td><code>&quot;email_verified&quot;: true</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope Not Granted</td>\n<td>Scope not in access token</td>\n<td>Omit all associated claims</td>\n<td>Email claims omitted without <code>email</code> scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Claim Present</td>\n<td>Custom scope granted and data exists</td>\n<td>Include claim in response</td>\n<td><code>&quot;employee_id&quot;: &quot;EMP123&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The filtering algorithm must process scopes in a specific order to ensure consistent results across different request patterns. First, extract all granted scopes from the access token&#39;s <code>scope</code> claim and validate that each scope is recognized by the system. Then, build the union of all claim names associated with the granted scopes. Finally, retrieve user profile data and include only those claims that appear in both the authorized claim set and the user&#39;s actual profile data.</p>\n<p>Error handling in scope-to-claims mapping focuses on graceful degradation rather than request failure. If a custom scope refers to a non-existent claim field, the system should log the configuration error but continue processing other valid claims. If the user profile is missing optional standard claims, the response simply omits those claims. Only severe errors like database connectivity failures or access token corruption should result in request failure.</p>\n<p>The mapping system must support <strong>nested claims</strong> for complex data structures like addresses. The OIDC <code>address</code> scope maps to a single <code>address</code> claim containing a structured object with fields like <code>street_address</code>, <code>locality</code>, <code>region</code>, <code>postal_code</code>, and <code>country</code>. Our implementation must handle these nested structures correctly while applying the same filtering principles to sub-claims within the nested object.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Scope-to-claims mapping serves as a privacy-by-design mechanism that ensures users receive granular control over their data sharing. By mapping abstract scope names to specific claim sets, users can make informed consent decisions without needing to understand technical details about API fields or database schemas. This abstraction layer protects user privacy while providing developers with predictable data access patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Performance optimization for scope mapping centers around <strong>mapping cache efficiency</strong> and <strong>user data retrieval patterns</strong>. Since scope-to-claims mappings change rarely (especially standard OIDC mappings), aggressive caching provides significant performance benefits. However, custom scope mappings may change more frequently and require cache invalidation strategies. The system should cache mapping results at the application level while maintaining the ability to refresh mappings without service restart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consent-persistence-and-management-storing-and-managing-user-authorization-decisions\">Consent Persistence and Management: Storing and Managing User Authorization Decisions</h3>\n<p><strong>Consent persistence</strong> transforms ephemeral user authorization decisions into durable access control policies that can be enforced across multiple API interactions. When a user clicks &quot;Allow&quot; on a consent screen, that decision must be recorded, indexed, tracked, and made revocable to provide users with meaningful control over their data sharing. The consent management system bridges the gap between one-time authorization flows and ongoing data access patterns.</p>\n<p>The <code>ConsentRecord</code> data model captures the essential elements of a user&#39;s authorization decision in a way that supports both access control enforcement and user privacy management. Each consent record represents a specific user&#39;s decision to grant specific scopes to a specific client application at a specific point in time. This granular approach allows users to make different decisions for different applications while maintaining precise audit trails.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ConsentRecord Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>UserID</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Links consent to specific user</td>\n<td>&quot;user_123456&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ClientID</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Links consent to specific client application</td>\n<td>&quot;client_abc789&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Scope</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Space-separated list of granted scopes</td>\n<td>&quot;openid profile email&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GrantedAt</code></td>\n<td>time.Time</td>\n<td>When user initially granted consent</td>\n<td>&quot;2024-01-15T10:30:00Z&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastUsedAt</code></td>\n<td>*time.Time</td>\n<td>Most recent access using this consent</td>\n<td>&quot;2024-01-15T14:22:00Z&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ExpiresAt</code></td>\n<td>*time.Time</td>\n<td>Optional consent expiration time</td>\n<td>&quot;2024-07-15T10:30:00Z&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Revoked</code></td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Whether user has revoked this consent</td>\n<td>false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RevokedAt</code></td>\n<td>*time.Time</td>\n<td>When consent was revoked (if applicable)</td>\n<td>null</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Consent record storage must support <strong>efficient lookups</strong> for multiple access patterns. During authorization flows, the system needs to quickly determine whether a user has previously consented to specific scopes for a specific client. During UserInfo requests, the system needs to validate that the current access token corresponds to valid, non-revoked consent. During user privacy management, the system needs to retrieve all consent records for a specific user across all client applications.</p>\n<p>The consent checking algorithm runs during authorization flows to determine whether the consent screen should be displayed or skipped. If a user is requesting scopes they&#39;ve previously granted to the same client application, and that consent hasn&#39;t been revoked or expired, the system can skip the consent screen and proceed directly to authorization code generation. However, if the client requests any new scopes beyond those previously granted, the consent screen must be displayed to capture the user&#39;s decision on the additional permissions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Consent Check Scenario</th>\n<th>Existing Consent</th>\n<th>New Request</th>\n<th>Behavior</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact Match</td>\n<td><code>openid profile email</code></td>\n<td><code>openid profile email</code></td>\n<td>Skip consent screen</td>\n<td>User already authorized these exact scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subset Request</td>\n<td><code>openid profile email</code></td>\n<td><code>openid profile</code></td>\n<td>Skip consent screen</td>\n<td>Requesting fewer permissions than previously granted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Superset Request</td>\n<td><code>openid profile</code></td>\n<td><code>openid profile email</code></td>\n<td>Show consent screen</td>\n<td>New <code>email</code> scope requires additional consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial Overlap</td>\n<td><code>openid profile</code></td>\n<td><code>openid email</code></td>\n<td>Show consent screen</td>\n<td>Mixed of old and new scopes requires re-consent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No Previous Consent</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>openid profile</code></td>\n<td>Show consent screen</td>\n<td>First-time authorization requires consent</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Consent expiration</strong> provides a mechanism for implementing organizational policies around consent freshness while respecting user privacy preferences. Some organizations require re-consent every 12 months for compliance reasons, while others prefer persistent consent until explicitly revoked. Our system supports optional expiration through the <code>ExpiresAt</code> field, allowing administrators to configure consent lifetime policies per client application or globally.</p>\n<p>Consent revocation must be <strong>immediately effective</strong> across all system components. When a user revokes consent for a client application, several things must happen atomically: the consent record is marked as revoked, any active refresh tokens for that client/user combination are invalidated, and future authorization requests for that client must display the consent screen regardless of previous consent history. This immediate revocation ensures that users maintain meaningful control over their data sharing.</p>\n<p>The consent management interface provides users with visibility and control over their authorization decisions. Users must be able to view all client applications they&#39;ve authorized, see what scopes each application was granted, review when each authorization occurred and was last used, and revoke consent for any application at any time.

Aggregate metrics like consent grant rates, revocation patterns, and scope popularity can inform UX improvements and policy decisions. However, these analytics must be implemented carefully to avoid creating privacy risks through detailed user behavior tracking.</p>\n<p>The consent persistence layer must handle <strong>concurrent modifications</strong> gracefully when multiple authorization flows occur simultaneously for the same user-client combination. Database-level constraints and optimistic locking prevent race conditions that could result in inconsistent consent states. If two authorization flows attempt to create consent records simultaneously, one should succeed while the other should detect the existing consent and proceed accordingly.</p>\n<p>Integration with the authorization endpoint requires careful coordination between consent checking, consent screen display, and consent record creation. The authorization flow must atomically create or update consent records during successful authorization to ensure that subsequent requests can benefit from the stored consent decision. Failure to persist consent decisions results in users facing repeated consent prompts, creating poor user experience and consent fatigue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Consent persistence transforms user authorization from a one-time authentication event into an ongoing privacy management relationship.

Developers might implement a simple &quot;return all user profile data&quot; approach without properly filtering based on access token scopes, inadvertently exposing sensitive information that users never consented to share.</p>\n<p>This mistake typically occurs when developers focus on JWT validation but skip the crucial scope-to-claims mapping step. The access token might be cryptographically valid and non-expired, but if it only contains the <code>openid profile</code> scopes, returning email addresses or phone numbers violates the user&#39;s consent decision and potentially breaches privacy regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Always implement scope-based filtering as a mandatory step in UserInfo response generation. Start with an empty claims object, then add only those claims that correspond to granted scopes. Never use user profile data as the starting point and filter out unauthorized claims - this approach is error-prone and may accidentally leak data during implementation changes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Caching UserInfo Responses Without Considering Consent Revocation</strong></p>\n<p>Aggressive caching of UserInfo responses can create a significant security vulnerability where revoked consent doesn&#39;t take effect immediately. If the system caches complete UserInfo responses for performance, a user&#39;s consent revocation might not prevent continued data access until the cache expires, potentially violating the user&#39;s privacy expectations and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>This problem is particularly severe when cache TTL values are set too high or when cache invalidation doesn&#39;t account for consent changes. A user might revoke a client&#39;s access and expect immediate effect, but cached responses could continue serving their profile data for minutes or hours after revocation.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Never cache complete UserInfo responses containing actual user profile data. Instead, cache only the expensive operations like JWT validation and revocation checking. Implement cache invalidation triggers that immediately clear relevant cached data when consent records are modified or tokens are revoked.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Consent Checking Logic Between Authorization and UserInfo</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing different consent validation logic in the authorization endpoint versus the UserInfo endpoint creates subtle security gaps where tokens issued under one set of rules are validated under different rules. This inconsistency might allow access tokens to be used for data access even when the underlying consent has been modified or revoked.</p>\n<p>The problem typically manifests when the authorization endpoint creates consent records in one format but the UserInfo endpoint expects a different format, or when consent checking algorithms diverge between components due to separate development or different developers implementing different parts of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Centralize consent checking logic in a shared service that both the authorization endpoint and UserInfo endpoint use. Ensure that consent record creation, validation, and revocation follow identical business rules across all system components. Implement comprehensive integration tests that verify consistent behavior between authorization and data access flows.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Exposing Internal User IDs in UserInfo Responses</strong></p>\n<p>The OIDC <code>sub</code> claim should contain a <strong>stable, unique identifier</strong> for the user that&#39;s specific to the client application, not the internal database primary key or user ID used within the identity provider system. Exposing internal user IDs creates privacy risks and potential security vulnerabilities if those IDs are used in other system contexts.</p>\n<p>Many developers mistakenly use the same user ID across all client applications, which enables cross-application user correlation and violates privacy principles. Different client applications should receive different <code>sub</code> claim values for the same user to prevent tracking across applications.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Generate client-specific subject identifiers using a one-way hash of the internal user ID and client ID. This approach ensures that each client receives a unique, stable identifier for each user while preventing cross-client correlation. Store these pairwise pseudonymous identifiers if consistent values are required across multiple token issuances.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Failing to Handle Missing or Unverified Claims Appropriately</strong></p>\n<p>When user profile data is incomplete or unverified, the UserInfo endpoint must handle missing claims correctly according to OIDC specifications. Simply returning null values or empty strings for missing claims can break client application logic that expects either valid data or complete omission of the claim.</p>\n<p>Verification status claims like <code>email_verified</code> must reflect actual verification state rather than defaulting to false or being omitted when verification status is unknown. Client applications rely on these verification claims to make security decisions about user authentication strength.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Omit claims entirely from UserInfo responses when the corresponding user profile data is missing or null. For verification claims, include them only when verification status is definitively known, and set the value to reflect actual verification state. Document clearly which claims are optional and may be omitted based on user profile completeness.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Consent Screen Information for User Decision Making</strong></p>\n<p>Consent screens that display only scope names like &quot;profile&quot; and &quot;email&quot; without explaining what specific information will be shared leave users unable to make informed decisions about their data sharing. Users can&#39;t meaningfully consent when they don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re authorizing.</p>\n<p>Generic consent screens that don&#39;t identify the specific client application requesting access or that fail to explain how the data will be used prevent users from making contextual privacy decisions. The same scopes might be appropriate for one application but inappropriate for another based on the application&#39;s purpose and trustworthiness.</p>\n<p><strong>How to avoid</strong>: Design consent screens that clearly identify the requesting client application, explain in plain language what information each scope provides access to, and when possible, include information about how the client intends to use the data. Provide scope descriptions that are meaningful to non-technical users, such as &quot;Access your name and profile picture&quot; rather than just &quot;profile scope&quot;.</p>\n<h3

milestones (1-4), showing how the individual components work together in complete OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-airport-security-system\">Mental Model: Airport Security System</h3>\n<p>Think of the OAuth2 provider&#39;s interactions like a comprehensive airport security system. The authorization code grant flow is like checking in for a flight - you present your ID (authentication), get a boarding pass (authorization code), then exchange it at the gate for actual access to the plane (access token). The refresh token flow is like a frequent flyer program - you have a special card that lets you get new boarding passes without going through the full check-in process again. The client credentials flow is like airline staff accessing restricted areas - they have special badges that grant direct access without passenger processing. The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint is like the airport information desk - it tells everyone where to find all the different services and what procedures to follow.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps us understand that OAuth2 isn&#39;t just about individual components, but about orchestrated workflows that move users and applications through a secure, standardized process. Each flow has different security requirements, different participants, and different success criteria, just like different types of airport access have different procedures and verification steps.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that these flows are <strong>state machines with cryptographic checkpoints</strong>. Each step validates the previous step&#39;s output and produces cryptographically bound artifacts for the next step. This creates an audit trail and prevents attackers from skipping steps or replaying old interactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authorization-code-grant-flow\">Authorization Code Grant Flow</h3>\n<p>The <strong>authorization code grant flow</strong> represents the gold standard for OAuth2 security, designed specifically for web applications that can securely store credentials. This flow implements the principle of <strong>least privilege</strong> by separating the authorization decision (made by the user) from the token issuance (handled by the authorization server), while ensuring that sensitive tokens never pass through potentially insecure channels like browser redirects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fauthorization-code-flow-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Authorization Code Grant Flow\"></p>\n<p>The flow consists of six distinct phases, each with specific security properties and failure modes. Understanding the purpose and implementation of each phase is crucial for building a secure OAuth2 provider.</p>\n<h4 id=\"phase-1-client-redirect-and-parameter-validation\">Phase 1: Client Redirect and Parameter Validation</h4>\n<p>The flow begins when the client application redirects the resource owner (user) to the authorization endpoint. This redirect carries several critical parameters that must be validated before proceeding. The client constructs an authorization URL containing the client identifier, requested scopes, redirect URI, state parameter for CSRF protection, and PKCE code challenge for additional security.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Validation Rules</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Identifies the requesting application</td>\n<td>Must match registered client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>redirect_uri</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Where to send the authorization response</td>\n<td>Must exactly match registered URI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Permissions being requested</td>\n<td>Must be subset of client&#39;s allowed scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>state</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>CSRF protection token</td>\n<td>Must be cryptographically random</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge</code></td>\n<td>Yes (PKCE)</td>\n<td>SHA256 hash of code verifier</td>\n<td>Must be valid base64url encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge_method</code></td>\n<td>Yes (PKCE)</td>\n<td>Hash algorithm used</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;S256&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>response_type</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Type of response expected</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;code&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server receives this request and immediately begins a multi-step validation process. First, it validates the client_id by looking up the client registration in the <code>ClientStore</code>. If the client doesn&#39;t exist, the server responds with an <code>ErrorInvalidClient</code> directly to the user (not via redirect) since we cannot trust the redirect_uri without a valid client.</p>\n<p>Once the client is validated, the server performs redirect URI validation using exact string matching. This is a critical security control - partial matches or pattern matching can lead to authorization code interception attacks. The redirect_uri in the request must exactly match one of the URIs registered for the client during the registration process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Insight</strong>: Redirect URI validation is the primary defense against authorization code interception. An attacker who registers a malicious application cannot steal authorization codes intended for legitimate applications because they cannot predict or control the exact redirect URI that legitimate applications will use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The server also validates the requested scopes to ensure they are a subset of the scopes the client is authorized to request. Scope validation prevents privilege escalation attacks where a client might attempt to request more permissions than originally granted during registration.</p>\n<h4 id=\"phase-2-pkce-code-challenge-processing\">Phase 2: PKCE Code Challenge Processing</h4>\n<p><strong>Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</strong> adds an additional layer of security specifically designed to protect against authorization code interception attacks, particularly relevant for mobile and single-page applications but recommended for all OAuth2 clients as a defense-in-depth measure.</p>\n<p>The PKCE flow requires the client to generate a cryptographically random <code>code_verifier</code> (43-128 characters, base64url-encoded) and derive a <code>code_challenge</code> by applying SHA256 hashing and base64url encoding. The client sends only the code_challenge in the authorization request, keeping the code_verifier secret until the token exchange phase.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>PKCE Component</th>\n<th>Generation Method</th>\n<th>Security Property</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>code_verifier</code></td>\n<td>Cryptographically random 43-128 chars</td>\n<td>High entropy, unpredictable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge</code></td>\n<td>SHA256(code_verifier), base64url encoded</td>\n<td>One-way function, tamper evident</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_challenge_method</code></td>\n<td>Always &quot;S256&quot;</td>\n<td>Specifies hash algorithm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server stores the code_challenge alongside the generated authorization code, creating a cryptographic binding between the authorization request and the eventual token request. This binding ensures that only the client that initiated the authorization flow can complete it, even if an attacker intercepts the authorization code during the redirect.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>PKCE Security Flow:\n1. Client generates random code_verifier: &quot;dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk&quot;\n2. Client computes code_challenge: SHA256(code_verifier) → base64url encode\n3. Authorization server stores code_challenge with authorization code\n4. Attacker intercepts authorization code but lacks code_verifier\n5. Token request fails PKCE validation without correct code_verifier</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-3-user-authentication-and-consent\">Phase 3: User Authentication and Consent</h4>\n<p>After parameter validation, the authorization server must authenticate the resource owner and obtain their consent for the requested access. This phase typically involves redirecting the user to a login page (if not already authenticated) followed by a consent screen that clearly displays what the client application is requesting.</p>\n<p>The consent screen serves multiple security and usability purposes. It provides <strong>informed consent</strong> by showing the user exactly what permissions they are granting, to which application, and for what purpose. It also serves as a <strong>phishing detection</strong> mechanism - legitimate consent screens will accurately display the client application&#39;s registered name and icon, while phishing attempts often contain obvious discrepancies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Consent Screen Element</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Consideration</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client Name</td>\n<td>Identifies the requesting application</td>\n<td>Must match registered name exactly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Icon/Logo</td>\n<td>Visual identification</td>\n<td>Should be displayed consistently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Requested Scopes</td>\n<td>Shows specific permissions</td>\n<td>Must use clear, non-technical language</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope Descriptions</td>\n<td>Explains what each permission allows</td>\n<td>Should be specific, not vague</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Allow/Deny Buttons</td>\n<td>Captures user decision</td>\n<td>Must be equally prominent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Information</td>\n<td>Shows who is granting consent</td>\n<td>Prevents confused deputy attacks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The consent mechanism also implements <strong>consent persistence</strong> to improve user experience. If a user has previously granted the same scopes to the same client, the authorization server can skip the consent screen and proceed directly to authorization code generation, unless the client explicitly requests re-consent or additional scopes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: Consent screens should optimize for <strong>informed decision-making</strong> rather than conversion rates. Users need sufficient information to make security decisions, even if this occasionally results in denied requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"phase-4-authorization-code-generation-and-binding\">Phase 4: Authorization Code Generation and Binding</h4>\n<p>Upon receiving user consent, the authorization server generates a cryptographically secure authorization code and binds it to the specific authorization request parameters. This binding is crucial for preventing various attack scenarios including authorization code replay, client substitution, and parameter modification attacks.</p>\n<p>The <code>AuthorizationCode</code> structure captures all the essential binding information:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Binding</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Code</code></td>\n<td>The authorization code itself</td>\n<td>Cryptographically random, 128+ bits entropy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ClientID</code></td>\n<td>Which client can use this code</td>\n<td>Prevents cross-client code usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UserID</code></td>\n<td>Which user granted consent</td>\n<td>Prevents user substitution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>RedirectURI</code></td>\n<td>Where the response should go</td>\n<td>Prevents redirect attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Scope</code></td>\n<td>What permissions were granted</td>\n<td>Prevents scope elevation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CodeChallenge</code></td>\n<td>PKCE challenge for verification</td>\n<td>Prevents code interception</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ExpiresAt</code></td>\n<td>When the code becomes invalid</td>\n<td>Limits attack window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Used</code></td>\n<td>Whether code has been exchanged</td>\n<td>Prevents replay attacks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Authorization codes must be <strong>single-use</strong> and <strong>short-lived</strong> (maximum 10 minutes, recommended 5 minutes). The short lifetime limits the window of opportunity for interception attacks, while single-use prevents replay attacks even if an attacker obtains a valid code.</p>\n<p>The authorization server generates the code using a cryptographically secure random number generator with at least 128 bits of entropy. The code should be base64url encoded to ensure safe transmission through URL parameters without requiring additional encoding.</p>\n<h4 id=\"phase-5-authorization-response-and-redirect\">Phase 5: Authorization Response and Redirect</h4>\n<p>After generating the authorization code, the authorization server constructs the authorization response and redirects the user back to the client application. This redirect carries the authorization code and the state parameter, allowing the client to continue the flow and verify that the response corresponds to its original request.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Parameter</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Validation by Client</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>code</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>The authorization code</td>\n<td>Store securely for token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>state</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>CSRF protection token</td>\n<td>Must match original request</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The redirect uses HTTP 302 status with the authorization code and state appended as query parameters to the registered redirect_uri. The client application receives this redirect and immediately validates the state parameter to ensure the response corresponds to its original authorization request, providing protection against CSRF attacks.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Successful Authorization Response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://client.example.com/callback?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&amp;state=af0ifjsldkj\n\nError Authorization Response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://client.example.com/callback?error=access_denied&amp;error_description=User+denied+access&amp;state=af0ifjsldkj</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If the user denies consent or an error occurs during processing, the authorization server redirects back to the client with an error parameter instead of an authorization code. This allows the client application to handle the denial gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback.</p>\n<h4 id=\"phase-6-authorization-code-exchange-for-tokens\">Phase 6: Authorization Code Exchange for Tokens</h4>\n<p>The final phase occurs when the client exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens at the token endpoint. This exchange happens server-to-server, providing confidentiality and allowing for strong client authentication.</p>\n<p>The token request must include several parameters that are validated against the stored authorization code:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Request Parameter</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Validation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>grant_type</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;authorization_code&quot;</td>\n<td>Specifies the grant type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>The authorization code</td>\n<td>Must exist and be unused</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>redirect_uri</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Must match original request</td>\n<td>Prevents parameter modification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>code_verifier</code></td>\n<td>Yes (PKCE)</td>\n<td>Proves client identity</td>\n<td>Must hash to stored challenge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Client authentication</td>\n<td>Must match code binding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret</code></td>\n<td>Yes (confidential)</td>\n<td>Client authentication</td>\n<td>Must be valid for client</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server performs comprehensive validation of the token request:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Client Authentication</strong>: Verify the client credentials using the registered authentication method (client_secret_basic or client_secret_post)</li>\n<li><strong>Authorization Code Validation</strong>: Confirm the code exists, hasn&#39;t been used, and hasn&#39;t expired</li>\n<li><strong>Parameter Binding Validation</strong>: Ensure the redirect_uri matches the original authorization request</li>\n<li><strong>PKCE Verification</strong>: Hash the code_verifier and compare against the stored code_challenge</li>\n<li><strong>Client Binding Validation</strong>: Confirm the requesting client matches the client for whom the code was issued</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon successful validation, the authorization server issues an access token and refresh token, marks the authorization code as used, and returns the token response to the client.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Authorization Code Single-Use Enforcement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Authorization codes could theoretically be reused multiple times until expiration</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Allow multiple uses until expiration</li>\n<li>Single-use with immediate invalidation</li>\n<li>Limited number of uses (e.g., 3 attempts)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Single-use with immediate invalidation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Single-use provides the strongest security posture by eliminating replay attack windows and simplifying the security model. The OAuth2 specification recommends single-use, and the marginal complexity of handling client retry scenarios is outweighed by the security benefits.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clients must implement proper error handling for network failures during token exchange, but the overall system security is significantly improved with no additional complexity in the authorization server.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"refresh-token-flow\">Refresh Token Flow</h3>\n<p>The <strong>refresh token flow</strong> provides a secure mechanism for clients to obtain new access tokens without requiring user interaction. This flow is essential for maintaining long-term access to protected resources while preserving the security principle of short-lived access tokens.</p>\n<p>The refresh token flow implements <strong>token rotation</strong> as a key security feature. Each time a refresh token is used, the authorization server issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one. This rotation provides forward security and enables detection of token theft through the identification of refresh token reuse attempts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-subscription-renewal-system\">Mental Model: Subscription Renewal System</h4>\n<p>Think of refresh tokens like magazine subscriptions with automatic renewal cards. You get an initial subscription (access token) that expires after a short period, but you also receive a renewal card (refresh token) that lets you extend your subscription. Each time you use the renewal card, you get a new subscription period and a new renewal card, while the old renewal card becomes invalid. If someone steals your old renewal card and tries to use it, the magazine company knows something suspicious is happening because that card should no longer exist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"token-family-tracking-and-rotation-security\">Token Family Tracking and Rotation Security</h4>\n<p>Refresh tokens are organized into <strong>token families</strong> that track the lineage of refresh token rotations. Each token family has a unique identifier that remains constant across all refresh token rotations within that authorization grant. This family tracking enables sophisticated security features like breach detection and family-wide revocation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Family Concept</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TokenFamily</code> ID</td>\n<td>Groups related refresh tokens</td>\n<td>Enables family-wide operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ParentToken</code> reference</td>\n<td>Tracks rotation lineage</td>\n<td>Detects unauthorized reuse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Family revocation</td>\n<td>Invalidates entire token family</td>\n<td>Limits breach impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotation audit log</td>\n<td>Records all token usage</td>\n<td>Enables forensic analysis</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When a refresh token is used legitimately, the following sequence occurs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Client presents refresh token to token endpoint</li>\n<li>Authorization server validates the token and checks revocation status</li>\n<li>Server generates new access token with fresh expiration</li>\n<li>Server generates new refresh token in the same family</li>\n<li>Server marks the old refresh token as used/revoked</li>\n<li>Server updates the parent-child relationship in the token family</li>\n<li>Server returns new tokens to the client</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The critical security feature is <strong>breach detection through reuse identification</strong>. If an attacker obtains a refresh token that has already been rotated, their attempt to use the old token triggers a security alert. The authorization server can then revoke the entire token family, preventing the attacker from using any tokens while forcing the legitimate client to re-authenticate.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Normal Rotation Sequence:\nRT1 (active) → exchange → RT2 (active), RT1 (revoked)\nRT2 (active) → exchange → RT3 (active), RT2 (revoked)\n\nBreach Detection Scenario:\nRT2 (revoked) → reuse attempt → SECURITY ALERT: revoke entire family\nLegitimate client with RT3 → next exchange fails → re-authentication required</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"refresh-token-request-processing\">Refresh Token Request Processing</h4>\n<p>The refresh token exchange follows a structured validation process that ensures both security and correctness. The client makes a POST request to the token endpoint with the refresh token grant type.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Refresh Request Parameter</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Validation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>grant_type</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;refresh_token&quot;</td>\n<td>Specifies grant type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>refresh_token</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>The current refresh token</td>\n<td>Must be valid and not revoked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Requested scope (subset)</td>\n<td>Must not exceed original grant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Client identification</td>\n<td>Must match token binding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret</code></td>\n<td>Yes (confidential)</td>\n<td>Client authentication</td>\n<td>Must be valid for client</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server processes the refresh token request through several validation phases:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Token Format and Existence Validation</strong>\nThe server first validates that the refresh token exists in the <code>RefreshTokenStore</code> and retrieves its associated metadata. This includes checking the token&#39;s format, ensuring it hasn&#39;t been marked as revoked, and confirming it hasn&#39;t exceeded its maximum lifetime.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Client Authentication and Binding Validation</strong>\nThe server authenticates the client using the provided credentials and verifies that the refresh token was originally issued to this client. This prevents clients from using refresh tokens issued to other clients, even if they somehow obtain them.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Token Family and Lineage Validation</strong>\nThe server checks the token&#39;s position in its token family and verifies that it represents the current active token in the family lineage. This is where breach detection occurs - if the token has already been rotated (has a child token), the server knows this is likely a replay attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 4: Scope Validation and Filtering</strong>\nIf the client requests specific scopes in the refresh request, the server validates that these scopes are a subset of the originally granted scopes. This prevents scope elevation attacks where a client might attempt to gain additional permissions during token refresh.</p>\n<h4 id=\"token-rotation-implementation\">Token Rotation Implementation</h4>\n<p>Upon successful validation, the authorization server performs the token rotation process that maintains security while providing the client with fresh credentials.</p>\n<p>The rotation process follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Generate New Access Token</strong>: Create a fresh JWT access token with updated expiration time and the same user/client/scope binding as the original grant</li>\n<li><strong>Generate New Refresh Token</strong>: Create a new refresh token in the same token family, setting the current token as its parent</li>\n<li><strong>Update Token Family State</strong>: Mark the old refresh token as used and establish the parent-child relationship</li>\n<li><strong>Persist State Changes</strong>: Atomically commit all state changes to prevent inconsistencies</li>\n<li><strong>Return Token Response</strong>: Provide the new tokens to the client in standard OAuth2 format</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The atomic persistence of state changes is crucial for preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency. If multiple refresh requests arrive simultaneously (due to network retries or client bugs), only one should succeed while others should fail gracefully.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Response Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Value Source</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>access_token</code></td>\n<td>New JWT access token</td>\n<td>Freshly generated with updated expiration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_type</code></td>\n<td>Always &quot;Bearer&quot;</td>\n<td>OAuth2 standard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expires_in</code></td>\n<td>Access token lifetime in seconds</td>\n<td>From JWT expiration claim</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>refresh_token</code></td>\n<td>New refresh token</td>\n<td>Generated in same family as replaced token</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>Granted scopes</td>\n<td>From original authorization or filtered request</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"refresh-token-lifetime-and-management\">Refresh Token Lifetime and Management</h4>\n<p>Refresh tokens have significantly longer lifetimes than access tokens, typically ranging from days to months depending on the security requirements and user experience goals. However, they are not unlimited in duration and must eventually expire to limit the impact of undetected breaches.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Refresh Token Attribute</th>\n<th>Typical Value</th>\n<th>Security Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Maximum lifetime</td>\n<td>30-90 days</td>\n<td>Balances convenience with security exposure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotation frequency</td>\n<td>Every access token refresh</td>\n<td>Provides forward security</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Family size limit</td>\n<td>10-20 tokens</td>\n<td>Prevents unbounded growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revocation propagation</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Ensures consistent security state</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server implements <strong>refresh token cleanup</strong> processes that remove expired tokens and their associated metadata. This cleanup is essential for preventing database growth and ensuring that old, potentially compromised tokens cannot be misused even if storage security is breached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: Refresh token rotation should be transparent to well-behaved clients while making token theft immediately detectable and automatically mitigated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"client-credentials-flow\">Client Credentials Flow</h3>\n<p>The <strong>client credentials flow</strong> provides a streamlined authentication mechanism for machine-to-machine communication where no human user is involved. This flow is essential for service-to-service authentication, background jobs, and API integration scenarios where applications need to access resources based on their own identity rather than on behalf of a user.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-corporate-id-badge-system\">Mental Model: Corporate ID Badge System</h4>\n<p>Think of the client credentials flow like a corporate ID badge system for employees accessing different buildings or systems. An employee (client application) presents their company-issued badge (client credentials) to a security reader (authorization server), which immediately grants or denies access based on the badge&#39;s validity and the employee&#39;s clearance level. There&#39;s no additional approval process or human intervention - the badge itself contains all the necessary authorization information.</p>\n<p>This analogy helps illustrate why the client credentials flow is both simpler and more restrictive than user-centric flows. The badge (client credentials) represents the application&#39;s inherent permissions rather than delegated user permissions, and access is immediate rather than requiring consent or multi-step validation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-authentication-methods\">Client Authentication Methods</h4>\n<p>The client credentials flow supports multiple authentication methods, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best fits their security requirements and infrastructure capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Authentication Method</th>\n<th>Security Level</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>client_secret_basic</code></td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Traditional web services</td>\n<td>HTTP Basic authentication with client_id:client_secret</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret_post</code></td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>APIs that can&#39;t use Basic auth</td>\n<td>client_id and client_secret in request body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret_jwt</code></td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>High-security environments</td>\n<td>JWT signed with shared secret</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>private_key_jwt</code></td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>Zero-shared-secret requirements</td>\n<td>JWT signed with client&#39;s private key</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>HTTP Basic Authentication</strong> represents the most common implementation, where the client encodes its client_id and client_secret as a Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header. This method provides reasonable security when used over HTTPS but requires secure storage of the client secret.</p>\n<p><strong>POST Body Authentication</strong> offers an alternative for clients that cannot easily set HTTP headers or prefer to send credentials in the request body. While functionally equivalent to Basic authentication, this method may be preferred in certain API gateway or proxy configurations.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Authentication Methods</strong> provide enhanced security by eliminating the need to transmit secrets directly. In <code>client_secret_jwt</code>, the client creates a JWT assertion signed with its registered secret, while <code>private_key_jwt</code> uses asymmetric cryptography to eliminate shared secrets entirely.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-credentials-request-processing\">Client Credentials Request Processing</h4>\n<p>The client credentials flow follows a simplified request-response pattern that bypasses user authentication and consent while maintaining rigorous client authentication and authorization validation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Request Parameter</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Validation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>grant_type</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;client_credentials&quot;</td>\n<td>Specifies the grant type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Requested permissions</td>\n<td>Must be subset of client&#39;s allowed scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Client identification</td>\n<td>Must match authenticated client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret</code></td>\n<td>Conditional</td>\n<td>Client authentication</td>\n<td>Required for secret-based auth methods</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The authorization server processes client credentials requests through a focused validation pipeline:</p>\n<p><strong>Client Authentication</strong>: The server authenticates the client using the provided credentials and the client&#39;s registered authentication method. This authentication must be successful before any authorization decisions are made.</p>\n<p><strong>Grant Type Authorization</strong>: The server verifies that the client is authorized to use the client credentials grant type. Not all registered clients should be permitted to use this flow - it should be restricted to applications with legitimate machine-to-machine access requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope Validation</strong>: If the client requests specific scopes, the server validates that these scopes are within the client&#39;s pre-authorized scope set. Unlike user-centric flows, there is no dynamic consent process - all permissions must be pre-configured during client registration.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Generation</strong>: Upon successful validation, the server generates an access token that represents the client&#39;s identity and authorized scopes. No refresh token is typically issued since clients can re-authenticate using their credentials whenever needed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-scoped-access-tokens\">Client-Scoped Access Tokens</h4>\n<p>Access tokens issued through the client credentials flow have different characteristics than user-delegated tokens. These tokens represent the client application&#39;s inherent permissions rather than user-granted permissions, and their claims structure reflects this distinction.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>JWT Claim</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Client Credentials Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sub</code></td>\n<td>Subject identifier</td>\n<td>Client ID or client-specific identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>aud</code></td>\n<td>Intended audience</td>\n<td>Resource server(s) the token is valid for</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iss</code></td>\n<td>Token issuer</td>\n<td>Authorization server identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exp</code></td>\n<td>Expiration time</td>\n<td>Typically shorter than user tokens (1-24 hours)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>iat</code></td>\n<td>Issued at time</td>\n<td>Current timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scope</code></td>\n<td>Granted permissions</td>\n<td>Client&#39;s authorized scopes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_id</code></td>\n<td>Client identifier</td>\n<td>Explicitly identifies the client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>token_type</code></td>\n<td>Token classification</td>\n<td>&quot;client_credentials&quot; or similar</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The absence of user-related claims (like user ID or user profile information) clearly indicates that these tokens represent application-level access rather than user-delegated access. Resource servers can use this distinction to apply different authorization policies for machine-to-machine access versus user-initiated access.</p>\n<h4 id=\"security-considerations-for-machine-to-machine-access\">Security Considerations for Machine-to-Machine Access</h4>\n<p>Client credentials flows require careful security consideration because they bypass many of the user-centric protections built into other OAuth2 flows. Applications using this flow have persistent, programmatic access to resources without human oversight, making security breaches potentially more severe and harder to detect.</p>\n<p><strong>Credential Rotation</strong>: Client credentials should be rotated regularly to limit the impact of credential compromise. Unlike user passwords, client credentials are typically stored in configuration files or environment variables, making them vulnerable to different types of attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope Minimization</strong>: Clients should be granted only the minimum scopes necessary for their legitimate functions. Since there is no user consent process to limit scope abuse, pre-authorization during client registration becomes the primary access control mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Audit Logging</strong>: All client credentials usage should be logged for security monitoring and compliance purposes. These logs should capture which client accessed what resources when, enabling detection of unusual patterns or potential abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Security</strong>: Client credentials flows assume secure transport (HTTPS) and may benefit from additional network-level protections like API gateways, IP allowlisting, or mutual TLS authentication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Refresh Token Omission in Client Credentials Flow</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Client credentials flow could issue refresh tokens for consistency with other flows</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Issue refresh tokens with rotation</li>\n<li>Omit refresh tokens, require re-authentication</li>\n<li>Make refresh token issuance configurable per client</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Omit refresh tokens by default</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Clients can re-authenticate using their credentials anytime, eliminating the complexity of refresh token management without significant usability impact. This also reduces the attack surface by eliminating long-lived tokens that could be compromised.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clients must handle access token expiration by re-authenticating, but this is typically automated and transparent to users. Security is improved by eliminating persistent tokens.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"openid-connect-discovery\">OpenID Connect Discovery</h3>\n<p><strong>OpenID Connect Discovery</strong> provides a standardized mechanism for clients to automatically discover the endpoints, capabilities, and configuration of an OpenID Connect provider. This discovery mechanism eliminates the need for manual configuration and enables dynamic client registration and endpoint resolution.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-airport-information-system\">Mental Model: Airport Information System</h4>\n<p>Think of OpenID Connect Discovery like the information systems at a major airport. When you arrive at an unfamiliar airport, you don&#39;t need to memorize the locations of every gate, restaurant, and service - instead, you consult the information displays and maps that tell you where everything is located. Similarly, OAuth2 clients don&#39;t need to have the authorization server&#39;s endpoints hard-coded - they can query the well-known discovery endpoint to learn about all available services, their locations, and their capabilities.</p>\n<p>This discovery system makes the OAuth2 ecosystem more dynamic and maintainable. Just as airports can relocate services or add new amenities without requiring travelers to update their personal navigation systems, authorization servers can change endpoints or add new features without breaking existing client integrations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"well-known-configuration-endpoint\">Well-Known Configuration Endpoint</h4>\n<p>The discovery process centers around the <strong>well-known configuration endpoint</strong>, which must be available at a standardized location relative to the authorization server&#39;s issuer identifier. This endpoint returns a JSON document containing comprehensive information about the provider&#39;s capabilities and endpoint locations.</p>\n<p>The well-known endpoint follows the pattern: <code>{issuer}/.well-known/openid_configuration</code></p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issuer: <code>https://auth.example.com</code></li>\n<li>Discovery endpoint: <code>https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid_configuration</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This standardized location allows clients to discover provider capabilities using only the issuer identifier, enabling truly dynamic configuration and reducing deployment complexity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"discovery-document-structure\">Discovery Document Structure</h4>\n<p>The discovery document contains extensive

This capability is particularly valuable in multi-tenant environments or when integrating with multiple identity providers.</p>\n<p>Client applications can use discovery information to:</p>\n<p><strong>Endpoint Resolution</strong>: Dynamically determine the correct URLs for authorization, token exchange, and user information requests without hard-coding endpoint locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Feature Detection</strong>: Check whether the provider supports specific features like PKCE, token introspection, or particular authentication methods before attempting to use them.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate cryptographic algorithms for token validation based on the provider&#39;s supported algorithm list.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope Discovery</strong>: Present users with accurate information about available permissions and claims based on the provider&#39;s capability declarations.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Dynamic Configuration Example:\n1. Client discovers provider supports [&quot;S256&quot;] for PKCE\n2. Client generates PKCE challenge using SHA256\n3. Client discovers authorization endpoint URL\n4. Client constructs authorization request with discovered endpoint\n5. Client discovers supported scopes and presents appropriate UI</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"jwks-endpoint-integration\">JWKS Endpoint Integration</h4>\n<p>The <strong>JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)</strong> endpoint provides cryptographic public keys that clients use to validate JWT tokens issued by the authorization server. The discovery document includes the <code>jwks_uri</code> field pointing to this endpoint, enabling automated key retrieval and rotation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>JWKS Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>keys</code></td>\n<td>Array of public keys</td>\n<td>JSON Web Key objects</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>kty</code></td>\n<td>Key type</td>\n<td>&quot;RSA&quot;, &quot;EC&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>use</code></td>\n<td>Key usage</td>\n<td>&quot;sig&quot; (signature)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>kid</code></td>\n<td>Key identifier</td>\n<td>&quot;2023-10-key-1&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>alg</code></td>\n<td>Algorithm</td>\n<td>&quot;RS256&quot;, &quot;ES256&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>n</code>, <code>e</code></td>\n<td>RSA public key components</td>\n<td>Base64url-encoded values</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Clients cache JWKS information but must handle key rotation gracefully. When token validation fails due to an unknown key ID, clients should refresh their JWKS cache and retry validation before concluding that the token is invalid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Static vs Dynamic JWKS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: JWKS endpoint could serve static keys or dynamically rotate keys</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Static keys with manual rotation procedures</li>\n<li>Dynamic rotation with cache invalidation</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with predictable rotation schedule</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Dynamic rotation with cache-friendly headers</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Dynamic key rotation provides better security through regular key renewal while cache headers (<code>Cache-Control: max-age=3600</code>) balance security with performance. Clients can cache keys safely while ensuring they detect rotations within a reasonable timeframe.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clients must implement JWKS caching and refresh logic, but overall system security is improved through automated key rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"caching-and-performance-considerations\">Caching and Performance Considerations</h4>\n<p>Discovery documents are relatively stable but may change when providers add new features, endpoints, or capabilities. Proper caching strategies balance the need for current information with performance and availability requirements.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cache Strategy</th>\n<th>Cache Duration</th>\n<th>Update Trigger</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Time-based</td>\n<td>1-24 hours</td>\n<td>Cache expiration</td>\n<td>General purpose caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ETag-based</td>\n<td>Until changed</td>\n<td>HTTP ETag mismatch</td>\n<td>Bandwidth optimization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure-tolerant</td>\n<td>Indefinite with refresh attempts</td>\n<td>Provider availability</td>\n<td>High availability scenarios</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Event-driven</td>\n<td>Until notified</td>\n<td>Provider notification</td>\n<td>Real-time updates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Clients should implement <strong>graceful degradation</strong> when discovery endpoints are unavailable. This might involve falling back to cached discovery documents or pre-configured endpoint information while continuing to attempt discovery refresh in the background.</p>\n<p>The discovery endpoint should return appropriate HTTP caching headers to guide client caching behavior:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>HTTP Response Headers for Discovery:\nCache-Control: public, max-age=3600\nETag: &quot;discovery-v1.2.3&quot;\nContent-Type: application/json</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>These headers indicate that the discovery document can be cached publicly for one hour and provide an ETag for efficient cache validation on subsequent requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Authorization Code Replay Attacks</strong>\nFailing to mark authorization codes as single-use allows attackers who intercept codes to replay them for token access. Always mark codes as used immediately upon successful exchange and reject any subsequent attempts to use the same code.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: PKCE Challenge Reuse</strong>\nStoring PKCE challenges without proper cleanup can lead to challenges being reused across multiple authorization attempts. Always bind PKCE challenges to specific authorization codes and clean them up when codes expire or are used.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Refresh Token Family Cleanup Failures</strong>\nNot properly cleaning up revoked refresh token families can lead to database bloat and potential security issues. Implement automated cleanup processes that remove expired and revoked tokens while maintaining audit trails.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Client Credentials Scope Elevation</strong>\nAllowing clients to request arbitrary scopes in client credentials flow bypasses the pre-authorization security model. Always validate that requested scopes are a subset of the client&#39;s registered allowed scopes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Discovery Document Staleness</strong>\nServing outdated discovery documents can break client integrations when endpoints change. Implement proper cache invalidation and ensure discovery documents accurately reflect current provider capabilities.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Token Rotation</strong>\nSimultaneous refresh token requests can lead to multiple valid tokens or corrupted token family state. Use atomic database operations and proper locking to ensure only one refresh operation succeeds per token.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Error Context</strong>\nReturning generic error messages makes debugging integration issues difficult for client developers. Provide specific error descriptions that help identify the exact validation failure while avoiding information disclosure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4

(1-4), establishing robust error handling patterns and security measures that must be implemented throughout the OAuth2 provider</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-airport-security-checkpoint\">Mental Model: Airport Security Checkpoint</h3>\n<p>Think of OAuth2 error handling like a multi-layered airport security system. Just as airport security has different checkpoints for different types of threats—document verification, metal detectors, baggage scanning—an OAuth2 provider needs different error handling layers for different types of failures. Each checkpoint has standardized procedures for handling problems: clear error codes, escalation paths, and recovery mechanisms. When something goes wrong, the system doesn&#39;t just fail silently—it provides specific, actionable feedback while maintaining security. A suspicious bag triggers a specific protocol, just as an invalid OAuth2 request triggers a standardized error response that helps the client application understand what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that error handling in OAuth2 isn&#39;t just about preventing crashes—it&#39;s about maintaining security boundaries while providing enough information for legitimate clients to succeed. Like airport security, you want to be helpful to legitimate travelers while being completely opaque to potential attackers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oauth2-error-response-format\">OAuth2 Error Response Format</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 defines a standardized error response format that ensures consistent communication between authorization servers and client applications. This standardization is crucial because client applications need to programmatically handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.</p>\n<p>The OAuth2 error response structure follows RFC 6749 specifications and includes several required and optional fields that provide different levels of detail about the failure. The <code>OAuth2Error</code> structure encapsulates all necessary information for proper error communication:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Error</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Standard OAuth2 error code from RFC 6749</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorDescription</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Human-readable description providing additional context</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorURI</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>URI pointing to documentation about the error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Exact state parameter value from the original request</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The standardized error codes provide specific categories of failures that client applications can handle programmatically. Each error code represents a different class of problem with different recovery strategies:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Code</th>\n<th>HTTP Status</th>\n<th>Usage Context</th>\n<th>Client Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ErrorInvalidRequest</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Missing or malformed parameters</td>\n<td>Fix request parameters and retry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorInvalidClient</td>\n<td>401</td>\n<td>Client authentication failed</td>\n<td>Check client credentials</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorInvalidGrant</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Authorization code/refresh token invalid</td>\n<td>Restart authorization flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorUnauthorizedClient</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Client not authorized for grant type</td>\n<td>Check client registration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorUnsupportedGrantType</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Grant type not supported</td>\n<td>Use supported grant type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorInvalidScope</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Scope invalid or exceeds registered scopes</td>\n<td>Request valid scopes only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorAccessDenied</td>\n<td>403</td>\n<td>User denied authorization request</td>\n<td>Inform user, don&#39;t retry automatically</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorUnsupportedResponseType</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>Response type not supported</td>\n<td>Use supported response type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorServerError</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>Internal server error occurred</td>\n<td>Retry with exponential backoff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorTemporarilyUnavailable</td>\n<td>503</td>\n<td>Service temporarily overloaded</td>\n<td>Retry with exponential backoff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorInvalidToken</td>\n<td>401</td>\n<td>Access token invalid or expired</td>\n<td>Refresh token or re-authenticate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ErrorInsufficientScope</td>\n<td>403</td>\n<td>Token lacks required scope</td>\n<td>Request higher scope or inform user</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Structured Error Response Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: OAuth2 providers must communicate errors clearly to client applications while maintaining security</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Custom error format, HTTP status codes only, OAuth2 standard format</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement OAuth2 RFC 6749 standard error format with structured JSON responses</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Standard format ensures interoperability, provides programmatic error handling, and includes security considerations for error disclosure</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables robust client error handling, maintains consistency with OAuth2 ecosystem, requires careful error message sanitization</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The error response formatting process involves several critical steps to ensure both usability and security. When an error occurs, the system must determine the appropriate error code, construct a helpful but secure error description, and format the response according to OAuth2 standards.</p>\n<p>Error response construction follows this algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the specific failure condition from the request processing pipeline</li>\n<li>Map the failure to the appropriate OAuth2 error code from the standard set</li>\n<li>Determine the correct HTTP status code based on the error type and context</li>\n<li>Construct a sanitized error description that helps legitimate clients without exposing sensitive information</li>\n<li>Include the original state parameter if present to maintain CSRF protection</li>\n<li>Format the response as JSON with proper Content-Type headers</li>\n<li>Log the error with full context for debugging while returning sanitized information to the client</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>WriteOAuth2Error</code> function centralizes error response formatting to ensure consistency across all endpoints. This function takes the HTTP response writer, appropriate status code, error code, and description, then formats them according to OAuth2 specifications.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that OAuth2 error responses serve dual purposes: they must provide enough information for legitimate clients to recover from transient failures, while revealing nothing useful to potential attackers probing for vulnerabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Error response formatting includes several security considerations that protect against information disclosure attacks. Error descriptions must be carefully crafted to avoid leaking sensitive information about internal system state, registered clients, or user accounts. For example, when a client_id doesn&#39;t exist, the error response should be identical to when client authentication fails, preventing enumeration attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"security-edge-cases\">Security Edge Cases</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 providers face numerous security edge cases that require careful handling to prevent token theft, replay attacks, and other sophisticated threats. These edge cases often involve timing attacks, token reuse detection, and proper handling of cryptographic failures.</p>\n<p>Token theft represents one of the most serious security threats to OAuth2 systems. When an attacker gains access to a valid access token or refresh token, they can impersonate the legitimate client or user. The system must implement several layers of defense to detect and mitigate token theft scenarios:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Threat Type</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Mitigation Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Access Token Theft</td>\n<td>Unusual usage patterns, geo-location</td>\n<td>Short token lifetime, scope validation</td>\n<td>Token revocation, user notification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refresh Token Theft</td>\n<td>Token family reuse detection</td>\n<td>Refresh token rotation</td>\n<td>Revoke entire token family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization Code Interception</td>\n<td>PKCE verification failure</td>\n<td>Mandatory PKCE for public clients</td>\n<td>Reject token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Secret Compromise</td>\n<td>Abnormal client behavior patterns</td>\n<td>Client secret rotation</td>\n<td>Invalidate all client tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Replay Attack</td>\n<td>Token reuse detection</td>\n<td>Nonce validation, timestamp checks</td>\n<td>Reject duplicate requests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The refresh token rotation mechanism provides the strongest defense against token theft. When a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, the system issues a completely new refresh token and marks the old one as invalid. This creates a &quot;token family&quot; where each refresh operation creates a new generation of tokens linked to the previous ones.</p>\n<p>Token family tracking algorithm works as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When issuing the first refresh token, generate a unique token family identifier</li>\n<li>Store the token family ID with the refresh token record in the database</li>\n<li>When a refresh token is used, verify it belongs to a valid, active token family</li>\n<li>Generate a new refresh token with the same family ID but new token value</li>\n<li>Mark the old refresh token as used and store a reference to the new token</li>\n<li>If an old refresh token is presented again, detect potential theft and revoke the entire family</li>\n<li>Maintain family lineage until the last token in the family expires naturally</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Refresh Token Rotation with Family Tracking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Refresh tokens are long-lived and valuable targets for attackers, requiring sophisticated theft detection</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Static refresh tokens, simple rotation, family-based rotation with theft detection</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement family-based refresh token rotation with automatic theft detection and family revocation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides strongest security against token theft while maintaining usability for legitimate clients</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires complex token family management, enables automatic breach detection, may impact client implementations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Replay attack prevention requires careful handling of request uniqueness and timing constraints. The system must track request identifiers and enforce appropriate time windows for token exchange operations. Authorization codes must be single-use and short-lived, while refresh token usage must be monitored for suspicious patterns.</p>\n<p>Timing attack mitigation is crucial for protecting against cryptographic side-channel attacks. Token validation, client secret verification, and other security-sensitive operations must use constant-time comparison functions to prevent timing-based information disclosure:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Timing Attack Mitigation Checklist:\n1. Client secret verification must use constant-time comparison (bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword)\n2. Token signature verification must not leak timing information about validity\n3. Authorization code lookup must take consistent time regardless of code validity\n4. PKCE code verifier validation must use constant-time comparison\n5. Database queries for security operations should have consistent response times\n6. Error responses must be generated in consistent time regardless of error type</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The system must also handle cryptographic failures gracefully without exposing information about the failure mode. When JWT signature verification fails, the error response should be identical whether the signature is invalid, the key is wrong, or the token is malformed. This prevents attackers from using error response variations to gain information about the cryptographic implementation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Timing attacks are particularly dangerous in OAuth2 because they can be used to validate tokens, enumerate client credentials, or break PKCE protection. Every security-sensitive comparison must be implemented with constant-time algorithms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"rate-limiting-and-abuse-prevention\">Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 endpoints are attractive targets for various types of abuse including credential stuffing, token enumeration, and denial-of-service attacks. Effective rate limiting requires different strategies for different endpoints based on their usage patterns and security requirements.</p>\n<p>The authorization endpoint faces unique challenges because legitimate users may retry authorization requests due to browser issues or user confusion. However, automated attacks against this endpoint can attempt to enumerate valid client_id values or overwhelm the consent screen infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Rate limiting strategy varies by endpoint and request type:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Endpoint</th>\n<th>Limiting Factor</th>\n<th>Normal Rate</th>\n<th>Burst Allowance</th>\n<th>Abuse Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authorization</td>\n<td>IP address + client_id</td>\n<td>10/minute</td>\n<td>3 burst</td>\n<td>100/hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Endpoint</td>\n<td>Client credentials</td>\n<td>60/minute</td>\n<td>10 burst</td>\n<td>1000/hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Introspection</td>\n<td>Client credentials</td>\n<td>100/minute</td>\n<td>20 burst</td>\n<td>10000/hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserInfo</td>\n<td>Access token</td>\n<td>60/minute</td>\n<td>10 burst</td>\n<td>1000/hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Registration</td>\n<td>IP address</td>\n<td>5/hour</td>\n<td>2 burst</td>\n<td>10/day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Revocation</td>\n<td>Client credentials</td>\n<td>30/minute</td>\n<td>5 burst</td>\n<td>500/hour</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The rate limiting implementation uses a multi-layered approach with different algorithms for different scenarios. Token bucket algorithms work well for allowing burst traffic while maintaining overall rate limits, while sliding window algorithms provide more precise control over request timing.</p>\n<p>Rate limiting algorithm for token endpoint requests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the client_id from the authenticated request (after client authentication succeeds)</li>\n<li>Look up the current token bucket state for this client from the rate limiting store</li>\n<li>Calculate tokens to add based on time elapsed since last request and configured refill rate</li>\n<li>Add calculated tokens to bucket, capping at maximum bucket size (burst allowance)</li>\n<li>Check if bucket contains sufficient tokens for this request (typically 1 token)</li>\n<li>If sufficient tokens available, decrement bucket and allow request to proceed</li>\n<li>If insufficient tokens, reject request with HTTP 429 and Retry-After header</li>\n<li>Update bucket state in rate limiting store with new token count and timestamp</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Distributed rate limiting presents additional challenges when the OAuth2 provider runs across multiple servers. The rate limiting state must be shared across instances while maintaining high performance and avoiding race conditions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Redis-Based Distributed Rate Limiting</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: OAuth2 provider needs consistent rate limiting across multiple server instances</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: In-memory per-instance, database-based, Redis-based distributed</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement Redis-based rate limiting with Lua scripts for atomic operations</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides low-latency distributed state sharing with atomic increment operations and automatic expiration</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Adds Redis dependency, enables consistent multi-instance rate limiting, requires careful Redis failover handling</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abuse detection goes beyond simple rate limiting to identify sophisticated attack patterns. The system monitors for suspicious behaviors like credential stuffing attempts, token enumeration attacks, and coordinated attacks from multiple IP addresses.</p>\n<p>Suspicious behavior detection patterns include:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attack Pattern</th>\n<th>Detection Signals</th>\n<th>Response Strategy</th>\n<th>Escalation Trigger</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Credential Stuffing</td>\n<td>High failure rate from single IP</td>\n<td>Progressive delays, CAPTCHA</td>\n<td>&gt;50 failures/hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client Enumeration</td>\n<td>Sequential client_id probing</td>\n<td>IP-based blocking</td>\n<td>&gt;20 invalid clients</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Brute Force</td>\n<td>Rapid token validation attempts</td>\n<td>Client rate limiting</td>\n<td>&gt;100 invalid tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distributed Attack</td>\n<td>Coordinated requests from multiple IPs</td>\n<td>Geographic analysis</td>\n<td>&gt;1000 requests/minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Account Takeover</td>\n<td>Unusual location/device patterns</td>\n<td>Additional authentication</td>\n<td>Risk score &gt;0.8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The system implements progressive response strategies that escalate from warnings to complete blocking based on the severity and persistence of suspicious behavior. Initial violations might trigger longer response delays or CAPTCHA challenges, while persistent abuse results in temporary or permanent IP blocking.</p>\n<p>Anomaly detection uses statistical models to identify unusual request patterns that might indicate automated attacks. The system establishes baseline behavior for each client and endpoint, then flags significant deviations for investigation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for abuse prevention is that legitimate OAuth2 traffic has predictable patterns—clients authenticate periodically, users authorize applications occasionally, and tokens are refreshed on schedule. Attackers typically generate traffic that violates these natural patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"graceful-degradation\">Graceful Degradation</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 providers depend on various external systems including databases, cache layers, cryptographic services, and user authentication systems. When these dependencies fail, the provider must gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining security guarantees.</p>\n<p>Dependency failure modes and their handling strategies require careful planning to ensure that partial failures don&#39;t compromise the security model. Some operations can continue with reduced functionality, while others must fail completely to maintain security boundaries.</p>\n<p>Graceful degradation strategies by system component:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Degraded Operation</th>\n<th>Security Impact</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Primary Database</td>\n<td>Connection lost</td>\n<td>Read-only from replica</td>\n<td>None if replica current</td>\n<td>Failover to replica</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redis Cache</td>\n<td>Unavailable</td>\n<td>Direct database queries</td>\n<td>Performance only</td>\n<td>Cache rebuilding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Authentication</td>\n<td>Service down</td>\n<td>No new authorizations</td>\n<td>Existing tokens valid</td>\n<td>Queue auth requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Management</td>\n<td>Key unavailable</td>\n<td>Token validation fails</td>\n<td>High - stop issuing tokens</td>\n<td>Emergency key rotation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rate Limiting Store</td>\n<td>Redis failure</td>\n<td>Per-instance rate limiting</td>\n<td>Reduced abuse protection</td>\n<td>Restart with memory limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audit Logging</td>\n<td>Log system down</td>\n<td>Continue operations</td>\n<td>Compliance risk</td>\n<td>Queue logs for replay</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Database failover represents the most critical degradation scenario because OAuth2 operations require persistent state for security. The system must distinguish between read operations that can use potentially stale replica data and write operations that require consistent primary database access.</p>\n<p>Database degradation handling algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Detect primary database connection failure through health check or operation timeout</li>\n<li>Evaluate current operation type—read-only (token introspection) vs. write-required (token issuance)</li>\n<li>For read operations, attempt failover to database replica with staleness checks</li>\n<li>For write operations, enter degraded mode and reject new token issuance requests</li>\n<li>Continue serving existing valid tokens through replica database or cache</li>\n<li>Monitor primary database recovery and gradually restore full functionality</li>\n<li>Perform consistency checks after primary database recovery to detect any data loss</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cache failure handling focuses on maintaining performance while preserving correctness. When Redis or other caching layers become unavailable, the system falls back to direct database queries but must be careful about query load.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Fail-Safe Security Model</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: System dependencies will occasionally fail, requiring graceful degradation without security compromise</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Continue all operations, fail completely, selective degradation based on security impact</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement selective degradation that maintains security properties while reducing functionality</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Preserves security boundaries while maximizing availability for low-risk operations</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires complex failure mode analysis, enables high availability, may impact user experience during outages</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cryptographic service failures require immediate response because they directly impact security. When key management systems become unavailable or keys are compromised, the system must stop issuing new tokens while continuing to validate existing ones until they expire naturally.</p>\n<p>Circuit breaker patterns help prevent cascading failures when external dependencies become unreliable. The system monitors dependency health and automatically stops sending requests to failing services while providing fallback responses.</p>\n<p>Circuit breaker state management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Closed State</strong>: Normal operation, all requests pass through to dependency</li>\n<li><strong>Open State</strong>: Dependency failed, all requests immediately return failure response</li>\n<li><strong>Half-Open State</strong>: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed through to test dependency health</li>\n<li>Monitor failure rate and response times to determine when to change circuit breaker state</li>\n<li>Implement exponential backoff for recovery testing to avoid overwhelming recovering services</li>\n<li>Provide meaningful error responses that help clients understand service degradation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The system must also handle partial functionality scenarios where some OAuth2 flows work while others don&#39;t. For example, if user authentication services are down, existing access tokens continue to work, but new authorization requests must be queued or rejected.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fundamental principle of graceful degradation in OAuth2 is that security properties must never be compromised for availability. It&#39;s better to reject requests than to issue tokens with compromised security guarantees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>User communication during degraded operation helps maintain trust and reduces support burden. The system should provide clear error messages that explain service limitations and expected recovery times when possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/oauth2-provider/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flowchart.svg\" alt=\"OAuth2 Error Response Handling\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Information Disclosure in Error Messages</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations inadvertently leak sensitive information through overly detailed error messages. For example, responding &quot;client_id xyz does not exist&quot; vs. &quot;invalid client credentials&quot; allows attackers to enumerate valid client identifiers. The error message should be identical whether the client doesn&#39;t exist or the secret is wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use generic error messages for authentication failures and implement detailed logging separately for debugging purposes. The <code>WriteOAuth2Error</code> function should sanitize all user-facing error descriptions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Non-Constant Time Security Operations</strong></p>\n<p>Using standard string comparison for client secret validation or PKCE code verifier checking creates timing side-channels that can be exploited to extract secrets. Go&#39;s <code>==</code> operator returns immediately on the first differing byte, creating measurable timing differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Always use constant-time comparison functions like <code>subtle.ConstantTimeCompare</code> for security-sensitive operations. For password hashing, use <code>bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword</code> which includes timing attack protection.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Rate Limiting Granularity</strong></p>\n<p>Applying the same rate limiting rules to all endpoints or request types fails to account for different usage patterns and attack vectors. The authorization endpoint needs different limits than the token introspection endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement endpoint-specific rate limiting with appropriate limiting factors (IP, client_id, user_id) based on the endpoint&#39;s function and typical usage patterns.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Improper Error Code Selection</strong></p>\n<p>Using generic HTTP status codes without proper OAuth2 error codes prevents clients from implementing appropriate error handling. Returning HTTP 500 for all failures provides no actionable information.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Map specific failure conditions to appropriate OAuth2 error codes and HTTP status codes. Implement comprehensive error classification that helps clients determine whether to retry, fix parameters, or escalate to users.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Token Family Cleanup</strong></p>\n<p>Implementing refresh token rotation without proper cleanup of old token families leads to database bloat and potential security issues. Old revoked tokens should be removed after they expire.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement background cleanup processes that remove expired revocation entries and old token family records. Set appropriate TTL values in Redis or database to automatically clean up stale data.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Synchronous External Dependency Calls</strong></p>\n<p>Making synchronous calls to external services (user authentication, audit logging) in the critical path creates failure points where external service issues directly impact OAuth2 operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use asynchronous patterns for non-critical external calls, implement circuit breakers for external dependencies, and provide meaningful fallback responses when external services are unavailable.</p>\n<h3

id=\"testing-strategy\">Testing Strategy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section provides comprehensive testing approaches for all milestones (1-4), establishing verification strategies that ensure security properties, protocol compliance, and integration correctness throughout the OAuth2 provider implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-multi-layer-security-inspection\">Mental Model: Multi-Layer Security Inspection</h3>\n<p>Think of testing an OAuth2 provider like conducting a comprehensive security inspection of a high-security facility with multiple layers of protection. Just as security inspectors must verify that each layer—from perimeter fences to biometric scanners to vault locks—functions correctly both individually and as an integrated system, OAuth2 testing requires verification at multiple levels.</p>\n<p>The perimeter inspection corresponds to <strong>protocol compliance testing</strong>—ensuring that your OAuth2 provider correctly implements the standardized communication protocols that all clients expect. The security system testing represents <strong>security property testing</strong>—verifying that cryptographic operations, token handling, and access controls actually provide the security guarantees they promise. The operational readiness testing matches <strong>integration testing</strong>—confirming that real OAuth2 clients can successfully interact with your provider in realistic scenarios. Finally, the checkpoint inspections align with <strong>milestone verification</strong>—systematic validation that each phase of construction meets its acceptance criteria before proceeding to the next layer.</p>\n<p>This multi-layer approach is essential because OAuth2 security failures can occur at any level. A provider might implement perfect cryptography but violate the OAuth2 specification, leading to client compatibility issues. Conversely, it might handle the OAuth2 protocol correctly but contain cryptographic vulnerabilities that enable token forgery. Comprehensive testing ensures that security properties hold at every layer of the system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"security-property-testing-testing-cryptographic-properties-and-attack-resistance\">Security Property Testing: Testing Cryptographic Properties and Attack Resistance</h3>\n<p>Security property testing for an OAuth2 provider focuses on verifying that the cryptographic foundations and security mechanisms actually provide their promised protection against real-world attacks. Unlike functional testing that verifies correct behavior under normal conditions, security testing specifically probes for vulnerabilities by simulating adversarial conditions and attack scenarios.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cryptographic-property-verification\">Cryptographic Property Verification</h4>\n<p>The foundation of OAuth2 security rests on cryptographic operations that must be tested for correctness, randomness quality, and resistance to cryptographic attacks. These tests verify that the mathematical and algorithmic security properties hold under implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Generation Randomness Testing</strong> verifies that authorization codes, client secrets, and refresh tokens contain sufficient entropy to resist brute force and prediction attacks. The testing approach involves generating large samples of tokens and applying statistical randomness tests to detect patterns or bias. For authorization codes, collect samples of 10,000 generated codes and apply the NIST SP 800-22 statistical test suite to verify that the randomness passes frequency tests, runs tests, and serial correlation tests. Any detectable pattern indicates a vulnerability in the random number generation that could allow attackers to predict future tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Signature Verification Testing</strong> ensures that JWT access tokens cannot be forged or tampered with by attackers who lack the signing keys. Create test JWTs with various manipulations—altered payloads, modified headers, incorrect signatures—and verify that the <code>JWTValidator</code> correctly rejects all invalid tokens. Test edge cases like JWTs with valid signatures but from different keys, tokens with algorithm confusion attacks (changing &quot;RS256&quot; to &quot;HS256&quot;), and tokens with subtle payload modifications. The validator must reject every tampered token while accepting all legitimate tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>PKCE Security Property Testing</strong> verifies that the Proof Key for Code Exchange mechanism actually prevents authorization code interception attacks. Generate PKCE challenges and verifiers, then test that the <code>PKCEValidator</code> correctly accepts only the matching verifier for each challenge. Test attack scenarios where an attacker intercepts an authorization code but lacks the code verifier—the token exchange must fail. Also test that slight modifications to the code verifier (single character changes, case modifications) result in validation failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Timing Attack Resistance Testing</strong> ensures that cryptographic operations use constant-time comparisons to prevent timing side-channel attacks. Implement timing measurement tests for critical operations like client secret verification and token comparison. The <code>VerifyClientSecret</code> function must take the same time to reject an incorrect secret as it takes to accept a correct one. Measure execution times over thousands of iterations with both correct and incorrect inputs—any statistically significant timing difference indicates a timing attack vulnerability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Security Property</th>\n<th>Test Method</th>\n<th>Failure Indicators</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Token Randomness</td>\n<td>Unpredictability</td>\n<td>NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests on 10K+ samples</td>\n<td>Patterns, bias, or predictability in token generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT Integrity</td>\n<td>Tamper resistance</td>\n<td>Signature verification with modified payloads/headers</td>\n<td>Acceptance of tampered or forged tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE Binding</td>\n<td>Authorization code protection</td>\n<td>Verifier validation with intercepted codes</td>\n<td>Code exchange without valid verifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timing Attacks</td>\n<td>Side-channel resistance</td>\n<td>Statistical timing analysis of crypto operations</td>\n<td>Timing differences revealing secret information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Management</td>\n<td>Key security</td>\n<td>Private key access and rotation testing</td>\n<td>Unauthorized key access or stale key usage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"attack-simulation-testing\">Attack Simulation Testing</h4>\n<p>Attack simulation testing systematically attempts common OAuth2 attacks against your provider to verify that security mechanisms effectively prevent real-world threats. These tests should be automated and run regularly to catch security regressions.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Code Replay Attack Testing</strong> simulates attackers attempting to reuse intercepted authorization codes. Generate a valid authorization code through the normal flow, then attempt to exchange it for tokens multiple times. The first exchange should succeed and return valid tokens, but subsequent attempts must fail with <code>ErrorInvalidGrant</code>. Additionally, test that codes expire after their configured timeout (typically 10 minutes) and cannot be used after expiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Theft and Misuse Testing</strong> simulates scenarios where attackers obtain valid tokens through various means and attempt to misuse them. Test that revoked tokens immediately become unusable across all endpoints, including the UserInfo endpoint and any resource servers using your JWT validation. Test that expired tokens are rejected with proper error codes. Test that tokens issued to one client cannot be used by a different client by attempting cross-client token usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Family Attack Testing</strong> simulates the critical refresh token theft detection mechanism. Create a refresh token family by issuing an initial refresh token and rotating it several times. Then simulate an attack by attempting to use a previously rotated (old) refresh token. The system must detect this as potential theft and revoke the entire token family, invalidating all related tokens. Verify that legitimate token rotation continues to work while detecting and preventing family replay attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Impersonation Attack Testing</strong> attempts various forms of OAuth2 client impersonation to verify client authentication mechanisms. Test scenarios where attackers attempt to use legitimate client IDs with incorrect secrets, stolen client credentials from one environment in another, and various client credential manipulation attacks. All unauthorized client authentication attempts must fail with <code>ErrorInvalidClient</code> without revealing information about valid client IDs.</p>\n<p><strong>PKCE Bypass Attack Testing</strong> specifically targets the PKCE implementation with various bypass attempts. Test scenarios where public clients attempt to skip PKCE verification, use weak code challenges, submit incorrect code challenge methods, or attempt to replay code challenges from other authorization flows. The authorization endpoint must enforce PKCE for public clients and reject any bypass attempts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: Security property testing must assume an intelligent adversary who understands OAuth2 specifications and common implementation vulnerabilities. Tests should not just verify correct behavior but actively attempt to break security assumptions through edge cases and malicious inputs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"security-test-implementation-strategy\">Security Test Implementation Strategy</h4>\n<p>Security tests require specialized infrastructure to generate attack scenarios, measure cryptographic properties, and simulate adversarial conditions. The testing framework should include utilities for token manipulation, timing measurements, and statistical analysis.</p>\n<p>Create a dedicated security testing suite that runs independently of functional tests. This suite should include test utilities for generating malicious inputs, measuring response times with microsecond precision, and analyzing token distributions for randomness properties. The security tests should run in a dedicated testing environment that can simulate network delays, partial failures, and concurrent attack scenarios without affecting development workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Test Data Generation for Security Tests</strong> requires creating large datasets of tokens, authorization codes, and cryptographic challenges for statistical analysis. Implement generators that can produce thousands of test tokens with controlled variations for randomness testing. Create test databases with realistic client registrations, user accounts, and token histories to support attack simulation scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Test Metrics and Reporting</strong> should provide clear indicators of security posture and track security properties over time. Implement metrics that measure token entropy, cryptographic operation timing consistency, and attack resistance rates. Security test failures should provide detailed forensic information about the specific vulnerability discovered, including reproducible attack scenarios and recommended remediation steps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"protocol-compliance-testing-validating-oauth2-and-oidc-specification-adherence\">Protocol Compliance Testing: Validating OAuth2 and OIDC Specification Adherence</h3>\n<p>Protocol compliance testing ensures that your OAuth2 provider correctly implements the standardized specifications that OAuth2 clients expect. Unlike security testing that focuses on adversarial scenarios, compliance testing verifies correct behavior according to RFC 6749 (OAuth2), RFC 7636 (PKCE), RFC 7662 (Token Introspection), RFC 7009 (Token Revocation), and the OpenID Connect Core specification.</p>\n<h4 id=\"oauth2-specification-compliance-testing\">OAuth2 Specification Compliance Testing</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 compliance testing systematically verifies that each endpoint correctly handles the request and response formats, error conditions, and behavioral requirements specified in the relevant RFCs. This testing is critical because OAuth2 clients are built to expect specific protocol behaviors, and deviations can cause integration failures or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Endpoint Compliance Testing</strong> verifies that the authorization endpoint correctly implements the OAuth2 authorization code grant flow according to RFC 6749 Section 4.1. Test all required parameters (<code>response_type</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>redirect_uri</code>, <code>scope</code>, <code>state</code>) and verify that missing required parameters result in proper error responses. Test the optional <code>state</code> parameter handling—when provided by the client, it must be returned unchanged in both success and error responses.</p>\n<p>The authorization endpoint must validate redirect URIs according to exact string matching requirements. Test scenarios with legitimate redirect URIs, URIs that are subpaths or subdomains of registered URIs (which should be rejected), URIs with additional query parameters (which should be rejected), and completely invalid URIs. The endpoint must reject authorization requests with redirect URIs that don&#39;t exactly match registered values.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Endpoint Compliance Testing</strong> ensures that token exchanges follow RFC 6749 Section 4.1.3 requirements precisely. Test the authorization code grant with all required parameters (<code>grant_type</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>redirect_uri</code>, <code>client_id</code>) and verify that client authentication works correctly. For confidential clients, test both HTTP Basic authentication and request body client credentials. For public clients, verify that client authentication is not required but client identification is still validated.</p>\n<p>Test refresh token grant compliance according to RFC 6749 Section 6. When processing refresh token grants, verify that the system issues new access tokens with the same or reduced scope, optionally issues new refresh tokens (implementing token rotation), and properly handles refresh token expiration and revocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials Grant Compliance Testing</strong> verifies machine-to-machine authentication according to RFC 6749 Section 4.4. Test that the client credentials grant bypasses user authorization and issues tokens directly to authenticated clients. Verify that the issued tokens have appropriate scope limitations and cannot access user-specific resources without explicit user consent.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Endpoint</th>\n<th>RFC Requirement</th>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authorization</td>\n<td>Parameter validation (RFC 6749 4.1.1)</td>\n<td>Missing <code>client_id</code> parameter</td>\n<td>HTTP 400 with <code>invalid_request</code> error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization</td>\n<td>Redirect URI validation (RFC 6749 3.1.2)</td>\n<td>URI substring of registered URI</td>\n<td>Reject with error page (no redirect)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token</td>\n<td>Authorization code validation (RFC 6749 4.1.3)</td>\n<td>Expired authorization code</td>\n<td>HTTP 400 with <code>invalid_grant</code> error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token</td>\n<td>Client authentication (RFC 6749 2.3)</td>\n<td>Invalid client credentials</td>\n<td>HTTP 401 with <code>invalid_client</code> error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token</td>\n<td>Refresh token grant (RFC 6749 6)</td>\n<td>Valid refresh token exchange</td>\n<td>New access token with same/reduced scope</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"pkce-specification-compliance-testing\">PKCE Specification Compliance Testing</h4>\n<p>PKCE compliance testing verifies implementation according to RFC 7636, which defines critical security extensions for OAuth2 authorization code flows. PKCE compliance is mandatory for public clients and should be supported for all client types.</p>\n<p><strong>PKCE Challenge and Verification Testing</strong> ensures that code challenges and verifiers are handled correctly throughout the authorization flow. Test that the authorization endpoint accepts and stores code challenges with both <code>S256</code> and <code>plain</code> challenge methods, though production systems should enforce <code>S256</code> for security. When the token endpoint processes authorization code exchanges, verify that the system correctly validates code verifiers against the stored code challenge using the specified challenge method.</p>\n<p>Test PKCE parameter validation thoroughly. The <code>code_challenge</code> parameter must be a base64url-encoded string of appropriate length for the challenge method. The <code>code_verifier</code> must be a cryptographically random string between 43 and 128 characters in length. Test boundary conditions with verifiers of exactly 43 characters, exactly 128 characters, and invalid lengths outside this range.</p>\n<p><strong>PKCE Enforcement Policy Testing</strong> verifies that your provider correctly enforces PKCE requirements based on client type and configuration. For public clients (mobile apps, single-page applications), PKCE should be mandatory—authorization requests without valid PKCE parameters should be rejected. For confidential clients, PKCE may be optional but should still be validated when present.</p>\n<h4 id=\"openid-connect-specification-compliance-testing\">OpenID Connect Specification Compliance Testing</h4>\n<p>OpenID Connect compliance testing ensures that the identity layer built on top of OAuth2 correctly implements OIDC Core specifications. This includes ID token generation, UserInfo endpoint behavior, and discovery document format.</p>\n<p><strong>ID Token Generation Compliance Testing</strong> verifies that ID tokens contain required claims and follow JWT formatting requirements. Test that ID tokens include mandatory claims (<code>iss</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>aud</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>iat</code>, <code>auth_time</code>, <code>nonce</code>) when appropriate. The <code>sub</code> claim must be locally unique and never reassigned within your provider. The <code>aud</code> claim must contain the client ID that requested the ID token. The <code>nonce</code> parameter from the authorization request must be included in the ID token if provided.</p>\n<p><strong>UserInfo Endpoint Compliance Testing</strong> ensures that the UserInfo endpoint returns user profile claims according to OIDC specifications. Test that the endpoint requires valid access tokens and returns user information only for the authenticated user (identified by the <code>sub</code> claim in the access token). Verify that the returned claims match the granted scopes—requests with <code>profile</code> scope should return profile-related claims, while requests with <code>email</code> scope should return email-related claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery Document Compliance Testing</strong> verifies that the well-known configuration endpoint returns a valid OIDC discovery document according to OIDC Discovery specifications. Test that required fields (<code>issuer</code>, <code>authorization_endpoint</code>, <code>token_endpoint</code>, <code>userinfo_endpoint</code>, <code>jwks_uri</code>) are present and contain correct URLs. Test that the supported grant types, response types, and scopes are accurately declared.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Protocol Compliance Critical Point</strong>: OAuth2 and OIDC specifications include numerous optional features and edge cases that real clients depend on. Compliance testing must cover not just the &quot;happy path&quot; scenarios but also error conditions, edge cases, and optional parameter handling that clients may rely on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"compliance-test-framework-implementation\">Compliance Test Framework Implementation</h4>\n<p>Protocol compliance testing requires systematic coverage of specification requirements and automated validation of request/response formats. Implement a compliance testing framework that can parse OAuth2 specifications and generate comprehensive test cases for each requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Specification-Driven Test Generation</strong> creates test cases directly from RFC requirements and OIDC specification sections. For each endpoint, enumerate all required parameters, optional parameters, and error conditions specified in the relevant standards. Generate positive test cases that verify correct behavior and negative test cases that verify proper error handling for each requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Response Format Validation Testing</strong> ensures that all endpoint responses exactly match the formats specified in OAuth2 and OIDC standards. Implement JSON schema validation for token responses, error responses, and UserInfo responses. Validate HTTP status codes, Content-Type headers, and Cache-Control headers according to specification requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"milestone-checkpoints-verification-steps-for-each-implementation-milestone\">Milestone Checkpoints: Verification Steps for Each Implementation Milestone</h3>\n<p>Milestone checkpoints provide structured verification that each phase of OAuth2 provider development meets its acceptance criteria before proceeding to the next milestone. These checkpoints combine automated testing, manual verification, and integration testing to ensure comprehensive validation of implemented functionality.</p>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-1-checkpoint-client-registration-amp-authorization-endpoint\">Milestone 1 Checkpoint: Client Registration &amp; Authorization Endpoint</h4>\n<p>The first milestone checkpoint verifies that client registration and authorization endpoint functionality works correctly with proper security properties. This checkpoint establishes the foundation for all subsequent OAuth2 flows.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Registration Verification</strong> tests that the <code>RegistrationService</code> correctly creates OAuth2 clients with proper credential generation and storage. Verify that the <code>RegisterClient</code> function generates cryptographically secure client IDs and client secrets, properly hashes client secrets using bcrypt, and stores client information with correct redirect URI associations.</p>\n<p>Create test scenarios with various client registration inputs—single redirect URI, multiple redirect URIs, different client names, and edge cases like extremely long names or URIs. Verify that the registration process validates redirect URIs for proper format and rejects obviously invalid URIs like localhost (in production configurations) or URIs with user credentials.</p>\n<p>Test the client credential verification process by attempting authentication with correct client credentials, incorrect secrets, non-existent client IDs, and various malformed credential formats. The <code>VerifyClientSecret</code> function must use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks while correctly accepting valid credentials and rejecting invalid ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Endpoint Verification</strong> tests the complete authorization flow from initial redirect through user consent to authorization code generation. Start by testing parameter validation—send authorization requests with various combinations of required and optional parameters. Verify that requests with missing <code>client_id</code>, <code>response_type</code>, or <code>redirect_uri</code> parameters result in appropriate error responses.</p>\n<p>Test redirect URI validation thoroughly by sending authorization requests with redirect URIs that exactly match registered URIs (should succeed), URIs that are subpaths or subdomains of registered URIs (should fail), and URIs with additional query parameters or fragments (should fail). The authorization endpoint must implement exact string matching for redirect URI validation.</p>\n<p>Verify PKCE implementation by sending authorization requests with valid PKCE parameters (<code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code>), invalid PKCE parameters, and missing PKCE parameters for public clients. The system should store PKCE challenges correctly and enforce PKCE requirements based on client type configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Code Generation Verification</strong> tests that authorization codes are generated securely and bound to the correct parameters. Generate authorization codes through the consent flow and verify that each code is cryptographically random, unique, and properly associated with the client ID, redirect URI, and user ID. Test that authorization codes expire after the configured timeout period and cannot be reused after a successful token exchange.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Verification Step</th>\n<th>Test Method</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Indicators</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Client registration</td>\n<td>API call with valid parameters</td>\n<td>Client record created with hashed secret</td>\n<td>Registration fails or secret stored in plaintext</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redirect URI validation</td>\n<td>Authorization request with various URIs</td>\n<td>Only exact matches accepted</td>\n<td>Partial matches accepted or valid URIs rejected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE parameter handling</td>\n<td>Authorization request with PKCE parameters</td>\n<td>Challenge stored and bound to authorization code</td>\n<td>PKCE parameters ignored or incorrectly validated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization code binding</td>\n<td>Token exchange with generated code</td>\n<td>Code validates against correct client/URI</td>\n<td>Code accepts incorrect client or redirect URI</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-2-checkpoint-token-endpoint-amp-jwt-generation\">Milestone 2 Checkpoint: Token Endpoint &amp; JWT Generation</h4>\n<p>The second milestone checkpoint verifies that token generation, JWT signing, and refresh token rotation work correctly. This milestone establishes the core token-based security mechanisms for the OAuth2 provider.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Exchange Verification</strong> tests that the token endpoint correctly exchanges authorization codes for access and refresh tokens. Send token exchange requests with valid authorization codes and verify that the response includes a properly formatted access token (JWT), refresh token, token type (&quot;Bearer&quot;), and expiration information. Test that the authorization code becomes invalid after successful exchange and cannot be reused.</p>\n<p>Verify client authentication during token exchange by testing with correct client credentials (both HTTP Basic and request body formats), incorrect credentials, and missing credentials for confidential clients. Public clients should be able to exchange tokens without client authentication but must still provide client identification for validation.</p>\n<p>Test PKCE verification during token exchange by providing correct code verifiers, incorrect verifiers, and missing verifiers for authorization codes that were issued with PKCE challenges. The token endpoint must validate code verifiers against stored code challenges and reject exchanges with invalid or missing verifiers.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Access Token Verification</strong> tests that generated access tokens are properly formatted JWTs with correct claims and signatures. Parse generated access tokens and verify that they contain required claims (<code>sub</code>, <code>iss</code>, <code>aud</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>iat</code>, <code>scope</code>) with correct values. The <code>sub</code> claim should identify the user who granted authorization, <code>aud</code> should identify the client that will use the token, and <code>scope</code> should reflect the granted permissions.</p>\n<p>Test JWT signature validation using your <code>JWTValidator</code> service. Verify that legitimate tokens are accepted and provide correct user and client identification. Test that tokens with modified payloads, invalid signatures, or expired timestamps are rejected with appropriate error codes.</p>\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Rotation Verification</strong> tests that refresh token grants issue new tokens while implementing security through token family tracking. Use a refresh token to obtain new access and refresh tokens, then verify that the old refresh token becomes invalid (if implementing rotation) and the new tokens are properly formatted and functional.</p>\n<p>Test refresh token family security by attempting to reuse an old refresh token after it has been rotated. If your implementation includes token family tracking for theft detection, verify that reusing an old refresh token triggers family revocation and invalidates all related tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Client Credentials Grant Verification</strong> tests machine-to-machine authentication for confidential clients. Send client credentials grant requests with valid client credentials and verify that access tokens are issued without user involvement. Test that these tokens have appropriate scope limitations and work correctly with protected resources.</p>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-3-checkpoint-token-introspection-amp-revocation\">Milestone 3 Checkpoint: Token Introspection &amp; Revocation</h4>\n<p>The third milestone checkpoint verifies that token introspection and revocation endpoints work correctly according to RFC 7662 and RFC 7009 specifications. This milestone establishes token lifecycle management and validation capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Introspection Verification</strong> tests that the introspection endpoint returns correct token metadata according to RFC 7662 format. Send introspection requests with valid access tokens and verify that the response includes <code>active: true</code> along with token metadata like <code>sub</code>, <code>client_id</code>, <code>exp</code>, and <code>scope</code>. Test with expired tokens and verify that <code>active: false</code> is returned without additional metadata.</p>\n<p>Test client authentication for the introspection endpoint by sending requests with correct client credentials, incorrect credentials, and missing authentication. The introspection endpoint should be protected and require client authentication to prevent unauthorized token validation.</p>\n<p>Verify JWT validation integration by testing introspection of JWT access tokens that have been modified, expired, or revoked. The introspection endpoint should correctly identify invalid JWTs and return <code>active: false</code> for compromised tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Revocation Verification</strong> tests that the revocation endpoint immediately invalidates tokens according to RFC 7009. Revoke valid access and refresh tokens, then verify that subsequent introspection requests return <code>active: false</code> and attempts to use the tokens with protected resources fail with authentication errors.</p>\n<p>Test revocation endpoint client authentication and verify that only authorized clients can revoke tokens. Test scenarios where clients attempt to revoke tokens that were issued to other clients—these requests should be rejected to prevent unauthorized token manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Family Revocation Verification</strong> tests advanced security features for refresh token theft detection. If implementing token families, test that revoking a refresh token also revokes related tokens in the same family. Test that detected refresh token replay attacks trigger automatic family revocation to prevent token theft exploitation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-4-checkpoint-userinfo-endpoint-amp-consent-management\">Milestone 4 Checkpoint: UserInfo Endpoint &amp; Consent Management</h4>\n<p>The fourth milestone checkpoint verifies that the UserInfo endpoint and consent management functionality work correctly according to OIDC specifications. This milestone completes the OpenID Connect identity provider implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>UserInfo Endpoint Verification</strong> tests that the UserInfo endpoint returns user profile claims based on granted scopes. Send UserInfo requests with access tokens that have different scope grants (<code>profile</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>openid</code>) and verify that only appropriate claims are returned. Tokens with <code>profile</code> scope should return profile-related claims like <code>name</code> and <code>picture</code>, while tokens with <code>email</code> scope should return email-related claims like <code>email</code> and <code>email_verified</code>.</p>\n<p>Test UserInfo endpoint authentication by sending requests with valid access tokens, expired tokens, revoked tokens, and invalid tokens. Only valid access tokens should result in successful UserInfo responses with appropriate user claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Consent Management Verification</strong> tests that user consent decisions are properly stored and respected in subsequent authorization requests. Grant consent for specific scopes with a particular client, then initiate new authorization requests with the same client and scopes—users should not be prompted for consent again for previously granted permissions.</p>\n<p>Test consent revocation functionality by allowing users to revoke previously granted consent, then verify that subsequent authorization requests re-prompt for consent approval. Test that partial consent revocation (revoking some but not all granted scopes) works correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope-to-Claims Mapping Verification</strong> tests that the <code>ClaimsMapper</code> service correctly filters user profile information based on granted scopes. Create test users with comprehensive profile information, then request UserInfo with various scope combinations and verify that only authorized claims are returned.</p>\n<p>Test edge cases like requesting scopes that weren&#39;t granted during authorization, using access tokens with reduced scopes (compared to the original authorization), and handling custom scopes that map to organization-specific user claims.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Milestone</th>\n<th>Core Verification</th>\n<th>Security Verification</th>\n<th>Integration Verification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Milestone 1</td>\n<td>Client registration and authorization codes</td>\n<td>PKCE implementation and redirect URI validation</td>\n<td>Authorization flow with test OAuth2 client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n<td>JWT generation and refresh token rotation</td>\n<td>Token binding and cryptographic signatures</td>\n<td>Token exchange with multiple client types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milestone 3</td>\n<td>Introspection and revocation endpoints</td>\n<td>Token family security and theft detection</td>\n<td>Resource server integration with JWT validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milestone 4</td>\n<td>UserInfo endpoint and consent persistence</td>\n<td>Scope-based claims filtering</td>\n<td>Complete OIDC flow with real identity clients</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing-end-to-end-testing-with-real-oauth2-clients\">Integration Testing: End-to-End Testing with Real OAuth2 Clients</h3>\n<p>Integration testing validates that your OAuth2 provider works correctly with real OAuth2 and OpenID Connect clients in realistic deployment scenarios. Unlike unit tests that verify individual components or compliance tests that check specification adherence, integration tests focus on end-to-end workflows and real-world compatibility.</p>\n<h4 id=\"real-client-integration-testing\">Real Client Integration Testing</h4>\n<p>Real client integration testing uses actual OAuth2 client libraries and applications to validate that your provider works with existing OAuth2 ecosystem components. This testing catches integration issues that might not appear in isolated component tests.</p>\n<p><strong>OAuth2 Client Library Integration</strong> tests your provider with popular OAuth2 client libraries in different programming languages. Set up test environments using libraries like <code>golang.org/x/oauth2</code> for Go, <code>requests-oauthlib</code> for Python, <code>passport-oauth2</code> for Node.js, and <code>Spring Security OAuth2</code> for Java. Each library may have different implementation assumptions or edge case handling that reveals compatibility issues.</p>\n<p>Create integration test scenarios where these client libraries attempt complete OAuth2 flows against your provider. Test authorization code flows with PKCE, client credentials flows, and refresh token flows. Verify that the client libraries can parse your token responses, handle your error responses appropriately, and successfully obtain and use access tokens for protected resource access.</p>\n<p><strong>Single-Page Application Integration</strong> tests your provider with JavaScript-based OAuth2 clients that run in web browsers. Deploy test single-page applications that use libraries like <code>oauth2-pkce</code> or <code>oidc-client-js</code> to perform OAuth2 flows with your provider. These clients are particularly sensitive to CORS configuration, redirect URI handling, and PKCE implementation details.</p>\n<p>Test browser-based authorization flows including popup-based authorization, redirect-based authorization, and iframe-based silent token renewal. Verify that your authorization endpoint correctly handles JavaScript origins, that your token endpoint supports appropriate CORS headers, and that generated tokens work correctly with browser-based resource access.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile Application Integration</strong> tests your provider with native mobile OAuth2 clients on iOS and Android platforms. Mobile clients have specific requirements for redirect URI handling (custom URL schemes, universal links), PKCE enforcement, and token storage security. Set up test mobile applications that implement OAuth2 flows using platform-specific OAuth2 libraries.</p>\n<p>Test mobile-specific OAuth2 patterns including custom URL scheme redirects, universal link redirects, and system browser-based authorization flows. Verify that your authorization endpoint correctly validates mobile redirect URIs and that generated tokens work appropriately with mobile application lifecycles and background/foreground transitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise SSO Integration</strong> tests your provider with enterprise single sign-on solutions and identity federation systems. Many organizations use OAuth2 providers as identity sources for enterprise applications, SAML identity providers, and other federation scenarios. Test integration scenarios where your OAuth2 provider serves as an identity source for enterprise SSO systems.</p>\n<p>Create test configurations where enterprise SSO solutions like Auth0, Okta, or Azure Active Directory can federate identity from your OAuth2 provider. Test user provisioning, attribute mapping, and session management across federated identity scenarios.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resource-server-integration-testing\">Resource Server Integration Testing</h4>\n<p>Resource server integration testing verifies that APIs and services can successfully validate tokens issued by your OAuth2 provider and enforce appropriate access controls based on token content.</p>\n<p><strong>JWT Validation Integration</strong> tests that resource servers can validate JWT access tokens using your public keys and JWT validation libraries. Deploy test resource servers that use JWT validation libraries like <code>jwt-go</code> for Go, <code>PyJWT</code> for Python, or <code>jsonwebtoken</code> for Node.js. These servers should fetch your public keys from your JWKS endpoint and validate incoming access tokens.</p>\n<p>Test various token validation scenarios including valid tokens (should grant access), expired tokens (should deny access), tampered tokens (should deny access), and revoked tokens (should deny access after checking revocation status). Verify that resource servers correctly extract user identity, client identity, and scope information from validated tokens.</p>\n<p><strong>Introspection-Based Validation Integration</strong> tests resource servers that use token introspection for validation instead of local JWT validation. Deploy test resource servers that call your introspection endpoint to validate opaque tokens or JWT tokens. Test that these servers correctly handle introspection responses and make appropriate access control decisions based on the returned token metadata.</p>\n<p>Test introspection integration scenarios including successful validation (active tokens), failed validation (inactive tokens), and error handling (network failures, authentication errors). Resource servers should gracefully handle introspection endpoint unavailability and implement appropriate caching strategies for validation results.</p>\n<p><strong>Scope-Based Authorization Integration</strong> tests that resource servers correctly enforce authorization based on token scopes. Create test APIs with different endpoints that require different scope combinations, then test access using tokens with various scope grants. Verify that tokens with insufficient scopes are rejected while tokens with appropriate scopes grant access to authorized resources.</p>\n<p>Test complex scope scenarios including hierarchical scopes (where <code>admin</code> scope grants <code>user</code> scope access), scope intersection requirements (endpoints that require multiple specific scopes), and dynamic scope evaluation (where scope requirements change based on request context).</p>\n<h4 id=\"load-and-performance-integration-testing\">Load and Performance Integration Testing</h4>\n<p>Load testing validates that your OAuth2 provider maintains correct behavior and security properties under realistic traffic loads and concurrent usage patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Flow Load Testing</strong> simulates concurrent authorization flows from multiple clients and users. Generate test scenarios with hundreds of simultaneous authorization requests, consent decisions, and token exchanges. Measure response times, error rates, and system resource utilization during peak load scenarios.</p>\n<p>Test load scenarios that stress different components—concurrent client registrations, simultaneous authorization code generation, parallel token exchanges, and concurrent UserInfo requests. Verify that your provider maintains security properties (no token reuse, proper randomness) even under heavy concurrent load.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Validation Load Testing</strong> simulates high-frequency token validation scenarios that resource servers typically generate. Create test scenarios with thousands of concurrent JWT validation operations, introspection requests, and revocation checks. Measure the performance impact of revocation list checks and JWKS key fetching under load.</p>\n<p>Test caching effectiveness by monitoring cache hit rates, cache invalidation performance, and memory usage during high-frequency validation scenarios. Verify that caching improves performance without compromising security properties like immediate token revocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Database and Storage Load Testing</strong> validates that your provider&#39;s data storage systems can handle realistic usage patterns without compromising data consistency or security. Test concurrent client registrations, authorization code generation, token storage, and consent record management under load.</p>\n<p>Monitor database performance metrics including connection pool utilization, query performance, and lock contention during high-concurrency scenarios. Test database failure scenarios and verify that your provider handles database unavailability gracefully without compromising security or losing critical data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Integration Testing Critical Insight</strong>: Real-world OAuth2 deployments face complex integration challenges including network failures, partial system outages, clock skew between systems, and varying client implementation quality.

Just as a doctor follows a structured approach — gathering symptoms, running diagnostic tests, reviewing past medical history, and applying proven treatments — debugging OAuth2 implementations requires methodical investigation. The &quot;symptoms&quot; are user reports and error logs, the &quot;diagnostic tests&quot; are specialized OAuth2 debugging tools and protocol analyzers, the &quot;medical history&quot; is audit trails and token lifecycle tracking, and the &quot;treatments&quot; are specific fixes for well-known OAuth2 security and implementation issues. Like medicine, OAuth2 debugging benefits from pattern recognition — experienced practitioners quickly recognize common symptom clusters and know which diagnostic approaches yield the fastest path to resolution.</p>\n<p>The debugging process becomes particularly crucial in OAuth2 systems because security vulnerabilities often manifest as subtle behavioral anomalies rather than obvious crashes. A timing attack vulnerability might only be detectable through careful response time analysis, while a token binding flaw could allow privilege escalation without generating obvious error messages. This section establishes systematic diagnostic techniques that help developers identify both obvious functional bugs and subtle security vulnerabilities that could compromise the entire authorization system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-implementation-bugs\">Common Implementation Bugs</h3>\n<p>OAuth2 provider implementations exhibit predictable failure patterns that stem from the complex interaction between cryptographic operations, protocol state management, and security enforcement. Understanding these common bugs enables faster diagnosis and prevention of issues that could compromise security or break client application integrations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Steps</th>\n<th>Fix Implementation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Authorization codes accepted multiple times</td>\n<td>Missing single-use enforcement in code validation</td>\n<td>Check database for <code>AuthorizationCode.Used</code> field updates</td>\n<td>Set <code>Used = true</code> atomically during token exchange</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PKCE bypass allows code interception</td>\n<td>Code verifier validation skipped or incorrect</td>\n<td>Test with invalid code_verifier in token request</td>\n<td>Implement proper SHA256 challenge verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refresh token families not revoked on theft</td>\n<td>Token reuse detection missing or incomplete</td>\n<td>Monitor for refresh token usage after rotation</td>\n<td>Revoke entire <code>TokenFamily</code> when old token reused</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client secrets compared with timing vulnerability</td>\n<td>Using <code>==</code> operator instead of constant-time comparison</td>\n<td>Measure response times for correct vs incorrect secrets</td>\n<td>Use <code>subtle.ConstantTimeCompare</code> for all secret validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JWT tokens accepted after explicit revocation</td>\n<td>Revocation list not checked during validation</td>\n<td>Test token access after calling revocation endpoint</td>\n<td>Query <code>RevocationStore</code> during <code>JWTValidator.ValidateToken</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization codes bound to wrong redirect URI</td>\n<td>URI validation logic flawed or missing</td>\n<td>Submit code exchange with different redirect_uri</td>\n<td>Store and validate <code>RedirectURI</code> in <code>AuthorizationCode</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State parameter validation bypassed</td>\n<td>CSRF protection implementation incomplete</td>\n<td>Omit state parameter or use predictable values</td>\n<td>Generate cryptographically random state, validate exact match</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token endpoint accepts expired authorization codes</td>\n<td>Expiration checking missing or incorrect</td>\n<td>Submit token request with old authorization code</td>\n<td>Check <code>AuthorizationCode.ExpiresAt</code> before token issuance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope escalation in token exchange</td>\n<td>Granted scopes exceed originally requested scopes</td>\n<td>Request broader scopes in token exchange than authorization</td>\n<td>Copy exact <code>Scope</code> from <code>AuthorizationCode</code> to tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client authentication bypassed entirely</td>\n<td>Client credential validation missing</td>\n<td>Submit token requests without client authentication</td>\n<td>Validate client credentials before processing grant requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Access tokens lack proper audience validation</td>\n<td>JWT aud claim missing or not validated</td>\n<td>Use access token with unintended resource server</td>\n<td>Include and validate <code>aud</code> claim in <code>JWTGenerator</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refresh token rotation creates orphaned tokens</td>\n<td>Database cleanup logic incomplete</td>\n<td>Monitor database growth after token rotations</td>\n<td>Implement <code>RevokeTokenFamily</code> with cascade deletion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserInfo endpoint leaks unauthorized claims</td>\n<td>Scope-to-claims filtering bypassed</td>\n<td>Request UserInfo with limited scopes, check response</td>\n<td>Filter claims through <code>ClaimsMapper.FilterClaims</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rate limiting ineffective against distributed attacks</td>\n<td>Rate limits applied per-IP instead of per-client</td>\n<td>Coordinate attack from multiple IP addresses</td>\n<td>Implement composite rate limiting by client_id and IP</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consent decisions not persisted correctly</td>\n<td><code>ConsentRecord</code> creation or retrieval logic flawed</td>\n<td>Grant consent, refresh page, observe re-prompting</td>\n<td>Store consent with proper <code>UserID</code> and <code>ClientID</code> binding</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Assuming OAuth2 Errors Are Always Client Mistakes</strong></p>\n<p>Many developers assume that OAuth2 protocol violations always indicate client implementation errors, leading them to focus debugging efforts on client applications rather than their own provider implementation. This assumption delays resolution because the actual bug often lies in the authorization server&#39;s parameter validation, token generation, or protocol state management. For example, when clients report &quot;invalid_grant&quot; errors during code exchange, the issue might be the provider&#39;s authorization code expiration logic rather than client timing problems.</p>\n<p>The correct debugging approach systematically validates the provider&#39;s implementation first — checking authorization code generation, storage, and validation logic — before concluding that client applications are at fault. This prevents debugging dead ends and ensures that subtle provider bugs don&#39;t get misclassified as integration issues.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overlooking Race Conditions in Token Operations</strong></p>\n<p>OAuth2 implementations often contain race conditions that only manifest under concurrent load, making them difficult to reproduce in development environments. Common examples include authorization codes being marked as used after validation but before token generation (allowing double redemption), refresh token rotation logic that doesn&#39;t properly handle concurrent requests from the same client, and client registration operations that can create duplicate client_id values under specific timing conditions.</p>\n<p>These race conditions require specific testing approaches that simulate concurrent operations rather than sequential test cases. Debugging them effectively requires understanding the critical sections in token lifecycle management and implementing proper database transaction isolation to prevent state corruption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-techniques\">Debugging Techniques</h3>\n<p>Effective OAuth2 debugging requires specialized techniques that account for the protocol&#39;s cryptographic nature, multi-step flows, and security-sensitive operations. Standard application debugging approaches often fall short because OAuth2 bugs frequently involve subtle timing issues, cryptographic validation failures, and protocol state mismatches that don&#39;t generate obvious error messages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"structured-logging-strategy\">Structured Logging Strategy</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 providers should implement comprehensive audit logging that captures every significant protocol operation with sufficient context for post-incident analysis.

Debugging token binding issues requires systematic verification that tokens cannot be used outside their intended context.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Code Binding Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization codes must be bound to the specific client that initiated the authorization request and the exact redirect URI specified in that request.

Performance debugging requires identifying which database operations are causing latency spikes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Client Lookup Performance</strong>: Profile <code>ClientStore.GetClient</code> operations under various load conditions to identify slow queries or missing database indexes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Authorization Code Storage</strong>: Measure <code>AuthorizationCode</code> creation and retrieval performance, particularly focusing on cleanup operations that remove expired codes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Refresh Token Management</strong>: Profile refresh token rotation operations, which involve creating new tokens, marking old tokens as revoked, and potentially revoking entire token families.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Revocation List Queries</strong>: Measure performance of <code>RevocationStore.IsRevoked</code> operations, which occur during every token validation and can become expensive without proper indexing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"concurrency-issue-identification\">Concurrency Issue Identification</h4>\n<p>OAuth2 implementations must handle concurrent requests safely while maintaining protocol correctness and security properties. Concurrency bugs often manifest as race conditions that corrupt protocol state or create security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Authorization Code Race Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>Authorization codes must be single-use, but concurrent token exchange requests can create race conditions where the same code is successfully exchanged multiple times before the database can enforce single-use restrictions.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Race Condition Detection Test:\n1. Generate authorization code through normal authorization flow\n2. Submit 10 concurrent token exchange requests using same authorization code\n3. Verify that exactly one request succeeds with valid tokens\n4. Verify that all other requests fail with invalid_grant error\n5. Verify that authorization code is marked as Used=true in database\n6. Confirm no orphaned tokens exist from failed concurrent exchanges</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Refresh Token Rotation Concurrency</strong></p>\n<p>Refresh token rotation logic can create race

operations can create race conditions if multiple registration requests attempt to create clients with the same identifiers or if cleanup operations interfere with active registration processes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Client ID Generation</strong>: Test concurrent client registration to verify that <code>client_id</code> generation produces unique values without collisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Redirect URI Validation</strong>: Verify that redirect URI validation during registration doesn&#39;t conflict with concurrent client lookup operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Secret Hash Generation</strong>: Ensure that bcrypt hash generation for client secrets operates correctly under concurrent load without timing vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Database Transaction Isolation</strong>: Verify that client creation uses appropriate database transaction isolation to prevent partial registration

beyond the core implementation covered in milestones 1-4, establishing a foundation for production-ready features and enterprise integration capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-software-evolution-ecosystem\">Mental Model: Software Evolution Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Think of these future extensions like expanding a successful local business into a multi-location enterprise. Your OAuth2 provider starts as a focused identity service solving the core authentication and authorization problem, much like a local bank serving basic checking and savings accounts. But as your organization grows and integrates with partners, you need additional services: international transfers (federation), business credit lines (advanced security features), automated teller networks (additional grant types), and corporate reporting (operational features).</p>\n<p>Each extension builds upon the solid foundation established in the core implementation, adding specialized capabilities without disrupting the essential services that existing clients depend upon. The key insight is that these extensions follow the same architectural patterns and security principles as the core system—they&#39;re not bolted-on afterthoughts, but natural evolutions that leverage the existing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Just as a bank&#39;s expansion into investment services still relies on the same customer identification and account management systems, OAuth2 extensions reuse the same client registration, token generation, and validation mechanisms while adding new endpoints, flows, and integration points. The mental model helps us understand that each extension should feel like a natural part of the ecosystem, not a foreign addition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-grant-types\">Additional Grant Types</h3>\n<p>Beyond the authorization code flow and client credentials grant implemented in the core milestones, the OAuth2 ecosystem includes several specialized grant types designed for specific use cases and device capabilities. Each grant type represents a different approach to the fundamental OAuth2 challenge: how do we securely establish trust between a client application and the authorization server when the capabilities and constraints of the client environment vary significantly?</p>\n<p>The <strong>device authorization grant</strong> (RFC 8628) addresses the challenge of OAuth2 authentication on input-constrained devices like smart TVs, gaming consoles, or IoT devices that lack a web browser or have limited text input capabilities. Think of this like trying to log into Netflix on your TV—you don&#39;t want to type your password with a remote control, so instead the TV displays a code that you enter on your phone or computer where typing is easier.</p>\n<p>The device flow introduces a polling-based mechanism where the device requests a device code and user code from a device authorization endpoint, displays the user code to the user, and then polls the token endpoint while the user completes authentication on a secondary device. This requires new endpoints and state management beyond the core implementation.</p>\n<p>Device Flow Data Structures:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Structure</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>DeviceAuthorizationRequest</code></td>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Identifying the device application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Scope</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Requested permissions for device access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DeviceAuthorizationResponse</code></td>\n<td>DeviceCode</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Server-generated code for device polling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>UserCode</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Human-readable code for user entry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>VerificationURI</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>URL where user enters the user code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>VerificationURIComplete</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Optional URL with user code pre-filled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>ExpiresIn</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Lifetime of the device code in seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Interval</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Minimum polling interval in seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>DeviceTokenRequest</code></td>\n<td>GrantType</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Must be &quot;urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>DeviceCode</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>The device code from authorization response</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>ClientID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Device client identifier</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>implicit grant</strong> was historically used for single-page applications but is now deprecated in favor of authorization code with PKCE due to security concerns. However, understanding its mechanics helps illustrate why PKCE was necessary. The implicit flow returns access tokens directly from the authorization endpoint in the URL fragment, bypassing the token endpoint entirely. This eliminates the need for client authentication but creates security vulnerabilities around token exposure in browser history and referer headers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Insight</strong>: The deprecation of the implicit grant demonstrates how OAuth2 security best practices evolve. What seemed like a reasonable trade-off for browser limitations in 2012 became a security liability as we better understood browser security models and as CORS enabled cross-origin requests from JavaScript.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Custom grant types</strong> allow organizations to implement domain-specific authentication flows while maintaining OAuth2 token compatibility. Examples include integrating with legacy authentication systems, implementing step-up authentication for sensitive operations, or creating specialized flows for partner integrations. Custom grants follow the same token endpoint pattern but with organization-specific grant type identifiers and validation logic.</p>\n<p>Custom Grant Implementation Patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pattern</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Validation Requirements</th>\n<th>Token Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Legacy Integration</td>\n<td>Bridge to SAML/LDAP systems</td>\n<td>Validate external assertion</td>\n<td>Standard OAuth2 tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Step-up Authentication</td>\n<td>Additional security for sensitive ops</td>\n<td>Verify primary token + secondary auth</td>\n<td>Enhanced scope tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partner Exchange</td>\n<td>B2B integration flows</td>\n<td>Validate partner credentials + user consent</td>\n<td>Audience-specific tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate-based</td>\n<td>PKI client authentication</td>\n<td>Validate client certificate chain</td>\n<td>Client-bound tokens</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Device Flow State Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Device flows require managing long-lived authorization requests while users complete authentication on secondary devices, creating new state tracking requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: In-memory maps, database tables with TTL, Redis with expiration</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Database table with TTL and background cleanup, similar to authorization code storage</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Reuses existing database patterns, survives server restarts, enables horizontal scaling with shared database</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Adds one new table but leverages existing cleanup mechanisms; polling load requires rate limiting</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The device authorization endpoint introduces new security considerations around code generation and polling behavior. Device codes must be cryptographically random and sufficiently long to prevent brute force attacks, while user codes should be short and human-readable but still unpredictable.

id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This glossary provides definitions for all milestones (1-4), establishing clear terminology used throughout the OAuth2/OIDC provider implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-technical-dictionary-for-authorization-systems\">Mental Model: Technical Dictionary for Authorization Systems</h3>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a specialized dictionary for authorization systems, similar to how medical professionals use precise terminology to avoid confusion in high-stakes environments. Just as a doctor distinguishes between &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;chronic&quot; conditions because the treatment implications are vastly different, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect use precise terminology where subtle distinctions have significant security implications. For example, an &quot;authorization code&quot; versus an &quot;access token&quot; might sound similar to a newcomer, but they serve completely different purposes in the security model - one is a temporary voucher for obtaining credentials, while the other is the actual credential for accessing resources.</p>\n<p>This glossary serves as your reference guide for understanding the precise meaning of terms used throughout this design document. Each definition includes not just what the term means, but why the distinction matters for implementation and security. Understanding these terms precisely is crucial because OAuth2 and OIDC are security protocols where ambiguous language can lead to vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"oauth2-core-protocol-terms\">OAuth2 Core Protocol Terms</h3>\n<p>The foundational OAuth2 specification defines a specific vocabulary that must be understood precisely for secure implementation. These terms form the building blocks of all OAuth2 flows and security mechanisms.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Implementation Significance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>OAuth2</strong></td>\n<td>An authorization framework enabling third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts without exposing user credentials. Defined in RFC 6749.</td>\n<td>The core protocol that all our components implement. Understanding OAuth2 versus authentication protocols is crucial for security boundaries.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Authorization Server</strong></td>\n<td>The server that issues access tokens after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. In our implementation, this is the complete OAuth2 provider system.</td>\n<td>This is what we&#39;re building - the central security component that all clients trust for token issuance and validation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Resource Server</strong></td>\n<td>The server hosting protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.</td>\n<td>External systems that will validate our JWT tokens and enforce scope-based access control.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Client Application</strong></td>\n<td>An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with the resource owner&#39;s authorization. Also called &quot;OAuth2 client.&quot;</td>\n<td>Third-party applications that register with our system and request user authorization through standardized flows.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Resource Owner</strong></td>\n<td>An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an &quot;end-user.&quot;</td>\n<td>The user who owns the data and grants permission for client applications to access it on their behalf.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Authorization Grant</strong></td>\n<td>A credential representing the resource owner&#39;s authorization to access protected resources. OAuth2 defines several grant types including authorization code, client credentials, and refresh token.</td>\n<td>The security proof that a client has been authorized to access specific resources with specific scopes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Authorization Code</strong></td>\n<td>A temporary credential that represents the resource owner&#39;s authorization, designed to be exchanged for access tokens. Short-lived and single-use.</td>\n<td>Critical security token that must be bound to client and redirect URI, expire quickly (max 10 minutes), and be used exactly once.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Access Token</strong></td>\n<td>A credential used to access protected resources. In our implementation, these are signed JWT tokens containing claims about the authorization.</td>\n<td>The actual credential that resource servers validate. Must contain scope, expiration, and subject information for proper access control.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Refresh Token</strong></td>\n<td>A credential used to obtain new access tokens without requiring resource owner re-authorization. Long-lived but revocable.</td>\n<td>Enables long-term access while maintaining access token security through short lifetimes. Requires family tracking for theft detection.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"token-and-credential-management-terms\">Token and Credential Management Terms</h3>\n<p>Token lifecycle management is central to OAuth2 security. Understanding the precise meaning of token-related terms is essential for implementing secure token handling, validation, and revocation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Security Implications</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong></td>\n<td>A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. Consists of header, payload, and signature components separated by dots. Defined in RFC 7519.</td>\n<td>Our access tokens are JWTs, enabling stateless validation by resource servers. Signature verification and claims validation are critical for security.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Token Introspection</strong></td>\n<td>An OAuth2 extension (RFC 7662) that allows resource servers to query the authorization server about the state of an access token.</td>\n<td>Enables real-time token validation and revocation checking for resource servers that cannot validate JWTs locally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Token Revocation</strong></td>\n<td>An OAuth2 extension (RFC 7009) that allows clients to notify the authorization server that a token should no longer be considered valid.</td>\n<td>Critical for security incidents and user-initiated logout. Requires tracking revoked token IDs until expiration.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Client ID</strong></td>\n<td>A public identifier for OAuth2 client applications, generated during client registration. Not confidential and can appear in redirect URIs.</td>\n<td>Used to identify clients in authorization requests. Must be unpredictable to prevent client enumeration attacks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Client Secret</strong></td>\n<td>A confidential credential known only to the client and authorization server, used for client authentication.</td>\n<td>Must be stored as bcrypt hash, never in plaintext. Required for confidential clients but not public clients (mobile/SPA).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redirect URI</strong></td>\n<td>The URI where the authorization server redirects the user after completing authorization. Must be registered during client registration.</td>\n<td>Critical security boundary - exact string matching prevents authorization code theft through redirect manipulation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scope</strong></td>\n<td>A parameter that defines the specific permissions being requested by the client application. Maps to specific resource access or user claims.</td>\n<td>Determines what data access is granted. Must be validated against client&#39;s registered scopes and user consent decisions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>State Parameter</strong></td>\n<td>An unguessable random string used to maintain state between authorization request and callback, providing CSRF protection.</td>\n<td>Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks in authorization flows. Must be unpredictable and verified on callback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"openid-connect-terms\">OpenID Connect Terms</h3>\n<p>OpenID Connect adds an identity layer on top of OAuth2, introducing additional concepts for user authentication and profile information sharing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>OIDC-Specific Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>OpenID Connect (OIDC)</strong></td>\n<td>An identity layer on top of OAuth2, enabling clients to verify the identity of end-users and obtain basic profile information. Defined in OpenID Connect Core 1.0.</td>\n<td>Adds standardized user authentication and profile sharing to OAuth2&#39;s authorization framework.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ID Token</strong></td>\n<td>A security token that contains claims about the authentication of an end-user by an authorization server. Always a signed JWT in OIDC.</td>\n<td>Provides proof of user authentication to client applications. Contains authentication event information, not for API access.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>UserInfo Endpoint</strong></td>\n<td>An OIDC endpoint that returns claims about the authenticated end-user, protected by an OAuth2 access token.</td>\n<td>Provides user profile information based on granted scopes. Must validate access token and filter claims appropriately.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Claims</strong></td>\n<td>Pieces of information about an entity (typically the end-user). OIDC defines standard claims like <code>sub</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>picture</code>.</td>\n<td>User profile data returned by UserInfo endpoint. Must be filtered based on granted scopes and consent decisions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Standard Claims</strong></td>\n<td>OIDC-defined user profile fields such as <code>sub</code> (subject identifier), <code>name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, <code>family_name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>picture</code>, etc.</td>\n<td>Provides interoperability between OIDC providers and clients. Implementation must support core claims for compliance.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scope to Claims Mapping</strong></td>\n<td>The system that determines which user profile claims are returned based on the OAuth2 scopes granted to the client.</td>\n<td>Critical for privacy - ensures clients only receive user data they&#39;re authorized to access based on granted scopes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Discovery Document</strong></td>\n<td>A JSON document describing the OIDC provider&#39;s configuration, available at the well-known configuration endpoint.</td>\n<td>Enables automatic client configuration. Must accurately reflect provider capabilities and endpoint URLs.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Well-Known Configuration Endpoint</strong></td>\n<td>A standardized URL (<code>/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>) where OIDC providers publish their discovery document.</td>\n<td>Provides automated discovery of provider capabilities and endpoints for OIDC clients.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"pkce-and-security-extension-terms\">PKCE and Security Extension Terms</h3>\n<p>Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and other OAuth2 security extensions provide additional protection against various attack vectors.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n<th>Security Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)</strong></td>\n<td>An OAuth2 security extension (RFC 7636) that provides protection against authorization code interception attacks, especially for public clients.</td>\n<td>Essential for mobile and single-page applications.

OpenID Connect identity provider that enables secure third-party application authorization. This system solves the critical challenge of allowing applications to access user data without exposing user credentials, while maintaining strong security guarantees through cryptographic tokens and standardized flows.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This provides foundational context for all milestones (1-4)\n\n### Mental Model: Digital Valet Key System\n\nBefore diving into the technical complexities of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect, let's establish an intuitive mental model that will help us understand the core authorization problem these protocols solve.\n\nImagine you're visiting a luxury hotel and need to leave your car with the valet. You could hand over your main car key, but that would give the valet complete access to everything: they could drive to Las Vegas, access your glove compartment, adjust your seat settings, and even steal your car. Instead, modern cars provide a **valet key** - a special key that starts the engine and unlocks the doors, but cannot access the trunk or glove compartment, and often has speed limitations programmed into the car's computer.\n\nThis valet key system embodies the core principle of OAuth2: **delegated authorization with limited scope**. Just as the valet key grants specific, limited access to your car without compromising your full ownership, OAuth2 allows applications to access specific user data without requiring the user's complete credentials.\n\nLet's extend this analogy to understand the key participants in OAuth2:\n\n- **You (the car owner)** represent the **Resource Owner** - the user who owns the data\n- **Your car** represents the **Protected Resource** - the user's data (photos, contacts, emails)  \n- **The valet service** represents the **Client Application** - the third-party app requesting access\n- **The valet key** represents the **Access Token** - a limited-capability credential\n- **The hotel's key management system** represents the **Authorization Server** - the OAuth2 provider that issues tokens\n- **The car's computer that validates the valet key** represents the **Resource Server** - the API that hosts the protected data\n\nWhen you authorize the valet service, you're not giving them your master key (password). Instead, the hotel's key management system creates a temporary, limited-capability key specifically for this interaction. The car's computer can verify this key's authenticity and enforce its limitations automatically.\n\n> **Key Insight**: OAuth2 eliminates the need for password sharing by introducing a token-based delegation system where the user grants specific, revocable permissions to applications without exposing their primary credentials.\n\nThis mental model helps us understand why building a secure OAuth2 provider is challenging - we're essentially building the entire \"hotel key management system\" that can issue various types of limited-capability keys, track their usage, enforce their restrictions, and revoke them when necessary.\n\n### Existing Authentication Approaches\n\nTo appreciate why OAuth2 represents a significant improvement in application security, let's examine the authentication approaches that preceded it and understand their fundamental limitations.\n\n#### Password Sharing Approach\n\nThe most primitive approach to third-party application authorization involves users sharing their actual username and password with the requesting application. While simple to implement, this approach creates severe security and usability problems.\n\n| Aspect | Password Sharing Approach | Problems |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------|\n| **User Experience** | User enters their Facebook/Google password directly into third-party app | Users must trust every app with their most sensitive credentials |\n| **Access Control** | App gains complete access to user's account | No way to limit what the app can do - it can read, modify, or delete anything |\n| **Credential Management** | App must store user's actual password (often in plaintext) | Creates honey pot targets for attackers; password breaches affect all apps |\n| **Revocation** | User must change their password to revoke access | Breaks access for ALL apps and devices, not just the compromised one |\n| **Auditability** | No distinction between user actions and app actions | Impossible to track which actions came from which app |\n| **Password Rotation** | User changing password breaks all connected apps | Forces users to avoid password rotation, weakening overall security |\n\nConsider a concrete scenario: Sarah wants to use a photo printing service that can access her Google Photos. Under the password sharing model, she would enter her Google username and password into PhotoPrint's website. Now PhotoPrint can read her Gmail, modify her Google Drive files, change her account settings, and even lock her out by changing her password. If PhotoPrint's database gets breached, Sarah's Google credentials are compromised, forcing her to change her password and reconfigure every device and application that accesses her Google account.\n\n#### API Key Approach\n\nRecognizing the problems with password sharing, many services introduced API keys - long-lived tokens that applications could use instead of passwords. While an improvement, this approach still has significant limitations.\n\n| Aspect | API Key Approach | Limitations |\n|--------|------------------|-------------|\n| **Scope Control** | API key typically grants broad access to user's account | Limited ability to restrict access to specific resources or actions |\n| **User Involvement** | User must manually generate and copy-paste API keys | Complex setup process; users often confused about key generation |\n| **Expiration** | Keys often never expire or have very long lifespans | Compromised keys remain valid indefinitely; no automatic rotation |\n| **Granular Permissions** | Single key for all operations | Cannot grant read-only access or limit to specific data types |\n| **Revocation** | User must manually revoke keys through provider's interface | No standardized way for apps to check if key is still valid |\n| **Multi-User Apps** | Each user must generate separate API keys | Apps must manage complex key-to-user mapping; no unified flow |\n\nThe API key approach works reasonably well for developer-to-service integration (like accessing a weather API), but breaks down for consumer applications that need to access data from multiple users across different services.\n\n#### OAuth2 Approach\n\nOAuth2 fundamentally changes the authorization model by introducing a standardized delegation protocol that addresses the limitations of both password sharing and API keys.\n\n| Aspect | OAuth2 Approach | Benefits |\n|--------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Credential Security** | User never shares password with third-party apps | Eliminates password exposure; apps receive opaque tokens instead |\n| **Granular Permissions** | Apps request specific scopes (read photos, send emails) | Users can approve limited access; principle of least privilege |\n| **Time-Limited Access** | Access tokens have short expiration times (15 minutes - 1 hour) | Reduces blast radius of compromised tokens |\n| **Standardized Flow** | Consistent authorization experience across all providers | Users learn one flow; developers implement one protocol |\n| **Revocation** | Users can revoke access per-application without affecting others | Fine-grained access control; easy to remove misbehaving apps |\n| **Refresh Capability** | Refresh tokens allow apps to get new access tokens | Long-running apps don't need user re-authorization |\n| **Auditability** | Clear separation between user actions and app actions | Providers can track which app performed which operations |\n\nThe OAuth2 flow works like this: when PhotoPrint wants to access Sarah's Google Photos, it redirects her to Google's authorization server. Google authenticates Sarah using her normal credentials (which PhotoPrint never sees), shows her exactly what PhotoPrint is requesting access to, and asks for her approval. If she approves, Google issues PhotoPrint a limited-capability access token that can only read photos from her account. This token expires after an hour, and Sarah can revoke it at any time through her Google account settings.\n\n> **Design Insight**: OAuth2's key innovation is the introduction of an intermediary (the authorization server) that translates user consent into limited-capability tokens, enabling secure delegation without credential sharing.\n\n### Core Security Challenges\n\nBuilding a secure OAuth2 provider involves solving several complex security challenges that don't exist in simpler authentication systems. Understanding these challenges is crucial for implementing a system that can withstand real-world attacks.\n\n#### Cryptographic Token Management\n\nOAuth2 providers must generate, sign, validate, and revoke millions of tokens while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees. This presents several specific challenges:\n\n**Secure Random Number Generation**: Authorization codes, client secrets, and tokens must be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators. Weak randomness can enable attackers to predict future tokens or brute-force existing ones. The provider must ensure sufficient entropy is available and that the random number generator is properly seeded.\n\n**JWT Signing and Verification**: Access tokens implemented as JWTs require asymmetric cryptography for signing and verification. The provider must securely manage private keys used for signing, ensure proper key rotation, and handle signature verification edge cases. Additionally, the choice of signing algorithm (RS256, ES256, etc.) affects both security and performance characteristics.\n\n**Token Binding and Replay Protection**: Tokens must be cryptographically bound to specific clients and contexts to prevent replay attacks. This involves validating that the entity presenting a token is the same entity it was issued to, which becomes complex in distributed systems with multiple resource servers.\n\n| Security Property | Challenge | OAuth2 Solution |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Confidentiality** | Tokens contain sensitive authorization information | Opaque tokens for authorization codes; signed JWTs for access tokens |\n| **Integrity** | Prevent token modification by attackers | Cryptographic signatures; constant-time comparison for validation |\n| **Authenticity** | Verify tokens were issued by legitimate authorization server | Asymmetric signatures; well-known public key endpoints |\n| **Non-repudiation** | Prove which entity performed which action | Token-to-client binding; audit logs with token identifiers |\n| **Freshness** | Prevent replay of old tokens | Short expiration times; timestamp validation; nonce handling |\n\n#### Distributed Security State Management\n\nUnlike simple session-based authentication where state exists on a single server, OAuth2 providers must maintain security-critical state across distributed systems and time periods.\n\n**Authorization Code State**: Authorization codes must be single-use, short-lived, and bound to specific clients and redirect URIs. The provider must track which codes have been used and prevent replay attacks, while handling the race conditions that can occur when multiple systems attempt to exchange the same code simultaneously.\n\n**Token Family Tracking**: Refresh token rotation requires tracking \"token families\" - chains of related refresh tokens issued for the same authorization grant. If an old refresh token is reused (indicating possible token theft), the entire token family must be revoked. This requires maintaining historical token relationships across potentially millions of active sessions.\n\n**Consent and Scope Management**: The provider must remember which users have granted which permissions to which clients, enabling features like \"skip consent screen for previously authorized scopes\" while ensuring scope creep doesn't occur when apps request additional permissions.\n\n| State Management Challenge | Complexity | Failure Impact |\n|---------------------------|------------|----------------|\n| **Cross-Server Consistency** | Multiple servers must see token revocations immediately | Revoked tokens remain valid on some servers; security breach |\n| **Partial System Failures** | Network partitions, database failures, cache inconsistencies | Users locked out; tokens valid longer than intended |\n| **Race Conditions** | Concurrent token exchanges, refresh operations, revocations | Double-spending of authorization codes; token family corruption |\n| **State Explosion** | Millions of tokens, codes, and consent records | Memory exhaustion; slow lookups; data consistency challenges |\n\n#### Protocol-Level Attack Resistance\n\nOAuth2 and OpenID Connect specifications address numerous attack vectors, but implementing these defenses correctly requires deep understanding of web security principles.\n\n**PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: Modern OAuth2 implementations must support PKCE to protect against authorization code interception attacks, particularly on mobile devices and single-page applications. This requires generating cryptographically secure code challenges, properly validating code verifiers using SHA256 hashing, and enforcing PKCE for public clients.\n\n**Redirect URI Validation**: One of the most critical security controls in OAuth2 is strict validation of redirect URIs. The provider must perform exact string matching against pre-registered URIs, resist various bypass attempts (subdomain attacks, open redirects, homograph attacks), and handle edge cases like custom URL schemes for mobile apps.\n\n**State Parameter Handling**: The state parameter prevents CSRF attacks by allowing clients to verify that authorization responses correspond to their requests. The provider must preserve state values across the authorization flow and ensure they are validated by clients.\n\n> **Security Principle**: OAuth2 security depends on the weakest link in a complex chain of validations. A single bypass in redirect URI validation, PKCE verification, or token binding can compromise the entire system.\n\n#### Real-World Implementation Pitfalls\n\nThe OAuth2 and OIDC specifications leave many security-critical implementation details to the provider, creating opportunities for subtle vulnerabilities.\n\n**Timing Attack Vulnerabilities**: Token validation, client secret verification, and authorization code lookup must use constant-time comparison algorithms to prevent timing-based attacks where attackers can determine valid prefixes of secrets by measuring response times.\n\n**Token Leakage Through Logs**: Access tokens and refresh tokens must never appear in application logs, error messages, or debugging output. This requires careful sanitization of log entries and error responses while maintaining sufficient debugging information for operational support.\n\n**Cryptographic Agility**: The provider must support algorithm evolution (moving from RS256 to ES256, increasing key sizes) without breaking existing clients. This requires versioned key management and graceful algorithm migration strategies.\n\n| Attack Vector | Technical Challenge | Mitigation Complexity |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Authorization Code Injection** | Attacker intercepts codes via network, malware, or device sharing | PKCE implementation; short code lifetimes; TLS enforcement |\n| **Token Sidejacking** | Tokens stolen via XSS, network interception, or server logs | Secure token storage; SameSite cookies; log sanitization |\n| **Redirect URI Manipulation** | Bypass redirect validation to send codes to attacker domains | Exact string matching; homograph detection; scheme validation |\n| **Scope Creep** | Apps gradually request more permissions than originally granted | Consent re-prompting; scope diff detection; audit logging |\n| **Client Impersonation** | Malicious apps pretend to be legitimate clients | Client authentication; app attestation; dynamic registration controls |\n\nThe complexity of these security challenges explains why many organizations choose to use hosted OAuth2 providers (like Auth0, Okta, or cloud provider services) rather than building their own. However, understanding these challenges is essential for developers who need to implement custom authorization logic, integrate with existing systems, or meet specific compliance requirements that hosted solutions cannot address.\n\n> **Design Philosophy**: A secure OAuth2 provider must assume that every component can be compromised and design defenses that limit the blast radius of any single point of failure. This defense-in-depth approach requires multiple layers of validation, cryptographic protection, and audit logging.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\nBuilding a production-ready OAuth2 provider requires careful selection of cryptographic libraries, storage systems, and web frameworks that provide the security primitives needed for token management.\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Web Framework** | `net/http` with `gorilla/mux` for routing | `gin-gonic/gin` or `echo` for middleware support |\n| **Cryptography** | Go's `crypto` package for JWT signing | `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` for JWT convenience methods |\n| **Database** | SQLite with `database/sql` for development | PostgreSQL with `lib/pq` for production |\n| **Caching** | In-memory `sync.Map` for token blacklist | Redis with `go-redis/redis/v8` for distributed cache |\n| **Secure Random** | `crypto/rand` for all token generation | Hardware security module (HSM) integration |\n| **Password Hashing** | `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` for client secrets | `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` for stronger protection |\n| **Configuration** | Environment variables with `os.Getenv` | `viper` for structured configuration management |\n| **Logging** | Standard `log` package with careful sanitization | `logrus` or `zap` for structured logging |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nOrganize your OAuth2 provider codebase to separate concerns clearly and make testing straightforward.

These implementations handle essential functionality so you can focus on the authorization logic.\n\n**Secure Random Number Generator** (`internal/crypto/random.go`):\n\n```go\npackage crypto\n\nimport (\n    \"crypto/rand\"\n    \"encoding/base64\"\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\n// TokenGenerator provides cryptographically secure random token generation\ntype TokenGenerator struct{}\n\n// GenerateAuthorizationCode creates a 32-byte random authorization code\n// encoded as URL-safe base64 (43 characters without padding)\nfunc (tg *TokenGenerator) GenerateAuthorizationCode() (string, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Create 32-byte buffer for random data\n    // TODO 2: Fill buffer with crypto/rand.Read()\n    // TODO 3: Encode as URL-safe base64 without padding\n    // TODO 4: Return error if random generation fails\n}\n\n// GenerateClientSecret creates a 32-byte random client secret\n// Returns both the raw secret and its bcrypt hash for storage\nfunc (tg *TokenGenerator) GenerateClientSecret() (secret, hash string, err error) {\n    // TODO 1: Generate 32 random bytes for the secret\n    // TODO 2: Encode secret as base64 for client use\n    // TODO 3: Hash secret with bcrypt cost 12\n    // TODO 4: Return both plaintext secret (for client) and hash (for storage)\n}\n\n// GenerateState creates a 16-byte random state parameter for CSRF protection\nfunc (tg *TokenGenerator) GenerateState() (string, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Generate 16 random bytes\n    // TODO 2: Encode as hex string\n    // TODO 3: Return error if random generation fails\n}\n```\n\n**OAuth2 Error Response Formatter** (`internal/web/errors.go`):\n\n```go\npackage web\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\n// OAuth2Error represents a standardized OAuth2 error response\ntype OAuth2Error struct {\n    Error            string `json:\"error\"`\n    ErrorDescription string `json:\"error_description,omitempty\"`\n    ErrorURI         string `json:\"error_uri,omitempty\"`\n    State            string `json:\"state,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// WriteOAuth2Error sends a standardized OAuth2 error response\nfunc WriteOAuth2Error(w http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, errorCode, description string) {\n    w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n    w.Header().Set(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-store\")\n    w.Header().Set(\"Pragma\", \"no-cache\")\n    w.WriteHeader(statusCode)\n    \n    response := OAuth2Error{\n        Error:            errorCode,\n        ErrorDescription: description,\n    }\n    \n    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(response)\n}\n\n// Common OAuth2 error codes as constants\nconst (\n    ErrorInvalidRequest          = \"invalid_request\"\n    ErrorInvalidClient           = \"invalid_client\"\n    ErrorInvalidGrant            = \"invalid_grant\"\n    ErrorUnauthorizedClient      = \"unauthorized_client\"\n    ErrorUnsupportedGrantType    = \"unsupported_grant_type\"\n    ErrorInvalidScope            = \"invalid_scope\"\n    ErrorAccessDenied            = \"access_denied\"\n    ErrorUnsupportedResponseType = \"unsupported_response_type\"\n    ErrorServerError             = \"server_error\"\n    ErrorTemporarilyUnavailable  = \"temporarily_unavailable\"\n)\n```\n\n**Basic HTTP Middleware** (`internal/web/middleware.go`):\n\n```go\npackage web\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\n// SecurityHeaders adds security-related HTTP headers to all responses\nfunc SecurityHeaders(next http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        w.Header().Set(\"X-Content-Type-Options\", \"nosniff\")\n        w.Header().Set(\"X-Frame-Options\", \"DENY\")\n        w.Header().Set(\"X-XSS-Protection\", \"1; mode=block\")\n        w.Header().Set(\"Referrer-Policy\", \"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\")\n        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n    })\n}\n\n// RequestTimeout enforces a maximum request processing time\nfunc RequestTimeout(timeout time.Duration) func(http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return func(next http.Handler) http.Handler {\n        return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n            ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), timeout)\n            defer cancel()\n            next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Core Logic Skeleton Code\n\nThe following interfaces and function signatures define the core OAuth2 authorization logic you'll implement across the four milestones. Each function maps to specific algorithm steps described in later sections.\n\n**Client Registration Interface** (`internal/client/client.go`):\n\n```go\npackage client\n\nimport \"time\"\n\n// Client represents a registered OAuth2 application\ntype Client struct {\n    ClientID      string    `json:\"client_id\"`\n    ClientSecret  string    `json:\"-\"`           // Never serialize to JSON\n    SecretHash    string    `json:\"-\"`           // Bcrypt hash for storage\n    Name          string    `json:\"name\"`\n    RedirectURIs  []string  `json:\"redirect_uris\"`\n    GrantTypes    []string  `json:\"grant_types\"`\n    Scopes        []string  `json:\"scopes\"`\n    CreatedAt     time.Time `json:\"created_at\"`\n}\n\n// ClientStore handles OAuth client persistence and retrieval\ntype ClientStore interface {\n    CreateClient(client *Client) error\n    GetClient(clientID string) (*Client, error)\n    ValidateClientCredentials(clientID, clientSecret string) (*Client, error)\n}\n\n// RegisterClient creates a new OAuth2 client with generated credentials\nfunc RegisterClient(store ClientStore, name string, redirectURIs []string) (*Client, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Generate cryptographically random client_id (16 bytes, base64)\n    // TODO 2: Generate client_secret and its bcrypt hash\n    // TODO 3: Validate that all redirect URIs are absolute URLs with https scheme\n    // TODO 4: Create Client struct with generated values and current timestamp\n    // TODO 5: Store client in persistent storage via ClientStore\n    // TODO 6: Return client with plaintext secret for one-time display to developer\n}\n```\n\n**Authorization Code Flow** (`internal/auth/authorization.go`):\n\n```go\npackage auth\n\nimport \"time\"\n\n// AuthorizationRequest represents the parsed authorization request parameters\ntype AuthorizationRequest struct {\n    ClientID            string\n    RedirectURI         string\n    Scope               string\n    State               string\n    ResponseType        string\n    CodeChallenge       string\n    CodeChallengeMethod string\n}\n\n// AuthorizationCode represents an issued authorization code\ntype AuthorizationCode struct {\n    Code          string    `json:\"code\"`\n    ClientID      string    `json:\"client_id\"`\n    UserID        string    `json:\"user_id\"`\n    RedirectURI   string    `json:\"redirect_uri\"`\n    Scope         string    `json:\"scope\"`\n    CodeChallenge string    `json:\"code_challenge,omitempty\"`\n    ExpiresAt     time.Time `json:\"expires_at\"`\n    Used          bool      `json:\"used\"`\n}\n\n// HandleAuthorizationRequest processes the initial OAuth2 authorization request\nfunc HandleAuthorizationRequest(req *AuthorizationRequest, clientStore ClientStore) (*AuthorizationCode, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Validate that response_type is \"code\"\n    // TODO 2: Look up client by client_id and verify it exists\n    // TODO 3: Validate redirect_uri exactly matches one of client's registered URIs\n    // TODO 4: Validate that requested scopes are subset of client's allowed scopes\n    // TODO 5: If PKCE code_challenge present, validate it's base64url encoded and appropriate length\n    // TODO 6: Generate cryptographically random authorization code\n    // TODO 7: Create AuthorizationCode struct with 10-minute expiration\n    // TODO 8: Store authorization code for later exchange\n    // Hint: This function handles the authorization request but doesn't capture user consent yet\n}\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Security Hints\n\n**Constant-Time Comparison**: Always use `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare()` for validating tokens, client secrets, and authorization codes to prevent timing attacks:\n\n```go\nimport \"crypto/subtle\"\n\n// WRONG - vulnerable to timing attacks\nif token == storedToken {\n    return true\n}\n\n// CORRECT - constant time comparison\nif subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(token), []byte(storedToken)) == 1 {\n    return true\n}\n```\n\n**Secure Random Generation**: Use `crypto/rand.Read()` for all security-critical random number generation. Never use `math/rand` for tokens, codes, or secrets:\n\n```go\nimport \"crypto/rand\"\n\n// Generate 32 bytes of cryptographically secure random data\nrandomBytes := make([]byte, 32)\nif _, err := rand.Read(randomBytes); err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to generate random bytes: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n**JWT Key Management**: Store JWT signing keys securely and rotate them periodically. Use RS256 or ES256 algorithms:\n\n```go\nimport \"crypto/rsa\"\n\n// Generate 2048-bit RSA key for JWT signing\nprivateKey, err := rsa.GenerateKey(rand.Reader, 2048)\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to generate RSA key: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// Store private key securely (encrypted at rest)\n// Expose public key via /.well-known/jwks.json endpoint\n```\n\n**Database Connection Security**: Use connection pooling and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection:\n\n```go\n// Prepared statement prevents SQL injection\nstmt, err := db.Prepare(\"SELECT client_id, secret_hash FROM clients WHERE client_id = ?\")\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndefer stmt.Close()\n\nvar clientID, secretHash string\nerr = stmt.QueryRow(providedClientID).Scan(&clientID, &secretHash)\n```\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Authorization codes always invalid | Code not being stored or wrong lookup key | Check database after code generation | Verify storage key matches lookup key exactly |\n| JWT tokens fail validation | Clock skew or wrong signing key | Compare token iat/exp with current time | Add clock skew tolerance (30 seconds) |\n| PKCE verification fails | Code verifier/challenge mismatch | Log both verifier and stored challenge | Ensure base64url encoding without padding |\n| Redirect URI validation fails | Exact match requirement not met | Log provided URI vs registered URI | Use exact string comparison, not pattern matching |\n| Client authentication fails | bcrypt comparison wrong | Test hash generation separately | Use bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword() correctly |\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section establishes the scope for all milestones (1-4), defining success criteria and boundaries\n\nThis section establishes clear boundaries for what our OAuth2 and OpenID Connect provider will accomplish. Think of this as signing a contract with stakeholders - we're committing to specific capabilities while explicitly declining to solve certain problems. This clarity prevents scope creep and ensures we build a focused, secure system rather than an over-engineered monster that tries to solve every possible identity use case.\n\nThe goals are organized into three categories: functional requirements that define what the system does, security requirements that define how it protects users and data, and explicit non-goals that define what we will not build. Each goal maps to specific acceptance criteria in our milestones, creating a clear path from high-level objectives to concrete implementation tasks.\n\n### Functional Goals: Required OAuth2/OIDC Features and Flows\n\nOur OAuth2 provider must implement the core authorization flows and endpoints required for modern web and mobile applications. These functional goals represent the minimum viable feature set for a production-ready identity provider that third-party applications can rely on for user authorization.\n\n#### Core OAuth2 Authorization Flows\n\nThe system must support the **authorization code grant flow** as the primary mechanism for web applications to obtain user consent and access tokens. This flow involves redirecting users to our authorization server, displaying a consent screen, generating a short-lived authorization code, and exchanging that code for tokens. This is the most secure flow for applications that can protect a client secret.\n\nWe must implement **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** as a mandatory security extension for all authorization requests. PKCE prevents authorization code interception attacks by requiring clients to prove they initiated the original authorization request. Public clients like mobile apps and single-page applications cannot protect secrets, making PKCE their primary defense against token theft.\n\nThe **client credentials grant flow** enables machine-to-machine authentication where no user interaction is required. Background services, APIs calling other APIs, and automated systems use this flow to authenticate using only their client ID and secret. This flow bypasses user consent since the client owns the data it's accessing.\n\n#### Token Management and Lifecycle\n\nOur token endpoint must generate **JWT access tokens** with proper claims, signatures, and expiration times. JWTs enable resource servers to validate tokens locally without calling back to our authorization server, reducing latency and improving scalability. Each JWT must contain standard claims like subject (user ID), issuer (our server), audience (intended recipient), expiration time, and granted scopes.\n\n**Refresh token rotation** provides long-term access while maintaining security through token family tracking. When a client uses a refresh token to obtain a new access token, we must issue a new refresh token and invalidate the old one. If an old refresh token is reused (indicating potential theft), we revoke the entire token family associated with that user and client.\n\nThe system must implement **token introspection** per RFC 7662, allowing resource servers to check token validity and retrieve metadata. This endpoint accepts an access or refresh token and returns whether it's active, along with information like expiration time, scopes, and client ID. Protected by client authentication, this endpoint serves as the authoritative source for token status.\n\n**Token revocation** per RFC 7009 enables users and clients to immediately invalidate tokens. When a user logs out, uninstalls an app, or revokes consent, the associated tokens must become unusable instantly. This prevents lingering access after authorization is withdrawn.\n\n#### Client Management and Registration\n\nThe system must provide **client registration APIs** that create OAuth2 client records with generated credentials and configured parameters. Each client receives a unique client ID, a securely hashed client secret (for confidential clients), and a list of allowed redirect URIs where users can be sent after authorization.\n\n**Client authentication** must validate client credentials during token requests using HTTP Basic authentication or form parameters. We must support both confidential clients (web applications with secrets) and public clients (mobile apps and SPAs without secrets) with appropriate security measures for each type.\n\n**Redirect URI validation** prevents authorization code theft by ensuring authorization responses only go to pre-registered, exact-match URIs. Partial matches, subdomain wildcards, and dynamic redirect URIs are explicitly rejected to prevent malicious clients from intercepting authorization codes.\n\n#### OpenID Connect Identity Layer\n\nAs an **OpenID Connect provider**, we must implement the identity layer on top of OAuth2. This includes issuing ID tokens (JWTs containing user authentication information), providing a UserInfo endpoint for accessing user profile claims, and supporting OIDC discovery through well-known configuration endpoints.\n\nThe **UserInfo endpoint** returns user profile information based on the scopes granted during authorization. If a client receives consent for the \"email\" scope, the UserInfo endpoint returns the user's email address. If granted \"profile\" scope, it returns name and other profile fields. This scope-to-claims mapping ensures clients only access data they've been authorized to see.\n\n**OIDC discovery** through the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint enables client applications to automatically configure themselves by retrieving our server's capabilities, endpoints, and cryptographic keys. This reduces manual configuration and ensures clients stay synchronized with our server's capabilities.\n\n#### User Consent and Authorization\n\nThe system must present **user consent screens** that clearly display what data and permissions an application is requesting. Users must be able to approve or deny each authorization request with full understanding of the implications. The consent screen shows the requesting application's name, the specific permissions (scopes) requested, and allows granular approval or complete denial.\n\n**Consent persistence** remembers user authorization decisions so returning users aren't repeatedly prompted for the same client and scopes. If Alice previously granted the \"Calendar App\" access to her email and calendar, subsequent authorizations for the same permissions proceed automatically without re-prompting.\n\n**Consent revocation** enables users to withdraw previously granted permissions through a management interface. When consent is revoked, associated tokens must be invalidated, and future authorization requests must re-prompt for user approval.\n\n| Functional Goal | Acceptance Criteria | Associated Milestone |\n|---|---|---|\n| Authorization Code Grant | Redirect user to consent, generate codes, exchange for tokens | Milestone 1 |\n| PKCE Implementation | Validate code challenges, enforce for public clients | Milestone 1 |\n| Client Credentials Grant | Authenticate clients, issue tokens without user consent | Milestone 2 |\n| JWT Access Tokens | Generate signed JWTs with proper claims and expiration | Milestone 2 |\n| Refresh Token Rotation | Issue new refresh tokens, invalidate old ones, track families | Milestone 2 |\n| Token Introspection | RFC 7662 compliant endpoint returning token metadata | Milestone 3 |\n| Token Revocation | RFC 7009 compliant endpoint invalidating tokens immediately | Milestone 3 |\n| UserInfo Endpoint | Return user claims based on granted scopes | Milestone 4 |\n| Consent Management | Display consent screens, persist decisions, enable revocation | Milestone 4 |\n| OIDC Discovery | Publish well-known configuration with endpoints and keys | Milestone 4 |\n\n### Security Goals: Security Properties the System Must Maintain\n\nSecurity represents the most critical aspect of an identity provider - any compromise could expose user data across multiple applications. Our security goals establish the non-negotiable properties that the system must maintain under all circumstances, including attack scenarios and operational failures.\n\n#### Cryptographic Security Properties\n\nAll **client secrets must be stored using cryptographically strong hashing** with per-secret salts. We will never store plaintext secrets that could be compromised in a data breach. Client secret verification must use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about secret values.\n\n**Authorization codes must be cryptographically random** with sufficient entropy to resist brute force attacks. Codes must be single-use only and expire within 10 minutes to minimize the attack window. Each code must be cryptographically bound to the specific client and redirect URI to prevent theft and misuse.\n\n**JWT access tokens must be signed** using asymmetric cryptography (RS256 or ES256) to enable distributed verification by resource servers. Private keys must be securely stored and never exposed through APIs or logs. Token signatures prevent tampering and ensure authenticity without requiring resource servers to contact our authorization server.\n\n**Refresh tokens must have high entropy** and be unpredictable to resist guessing attacks. Unlike JWTs, refresh tokens should be opaque strings stored in our database with associated metadata like expiration time, client ID, and user ID.\n\n#### Attack Resistance Requirements\n\nThe system must resist **authorization code interception attacks** through mandatory PKCE implementation. Even if an attacker intercepts an authorization code through app link hijacking or network sniffing, they cannot exchange it for tokens without the original code verifier that only the legitimate client possesses.\n\n**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection** must be enforced through mandatory state parameters in authorization requests. Clients must provide unpredictable state values that are validated when users return from the authorization server. This prevents attackers from tricking users into authorizing malicious applications.\n\n**Token replay attack prevention** requires tracking used authorization codes and implementing refresh token rotation. Once an authorization code is exchanged for tokens, it becomes permanently invalid. Similarly, refresh tokens become invalid after a single use, requiring clients to use the newly issued refresh token for subsequent refreshes.\n\n**Timing attack resistance** mandates constant-time comparison for all secret validation operations. Whether comparing client secrets, authorization codes, or any other sensitive values, the comparison time must not leak information about correct vs. incorrect values.\n\n#### Data Protection Requirements\n\n**Sensitive data must never appear in JWT payloads** since JWTs are base64-encoded, not encrypted. Access tokens should contain only non-sensitive claims like user ID, expiration time, and granted scopes. Detailed user information like email addresses, phone numbers, or profile data must only be available through the protected UserInfo endpoint.\n\n**Audit logging** must record all security-relevant events including client registrations, authorization grants, token issuances, token revocations, and authentication failures. Logs must include sufficient context for forensic analysis while avoiding sensitive data like tokens or user passwords.\n\n**Secure credential storage** requires that all persistent sensitive data uses appropriate encryption or hashing. Client secrets use bcrypt or similar password hashing. Refresh tokens should be stored as hashed values to prevent compromise even if the database is breached.\n\n#### Session and State Management Security\n\n**Authorization code binding** ensures codes cannot be used by unintended parties. Each code must be cryptographically bound to the specific client ID, redirect URI, user ID, and PKCE code challenge that were present during authorization. Attempts to use codes with different parameters must fail validation.\n\n**Token family tracking** for refresh tokens enables breach detection. When a client exchanges a refresh token, we track the old and new tokens as part of the same family. If the old token is later used (indicating theft), we immediately revoke all tokens in that family to limit the blast radius.\n\n**Concurrent session limits** prevent token proliferation by limiting how many active refresh tokens a single user can have with each client. When limits are exceeded, the oldest tokens are automatically revoked, ensuring users maintain control over their authorization grants.\n\n| Security Property | Implementation Requirement | Attack Prevention |\n|---|---|---|\n| Client Secret Security | bcrypt hashing, constant-time comparison | Database breach, timing attacks |\n| Authorization Code Security | Cryptographic randomness, single-use, 10-minute expiry | Code interception, replay |\n| JWT Signature Security | Asymmetric signing (RS256/ES256), secure key storage | Token tampering, forgery |\n| PKCE Enforcement | Mandatory for all flows, SHA256 code challenge | Code interception |\n| CSRF Protection | Mandatory state parameter validation | Cross-site request forgery |\n| Token Replay Prevention | Single-use codes, refresh token rotation | Replay attacks |\n| Timing Attack Resistance | Constant-time secret comparison | Information leakage |\n| Data Exposure Prevention | No sensitive data in JWTs, protected UserInfo endpoint | Unintended data disclosure |\n| Audit Trail | Security event logging with context | Forensic analysis support |\n| Token Family Tracking | Refresh token breach detection and revocation | Token theft mitigation |\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: The security of an OAuth2 provider extends beyond just protecting its own data - any compromise could expose user data across every application that trusts our tokens. This responsibility amplifies the importance of defense-in-depth strategies and assumes-breach security models.\n\n### Non-Goals: Features explicitly excluded from this implementation\n\nClearly defining what we will not build prevents scope creep and manages stakeholder expectations. These non-goals represent valuable features that could be added in future iterations but are explicitly excluded from our initial implementation to maintain focus on core security and functionality.\n\n#### Advanced OAuth2 Grant Types and Flows\n\nWe will **not implement the implicit grant flow** which directly returns access tokens in the URL fragment without an authorization code exchange step. While historically used for single-page applications, the implicit flow has known security vulnerabilities and has been superseded by the authorization code flow with PKCE for all client types.\n\n**Device authorization grant (RFC 8628)** for input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices is excluded. This flow involves displaying codes on one device while users complete authorization on a separate device with better input capabilities. While useful for modern IoT scenarios, it adds complexity without being essential for web and mobile applications.\n\n**Resource Owner Password Credentials grant** where users directly provide their username and password to client applications is explicitly rejected. This grant type undermines the fundamental OAuth2 principle of never sharing user credentials with third parties and should only be used when no redirect-based flow is possible.\n\n#### Advanced Security and Enterprise Features\n\n**Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)** from RFC 9126, which allows clients to push authorization request parameters directly to the authorization server instead of passing them through browser redirects, is not included. While PAR improves security by keeping request parameters confidential, it adds complexity and is not required for basic OAuth2 compliance.\n\n**Rich Authorization Requests** that support fine-grained permissions beyond simple scopes (e.g., \"access calendar events from January to March for work calendar only\") are excluded. The standard scope-based authorization model provides sufficient granularity for most applications.\n\n**Financial-grade API (FAPI) compliance** with its additional security requirements like mutual TLS authentication, signed request objects, and enhanced token binding is not included. FAPI represents the highest security tier for financial applications but exceeds the requirements for general-purpose identity providers.\n\n**Multi-tenant architecture** supporting multiple isolated organizations within a single deployment is excluded. Each deployment will serve a single organization or user base, simplifying data isolation and access control models.\n\n#### Identity Federation and Protocol Integration\n\n**SAML 2.0 integration** for enterprise single sign-on scenarios is not included. While SAML remains important in enterprise environments, supporting it would require implementing an entirely different protocol stack alongside OAuth2/OIDC.\n\n**Social login providers** like \"Sign in with Google\" or \"Login with Facebook\" are excluded from the core implementation. While valuable for user experience, integrating external identity providers adds operational dependencies and complexity that can be addressed through separate modules.\n\n**LDAP or Active Directory integration** for enterprise user stores is not included in the initial scope. The system will maintain its own user database, though the architecture should allow for pluggable user stores in future versions.\n\n**Cross-domain identity federation** protocols like SAML federation or OpenID Connect federation are excluded. Our provider will serve as an authoritative identity source rather than participating in federated trust relationships with other providers.\n\n#### Advanced User Experience and Management Features\n\n**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** during the authorization flow is excluded from core functionality. Users may have MFA configured in their user accounts, but the OAuth2 authorization flow itself will not enforce or manage additional authentication factors.\n\n**Progressive consent** where applications can request additional scopes after initial authorization without full re-consent is not implemented. Each authorization request is treated independently, requiring explicit user consent for any new or changed scope requests.\n\n**Administrative interfaces** for managing clients, viewing user consents, monitoring token usage, or configuring server settings are excluded. Initial deployments will rely on direct database access or API calls for administrative tasks.\n\n**User self-service portals** for managing authorized applications, reviewing permissions, or configuring account settings are not included. Consent revocation will be available through API endpoints but not through a web interface.\n\n#### Operational and Deployment Features\n\n**High availability clustering** with leader election, state synchronization, and automatic failover is excluded. Initial deployments assume single-instance operation with traditional database backup and recovery procedures.\n\n**Metrics and monitoring integration** with systems like Prometheus, Grafana, or application performance monitoring (APM) tools is not included. Basic logging will be available, but structured metrics export requires additional development.\n\n**Database migration tooling** for upgrading schemas, migrating between database engines, or handling data transformations during version upgrades is excluded. Schema changes will require manual database administration.\n\n**Containerization and orchestration** support with Docker images, Kubernetes manifests, or cloud-native deployment patterns is not included in the core deliverable. The application will be designed as a standard executable that can be containerized separately.\n\n| Non-Goal Category | Excluded Feature | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| Grant Types | Implicit Grant Flow | Security vulnerabilities, superseded by PKCE |\n| Grant Types | Device Authorization Grant | Complexity without broad necessity |\n| Grant Types | Password Credentials Grant | Violates OAuth2 security principles |\n| Security | Pushed Authorization Requests | Adds complexity beyond basic compliance |\n| Security | Financial-grade API (FAPI) | Exceeds general-purpose requirements |\n| Security | Rich Authorization Requests | Standard scopes provide sufficient granularity |\n| Federation | SAML 2.0 Integration | Different protocol stack, enterprise complexity |\n| Federation | Social Login Providers | External dependencies, operational complexity |\n| Federation | LDAP/AD Integration | Enterprise complexity, pluggable in future |\n| User Experience | Multi-factor Authentication | Authentication vs. authorization separation |\n| User Experience | Administrative Web Interface | API-first approach sufficient initially |\n| User Experience | User Self-service Portal | Core functionality focus |\n| Operations | High Availability Clustering | Single-instance operational model |\n| Operations | Built-in Metrics/Monitoring | External tooling integration preferred |\n| Operations | Database Migration Tools | Manual administration acceptable initially |\n\n> **Design Philosophy**: By explicitly excluding these features, we're prioritizing a secure, compliant, and maintainable core implementation over feature completeness. Each excluded item represents a potential future enhancement that can be added without compromising the foundational architecture.\n\n**⚠️ Pitfall: Scope Creep Through \"Simple\" Additions**\n\nA common mistake is treating excluded features as \"quick additions\" during development. For example, adding implicit grant support \"just for testing\" or including basic MFA \"since we're already handling user authentication.\" Each excluded feature was deliberately omitted due to complexity, security implications, or maintenance burden. Resist the temptation to include them without proper design and testing - they inevitably consume more effort than anticipated and can compromise the security or maintainability of core features.\n\n**⚠️ Pitfall: Misunderstanding OAuth2 vs. OIDC Scope**\n\nDevelopers sometimes confuse OAuth2 authorization with general authentication features. OAuth2 is specifically about delegating access to resources, not about user authentication, password management, or session handling. Features like password reset, account lockout, or user registration are authentication concerns that exist outside the OAuth2 specification. Keep the OAuth2 provider focused on authorization delegation rather than expanding into a general authentication system.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete technology recommendations and starter code to begin implementing the goals outlined above. The recommendations prioritize simplicity and security over performance optimization, following the principle that a correct, maintainable implementation should be achieved before optimization efforts.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Security Consideration |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| HTTP Framework | net/http (Go standard library) | Gin or Echo framework | Standard library provides better security auditability |\n| Database | SQLite with migrations | PostgreSQL with connection pooling | Both support transactions required for token atomicity |\n| Client Secret Hashing | bcrypt (golang.org/x/crypto) | Argon2 with configurable parameters | bcrypt provides good defaults, Argon2 offers more tuning |\n| JWT Signing | RS256 with crypto/rsa | ES256 with crypto/ecdsa | Both provide asymmetric verification, ES256 has smaller signatures |\n| Random Generation | crypto/rand with encoding/base64 | crypto/rand with custom encoding | Never use math/rand for security-sensitive values |\n| Session Storage | In-memory maps with sync.RWMutex | Redis with TTL expiration | In-memory simpler for single-instance deployments |\n| Configuration | Environment variables + flag package | YAML/JSON config files with validation | Environment variables prevent secrets in source code |\n| Logging | Go standard log package | Structured logging (logrus, zap) | Ensure no sensitive data appears in logs |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nOrganize the codebase to separate concerns clearly and support the milestone-based development

After implementing client registration and authorization endpoint:\n\n```bash\n# Test client registration\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/register \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Test App\", \"redirect_uris\": [\"https://example.com/callback\"]}'\n\n# Expected response: JSON with client_id, client_secret, and registration details\n# Verify: Client secret should be 43+ characters, client_id should be shorter\n\n# Test authorization endpoint\ncurl \"http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://example.com/callback&scope=openid%20profile&state=xyz&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM&code_challenge_method=S256\"\n\n#

authorization code cannot be exchanged again\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Security Tips\n\n**Go-Specific Security Considerations**:\n\n- Use `crypto/rand` instead of `math/rand` for all token generation\n- Use `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare()` for comparing secrets to prevent timing attacks\n- Use `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` with cost 12 for hashing client secrets\n- Use `crypto/rsa` with 2048+ bit keys or `crypto/ecdsa` with P-256 curves for JWT signing\n- Use `encoding/base64.RawURLEncoding` for tokens to avoid padding characters in URLs\n- Set appropriate HTTP headers: `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Pragma: no-cache` for token responses\n- Use `context.Context` with timeouts for database operations to prevent resource exhaustion\n- Validate all inputs using explicit checks rather than relying on SQL or template injection protection\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides architectural foundation for all milestones (1-4), establishing the component structure that will be built incrementally\n\n### Mental Model: Digital Bank Infrastructure\n\nThink of our OAuth2 provider as a **digital bank infrastructure** that manages authorization rather than money. Just as a physical bank has distinct departments working together - the front desk registers new customers, the loan department approves credit applications, the vault manages assets, and the audit department tracks all transactions - our OAuth2 provider has specialized components that collaborate to securely manage digital permissions.\n\nThe **Authorization Endpoint** is like the loan application desk where customers (users) come to approve third-party access requests. The **Token Endpoint** acts like the vault, exchanging approved authorizations for valuable digital tokens. The **Client Registration** component functions like the business accounts department, vetting and registering third-party applications that want to access customer data. The **UserInfo Endpoint** operates like the customer service desk, providing account information to authorized parties.\n\nEach department has its own specialized storage systems, security protocols, and communication channels, but they all work together through well-defined interfaces to ensure that every authorization transaction is secure, auditable, and follows banking regulations (OAuth2/OIDC specifications).\n\n![OAuth2 Provider System Components](./diagrams/system-component-diagram.svg)\n\n### Component Overview: Main Components and Their Responsibilities\n\nOur OAuth2 provider consists of six primary components that work together to implement the complete authorization server functionality. Each component has distinct responsibilities and maintains its own data while communicating through well-defined interfaces.\n\n#### Core Authorization Components\n\nThe **Authorization Endpoint Component** serves as the entry point for OAuth2 flows, handling initial authorization requests from client applications. This component validates client credentials, manages PKCE security mechanisms, presents consent screens to users, and generates authorization codes bound to specific clients and users. It implements the authorization server role defined in RFC 6749, ensuring that all authorization requests follow proper security protocols and user consent is obtained before any access is granted.\n\nThe **Token Endpoint Component** functions as the secure token exchange facility, responsible for converting authorization codes into JWT access tokens and refresh tokens. This component handles multiple OAuth2 grant types including authorization code grant and client credentials grant, implements refresh token rotation for enhanced security, and generates cryptographically signed JWTs with appropriate claims and expiration times. It serves as the primary interface for client applications to obtain the credentials they need to access protected resources.\n\nThe **Client Registration Component** manages the lifecycle of OAuth2 client applications, handling registration, credential generation, and ongoing client management. This component generates unique client identifiers, securely hashes and stores client secrets, validates redirect URIs, and maintains client configuration including allowed grant types and scopes. It ensures that only properly registered and authenticated clients can participate in OAuth2 flows.\n\n#### Token Management Components\n\nThe **Token Introspection and Revocation Component** provides RFC 7662 and RFC 7009 compliant endpoints for token validation and invalidation. The introspection functionality allows resource servers to validate tokens and retrieve metadata about their status and associated permissions. The revocation functionality enables immediate token invalidation for security incidents or user-initiated logouts, with support for refresh token family tracking to detect token theft.\n\nThe **UserInfo and Consent Management Component** implements the OpenID Connect UserInfo endpoint and manages user consent decisions throughout their lifecycle. This component maps granted scopes to specific user claims, filters profile information based on authorized permissions, and maintains persistent records of user consent decisions. It ensures that users retain control over their data and can revoke previously granted permissions.\n\n#### Supporting Infrastructure Components\n\nThe **Data Storage Layer** provides persistent storage for all system entities including clients, users, tokens, authorization codes, and consent records. This layer abstracts the underlying storage technology and provides consistent interfaces for data access, ensuring data integrity and supporting concurrent access patterns required by the OAuth2 flows.\n\nEach component maintains clear boundaries and communicates through well-defined interfaces, enabling the system to scale horizontally and be maintained by different development teams. The architecture supports both synchronous request-response patterns for user-facing flows and asynchronous processing for token cleanup and audit logging.\n\n| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Data Managed | External Interfaces |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Authorization Endpoint | Handle authorization requests, PKCE, consent | Authorization codes, PKCE challenges | HTTP endpoints for auth flow |\n| Token Endpoint | Exchange codes for tokens, refresh flows | Access tokens, refresh tokens, JWT signing | HTTP endpoints for token operations |\n| Client Registration | Register and authenticate OAuth2 clients | Client credentials, redirect URIs, scopes | Registration API, client validation |\n| Token Introspection/Revocation | Validate and invalidate tokens | Token status, revocation lists | RFC 7662/7009 compliant endpoints |\n| UserInfo/Consent | Provide user claims, manage consent | User profiles, consent decisions | OIDC UserInfo endpoint, consent UI |\n| Data Storage | Persist all system entities | Clients, users, tokens, codes, consent | Storage interfaces for all components |\n\n#### Component Interaction Patterns\n\nComponents interact through **synchronous HTTP APIs** for user-facing operations and **shared data storage** for state coordination. The Authorization Endpoint communicates with Client Registration to validate client applications and with Data Storage to persist authorization codes. The Token Endpoint retrieves authorization codes and client information from storage while generating new tokens that are tracked by the Introspection component.\n\n**Event-driven patterns** handle asynchronous operations like token cleanup and audit logging. When tokens are created, revoked, or expire, events are published to trigger appropriate cleanup actions and security monitoring. This ensures that the system can scale beyond simple request-response patterns while maintaining consistency.\n\n**Security boundaries** are enforced at component interfaces, with each component validating inputs and applying appropriate security controls. Client authentication is centralized in the Client Registration component, token validation is handled by the Introspection component, and user authentication is managed by the Authorization Endpoint.\n\n> **Decision: Microservice vs Monolith Architecture**\n> - **Context**: OAuth2 providers can be built as single monolithic services or distributed microservice architectures\n> - **Options Considered**: Single process monolith, containerized microservices, serverless functions\n> - **Decision**: Start with modular monolith, architect for microservice extraction\n> - **Rationale**: OAuth2 flows require tight consistency and low latency between components. A monolith reduces network overhead and simplifies deployment while maintaining clear component boundaries for future extraction\n> - **Consequences**: Faster development and simpler operations initially, with ability to extract high-load components (like token validation) into separate services as scale requirements emerge\n\n### Recommended File Structure: How to Organize the Codebase for Maintainability\n\nA well-organized file structure is crucial for an OAuth2 provider because the codebase must handle complex security protocols, multiple HTTP endpoints, cryptographic operations, and data persistence while remaining maintainable as the system evolves. The structure should clearly separate concerns, make dependencies explicit, and support both unit testing and integration testing.\n\n#### Project Root Organization\n\nThe project follows Go's standard layout conventions with clear separation between application entry points, internal business logic, external APIs, and supporting infrastructure. This organization makes it easy for new developers to understand the system architecture by examining the directory structure.\n\n```\noauth2-provider/\n├── cmd/                          # Application entry points\n│   ├── server/                   # Main OAuth2 server\n│   │   ├── main.go              # Server startup and configuration\n│   │   └── config.yaml          # Default configuration\n│   └── migrate/                  # Database migration utility\n│       └── main.go              # Schema setup and migrations\n├── internal/                     # Private application code\n├── pkg/                         # Public library code\n├── api/                         # API definitions and schemas\n├── web/                         # Static web assets\n├── deployments/                 # Deployment configurations\n├── docs/                        # Additional documentation\n└── scripts/                     # Build and development scripts\n```\n\n#### Internal Component Organization\n\nThe `internal/` directory contains all private business logic organized by component boundaries. Each component is self-contained with its own models, handlers, storage interfaces, and tests. This structure supports the component architecture while preventing circular dependencies.\n\n```\ninternal/\n├── auth/                        # Authorization Endpoint Component\n│   ├── handlers.go             # HTTP handlers for authorization flow\n│   ├── pkce.go                 # PKCE implementation\n│   ├── consent.go              # User consent management\n│   ├── codes.go                # Authorization code generation\n│   ├── models.go               # Authorization request/response models\n│   ├── handlers_test.go        # Handler unit tests\n│   └── pkce_test.go           # PKCE unit tests\n├── token/                      # Token Endpoint Component\n│   ├── handlers.go             # Token endpoint HTTP handlers\n│   ├── jwt.go                  # JWT generation and signing\n│   ├── refresh.go              # Refresh token rotation\n│   ├── grants.go               # Grant type implementations\n│   ├── models.go               # Token request/response models\n│   └── handlers_test.go        # Token endpoint tests\n├── clients/                    # Client Registration Component\n│   ├── registration.go         # Client registration logic\n│   ├── validation.go           # Client credential validation\n│   ├── storage.go             # Client storage interface\n│   ├── models.go              # Client data models\n│   └── registration_test.go    # Registration tests\n├── introspection/              # Token Introspection/Revocation\n│   ├── handlers.go             # RFC 7662/7009 endpoint handlers\n│   ├── validation.go           # Token validation logic\n│   ├── revocation.go          # Token revocation tracking\n│   └── handlers_test.go        # Introspection tests\n├── userinfo/                   # UserInfo/Consent Component\n│   ├── handlers.go             # OIDC UserInfo endpoint\n│   ├── claims.go               # Scope-to-claims mapping\n│   ├── consent.go              # Consent persistence\n│   └── handlers_test.go        # UserInfo tests\n├── storage/                    # Data Storage Layer\n│   ├── interfaces.go           # Storage interface definitions\n│   ├── memory/                 # In-memory implementation\n│   │   ├── clients.go         # Client storage\n│   │   ├── tokens.go          # Token storage\n│   │   └── users.go           # User storage\n│   ├── postgres/              # PostgreSQL implementation\n│   │   ├── clients.go         # Client queries\n│   │   ├── tokens.go          # Token queries\n│   │   ├── migrations/        # Database schema\n│   │   └── postgres.go        # Database connection\n│   └── redis/                 # Redis for caching/sessions\n│       └── cache.go           # Cache implementation\n├── crypto/                     # Cryptographic Operations\n│   ├── keys.go                # Key management\n│   ├── jwt.go                 # JWT signing/verification\n│   ├── random.go              # Secure random generation\n│   └── crypto_test.go         # Crypto tests\n├── middleware/                 # HTTP Middleware\n│   ├── auth.go                # Client authentication\n│   ├── cors.go                # CORS handling\n│   ├── logging.go             # Request logging\n│   └── ratelimit.go           # Rate limiting\n├── config/                     # Configuration Management\n│   ├── config.go              # Configuration loading\n│   ├── validation.go          # Config validation\n│   └── defaults.go            # Default values\n└── server/                     # HTTP Server Setup\n    ├── server.go              # Server initialization\n    ├── routes.go              # Route registration\n    └── middleware.go          # Middleware chain setup\n```\n\n#### Public Library Organization\n\nThe `pkg/` directory contains reusable components that could be imported by other projects, such as OAuth2 client libraries or JWT validation utilities. This separation allows the core business logic to remain private while providing useful tools to the broader ecosystem.\n\n```\npkg/\n├── oauth2/                     # OAuth2 client library\n│   ├── client.go              # OAuth2 client implementation\n│   ├── tokens.go              # Token management\n│   └── errors.go              # Error types\n├── jwt/                       # JWT validation library\n│   ├── validator.go           # JWT validation logic\n│   ├── claims.go              # Claims processing\n│   └── keys.go                # Key management\n└── oidc/                      # OIDC discovery and validation\n    ├── discovery.go           # Well-known endpoint\n    └── validation.go          # OIDC token validation\n```\n\n#### Supporting Directories\n\nAdditional directories support development, deployment, and documentation workflows while keeping the core codebase focused on business logic.\n\n```\napi/\n├── oauth2/                     # OAuth2 API definitions\n│   ├── openapi.yaml           # OpenAPI specification\n│   └── schemas/               # JSON schemas for validation\n└── oidc/                      # OIDC API definitions\n    └── discovery.json         # Well-known configuration\nweb/\n├── static/                     # Static assets for consent UI\n│   ├── css/                   # Stylesheets\n│   ├── js/                    # JavaScript\n│   └── images/                # Images and icons\n└── templates/                  # HTML templates\n    ├── consent.html           # User consent page\n    ├── error.html             # Error page template\n    └── login.html             # Login page template\ndeployments/\n├── docker/                     # Docker configurations\n│   ├── Dockerfile             # Application container\n│   └── docker-compose.yml     # Development environment\n├── kubernetes/                 # Kubernetes manifests\n│   ├── deployment.yaml        # Application deployment\n│   ├── service.yaml           # Service definition\n│   └── configmap.yaml         # Configuration\n└── terraform/                  # Infrastructure as code\n    └── main.tf                # Cloud resources\n```\n\n#### File Naming Conventions\n\nConsistent file naming makes the codebase navigable and predictable. Files are named to clearly indicate their purpose and scope within each component.\n\n| File Type | Naming Pattern | Purpose | Examples |\n|-----------|---------------|---------|----------|\n| HTTP Handlers | `handlers.go` | HTTP endpoint implementations | `auth/handlers.go`, `token/handlers.go` |\n| Data Models | `models.go` | Struct definitions and validation | `clients/models.go`, `token/models.go` |\n| Storage Interfaces | `interfaces.go` | Abstract storage contracts | `storage/interfaces.go` |\n| Storage Implementations | `{technology}.go` | Concrete storage implementations | `storage/postgres/postgres.go` |\n| Business Logic | `{feature}.go` | Core business functionality | `auth/pkce.go`, `token/jwt.go` |\n| Tests | `{filename}_test.go` | Unit and integration tests | `handlers_test.go`, `pkce_test.go` |\n| Integration Tests | `{component}_integration_test.go` | Cross-component testing | `auth_integration_test.go` |\n\nThis file organization supports several important development practices:\n\n**Clear Dependencies**: The structure makes component dependencies visible through import statements, preventing circular dependencies and ensuring clean architecture boundaries.\n\n**Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently, and the separation of interfaces from implementations enables effective mocking and integration testing.\n\n**Team Scalability**: Different teams can own different components without stepping on each other, as component boundaries are clearly defined in the file system.\n\n**Security Auditing**: Security-critical code is concentrated in specific files (`crypto/`, authentication handlers, token validation), making security reviews more focused and effective.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The file structure mirrors the component architecture, making the system's design visible in the codebase organization. This reduces cognitive load for developers and makes architectural violations obvious through inappropriate cross-directory imports.\n\n### Technology Stack: Recommended Libraries and Tools for Implementation\n\nThe technology stack for an OAuth2 provider must balance security, performance, standards compliance, and developer productivity. The choices made here will impact both the development experience and the operational characteristics of the system in production environments.\n\n#### Core Technology Decisions\n\n**Go** serves as the primary implementation language due to its excellent HTTP server capabilities, strong cryptographic standard library, built-in concurrency support, and static binary deployment model. Go's explicit error handling reduces the risk of security bugs common in OAuth2 implementations, while its performance characteristics support the high-throughput token operations required by authorization servers.\n\n**PostgreSQL** provides the primary data store for persistent entities like clients, users, tokens, and consent records. PostgreSQL offers ACID transactions required for consistent token operations, JSON column support for flexible client metadata storage, and excellent performance for the read-heavy workloads common in OAuth2 systems. The robust ecosystem and operational tooling make it suitable for production deployments.\n\n**Redis** serves as the caching layer and session store for temporary data like authorization codes, rate limiting counters, and revoked token tracking. Redis provides the sub-second latency required for authorization flows and supports automatic expiration for time-bounded entities like authorization codes.\n\n| Technology Category | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Recommendation for Learning |\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| HTTP Framework | `net/http` standard library | `gin-gonic/gin` or `gorilla/mux` | Start with `net/http` for clarity |\n| Database | SQLite for development | PostgreSQL for production | SQLite initially, PostgreSQL for Milestone 3+ |\n| Caching | In-memory maps | Redis with persistence | In-memory for Milestones 1-2, Redis for production |\n| JWT Library | `golang-jwt/jwt/v4` | Custom implementation with `crypto/` | Use `golang-jwt/jwt/v4` for reliability |\n| Password Hashing | `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` | `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` | bcrypt for simplicity |\n| Configuration | Environment variables | `spf13/viper` with multiple sources | Environment variables initially |\n| Logging | `log/slog` standard library | `sirupsen/logrus` or `uber-go/zap` | `log/slog` for structured logging |\n| Testing | `testing` standard library | `stretchr/testify` for assertions | Standard library with `testify` for convenience |\n\n#### HTTP Server and Routing\n\nThe HTTP server foundation handles OAuth2 protocol endpoints, serves consent UI, and provides administrative interfaces. The choice between standard library and frameworks involves trade-offs between simplicity and convenience features.\n\n**Standard Library Approach** (`net/http`): Using Go's built-in HTTP server provides complete control over request handling, middleware chains, and error responses. This approach requires more boilerplate but offers better understanding of HTTP fundamentals and fewer dependencies. For learning OAuth2 concepts, this transparency is valuable.\n\n**Framework Approach** (`gin-gonic/gin`): Web frameworks provide convenient request binding, middleware systems, and response helpers that reduce boilerplate for OAuth2 endpoint implementations. However, they can obscure important details about HTTP handling that are crucial for security-sensitive OAuth2 implementations.\n\n```\nRecommended HTTP Stack:\n├── net/http (server)           # Core HTTP server\n├── gorilla/mux (routing)       # URL routing and path variables  \n├── gorilla/handlers (middleware) # CORS, logging, compression\n└── html/template (templating)   # Consent screen rendering\n```\n\n#### Cryptographic Libraries\n\nOAuth2 providers require multiple cryptographic operations including JWT signing, client secret hashing, secure random generation, and PKCE challenge verification. Go's `crypto/` package provides excellent foundations, but additional libraries handle higher-level operations.\n\n**JWT Operations**: The `golang-jwt/jwt/v4` library provides robust JWT creation, parsing, and validation with support for multiple signing algorithms. It handles edge cases like algorithm confusion attacks and provides secure defaults for token operations.\n\n**Password Hashing**: `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` offers appropriate password hashing for client secrets with configurable work factors. The library handles salt generation and provides constant-time comparison functions to prevent timing attacks.\n\n**Random Generation**: Go's `crypto/rand` provides cryptographically secure random number generation for authorization codes, client secrets, and token generation. This is critical for OAuth2 security properties.\n\n| Cryptographic Operation | Library | Key Functions | Security Considerations |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------------|------------------------|\n| JWT Signing/Verification | `golang-jwt/jwt/v4` | `jwt.NewWithClaims()`, `jwt.Parse()` | Use RS256 or ES256, validate all claims |\n| Client Secret Hashing | `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` | `bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword()`, `bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword()` | Cost factor 12+, constant-time comparison |\n| Secure Random Generation | `crypto/rand` | `rand.Read()`, `rand.Int()` | Always check errors, use appropriate entropy |\n| PKCE Challenge Verification | `crypto/sha256` | `sha256.Sum256()` | Base64URL encoding, constant-time comparison |\n| TLS Certificate Management | `crypto/tls` | `tls.LoadX509KeyPair()` | Regular rotation, proper certificate validation |\n\n#### Database and Storage\n\nThe storage layer must handle both persistent entities (clients, users, consent) and temporary entities (authorization codes, sessions) with different consistency and performance requirements.\n\n**PostgreSQL Configuration**: The database schema uses separate tables for each entity type with appropriate indexes for OAuth2 query patterns. JSON columns store flexible client metadata and user profiles while maintaining queryable structure.\n\n**Connection Management**: Database connections use `lib/pq` or `pgx` drivers with connection pooling configured for OAuth2 workload characteristics. Token operations are read-heavy with occasional writes, requiring optimized connection pool settings.\n\n**Migration Strategy**: Database schema changes use versioned migrations managed by `golang-migrate/migrate` or similar tools. OAuth2 schemas evolve as new features are added, requiring careful migration planning to avoid service disruptions.\n\n```\nDatabase Architecture:\n├── PostgreSQL (primary)        # Persistent entities\n│   ├── oauth_clients          # Client registrations  \n│   ├── oauth_codes            # Authorization codes\n│   ├── oauth_tokens           # Issued tokens\n│   ├── users                  # User accounts\n│   └── user_consent           # Consent decisions\n├── Redis (cache)              # Temporary data\n│   ├── sessions               # User sessions\n│   ├── rate_limits           # Rate limiting counters\n│   └── revoked_tokens        # Revocation tracking\n└── Local files (keys)         # JWT signing keys\n    ├── private.pem           # Token signing key\n    └── public.pem            # Token verification key\n```\n\n#### Development and Testing Tools\n\nOAuth2 providers require specialized testing approaches to verify security properties, protocol compliance, and integration behavior with real OAuth2 clients.\n\n**Unit Testing**: Standard Go testing with `testify` assertions provides component-level verification. Mock implementations of storage interfaces enable isolated testing of business logic without database dependencies.\n\n**Integration Testing**: `testcontainers-go` provides real database instances for integration tests, ensuring that storage implementations work correctly with actual database systems. This catches SQL compatibility issues and transaction behavior differences.\n\n**OAuth2 Protocol Testing**: Custom test clients simulate various OAuth2 flows including error conditions, malformed requests, and security attacks. These tests verify that the implementation correctly handles edge cases defined in OAuth2 specifications.\n\n**Security Testing**: Specialized tools verify cryptographic operations, timing attack resistance, and input validation completeness. Static analysis tools like `gosec` identify common security patterns in OAuth2 implementations.\n\n| Testing Category | Primary Tool | Secondary Tools | Purpose |\n|------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|\n| Unit Tests | `testing` + `testify/assert` | `testify/mock` for interfaces | Component isolation and logic verification |\n| Integration Tests | `testcontainers-go` | `dockertest` alternative | Real database and service integration |\n| HTTP Endpoint Tests | `net/http/httptest` | `gavv/httpexpect` for fluent APIs | OAuth2 protocol compliance |\n| Security Tests | Custom tooling | `gosec`, `nancy` for vulnerabilities | Cryptographic and input validation |\n| Load Tests | `k6` or `bombardier` | `pprof` for profiling | Performance under OAuth2 workloads |\n| Browser Tests | `chromedp` | `selenium` for complex UI | User consent flow validation |\n\n#### Configuration and Deployment\n\nOAuth2 providers require careful configuration management for security-sensitive settings like signing keys, database credentials, and endpoint URLs. The configuration system must support both development flexibility and production security requirements.\n\n**Configuration Sources**: The system reads configuration from environment variables, configuration files, and command-line flags in that priority order. This supports both containerized deployments (environment variables) and traditional deployments (configuration files).\n\n**Secret Management**: Sensitive values like JWT signing keys and database passwords are loaded from secure sources like HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes secrets, or cloud provider secret managers rather than being stored in configuration files.\n\n**Environment-Specific Settings**: Different deployment environments (development, staging, production) require different token lifetimes, security policies, and integration endpoints. The configuration system supports environment-specific overrides while maintaining consistent base settings.\n\n> **Decision: JWT Signing Algorithm Selection**\n> - **Context**: OAuth2 access tokens can use symmetric (HS256) or asymmetric (RS256/ES256) signing algorithms\n> - **Options Considered**: HS256 with shared secret, RS256 with RSA keypair, ES256 with ECDSA keypair\n> - **Decision**: Use RS256 for access tokens, HS256 for internal tokens\n> - **Rationale**: RS256 enables distributed token validation by resource servers without sharing secrets, while HS256 is sufficient for internal tokens like refresh tokens where the authorization server is the only validator\n> - **Consequences**: Requires RSA key management and slightly higher CPU costs for signing/verification, but enables proper OAuth2 architecture with independent resource servers\n\nThis technology stack provides a solid foundation for implementing a production-ready OAuth2 provider while maintaining code clarity for learning purposes. The choices prioritize security, standards compliance, and operational simplicity over cutting-edge features that might introduce complexity or security risks.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n####

generation\n- Always check errors from cryptographic operations - they indicate serious problems\n- Use `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare()` for token and password comparisons to prevent timing attacks\n- Prefer `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` over custom password hashing implementations\n- Use `context.Context` with timeouts for all database and HTTP operations\n\n**HTTP Server Configuration:**\n```go\nserver := &http.Server{\n    Addr:         \":8080\",\n    Handler:      router,\n    ReadTimeout:  30 * time.Second,  // Prevent slow-read attacks\n    WriteTimeout: 30 * time.Second,  // Prevent slow-write attacks\n    IdleTimeout:  60 * time.Second,  // Close idle connections\n    TLSConfig: &tls.Config{\n        MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,  // Require TLS 1.2+\n    },\n}\n```\n\n**Database Connection Pooling:**\n```go\ndb, err := sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", \"oauth2.db?_foreign_keys=on&_journal_mode=WAL\")\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndb.SetMaxOpenConns(10)        // Limit concurrent connections\ndb.SetMaxIdleConns(5)         // Keep some connections open\ndb.SetConnMaxLifetime(time.Hour)  // Rotate connections\n```\n\n**JWT Configuration Best Practices:**\n- Use RS256 (RSA-SHA256) for access tokens to enable distributed validation\n- Set appropriate token lifetimes: 15-60 minutes for access tokens, 30 days for refresh tokens\n- Include only necessary claims in JWTs - they're not encrypted, only signed\n- Use the `jti` (JWT ID) claim for revocation tracking\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint: Architecture Setup\n\nAfter implementing the basic project structure and infrastructure components, verify the following:\n\n**File Structure Verification:**\n```bash\n# Check that all required directories exist\nfind . -type d -name \"internal\" -o -name \"cmd\" -o -name \"pkg\" | wc -l\n# Should return 3\n\n# Verify component directories are created\nls internal/\n# Should show: auth, clients, config, crypto, storage, token, etc.\n```\n\n**Configuration Loading Test:**\n```bash\n# Set environment variables and test config loading\nexport PORT=8080\nexport DB_URL=\"./test.db\"\ngo run cmd/server/main.go --dry-run\n# Should start without errors and log configuration values\n```\n\n**Cryptographic Operations Test:**\n```bash\n# Test random token generation\ngo test ./internal/crypto/ -v\n# Should pass all tests for secure random generation\n```\n\n**Storage Interface Compilation:**\n```bash\n# Verify all interfaces compile correctly\ngo build ./internal/storage/\n# Should compile without errors\n```\n\n**Basic HTTP Server Test:**\n```bash\n# Start server and test basic connectivity\ngo run cmd/server/main.go &\ncurl -i http://localhost:8080/health\n# Should return 200 OK with basic health check response\n```\n\nThis architectural foundation provides the structure and infrastructure needed to implement the OAuth2 provider components in the subsequent milestones, with clear separation of concerns and proper security foundations.\n\n\n## Data Model\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section establishes the foundational data structures for all milestones (1-4), providing the schema that will be implemented incrementally\n\n![Data Model Relationships](./diagrams/data-model-diagram.svg)\n\n### Mental Model: Library Card System\n\nThink of the OAuth2 data model as a sophisticated library card system. When you register for a library card, the library creates a record with your personal information and what sections you're allowed to access. The library issues you a physical card (client credentials) that proves you're registered. When you want to check out a book, you present your card to authorize the transaction, and the librarian gives you a temporary checkout slip (authorization code) that you can exchange at the front desk for an actual book loan record (access token). The library keeps track of all your current loans (active tokens) and your borrowing history (consent records). If you lose your card or want to return all your books early, the library can revoke your access immediately.\n\nIn OAuth2, registered client applications are like library cardholders, authorization codes are like temporary checkout slips, access tokens are like active loan records, and the consent system tracks what data access permissions users have granted to each application. Just as a library needs to track cards, loans, and patron permissions, our OAuth2 provider needs robust data structures to manage clients, tokens, users, and consent decisions securely.\n\nThe data model serves as the foundation for all OAuth2 operations. Every authorization request, token exchange, and user consent decision depends on these core structures. Getting the data model right is critical because security vulnerabilities often stem from incomplete data validation, missing relationships between entities, or improper lifecycle management of sensitive credentials.\n\n### OAuth Client Registration\n\nOAuth2 **client registration** establishes the foundation of trust between the authorization server and third-party applications. When an application wants to use OAuth2, it must first register with the authorization server to obtain credentials and declare its intended behavior. This registration process creates a **client record** that defines the application's identity, capabilities, and security constraints.\n\nThe client registration data model captures both the public metadata that identifies the application and the confidential credentials used for authentication. This dual nature reflects OAuth2's support for different client types - public clients like mobile apps that cannot securely store secrets, and confidential clients like server-side web applications that can protect their credentials.\n\n#### Client Entity Structure\n\nThe `Client` entity represents a registered OAuth2 application with all the metadata necessary for secure authorization flows:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| ClientID | string | Unique public identifier for the OAuth2 application, generated as a cryptographically random 32-character string |\n| ClientSecret | string | Original plaintext secret returned only during registration, used for client authentication |\n| SecretHash | string | Bcrypt hash of the client secret stored permanently, used for credential verification |\n| Name | string | Human-readable application name displayed on consent screens and administrative interfaces |\n| RedirectURIs | []string | Whitelist of exact URIs where authorization codes can be delivered, prevents authorization code interception |\n| GrantTypes | []string | OAuth2 grant types this client is authorized to use (authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token) |\n| Scopes | []string | Maximum scopes this client can request, acts as an upper bound for authorization requests |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Timestamp when the client was registered, used for auditing and lifecycle management |\n\nThe `ClientID` serves as the public identifier for the application and is included in all OAuth2 flows. It must be cryptographically random and globally unique to prevent client impersonation attacks. The 32-character length provides sufficient entropy while remaining manageable for developers who need to configure it in their applications.\n\nThe separation between `ClientSecret` and `SecretHash` follows security best practices for credential storage. The plaintext `ClientSecret` is returned only once during registration and should be stored securely by the client application. The authorization server stores only the bcrypt `SecretHash`, which provides one-way verification without exposing the original secret even to system administrators.\n\nThe `RedirectURIs` array enforces strict validation of where authorization codes can be delivered. Each URI must match exactly - no wildcards, partial matches, or subdomain matching is allowed. This prevents authorization code interception attacks where malicious actors register similar domains to capture codes intended for legitimate applications.\n\n#### Client Types and Security Profiles\n\nOAuth2 distinguishes between **confidential clients** that can securely store credentials and **public clients** that cannot. This distinction affects how the authorization server validates client authentication and enforces security measures:\n\n| Client Type | Authentication Method | PKCE Requirement | Secret Storage |\n|-------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Confidential | Client ID + Secret | Recommended | Server-side secure storage |\n| Public | Client ID only | Mandatory | No secret issued |\n| Native Mobile | Client ID only | Mandatory | App cannot store secrets securely |\n| Single Page App | Client ID only | Mandatory | Browser cannot store secrets securely |\n\nConfidential clients receive both a `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` during registration. They must authenticate using both credentials when exchanging authorization codes for tokens. Examples include traditional web applications with server-side code that can store the secret in environment variables or secure configuration files.\n\nPublic clients receive only a `ClientID` and cannot authenticate with a secret. To maintain security, they must use **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** for all authorization requests. The `CodeChallenge` and `CodeChallengeMethod` fields in authorization flows provide cryptographic proof that the same client that initiated the authorization flow is the one exchanging the code for tokens.\n\n> **Security Principle: Defense in Depth**\n> \n> Client registration implements multiple layers of security validation. Even if one check fails (like redirect URI validation), other mechanisms (like PKCE verification for public clients) prevent successful attacks. This layered approach ensures that single vulnerabilities don't compromise the entire system.\n\n#### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: Bcrypt for Client Secret Hashing**\n> - **Context**: Client secrets need secure storage that prevents recovery even by system administrators while allowing verification during authentication\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Store plaintext secrets for simple comparison\n>   - Use SHA-256 hash for fast verification\n>   - Use bcrypt with configurable work factor\n> - **Decision**: Bcrypt with work factor 12\n> - **Rationale**: Bcrypt provides adaptive cost that can increase over time as hardware improves. The work factor of 12 balances security (resists brute force) with performance (sub-100ms verification). Unlike SHA-256, bcrypt includes salt automatically and resists rainbow table attacks.\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly slower client authentication (acceptable for OAuth2 flows), but dramatically improved security against credential database breaches. Work factor can be increased in future deployments without changing the verification logic.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Plaintext | Simple implementation, fast verification | Catastrophic security risk if database compromised |\n| SHA-256 | Fast hashing and verification | Vulnerable to rainbow tables, no adaptive cost |\n| Bcrypt | Salt included, adaptive cost, industry standard | Slower than plain hashing, requires bcrypt library |\n\n> **Decision: Exact String Matching for Redirect URIs**\n> - **Context**: Redirect URI validation must prevent authorization code interception while allowing legitimate client deployments\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Exact string matching only\n>   - Domain-based matching (allow subdomains)\n>   - Regex pattern matching for flexibility\n> - **Decision**: Exact string matching with no wildcards or patterns\n> - **Rationale**: OAuth2 security depends critically on preventing redirect URI manipulation. Even sophisticated pattern matching has edge cases that attackers exploit. The principle of least privilege suggests allowing only exactly what's needed. Exact matching eliminates entire classes of bypass attacks.\n> - **Consequences**: Clients must register separate URIs for different environments (dev, staging, production), but this actually improves security by making each deployment explicit. Slightly more complex client configuration but eliminates redirect URI attack surface.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Exact matching | No bypass vulnerabilities, clear security boundary | Requires separate URIs per environment |\n| Domain matching | Flexible for subdomains | Complex parsing, potential bypass via subdomain takeover |\n| Regex patterns | Maximum flexibility | High complexity, regex injection risks |\n\n### Token Data Structures\n\nOAuth2 tokens represent different stages of the authorization process, each with specific security properties and lifecycle requirements. The token data model encompasses **authorization codes** (temporary credentials for token exchange), **access tokens** (credentials for accessing protected resources), and **refresh tokens** (credentials for obtaining new access tokens). Each token type has distinct expiration policies, validation requirements, and security constraints.\n\nThe token lifecycle follows a progression from broad permissions to specific capabilities. Authorization codes represent a user's consent to grant access but cannot directly access resources. Access tokens represent specific, time-limited permissions to access particular resources. Refresh tokens represent long-term authorization to obtain new access tokens without re-prompting the user for consent.\n\n#### Authorization Code Structure\n\nAuthorization codes are **temporary credentials** issued after successful user authentication and consent. They serve as proof that a user has authorized a specific client to access specific scopes. The code must be exchanged quickly for tokens and can only be used once to prevent replay attacks:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Code | string | Cryptographically random 43-character string using URL-safe base64 encoding |\n| ClientID | string | Client that initiated the authorization request, must match during token exchange |\n| UserID | string | User who granted authorization, becomes the 'sub' claim in issued access tokens |\n| RedirectURI | string | Exact redirect URI from the authorization request, must match during token exchange |\n| Scope | string | Space-delimited scopes the user authorized, may be subset of requested scopes |\n| CodeChallenge | string | Base64URL-encoded SHA256 hash of the client's PKCE code verifier |\n| CodeChallengeMethod | string | Method used to generate challenge, always \"S256\" for SHA256 hashing |\n| ExpiresAt | time.Time | Absolute expiration time, typically 10 minutes from creation |\n| Used | bool | Prevents replay attacks - set to true after successful token exchange |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Creation timestamp for auditing and cleanup of expired codes |\n\nThe 43-character `Code` provides 256 bits of entropy when base64-encoded, making brute force attacks computationally infeasible. The code binds together all the authorization parameters (`ClientID`, `RedirectURI`, `Scope`) so that the token endpoint can verify that the exchange request matches exactly what the user authorized.\n\nThe PKCE fields (`CodeChallenge`, `CodeChallengeMethod`) provide cryptographic proof that the same client that initiated the authorization flow is the one exchanging the code. This prevents authorization code interception attacks, particularly important for mobile applications where redirect URIs might be intercepted by malicious apps.\n\n> **Critical Security Property: Single Use Enforcement**\n> \n> Once an authorization code is exchanged for tokens, it must never be usable again. The `Used` flag provides this guarantee. If an already-used code is presented again, it indicates either a replay attack or that the code was intercepted. In either case, all tokens issued from that authorization code should be revoked immediately.\n\n#### Access Token Structure (JWT Format)\n\nAccess tokens are implemented as **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** containing claims about the authorized access. JWTs provide stateless verification - resource servers can validate tokens cryptographically without calling back to the authorization server:\n\n| Claim Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| iss (Issuer) | string | Authorization server identifier, typically the server's base URL |\n| sub (Subject) | string | User identifier from the authorization, uniquely identifies the resource owner |\n| aud (Audience) | string | Intended recipient of the token, typically the resource server's identifier |\n| exp (Expiration) | int64 | Unix timestamp when token expires, typically 15-60 minutes from issuance |\n| iat (Issued At) | int64 | Unix timestamp when token was issued, prevents token pre-dating attacks |\n| jti (JWT ID) | string | Unique token identifier, enables revocation tracking and prevents replay |\n| scope | string | Space-delimited permissions granted to the client for this user |\n| client_id | string | Client identifier, allows resource servers to log which app accessed data |\n\nThe JWT structure follows the standard format: `header.payload.signature`. The header specifies the signing algorithm (typically RS256 or ES256 for asymmetric signatures). The payload contains the claims listed above as base64-encoded JSON. The signature provides cryptographic proof that the token was issued by the authorization server and hasn't been tampered with.\n\nThe `exp` claim enforces token expiration, limiting the blast radius if tokens are compromised. Short expiration times (15-60 minutes) balance security with user experience - users don't need to re-authenticate frequently, but compromised tokens become useless quickly.\n\nThe `jti` claim enables token revocation even though JWTs are stateless. When a token is revoked, the authorization server adds the `jti` to a revocation list. Resource servers can check this list during token validation to reject revoked tokens immediately.\n\n#### Refresh Token Structure\n\nRefresh tokens enable **long-term access** without requiring users to re-authenticate repeatedly. They're stored on the authorization server and used to obtain new access tokens when the current ones expire:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| Token | string | Cryptographically random 43-character string using URL-safe base64 encoding |\n| ClientID | string | Client authorized to use this refresh token, validated during refresh requests |\n| UserID | string | User who originally granted authorization, maintains consistent identity |\n| Scope | string | Authorized scopes that can be refreshed, may be subset of original grant |\n| ExpiresAt | time.Time | Long-term expiration, typically 30-90 days from creation |\n| TokenFamily | string | Refresh token family identifier for rotation tracking and breach detection |\n| ParentToken | string | Previous refresh token in the rotation chain, null for initial token |\n| Revoked | bool | Revocation status - once true, token and entire family become invalid |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Creation timestamp for lifecycle management and auditing |\n| LastUsedAt | time.Time | Most recent usage for detecting suspicious patterns and inactive cleanup |\n\nRefresh tokens use **token rotation** for enhanced security. Each time a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, a new refresh token is issued and the old one is invalidated. This creates a \"token family\" chain that enables breach detection - if an old refresh token is used after a new one has been issued, it indicates the token family has been compromised and all tokens in the family should be revoked.\n\nThe `TokenFamily` identifier groups related refresh tokens together. When token theft is detected (old token reused), the entire family can be revoked instantly, preventing further abuse. The `ParentToken` field creates the chain linkage that enables tracing the rotation history.\n\n> **Security Insight: Token Family Breach Detection**\n> \n> Token rotation creates a security property where legitimate usage forms a linear chain (each token used exactly once), but theft creates a branch (old token reused after new token issued). Detecting these branches enables automatic revocation of compromised token families before significant damage occurs.\n\n#### Token Lifecycle State Machine\n\nTokens progress through defined states that determine their validity and usability:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------------|\n| Issued | Normal usage | Active | Update LastUsedAt timestamp |\n| Active | Expiration time reached | Expired | Token becomes invalid |\n| Active | Explicit revocation | Revoked | Add to revocation list |\n| Active | Refresh (for refresh tokens) | Rotated | Issue new token, invalidate current |\n| Issued/Active | System breach detection | Revoked | Revoke token family |\n| Expired | Cleanup process | Deleted | Remove from storage |\n| Revoked | Cleanup process (after expiry) | Deleted | Remove from revocation list |\n\nThis state machine ensures that tokens have clear validity rules and that state transitions maintain security invariants. The cleanup transitions prevent the database from growing indefinitely with expired tokens while maintaining revocation lists long enough to catch late-arriving requests with revoked tokens.\n\n### User and Consent Models\n\nThe user and consent data models capture the **resource owner** information and track their authorization decisions over time. In OAuth2, the resource owner (typically a human user) controls access to their protected data and makes consent decisions about which applications can access what information. The data model must support both identity management for authentication and fine-grained consent tracking for authorization.\n\nUser consent represents the cornerstone of OAuth2's security model. Users must explicitly authorize each application's access to their data, and they retain control over these permissions throughout the application lifecycle. The consent system must track not just current permissions but also the history of authorization decisions to support revocation and auditing.\n\n#### User Profile Structure\n\nThe user profile stores identity information and authentication credentials for resource owners:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| UserID | string | Unique user identifier, becomes 'sub' claim in tokens |\n| Username | string | Human-readable username for authentication |\n| Email | string | Email address for contact and identity verification |\n| EmailVerified | bool | Whether email address has been verified through confirmation process |\n| PasswordHash | string | Bcrypt hash of user password for authentication |\n| GivenName | string | User's first name for OIDC standard claims |\n| FamilyName | string | User's last name for OIDC standard claims |\n| Picture | string | URL to user's profile picture for OIDC claims |\n| Locale | string | User's preferred language/locale for OIDC claims |\n| CreatedAt | time.Time | Account creation timestamp |\n| UpdatedAt | time.Time | Last profile modification timestamp |\n| Active | bool | Whether account is enabled and can authenticate |\n\nThe user profile follows **OpenID Connect standard claims** to ensure compatibility with OIDC clients. The `UserID` serves as the stable identifier that appears in the `sub` claim of access tokens and ID tokens. It should never change even if other profile fields are updated.\n\nThe email verification status is critical for security flows like password reset and account recovery. Unverified emails should not be used for sensitive operations, and the verification status should be included in OIDC claims when email scope is granted.\n\n#### Consent Record Structure\n\nConsent records track user authorization decisions for each client application:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| UserID | string | User who granted the consent |\n| ClientID | string | Client application that received the consent |\n| Scope | string | Space-delimited scopes the user authorized |\n| GrantedAt | time.Time | When the user originally granted consent |\n| LastUsedAt | time.Time | Most recent authorization using this consent |\n| ExpiresAt | time.Time | Optional consent expiration for time-limited grants |\n| Revoked | bool | Whether user has revoked this consent |\n| RevokedAt | time.Time | When consent was revoked (null if still active) |\n\nThe consent record enables **consent reuse** - if a user has previously authorized a client for specific scopes, future authorization requests for the same or subset of scopes can skip the consent screen. This improves user experience while maintaining security through explicit authorization tracking.\n\nScope handling in consent records follows the **principle of least privilege**. If a client requests scopes beyond what the user previously consented to, a new consent screen must be presented for the additional scopes. The system stores the exact scopes granted, not just the fact that consent was given.\n\n#### Scope to Claims Mapping\n\nThe scope-to-claims mapping defines which user profile fields are accessible for each OAuth2 scope:\n\n| Scope | Claims Included | Description |\n|-------|----------------|-------------|\n| openid | sub | Required for OIDC, provides user identifier only |\n| profile | sub, given_name, family_name, picture, locale | Basic profile information |\n| email | email, email_verified | Email address and verification status |\n| phone | phone_number, phone_number_verified | Phone contact information |\n| address | address | Formatted postal address information |\n\nThis mapping ensures that **scope-based access control** is enforced consistently. The UserInfo endpoint uses this mapping to filter the response based on the scopes granted in the access token. Only claims corresponding to granted scopes are included in the response.\n\nThe mapping supports **incremental authorization** where applications can request additional scopes over time. Each new scope request triggers a consent screen showing only the new permissions being requested, with previously granted scopes noted as already authorized.\n\n> **Privacy Principle: Minimal Disclosure**\n> \n> Users should understand exactly what information they're sharing and with whom. The scope-to-claims mapping provides granular control so users can authorize access to their email without also sharing their profile picture, or share basic profile information without revealing their phone number.\n\n#### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: Separate User Authentication from OAuth Authorization**\n> - **Context**: Users need to authenticate to the OAuth provider before they can authorize third-party applications\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Combine user authentication with OAuth flows in single endpoint\n>   - Separate authentication system with session management\n>   - Delegate authentication to external identity provider\n> - **Decision**: Separate authentication system with secure session cookies\n> - **Rationale**: OAuth2 specification assumes user is already authenticated when they reach the authorization endpoint. Separating concerns allows different authentication methods (password, MFA, SSO) without affecting OAuth flows. Session-based authentication provides better UX than re-authenticating for each OAuth request.\n> - **Consequences**: Additional complexity in session management, but cleaner separation of authentication and authorization concerns. Enables future integration with enterprise SSO without changing OAuth implementation.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Combined flow | Simpler implementation | Tight coupling, harder to extend authentication methods |\n| Separate with sessions | Clean separation, flexible auth methods | Session management complexity |\n| External delegation | Leverage existing systems | External dependency, integration complexity |\n\n> **Decision: Consent Expiration and Revocation Model**\n> - **Context**: User consent should not last forever, and users need ability to revoke previously granted permissions\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Permanent consent until explicitly revoked\n>   - Time-limited consent with configurable expiration\n>   - Consent tied to token lifetime (expires with refresh token)\n> - **Decision**: Optional time-limited consent with user-controlled revocation\n> - **Rationale**: Different use cases need different consent durability. High-security applications might want consent to expire annually, while trusted applications might receive long-term consent. User revocation must always be available regardless of expiration policy.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex consent management, but provides flexibility for different security requirements. Requires user interface for managing active consents and clear communication about consent duration.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Permanent consent | Simple implementation | No way to expire stale permissions |\n| Time-limited consent | Automatic permission cleanup | May interrupt user workflows |\n| Token-tied expiration | Aligned with token lifecycle | Complex interaction with refresh token rotation |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Storing Plaintext Client Secrets**\n\nMany implementations store client secrets in plaintext for simplicity, but this creates catastrophic security risks if the database is compromised. Even system administrators shouldn't be able to recover client secrets.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: If an attacker gains database access, they can impersonate any registered client and potentially access all user data. Regulatory compliance frameworks often require credential hashing as a basic security control.\n\n**How to fix**: Always hash client secrets using bcrypt with a work factor of at least 10. Store only the hash and compare submitted secrets against the hash during authentication. Return the plaintext secret only once during registration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Flexible Redirect URI Matching**\n\nImplementing substring matching, wildcard matching, or regex patterns for redirect URI validation seems developer-friendly but creates security vulnerabilities that attackers regularly exploit.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Even sophisticated pattern matching has edge cases. Substring matching allows `evil.com/callback` to match `good.com/callback`. Wildcard matching can be bypassed through subdomain takeover attacks. These bypasses enable authorization code interception.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement exact string matching only. Clients must register separate URIs for each environment (development, staging, production). This improves security by making each deployment explicit and eliminates entire classes of redirect URI manipulation attacks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Long-Lived Authorization Codes**\n\nSetting authorization code expiration to 30 minutes or longer seems reasonable for user experience, but significantly increases the attack window for code interception and replay attacks.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Authorization codes can be intercepted through HTTP referrer headers, browser history, server logs, or man-in-the-middle attacks. The longer the code remains valid, the more time attackers have to exploit it.\n\n**How to fix**: Set authorization code expiration to 10 minutes maximum, preferably 5 minutes. Modern applications can complete the code exchange quickly. Use PKCE for all clients to provide additional protection against code interception.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Token Family Revocation**\n\nImplementing refresh token rotation without family tracking allows compromised tokens to continue working even after legitimate users obtain new tokens.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: If a refresh token is stolen but the user continues using the application, both the legitimate user and the attacker will obtain valid refresh tokens. Without family tracking, there's no way to detect this compromise and revoke the stolen tokens.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement token families with breach detection. When an old refresh token is used after a new one has been issued, revoke the entire token family immediately. This automatically stops attacks when they're detected.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: JWT Payload Security Misconceptions**\n\nStoring sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private keys in JWT payload because \"JWTs are secure tokens.\"\n\n**Why it's wrong**: JWT payload is base64-encoded, not encrypted. Anyone who obtains the token can decode the payload and read all claims. JWTs provide integrity (through signatures) but not confidentiality.\n\n**How to fix**: Include only non-sensitive claims in JWTs: user ID, scopes, expiration times, issuer information. Store sensitive user data in your database and access it using the user ID from the token's `sub` claim.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overly Broad Scope Grants**\n\nGranting all requested scopes to applications without considering the principle of least privilege or allowing scope escalation in refresh flows.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Applications might request more permissions than they actually need, either due to over-engineering or malicious intent. Once granted, these excessive permissions increase the impact of potential security breaches.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement scope validation that checks requested scopes against the client's registered maximum scopes. Display clear descriptions of what each scope allows on consent screens. Never allow refresh token flows to grant scopes beyond what was originally authorized.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis subsection provides concrete implementation patterns and starter code to translate the data model design into working Go code.

without errors\n2. **Validation Test**: Create a simple test that validates client registration data\n3. **Generation Test**: Test the token generation functions produce different outputs on each call\n4. **Hash Verification**: Test that client secret hashing and verification work correctly\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- `GenerateClientSecret()` should return different secrets each time\n- `VerifyClientSecret()` should return true for correct secrets, false for incorrect ones\n- `GenerateAuthorizationCode()` should produce 43-character URL-safe strings\n- Client validation should reject invalid redirect URIs and empty required fields\n\n**Signs something is wrong:**\n- Token generation functions return the same value multiple times (entropy issue)\n- Client secret verification always returns false (hashing mismatch)\n- Validation functions accept clearly invalid data (validation logic incomplete)\n\n\n## Client Registration Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 - Client Registration & Authorization Endpoint\n\n### Mental Model: Business License System\n\nThink of OAuth2 client registration like a business licensing system at your local city hall. When a new restaurant wants to operate, they can't just start serving customers - they must first register with the city, provide their business details, and receive official credentials that prove their legitimacy. The city issues them a business license number (like a `client_id`) and a confidential tax ID (like a `client_secret`) that they'll use for all official transactions.\n\nJust as the city maintains strict records of where each restaurant is allowed to operate (their permitted addresses), OAuth2 client registration maintains strict records of where each application is allowed to redirect users after authorization (their registered `redirect_uri` values). A restaurant with a downtown license can't suddenly start operating in the suburbs without updating their registration - similarly, an OAuth2 client can't redirect to unregistered URIs without updating their client record.\n\nThe registration authority (whether city hall or OAuth2 provider) acts as the trusted source of truth. When other parties need to verify a business's legitimacy (like suppliers checking credentials), they contact the registration authority. Similarly, when your OAuth2 provider receives an authorization request, it validates the client's identity and permissions against the authoritative registration records.\n\nThis mental model helps explain why client registration is foundational - without proper registration and credential management, there's no way to distinguish legitimate applications from malicious ones attempting to steal user data or impersonate trusted services.\n\n### Registration Interface\n\nThe client registration interface provides the foundational API for OAuth2 applications to establish their identity with the authorization server. This interface serves as the entry point for all client applications, whether they're confidential clients (backend web applications with secure secret storage) or public clients (mobile apps and single-page applications that cannot securely store secrets).\n\nThe registration process follows a structured workflow that ensures security while remaining accessible to developers. Applications provide essential metadata about their identity, intended usage patterns, and technical capabilities. The OAuth2 provider validates this information, generates cryptographically secure credentials, and establishes the trust relationship that enables all subsequent OAuth2 flows.\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `RegisterClient` | `store ClientStore`, `name string`, `redirectURIs []string` | `*Client`, `error` | Creates new OAuth2 client with generated credentials and validates redirect URIs |\n| `CreateClient` | `ctx context.Context`, `client *Client` | `error` | Persists client record to storage with proper indexing |\n| `GetClient` | `ctx context.Context`, `clientID string` | `*Client`, `error` | Retrieves client by client_id for validation during flows |\n| `UpdateClient` | `ctx context.Context`, `clientID string`, `updates *ClientUpdate` | `error` | Modifies existing client configuration (name, redirectURIs, scopes) |\n| `DeleteClient` | `ctx context.Context`, `clientID string` | `error` | Soft deletes client and revokes all associated tokens |\n\nThe `Client` data structure captures all essential information about a registered OAuth2 application:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `ClientID` | `string` | Unique public identifier, 32-byte cryptographically random string |\n| `ClientSecret` | `string` | Confidential credential for client authentication (empty for public clients) |\n| `SecretHash` | `string` | bcrypt hash of client secret for secure storage and validation |\n| `Name` | `string` | Human-readable application name displayed on consent screens |\n| `RedirectURIs` | `[]string` | Exact URIs where authorization codes can be delivered |\n| `GrantTypes` | `[]string` | Permitted OAuth2 flows (authorization_code, client_credentials, refresh_token) |\n| `Scopes` | `[]string` | Maximum scopes this client can request (subset enforcement) |\n| `CreatedAt` | `time.Time` | Registration timestamp for auditing and lifecycle management |\n\nThe registration workflow follows these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Request Validation**: The registration handler validates that required fields are present and properly formatted. Application names must be non-empty and reasonable length (1-100 characters). Redirect URIs must be absolute HTTPS URLs (HTTP allowed only for localhost development). The handler rejects registrations with obviously malicious or misconfigured parameters.\n\n2. **Credential Generation**: The system generates a cryptographically secure `client_id` using 32 bytes of random data, encoded as a URL-safe base64 string. For confidential clients, it generates an equally strong `client_secret` and immediately hashes it using bcrypt with a work factor of 12. Public clients (mobile and single-page applications) receive no secret, as they cannot store credentials securely.\n\n3. **URI Validation**: Each provided redirect URI undergoes strict validation. The system requires HTTPS schemes for production (with localhost HTTP allowed for development). It rejects URIs with fragments, as OAuth2 specifications prohibit fragment-based redirects. The validation ensures URIs are absolute, properly formatted, and don't contain suspicious patterns that might enable redirect attacks.\n\n4. **Default Configuration**: The registration process applies sensible defaults for grant types and scopes based on client type. Confidential clients receive `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, and optionally `client_credentials` grants. Public clients receive only `authorization_code` with PKCE enforcement. Default scopes include basic profile access, with additional scopes requiring explicit approval.\n\n5. **Storage and Indexing**: The system persists the complete client record with proper database indexing on `ClientID` for fast lookups during authorization flows. It stores the bcrypt hash rather than plaintext secrets, ensuring credential security even if storage is compromised. The storage layer supports atomic operations to prevent partial registrations.\n\n6. **Response Generation**: Successful registrations return the complete client record including the generated `client_id` and `client_secret` (for confidential clients). This is the only time the plaintext secret is revealed - clients must store it securely as it cannot be retrieved later, only regenerated through a separate rotation process.\n\nThe registration interface includes comprehensive error handling for common failure scenarios:\n\n| Error Condition | Response | Description |\n|----------------|----------|-------------|\n| Missing application name | `invalid_request` | Application name is required for consent screen display |\n| Invalid redirect URI | `invalid_redirect_uri` | URI must be absolute HTTPS (or localhost HTTP) |\n| Duplicate client name | `invalid_request` | Application names must be unique within the provider |\n| Storage failure | `server_error` | Database unavailable or constraint violation |\n| Rate limit exceeded | `temporarily_unavailable` | Too many registrations from same source |\n\n### Credential Storage and Hashing\n\nCredential storage represents one of the most security-critical aspects of the OAuth2 provider, as compromised client credentials can enable widespread attacks against user data. The storage system must protect client secrets with the same rigor applied to user passwords, while supporting the high-throughput access patterns required during OAuth2 flows.\n\nThe credential storage architecture employs multiple layers of protection to ensure client secret security. At the core lies a cryptographically sound hashing strategy that renders stored secrets useless to attackers even in the event of database compromise. The system combines this with secure random generation, constant-time validation, and comprehensive audit logging.\n\n**Secret Generation and Hashing Process:**\n\nThe `GenerateClientSecret` function implements a secure two-phase process that creates both the plaintext secret returned to the client and the hash stored in the database:\n\n1. **Random Generation**: The system generates 32 bytes of cryptographically random data using the operating system's secure random number generator. This provides approximately 256 bits of entropy, far exceeding the security requirements for client authentication. The raw bytes are encoded using URL-safe base64 to create a string suitable for HTTP transmission and storage in configuration files.\n\n2. **bcrypt Hashing**: The plaintext secret immediately undergoes bcrypt hashing with a work factor of 12. bcrypt provides several critical security properties: it's computationally expensive (requiring ~250ms on modern hardware), includes automatic salt generation to prevent rainbow table attacks, and uses a proven algorithm resistant to both brute-force and cryptanalytic attacks. The work factor of 12 represents a careful balance between security and performance - high enough to significantly slow brute-force attempts while remaining fast enough for interactive authentication flows.\n\n3. **Secure Cleanup**: After hashing, the system immediately clears the plaintext secret from memory and returns both the original secret (for client storage) and the hash (for database storage). This minimizes the window during which plaintext secrets exist in memory.\n\n**Storage Schema and Indexing:**\n\nThe client credentials storage employs a carefully designed schema that supports both security and performance requirements:\n\n| Field | Type | Index | Description |\n|-------|------|-------|-------------|\n| `client_id` | `VARCHAR(64)` | PRIMARY KEY | Unique identifier, base64-encoded random bytes |\n| `secret_hash` | `VARCHAR(72)` | None | bcrypt hash of client secret (60 chars + NULL) |\n| `name` | `VARCHAR(255)` | UNIQUE | Application name for consent screens |\n| `redirect_uris` | `JSON` | None | Array of permitted redirect destinations |\n| `grant_types` | `JSON` | None | Array of permitted OAuth2 flows |\n| `scopes` | `JSON` | None | Array of maximum permitted scopes |\n| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | INDEX | Registration time for auditing |\n| `last_used_at` | `TIMESTAMP` | INDEX | Most recent authentication for cleanup |\n| `active` | `BOOLEAN` | INDEX | Soft deletion flag |\n\nThe indexing strategy optimizes for the OAuth2 flow access patterns. The primary key on `client_id` enables O(1) lookups during authorization and token requests. The unique index on `name` prevents duplicate application names that could confuse users. Indexes on timestamp fields support efficient cleanup of unused clients and audit queries.\n\n**Secret Validation Process:**\n\nThe `VerifyClientSecret` function implements constant-time secret validation that prevents timing attacks while maintaining compatibility with standard bcrypt libraries:\n\n1. **Hash Retrieval**: The system retrieves the stored bcrypt hash for the provided `client_id`. If no client exists, it performs a dummy bcrypt operation against a fake hash to maintain constant timing behavior.\n\n2. **bcrypt Comparison**: The bcrypt library's constant-time compare function validates the provided secret against the stored hash. This comparison takes consistent time regardless of how much of the secret matches, preventing attackers from using timing differences to guess secrets character by character.\n\n3. **Result Handling**: The function returns a boolean result without leaking information about why validation failed. Whether the client doesn't exist, the secret is wrong, or the client is disabled, the result appears identical to potential attackers.\n\n**Audit Logging and Monitoring:**\n\nThe credential storage system maintains comprehensive audit logs that enable security monitoring and forensic analysis:\n\n| Event Type | Logged Data | Purpose |\n|------------|-------------|---------|\n| Client Registration | `client_id`, `name`, source IP, timestamp | Track new client creation |\n| Authentication Success | `client_id`, source IP, timestamp | Monitor normal usage |\n| Authentication Failure | attempted `client_id`, source IP, timestamp | Detect brute-force attacks |\n| Secret Rotation | `client_id`, old/new secret hashes, timestamp | Track credential changes |\n| Client Deletion | `client_id`, `name`, deletion reason, timestamp | Audit client lifecycle |\n\nThe monitoring system analyzes these logs to detect suspicious patterns such as repeated authentication failures from the same IP address, authentication attempts for non-existent clients, or unusual geographic patterns in client usage.\n\n**Backup and Recovery Considerations:**\n\nClient credential storage requires special handling in backup and recovery scenarios. Database backups containing client records must be encrypted at rest and protected with the same security measures as production systems. The recovery process must validate that restored client hashes remain valid and haven't been corrupted during backup or restoration.\n\nFor disaster recovery scenarios, the system supports client secret rotation workflows that allow legitimate clients to re-establish their credentials without requiring manual intervention from every application developer. This involves secure out-of-band communication channels and cryptographic proof of client ownership.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe client registration component requires several critical design decisions that significantly impact the security, performance, and usability of the entire OAuth2 provider. Each decision involves careful trade-offs between competing concerns.\n\n> **Decision: Client Secret Hashing Algorithm**\n> - **Context**: Client secrets must be stored securely to prevent credential theft in case of database compromise, while supporting high-throughput authentication during OAuth2 flows. The hashing algorithm must balance computational cost, security strength, and implementation complexity.\n> - **Options Considered**: Plain storage (no hashing), SHA-256 with salt, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2id\n> - **Decision**: Use bcrypt with work factor 12 for client secret hashing\n> - **Rationale**: bcrypt provides proven security with widespread library support and excellent resistance to both rainbow table and brute-force attacks. Work factor 12 requires ~250ms per hash on modern hardware, adding meaningful cost for attackers while remaining acceptable for interactive OAuth2 flows (which typically involve 1-2 client authentications per user session). Unlike memory-hard functions (scrypt/Argon2id), bcrypt's CPU-only approach suits deployment environments with constrained memory.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables secure credential storage with acceptable performance overhead. Requires careful work factor tuning for different deployment environments. Provides upgrade path to stronger algorithms in the future through algorithm versioning.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Plain storage | Zero computational overhead | Catastrophic security failure if database compromised |\n| SHA-256 + salt | Fast, simple implementation | Vulnerable to GPU-accelerated brute force attacks |\n| bcrypt (chosen) | Proven security, tunable cost, wide support | Fixed memory usage, slower than simple hashes |\n| scrypt | Memory-hard, resistant to ASIC attacks | Complex tuning, higher memory requirements |\n| Argon2id | Latest standard, excellent security properties | Limited library support, complex parameterization |\n\n> **Decision: Client ID Generation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Client IDs must be unique, unpredictable, and suitable for use in URLs and HTTP headers. They serve as public identifiers that appear in authorization URLs and audit logs, so they must not leak sensitive information about the client or provider.\n> - **Options Considered**: Sequential integers, UUIDs (v4), cryptographically random strings, hash of client metadata\n> - **Decision**: Use 32-byte cryptographically random strings, base64url-encoded\n> - **Rationale**: Cryptographic randomness provides maximum security against enumeration and prediction attacks. 32 bytes offers 256 bits of entropy, making collisions mathematically impossible at any realistic scale. Base64url encoding creates URL-safe strings without padding characters. This approach avoids UUID overhead while providing stronger security guarantees than standard UUID v4 (which uses only 122 bits of randomness).\n> - **Consequences**: Eliminates enumeration attacks and ensures global uniqueness without coordination. Creates slightly longer identifiers than UUIDs (43 vs 36 characters) but provides superior security. Requires cryptographically secure random number generator.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Sequential integers | Short, simple, predictable ordering | Trivial enumeration, leaks registration volume |\n| UUIDs v4 | Standard format, good uniqueness | Only 122 bits entropy, longer than needed |\n| Random strings (chosen) | Maximum entropy, customizable length | Non-standard format, requires careful encoding |\n| Hashed metadata | Deterministic, prevents duplicates | Vulnerable to rainbow tables, complex collision handling |\n\n> **Decision: Redirect URI Validation Strictness**\n> - **Context**: OAuth2 redirect URI validation prevents authorization code interception attacks, but overly strict validation can break legitimate use cases. The validation must balance security against developer usability, particularly for development and testing scenarios.\n> - **Options Considered**: Exact string matching only, prefix matching, pattern matching with wildcards, runtime URI validation\n> - **Decision**: Exact string matching with localhost HTTP exception for development\n> - **Rationale**: Exact matching provides the strongest security guarantee by preventing any form of redirect manipulation. The OAuth2 specification strongly recommends exact matching to prevent subtle attack vectors. Allowing HTTP for localhost URIs supports local development without compromising production security. This approach eliminates entire classes of redirect-based attacks while remaining practical for legitimate development workflows.\n> - **Consequences**: Maximizes security against redirect attacks but requires clients to register all redirect URIs upfront. Development environments can use HTTP localhost without security compromise. Clients needing dynamic redirects must implement application-level routing after the OAuth2 redirect.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Exact matching (chosen) | Maximum security, spec-compliant | Requires registering all URIs, less flexible |\n| Prefix matching | More flexible for path-based routing | Vulnerable to path traversal attacks |\n| Wildcard patterns | Very flexible, supports complex routing | Complex implementation, many attack vectors |\n| Runtime validation | Ultimate flexibility | Cannot validate at registration time, complex security model |\n\n> **Decision: Public Client Secret Handling**\n> - **Context**: Public clients (mobile apps, single-page applications) cannot securely store client secrets, but the OAuth2 specification allows both secret-based and secret-less authentication. The provider must handle both client types while maintaining security.\n> - **Options Considered**: Require secrets for all clients, allow empty secrets for public clients, separate registration endpoints, client type declaration\n> - **Decision**: Allow empty client secrets with mandatory PKCE for public clients\n> - **Rationale**: Following OAuth2 Security Best Current Practice, public clients should not receive secrets and must use PKCE for security. Empty secrets clearly indicate public client status and eliminate any temptation to embed secrets in client-side code. Mandatory PKCE provides equivalent security to client secrets for public clients. This approach aligns with current OAuth2 security guidance and modern application architectures.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables secure mobile and SPA integration without compromising security. Requires PKCE implementation and validation. Creates two distinct client authentication paths that must be properly handled throughout the system.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Require all secrets | Simple, uniform authentication model | Impossible for public clients to implement securely |\n| Empty secrets (chosen) | Clear public client indication, spec-compliant | Requires dual authentication logic |\n| Separate endpoints | Clear separation of client types | Duplicated registration logic, more complex API |\n| Client type declaration | Explicit client capability declaration | Additional complexity, potential misconfiguration |\n\n> **Decision: Client Name Uniqueness Enforcement**\n> - **Context**: Client names appear on consent screens to help users identify applications requesting access. Duplicate names could enable phishing attacks where malicious applications impersonate legitimate ones. However, legitimate applications might have naming conflicts.\n> - **Options Considered**: No uniqueness requirement, global uniqueness enforcement, namespace-based uniqueness, user confirmation for duplicates\n> - **Decision**: Enforce global uniqueness of client names with case-insensitive comparison\n> - **Rationale**: Global uniqueness prevents impersonation attacks where malicious clients use names identical to popular applications. Case-insensitive comparison prevents near-duplicate names that could confuse users. This approach prioritizes user security over developer convenience, as confused users might grant inappropriate permissions to impersonator applications. The burden on developers to choose unique names is manageable and encourages distinctive branding.\n> - **Consequences**: Prevents client impersonation attacks through name confusion. May require developers to modify desired application names if conflicts exist. Requires careful handling of internationalization and Unicode normalization in name comparison.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| No uniqueness | No naming restrictions for developers | Enables impersonation attacks |\n| Global uniqueness (chosen) | Prevents impersonation, clear user identification | May inconvenience legitimate developers |\n| Namespaced uniqueness | Reduces conflicts while preventing impersonation | Complex namespace management |\n| User confirmation | Flexible with explicit user warning | Users may ignore warnings, complex UX |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nOAuth2 client registration appears straightforward but contains numerous subtle security and implementation traps that can compromise the entire authorization system. These pitfalls often arise from misunderstanding the threat model or making seemingly reasonable optimizations that introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Storing Plaintext Client Secrets**\n\nMany implementations store client secrets in plaintext or with reversible encryption, reasoning that the secrets need to be compared during authentication. This creates catastrophic vulnerability if the database is compromised, as attackers gain immediate access to all client credentials.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Client secrets function like passwords and should never be recoverable. Unlike user passwords, client secrets don't need account recovery workflows - they can be regenerated if lost. Storing plaintext secrets means a single database breach exposes every registered application's credentials.\n\n**How to fix it:** Always hash client secrets using bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2id before storage. Store only the hash and compare provided secrets against the hash using the library's constant-time comparison function. Never implement custom hashing or comparison logic.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Weak Client ID Generation**\n\nUsing predictable client ID generation (sequential numbers, timestamps, or weak random generators) enables enumeration attacks where adversaries can guess valid client IDs and attempt to exploit them in authorization flows.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Client IDs appear in authorization URLs and logs, making them observable to attackers. Predictable IDs allow attackers to discover all registered clients and potentially launch targeted attacks against specific applications. Even UUID v4 provides insufficient randomness (122 bits) for high-security environments.\n\n**How to fix it:** Generate client IDs using cryptographically secure random number generators with at least 256 bits of entropy. Use base64url encoding to create URL-safe strings. Never use sequential numbers, timestamps, or application names as client ID components.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Loose Redirect URI Validation**\n\nImplementing flexible redirect URI validation (prefix matching, wildcard support, or runtime validation) seems developer-friendly but introduces authorization code interception vulnerabilities where attackers can redirect authorization codes to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** The redirect URI is the primary security boundary preventing authorization code theft. Any flexibility in validation creates attack opportunities. Even seemingly safe approaches like prefix matching can be exploited through path traversal or subdomain attacks.\n\n**How to fix it:** Implement exact string matching for redirect URIs. Allow HTTP only for localhost addresses during development. Require applications to register all possible redirect URIs at registration time. Document this limitation clearly and provide guidance on application-level routing after OAuth2 redirects.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Client Type Handling**\n\nMixing confidential and public client authentication logic without clear separation leads to security vulnerabilities where public clients might authenticate using missing or weak credentials, or confidential clients might bypass proper authentication.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Confidential and public clients have fundamentally different security models. Confidential clients rely on secret-based authentication, while public clients depend on PKCE. Inconsistent handling can allow authentication bypasses or force insecure authentication methods.\n\n**How to fix it:** Clearly distinguish client types at registration time. Store client type explicitly in the client record. Implement separate authentication paths that enforce appropriate security measures for each client type. Never allow public clients to authenticate with secrets, and never allow confidential clients to skip secret authentication.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Client Secret Rotation Support**\n\nFailing to implement client secret rotation capabilities creates operational security problems when secrets are compromised, accidentally exposed, or need regular rotation for compliance requirements.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Client secrets will eventually need rotation due to security breaches, compliance requirements, or operational accidents. Without rotation support, the only option is deleting and re-creating clients, which breaks all existing deployments and requires coordination across multiple teams.\n\n**How to fix it:** Implement client secret rotation endpoints that generate new secrets while temporarily accepting both old and new secrets during a transition period. Provide secure out-of-band notification mechanisms for secret rotation. Include secret version tracking to support gradual rollout of new secrets.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Rate Limiting on Registration**\n\nAllowing unlimited client registration enables abuse where attackers create large numbers of clients to exhaust storage, create confusion in audit logs, or launch distributed attacks using many different client IDs.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Client registration should be a relatively rare operation, but unlimited registration enables various abuse scenarios. Mass client creation can exhaust storage quotas, make audit logs unusable, and provide attackers with numerous client IDs for distributed attack campaigns.\n\n**How to fix it:** Implement rate limiting on client registration endpoints based on source IP, user account, and global registration rate. Consider requiring manual approval for client registration in high-security environments. Monitor registration patterns for abuse and implement automated detection of suspicious registration activity.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Exposing Internal Client Information**\n\nReturning internal database fields, sensitive configuration details, or other clients' information in registration responses creates information disclosure vulnerabilities that can aid attackers in understanding the system or launching targeted attacks.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Client registration responses should contain only the information needed by the registering application. Exposing internal IDs, configuration details, or information about other clients provides intelligence that attackers can use for reconnaissance or privilege escalation attacks.\n\n**How to fix it:** Carefully design registration response objects to include only public information needed by clients. Never include database internal IDs, other clients' information, or sensitive configuration. Implement response filtering that explicitly allowlists returned fields rather than blocklisting sensitive ones.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Redirect URI Format Validation**\n\nAccepting malformed URIs, URIs with fragments, or non-HTTP(S) schemes in redirect URI registration creates potential security vulnerabilities and protocol violations that can be exploited in authorization flows.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** OAuth2 specifications explicitly prohibit certain URI formats (particularly those with fragments) and require absolute URIs. Accepting invalid formats can lead to protocol violations, security vulnerabilities, or interoperability problems with client applications.\n\n**How to fix it:** Implement comprehensive URI validation that checks scheme (HTTPS required, HTTP only for localhost), absolute format, absence of fragments, and proper encoding. Reject registrations with invalid URIs rather than attempting to correct them. Provide clear error messages explaining validation requirements.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

if not found\n    // TODO 5: Log access for auditing\n}\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Hints\n\n**Go-Specific Implementation Tips:**\n\n1. **JSON Handling**: Use struct tags to control JSON serialization. The `json:\"-\"` tag prevents sensitive fields from appearing in responses. The `omitempty` tag excludes nil pointers and empty values.\n\n2. **Database Integration**: Use the `db` struct tags with libraries like `sqlx` for automatic scanning. Store JSON arrays as PostgreSQL JSON columns or comma-separated strings for SQLite.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf(\"context: %w\", err)` to maintain error chains. Use custom error types for OAuth2-specific errors that need special HTTP status codes.\n\n4. **Context Usage**: Always pass `context.Context` to database operations for timeout and cancellation support. Use `context.Background()` only in tests or main functions.\n\n5. **Security Libraries**: Use `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` for password hashing, never implement custom crypto. Use `crypto/rand` for random generation, never `math/rand`.\n\n6. **Testing**: Use table-driven tests for validation functions. Use `testify/mock` for mocking the ClientStore interface. Use `httptest` for testing HTTP handlers.\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the client registration component, verify the following functionality:\n\n**Registration API Testing:**\n```bash\n# Test client registration\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/register \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"Test Application\",\n    \"redirect_uris\": [\"https://app.example.com/callback\", \"http://localhost:3000/callback\"]\n  }'\n\n# Expected response (save the client_secret!):\n{\n  \"client_id\": \"abc123...\",\n  \"client_secret\": \"def456...\",\n  \"name\": \"Test Application\",\n  \"redirect_uris\": [\"https://app.example.com/callback\", \"http://localhost:3000/callback\"],\n  \"grant_types\": [\"authorization_code\"],\n  \"scopes\": [\"openid\", \"profile\"],\n  \"client_type\": \"confidential\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"active\": true\n}\n```\n\n**Database Verification:**\n```sql\n-- Verify client record was created correctly\nSELECT client_id, name, redirect_uris, secret_hash IS NOT NULL as has_secret \nFROM oauth_clients \nWHERE name = 'Test Application';\n\n-- Verify secret is hashed, not plaintext\nSELECT LENGTH(secret_hash), LEFT(secret_hash, 7) = '$2a$12$' as is_bcrypt\nFROM oauth_clients \nWHERE name = 'Test Application';\n```\n\n**Validation Testing:**\n```bash\n# Test duplicate name rejection\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/register \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Test Application\", \"redirect_uris\": [\"https://other.example.com/callback\"]}'\n# Should return 400 Bad Request\n\n# Test invalid redirect URI\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/register \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Invalid App\", \"redirect_uris\": [\"http://example.com/callback\"]}'\n# Should return 400 Bad Request (HTTP not allowed except localhost)\n```\n\n**Security Verification:**\n1. Confirm client secrets are never logged in plaintext\n2. Verify bcrypt hashes start with `$2a$12$` (correct algorithm and cost)\n3. Test that client_id values are truly random (no sequential patterns)\n4. Ensure redirect URI validation rejects malicious URIs with fragments\n5. Verify case-insensitive name uniqueness works correctly\n\n**Signs Something Is Wrong:**\n- Client secrets appear in logs or error messages (security leak)\n- Client registration succeeds with invalid redirect URIs (validation bypass)\n- Database contains plaintext secrets (hashing failure)\n- Sequential or predictable client_id values (weak random generation)\n- Duplicate client names accepted (uniqueness constraint failure)\n\n\n## Authorization Endpoint Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 - Client Registration & Authorization Endpoint\n\n### Mental Model: Bank Authorization Process\n\nThink of the OAuth2 authorization endpoint like a bank's signature card verification process. When you want to give someone permission to access your bank account (like setting up automatic bill payments), you don't just hand over your debit card PIN. Instead, you visit the bank with proper identification, review exactly what permissions the company is requesting, and then sign an authorization form that grants specific, limited access to your account.\n\nThe authorization endpoint serves as this secure \"bank branch\" where the real account owner (resource owner) can review what a third-party application is requesting and make an informed decision. Just as the bank verifies your identity before processing any authorization, the OAuth2 provider must authenticate the user before showing them the consent screen. The bank also validates that the company requesting access is legitimate (registered business) and that their request form (authorization request) contains all required information and matches their registered details.\n\nThe authorization code that gets generated is like a signed authorization form with a unique reference number. This form can only be used once, expires quickly (typically within 10 minutes), and must be exchanged by the legitimate business at the bank's separate \"account setup\" window (token endpoint) to receive the actual account access credentials. The authorization code itself provides no account access - it's merely proof that the account owner approved the request under specific terms.\n\nThis mental model highlights several critical security properties: the authorization decision is always made by the authenticated account owner, the authorization is specific to one requesting party and their stated purpose, and the authorization proof (code) cannot be directly used to access protected resources.\n\n### PKCE Implementation\n\n**Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** addresses a fundamental security weakness in the original OAuth2 authorization code flow. When mobile applications or single-page applications initiate an authorization request, they cannot securely store a client secret (since anyone can inspect the app binary or JavaScript source). Without PKCE, an attacker who intercepts an authorization code could potentially exchange it for tokens without being the legitimate client.\n\nPKCE solves this by creating a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism that proves the client exchanging the authorization code is the same client that initiated the authorization request. The process works like a secure handshake where the client demonstrates knowledge of a secret without ever transmitting that secret over potentially insecure channels.\n\nThe **code challenge generation** begins when the client creates a cryptographically random string called a `code_verifier`. This verifier must be between 43 and 128 characters long and use unreserved characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, '-', '.', '_', '~'). The client then applies a one-way transformation to create a `code_challenge`. While the OAuth2 specification allows \"plain\" transformation (where challenge equals verifier), security best practices mandate using \"S256\" method where the challenge is the base64url-encoded SHA256 hash of the verifier.\n\n![PKCE Flow Implementation](./diagrams/pkce-flow-diagram.svg)\n\nDuring the **authorization request phase**, the client includes the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters in the authorization URL. The authorization server stores these values alongside the generated authorization code. An attacker intercepting this request only sees the hashed challenge, not the original verifier, making it computationally infeasible to generate a valid verifier.\n\nThe **verification process** occurs during token exchange when the client presents the original `code_verifier` to the token endpoint. The authorization server retrieves the stored `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` for that authorization code, recomputes the challenge by applying the same transformation to the provided verifier, and compares the results. Only if the computed challenge matches the stored challenge does the server proceed with token issuance.\n\n| PKCE Parameter | Source | Purpose | Security Property |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `code_verifier` | Client-generated | Proves client identity during token exchange | High entropy secret never transmitted during authorization |\n| `code_challenge` | SHA256 hash of verifier | Binds authorization code to client | One-way transformation prevents verifier derivation |\n| `code_challenge_method` | Always \"S256\" | Specifies hash algorithm | Ensures cryptographic binding, not plaintext |\n\n**PKCE enforcement policies** must distinguish between different client types. Public clients (mobile apps, SPAs) should be required to use PKCE for all authorization requests, as they cannot securely store client secrets. Confidential clients (server-side web applications) that can authenticate with client secrets may optionally use PKCE as defense-in-depth, but the authorization server should not reject requests lacking PKCE parameters from properly authenticated confidential clients.\n\nThe **code challenge validation** implementation must use constant-time comparison operations to prevent timing attacks that could leak information about the expected challenge value. Additionally, the authorization server must store the PKCE parameters securely alongside authorization codes and ensure they are properly cleaned up when codes expire or are consumed.\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: PKCE transforms OAuth2 from relying solely on client authentication (which public clients cannot do securely) to cryptographic proof of request initiation, making the authorization code flow secure even for clients that cannot keep secrets.\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: PKCE Enforcement Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Mandatory PKCE for Public Clients with Graceful Confidential Client Support**\n> - **Context**: Different OAuth2 client types have different security capabilities. Public clients (mobile, SPA) cannot securely store secrets while confidential clients can authenticate via client secrets.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Mandatory PKCE for all clients\n>   2. Optional PKCE for all clients  \n>   3. Mandatory for public clients, optional for confidential clients\n> - **Decision**: Require PKCE for clients without client secrets, allow optional PKCE for confidential clients\n> - **Rationale**: Maximizes security for vulnerable public clients while maintaining compatibility with existing confidential clients that rely on client secret authentication\n> - **Consequences**: Requires client type detection logic and different validation paths, but provides appropriate security for each client category\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Security Level |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Mandatory for all | Uniform security model, future-proof | Breaks existing confidential clients | Highest |\n| Optional for all | Maximum compatibility | Public clients remain vulnerable | Lowest |\n| Type-specific (chosen) | Appropriate security per client type | Complex validation logic | Optimal balance |\n\n### User Consent Screen\n\nThe **consent screen interface** serves as the critical trust boundary where users make informed decisions about granting access to their protected resources. This interface must clearly communicate what the requesting application wants to access, who is making the request, and what the consequences of approval or denial will be. The design must balance security transparency with usability to avoid consent fatigue that leads users to blindly approve all requests.\n\n**Essential consent screen elements** include the requesting application's verified name and description, a clear list of requested scopes translated into human-readable permissions, visual indicators of data sensitivity levels, and explicit approval/denial buttons that make the user's choice unambiguous. The screen must also display the user's current authentication context and provide a secure way to change accounts if needed.\n\nThe **scope presentation strategy** transforms technical OAuth2 scope strings into meaningful descriptions that non-technical users can understand. Rather than showing \"user:email repo:public_repo\", the screen should display \"Access your email address\" and \"Read your public repositories\". Each permission description should include specific examples of what the application will be able to do and, importantly, what it will NOT be able to do with the granted access.\n\n| Scope | Technical Name | User-Friendly Description | Data Sensitivity |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Profile basic info | `profile` | View your name and profile picture | Low |\n| Email address | `email` | Access your email address for notifications | Medium |\n| Repository access | `repo` | Read and modify your code repositories | High |\n| Admin privileges | `admin:org` | Manage organization settings and members | Critical |\n\n**Consent persistence logic** determines when to show the consent screen versus when to rely on previously granted permissions. The system should store consent decisions with sufficient granularity to detect when new permissions are requested or when significant time has passed since the last consent. Users should never be surprised by applications having access they don't remember granting.\n\nA robust consent system maintains **consent records** that track not just the granted scopes, but also when consent was given, when it was last used, and under what circumstances. This enables features like consent expiration, suspicious activity detection, and detailed access logs that users can review to maintain control over their data.\n\nThe **consent flow state machine** manages the user journey from initial authorization request through consent decision to final redirect. The system must handle edge cases like users navigating away mid-flow, session timeouts during consent review, and attempts to manipulate consent parameters through browser developer tools.\n\n| State | User Action | System Response | Next State |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Request Received | - | Validate parameters, authenticate user | Show Consent |\n| Show Consent | Approve | Generate authorization code, redirect | Flow Complete |\n| Show Consent | Deny | Send access_denied error, redirect | Flow Complete |\n| Show Consent | Navigate away | Clean up pending state | Request Expired |\n| Session Timeout | - | Require re-authentication | Authenticate User |\n\n**Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection** in the consent flow relies heavily on the OAuth2 `state` parameter, but the consent screen itself may require additional protection if implemented as an HTML form. The authorization server must validate that consent decisions originate from legitimate user interactions, not from malicious scripts or cross-site attacks.\n\n### Authorization Code Generation\n\n**Cryptographically secure random generation** forms the foundation of authorization code security. Authorization codes must be indistinguishable from random data to prevent attackers from predicting or brute-forcing valid codes. The system must use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) that draws entropy from the operating system's secure random source.\n\nThe **authorization code format** should prioritize security over human readability. A 32-byte random value encoded as base64url (resulting in a 43-character string) provides approximately 256 bits of entropy, making brute-force attacks computationally infeasible. The encoding must use base64url rather than standard base64 to ensure the codes are URL-safe without requiring additional percent-encoding.\n\n**Code binding mechanisms** associate each authorization code with the specific authorization request parameters that generated it. This binding prevents authorization code injection attacks where an attacker attempts to use a legitimate code with different parameters than originally authorized. The system must store and validate the client ID, redirect URI, requested scopes, and PKCE challenge alongside each code.\n\n| Bound Parameter | Storage Requirement | Validation Point | Attack Prevention |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Client ID | Required | Token exchange | Prevents cross-client code reuse |\n| Redirect URI | Exact match | Token exchange | Prevents code interception |\n| Scope | Original requested scopes | Token exchange | Prevents privilege escalation |\n| PKCE Challenge | SHA256 hash + method | Token exchange | Proves client identity |\n| User ID | Internal user identifier | Token exchange | Prevents user confusion |\n\n**Authorization code lifecycle management** enforces strict temporal and usage constraints to minimize the window of vulnerability. Codes must expire within 10 minutes of generation (RFC recommendation) and become invalid immediately after one successful exchange attempt. The system should also implement cleanup processes to purge expired codes and prevent storage exhaustion.\n\nThe **single-use enforcement** mechanism must be atomic to prevent race conditions where the same code could be exchanged multiple times simultaneously. This typically requires database-level constraints or atomic compare-and-swap operations that mark codes as used in the same transaction that validates their availability.\n\n**Authorization code storage security** requires protecting codes both at rest and in transit. While codes are temporary and cannot directly access resources, they represent valuable authentication artifacts that attackers might attempt to steal. Storage should use appropriate database security measures, and codes should never appear in application logs or error messages.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: State Parameter Validation Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Cryptographically Secure State Generation with Round-Trip Validation**\n> - **Context**: The OAuth2 state parameter provides CSRF protection but implementation approaches vary from simple timestamps to cryptographic tokens\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Client-provided state with no server validation\n>   2. Server-generated random state with session storage\n>   3. Hybrid approach allowing client state with server validation\n> - **Decision**: Accept client-provided state parameters while strongly recommending cryptographically random values and providing validation guidance\n> - **Rationale**: Maintains OAuth2 specification compliance while enabling flexible client implementations, with clear security guidance preventing weak state implementations\n> - **Consequences**: Requires client education about state security but provides maximum compatibility with diverse client architectures\n\n| Approach | CSRF Protection | Implementation Complexity | Client Flexibility | Chosen |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Client-only state | Variable (depends on client) | Low | High | ✓ |\n| Server-generated state | High | Medium | Low | |\n| Hybrid validation | High | High | Medium | |\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: Authorization Code Expiration Strategy**\n\n> **Decision: Short-Lived Codes with Aggressive Cleanup**\n> - **Context**: Authorization codes represent a security risk while valid, but overly short expiration can cause usability issues with network latency\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. 10-minute expiration (RFC 6749 recommendation)\n>   2. 5-minute expiration for enhanced security\n>   3. Adaptive expiration based on client risk profile\n> - **Decision**: 10-minute expiration with 5-minute option for high-security deployments, plus immediate cleanup on first use\n> - **Rationale**: Balances security with practical network delays and mobile application backgrounding scenarios while maintaining RFC compliance\n> - **Consequences**: Requires robust cleanup mechanisms and clear client guidance on timely code exchange\n\n**Architecture Decision Record: Redirect URI Validation Strictness**\n\n> **Decision: Exact String Matching with No Wildcards or Partial Matches**\n> - **Context**: Redirect URI validation prevents authorization code interception but strict validation can cause deployment difficulties\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Exact string matching only\n>   2. Allow subdomain wildcards (*.example.com)\n>   3. Allow path prefix matching\n> - **Decision**: Enforce exact string matching with multiple allowed URIs per client\n> - **Rationale**: Exact matching eliminates entire classes of redirect URI manipulation attacks while multiple URI registration provides deployment flexibility\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful client configuration but provides strongest security guarantees against redirect attacks\n\n| Validation Level | Security Strength | Configuration Flexibility | Attack Surface | Chosen |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Exact matching | Highest | Medium | Minimal | ✓ |\n| Subdomain wildcards | Medium | High | Moderate | |\n| Path prefixes | Low | Highest | Significant | |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Using Predictable Authorization Code Generation**\n\nMany implementations attempt to create \"readable\" authorization codes by using timestamps, sequential numbers, or weak random number generators. This creates a critical vulnerability where attackers can predict or enumerate valid codes.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Authorization codes with insufficient entropy can be brute-forced or predicted, allowing attackers to obtain tokens for arbitrary users without their consent.\n\n**How to fix**: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create codes with at least 128 bits of entropy. In Go, use `crypto/rand` rather than `math/rand`. Encode the result as base64url for URL safety.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient PKCE Challenge Validation**\n\nImplementations sometimes skip PKCE validation for \"trusted\" clients or use string equality comparison that's vulnerable to timing attacks.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Weak PKCE validation defeats the entire purpose of the security mechanism, leaving public clients vulnerable to authorization code interception attacks.\n\n**How to fix**: Always validate PKCE parameters when present, use constant-time comparison operations, and require PKCE for all public clients (those without client secrets).\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Storing User Passwords in Consent Context**\n\nSome implementations attempt to \"streamline\" the consent flow by storing user credentials or authentication state insecurely to avoid re-authentication.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Storing authentication credentials beyond the immediate authentication session creates unnecessary credential exposure risks and violates security best practices.\n\n**How to fix**: Use secure session management with time-limited authentication tokens. Require re-authentication for sensitive operations rather than caching credentials.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Authorization Code Binding**\n\nImplementations might generate authorization codes without properly binding them to the original request parameters, allowing codes to be used with different clients or redirect URIs than intended.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Unbound authorization codes can be stolen and used by different clients, leading to token theft and unauthorized access.\n\n**How to fix**: Store all critical request parameters (client ID, redirect URI, scope, PKCE challenge) alongside each authorization code and validate these parameters during token exchange.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Exposing Authorization Codes in Logs or Error Messages**\n\nAuthorization codes might inadvertently appear in application logs, error messages, or debugging output, creating an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Logged authorization codes can be extracted by attackers with log access and used to obtain unauthorized tokens.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement careful logging practices that redact or hash sensitive parameters. Never include authorization codes in error messages returned to clients.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Weak State Parameter Validation**\n\nClients might use predictable state values (like \"state=1234\") or servers might not properly validate state round-trips, weakening CSRF protection.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Predictable or unvalidated state parameters allow cross-site request forgery attacks that can trick users into authorizing malicious applications.\n\n**How to fix**: Generate cryptographically random state values with sufficient entropy and validate that the returned state exactly matches the sent state. Consider binding state to user sessions for additional protection.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

all random generation - never use `math/rand` for security-critical values\n- Implement constant-time string comparison using bitwise XOR to prevent timing attacks\n- Use `html/template` with auto-escaping enabled for consent screen rendering to prevent XSS\n- Store authorization codes with `time.Time` expiration and use database-level TTL where possible\n- Implement atomic code consumption using SQL `UPDATE ... WHERE used = false` with affected row counting\n- Use structured logging with `slog` but implement custom redaction for sensitive OAuth2 parameters\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Return structured OAuth2 errors using the `OAuth2Error` type with proper error codes\n- Implement redirect-based error responses that preserve the original `state` parameter\n- Log security events (failed validations, expired codes) but never log sensitive values\n- Use HTTP status codes appropriately: 400 for client errors, 302 for OAuth2 redirects, 500 for server errors\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\n**Verification Steps for Authorization Endpoint Implementation:**\n\n1. **Client Registration Verification**: Register a test client and verify generated `client_id` format and `redirect_uri` storage\n2. **Authorization Request Processing**: Send GET request to `/authorize` with valid parameters, confirm consent screen display\n3. **PKCE Challenge Handling**: Test authorization requests with and without PKCE, verify public client enforcement\n4. **Consent Flow Testing**: Submit consent form approval/denial, verify authorization code generation and redirect behavior\n5. **Error Response Validation**: Test invalid `client_id`, mismatched `redirect_uri`, and expired authorization codes\n6. **Security Boundary Testing**: Attempt CSRF attacks on consent form, test state parameter validation, verify redirect URI exact matching\n\n**Expected Behavior After Implementation:**\n- Authorization requests with valid parameters show branded consent screen with readable scope descriptions\n- User consent approval generates single-use authorization code that expires within 10 minutes\n- PKCE-enabled requests properly validate code challenges using SHA256 verification\n- Invalid requests return appropriate OAuth2 error responses with correct redirect behavior\n- Security attacks (CSRF, redirect URI manipulation, code reuse) are properly rejected\n\n**Common Implementation Issues and Diagnostics:**\n- **Consent screen not displaying**: Check user authentication and session management\n- **Authorization codes not working**: Verify code binding and single-use enforcement\n- **PKCE validation failing**: Check SHA256 computation and base64url encoding\n- **Redirect loops**: Verify redirect URI exact matching and state parameter handling\n- **Security test failures**: Review constant-time comparisons and CSRF token validation\n\n\n## Token Endpoint Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 - Token Endpoint & JWT Generation\n\n### Mental Model: Ticket Exchange System\n\nThink of the token endpoint as a sophisticated ticket exchange system at a major entertainment venue. When you arrive at a concert hall with a voucher (authorization code), you don't just walk into the show - you must first visit the box office to exchange that voucher for actual tickets that grant you specific access privileges.\n\nThe authorization code is like a **time-sensitive voucher** that proves you've already gone through the proper authorization process (getting approval from the venue's security desk). However, this voucher itself can't get you into the concert - it's just proof that you're authorized to receive the real tickets. The voucher has an expiration time (10 minutes maximum) and can only be used once to prevent fraud.\n\nWhen you present your voucher at the box office (token endpoint), the clerk (token service) performs several verification steps: they check that the voucher is genuine, hasn't expired, hasn't been used before, and matches the name on your ID (client authentication). They also verify that you're the same person who originally requested the voucher by checking your PKCE code verifier - think of this as a unique password you created when you first requested access.\n\nOnce all verifications pass, the box office issues you two types of tickets: an **access token** (like a concert ticket with specific seat assignments and time validity) and a **refresh token** (like a season pass that allows you to get new concert tickets without going through the full authorization process again). The access token is short-lived but gives you immediate access to the specific resources (concert sections) you're authorized for. The refresh token is long-lived but can only be used to obtain new access tokens, not for direct resource access.\n\nFor corporate clients (machine-to-machine scenarios), there's a special VIP box office where organizations with proper business credentials can directly purchase tickets without individual user vouchers - this is the client credentials grant flow.\n\n![Token Lifecycle State Machine](./diagrams/token-lifecycle-state-machine.svg)\n\n### JWT Access Token Generation\n\nThe heart of our token endpoint is the generation of **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** that serve as cryptographically signed access tokens. Unlike opaque token formats, JWTs are self-contained credentials that carry all necessary information for resource servers to validate access without consulting the authorization server.\n\nA JWT consists of three base64url-encoded components separated by dots: header.payload.signature. The **header** specifies the signing algorithm and token type. The **payload** contains claims about the token's subject, issuer, audience, expiration, and granted scopes. The **signature** provides cryptographic proof that the token hasn't been tampered with and was issued by the legitimate authorization server.\n\nOur JWT generation process follows a carefully designed sequence to ensure both security and interoperability. When an authorization code is successfully exchanged, we construct the JWT payload with mandatory claims required by the OAuth2 and OIDC specifications, plus any additional claims specific to our implementation.\n\n**JWT Claims Structure:**\n\n| Claim | Type | Required | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| `sub` | string | Yes | Subject identifier - the user ID who authorized the token |\n| `iss` | string | Yes | Issuer - our authorization server's identifier URL |\n| `aud` | string/array | Yes | Audience - intended recipients (resource servers) for this token |\n| `exp` | number | Yes | Expiration time as Unix timestamp - when this token expires |\n| `iat` | number | Yes | Issued at time as Unix timestamp - when this token was created |\n| `jti` | string | Yes | JWT ID - unique identifier for this specific token instance |\n| `scope` | string | Yes | Space-separated list of scopes granted to this token |\n| `client_id` | string | No | Client identifier that requested this token |\n| `token_use` | string | No | Always \"access\" to distinguish from ID tokens |\n\nThe token generation algorithm follows these precise steps:\n\n1. **Claim Assembly**: We start by constructing the base claims object with the subject (`sub`) field set to the user ID from the authorization code, the issuer (`iss`) set to our server's base URL, and the audience (`aud`) configured based on the intended resource servers.\n\n2. **Timestamp Calculation**: We set the issued-at time (`iat`) to the current Unix timestamp and calculate the expiration time (`exp`) by adding our configured token lifetime (typically 15-60 minutes for access tokens).\n\n3. **Unique Identifier Generation**: We generate a cryptographically secure random JWT ID (`jti`) that serves as a unique identifier for this token instance, enabling precise revocation tracking.\n\n4. **Scope Inclusion**: We copy the exact scope string from the authorization code into the `scope` claim, ensuring the token carries the precise permissions that were authorized by the user.\n\n5. **Header Construction**: We build the JWT header specifying our chosen signing algorithm (RS256 for RSA signatures or ES256 for ECDSA) and the standard \"JWT\" token type.\n\n6. **Signature Generation**: We serialize the header and payload, base64url-encode them, concatenate with a dot separator, and generate a cryptographic signature using our private key.\n\n7. **Token Assembly**: Finally, we concatenate the encoded header, payload, and signature with dot separators to produce the final JWT access token.\n\n**JWT Generation Service Interface:**\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `GenerateAccessToken` | `userID string, clientID string, scope string, audience []string` | `string, error` | Creates a signed JWT access token with specified claims |\n| `GenerateRefreshToken` | `userID string, clientID string, scope string, tokenFamily string` | `*RefreshToken, error` | Creates a new refresh token with family tracking |\n| `ValidateJWT` | `tokenString string` | `*jwt.Claims, error` | Verifies JWT signature and extracts validated claims |\n| `RevokeToken` | `jti string` | `error` | Adds JWT ID to revocation list until expiry |\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: The JWT payload is only base64-encoded, not encrypted. Never include sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private user data in JWT claims. The signature prevents tampering but doesn't provide confidentiality.\n\n**Token Signing Algorithm Selection:**\n\nOur implementation supports both RSA and ECDSA signing algorithms, each with distinct security and performance characteristics. RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) provides wide compatibility across OAuth2 clients and resource servers, making it the safer default choice for interoperability. ECDSA with P-256 (ES256) offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes and signatures, resulting in better performance and smaller tokens.\n\nFor token generation, we maintain both a private key for signing and a corresponding public key that resource servers use for signature verification. The public key must be made available through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint that clients can discover and fetch.\n\n**Access Token Lifetime Strategy:**\n\nAccess tokens should be short-lived to limit the window of exposure if compromised. Industry best practices recommend 15 minutes to 1 hour maximum lifetime for access tokens. Shorter lifetimes provide better security by reducing the risk from stolen tokens, but increase the frequency of refresh token usage and potential performance impact.\n\nOur default configuration uses 30-minute access tokens as a balance between security and usability. Resource-intensive applications or high-security environments may prefer 15-minute tokens, while internal applications with lower risk profiles might use 1-hour tokens.\n\n### Refresh Token Rotation\n\nRefresh tokens enable applications to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication, but they represent a significant security risk if compromised since they typically have much longer lifetimes (days to months). To mitigate this risk, we implement **refresh token rotation** with family tracking - a security mechanism that detects and responds to token theft attempts.\n\n**Refresh Token Family Concept:**\n\nEvery initial authorization generates a new **token family** identified by a unique family ID. When a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, we generate a completely new refresh token and invalidate the old one. Critically, the new refresh token belongs to the same family as its parent, creating a chain of related tokens.\n\nThis family relationship enables powerful security detection: if an application ever attempts to use an old (already rotated) refresh token, it indicates either a programming error or token theft. In response to this violation, we immediately revoke the entire token family, forcing the user to re-authenticate and preventing further abuse of any stolen tokens.\n\n**Refresh Token Data Model:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `Token` | string | Cryptographically random refresh token string |\n| `ClientID` | string | Client that this refresh token was issued to |\n| `UserID` | string | User who authorized this token |\n| `Scope` | string | Scopes that can be granted when refreshing |\n| `ExpiresAt` | time.Time | When this refresh token expires |\n| `TokenFamily` | string | Unique identifier linking related refresh tokens |\n| `ParentToken` | *string | Previous refresh token in this family (null for initial) |\n| `Revoked` | bool | Whether this token has been revoked |\n| `CreatedAt` | time.Time | When this refresh token was created |\n| `LastUsedAt` | *time.Time | When this token was last used for refresh |\n\n**Refresh Token Rotation Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Token Validation**: When a refresh request arrives, we first validate that the presented refresh token exists in our database, hasn't expired, and hasn't been marked as revoked.\n\n2. **Family Breach Detection**: We check if the token has already been used (has a non-null `LastUsedAt` field). If so, this indicates a replay attack or programming error, triggering immediate family revocation.\n\n3. **New Token Generation**: For valid refresh requests, we generate a new cryptographically random refresh token string and create a new `RefreshToken` record with the same family ID as the current token.\n\n4. **Parent Linking**: We set the new token's `ParentToken` field to point to the current token being exchanged, maintaining the family chain for audit purposes.\n\n5. **Current Token Invalidation**: We mark the current refresh token's `LastUsedAt` field and set a flag indicating it has been consumed, preventing reuse.\n\n6. **Access Token Issuance**: We generate a new JWT access token with the same scope and user information as the refresh token being exchanged.\n\n7. **Atomic Persistence**: All database changes (new refresh token creation, old token invalidation, access token logging) must be performed atomically to prevent inconsistent state.\n\n**Family Revocation Process:**\n\nWhen we detect refresh token reuse, indicating potential compromise, we execute a family-wide revocation:\n\n1. **Family Discovery**: Starting with the compromised token's family ID, we query all refresh tokens belonging to that family.\n\n2. **Batch Revocation**: We mark all tokens in the family as revoked and record the revocation timestamp for audit logging.\n\n3. **Active Token Invalidation**: Any access tokens currently issued from this family should be added to a revocation list until their natural expiry.\n\n4. **Client Notification**: We return an `invalid_grant` error to the client attempting the refresh, forcing them to restart the authorization flow.\n\n5. **Security Logging**: We generate detailed audit logs including the compromised token, family size, and suspected breach time for security analysis.\n\n**Refresh Token Storage Strategy:**\n\nRefresh tokens require persistent storage with efficient lookup capabilities. We need to support queries by token string (for refresh operations), by family ID (for revocation), and by user ID (for administrative operations). A relational database with proper indexing provides the necessary query flexibility and transactional guarantees.\n\nFor high-throughput scenarios, consider implementing a write-through cache layer that stores recently active refresh tokens in memory while maintaining the database as the authoritative source. This reduces database load for frequent refresh operations while preserving the durability guarantees needed for security.\n\n### Client Credentials Grant\n\nThe **client credentials grant** provides a streamlined authentication flow for machine-to-machine scenarios where no human user is involved. This grant type allows confidential clients (servers, background services, APIs) to authenticate directly with the authorization server using their client credentials and receive access tokens for accessing protected resources.\n\nUnlike the authorization code flow, the client credentials grant bypasses user authorization entirely since the client is acting on its own behalf rather than on behalf of a user. This makes it ideal for server-to-server API calls, scheduled background jobs, and microservice authentication.\n\n**Client Credentials Flow Sequence:**\n\n1. **Direct Authentication**: The client makes a POST request directly to the token endpoint with its client ID and client secret, along with the grant type set to \"client_credentials\".\n\n2. **Client Authentication**: We verify the client credentials using the same authentication methods as the authorization code flow (HTTP Basic or POST body parameters).\n\n3. **Scope Validation**: We check that the requested scopes are within the client's registered allowed scopes, rejecting any scope escalation attempts.\n\n4. **Token Generation**: We generate a JWT access token with the client ID as the subject (no user ID since there's no user involved) and the requested scopes.\n\n5. **Response**: We return the access token directly to the client with the standard OAuth2 token response format.\n\n**Client Credentials Token Claims:**\n\nFor client credentials tokens, the JWT payload differs slightly from user-authorized tokens:\n\n| Claim | Value | Description |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| `sub` | client_id | The client itself is the subject |\n| `iss` | server_url | Our authorization server identifier |\n| `aud` | configured_audience | Resource servers that accept these tokens |\n| `exp` | current_time + lifetime | Token expiration (typically longer than user tokens) |\n| `iat` | current_time | Token issuance time |\n| `jti` | random_uuid | Unique token identifier |\n| `scope` | requested_scopes | Space-separated scope string |\n| `client_id` | client_id | Explicit client identifier |\n| `token_use` | \"access\" | Token type indicator |\n| `gty` | \"client_credentials\" | Grant type used to obtain this token |\n\n**Client Credentials vs Authorization Code Tokens:**\n\nThe key differences between client credentials tokens and user-authorized tokens reflect their different security contexts:\n\n- **Subject**: Client credentials tokens have the client ID as the subject since there's no user involved\n- **Lifetime**: These tokens can have longer lifetimes (1-24 hours) since they represent ongoing service authorization rather than temporary user delegation\n- **Refresh Tokens**: Client credentials grants typically don't issue refresh tokens since clients can simply re-authenticate when needed\n- **Scope Restrictions**: Scopes are limited to what the client is pre-authorized for during registration, with no user consent step\n\n**Client Credentials Security Considerations:**\n\nClient credentials represent powerful, long-lived authentication mechanisms that require careful security handling:\n\n> **Security Principle**: Client credentials tokens should be scoped to the minimum necessary permissions and should include rate limiting to prevent abuse if compromised.\n\nClients must securely store their client secrets using the same practices as database passwords or API keys. For containerized deployments, use secret management systems rather than environment variables or configuration files. Consider implementing client certificate authentication for high-security scenarios where mutual TLS provides stronger authentication than shared secrets.\n\n**Client Credentials Grant Implementation:**\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `HandleClientCredentials` | `clientID string, scope string` | `*TokenResponse, error` | Processes client credentials grant requests |\n| `ValidateClientScope` | `client *Client, requestedScope string` | `error` | Ensures requested scopes are within client's allowed scopes |\n| `GenerateClientToken` | `clientID string, scope string` | `string, error` | Creates JWT access token for client credentials flow |\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: JWT Signing Algorithm Selection**\n> - **Context**: We need to choose between HMAC (HS256), RSA (RS256), and ECDSA (ES256) for JWT signing. The choice affects security, performance, and key management complexity.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) - symmetric signing with shared secrets\n>   2. RSA-SHA256 (RS256) - asymmetric signing with RSA key pairs  \n>   3. ECDSA-P256 (ES256) - asymmetric signing with elliptic curve keys\n> - **Decision**: Use RS256 as the default with optional ES256 support\n> - **Rationale**: HMAC requires sharing the same secret between authorization server and all resource servers, creating a security vulnerability if any resource server is compromised. RSA provides better key separation (private key stays on auth server, public keys distributed to resource servers) and has the widest compatibility across OAuth2 implementations. ES256 offers better performance and smaller signatures but has less universal support.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables distributed token validation without secret sharing, requires RSA key pair management, slightly larger tokens than ECDSA but better client compatibility.\n\n**JWT Algorithm Comparison:**\n\n| Algorithm | Key Type | Signature Size | Performance | Compatibility | Key Management |\n|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| HS256 | Symmetric | 32 bytes | Fastest | Universal | Shared secrets (risky) |\n| RS256 | RSA (2048-bit) | 256 bytes | Moderate | Excellent | Public/private key pairs |\n| ES256 | ECDSA P-256 | 64 bytes | Fast | Good | Public/private key pairs |\n\n> **Decision: Access Token Lifetime Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Access token lifetime affects security (shorter is safer) versus performance (longer reduces refresh frequency). Industry practices range from 5 minutes to 24 hours.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Short-lived tokens (5-15 minutes) - maximum security\n>   2. Medium-lived tokens (30-60 minutes) - balanced approach\n>   3. Long-lived tokens (2-24 hours) - maximum performance\n> - **Decision**: Default to 30-minute access tokens with configurable lifetimes per client\n> - **Rationale**: 30 minutes provides reasonable security (limits exposure window if tokens are compromised) while avoiding excessive refresh token usage. Per-client configuration allows high-security clients to use shorter lifetimes and internal services to use longer lifetimes based on risk assessment.\n> - **Consequences**: Balances security and performance, requires refresh token rotation every 30 minutes for long-running applications, enables risk-based lifetime adjustment per client.\n\n> **Decision: Refresh Token Storage and Family Tracking**\n> - **Context**: Refresh tokens need persistent storage and family tracking for security. Options include database storage, encrypted cookies, or hybrid approaches.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Database storage with full family tracking - maximum security and auditability\n>   2. Encrypted stateless tokens - no database dependency but limited revocation\n>   3. Hybrid approach with database references and encrypted tokens\n> - **Decision**: Database storage with comprehensive family tracking and revocation support\n> - **Rationale**: Security requirements (immediate revocation, breach detection, audit logging) require persistent state that stateless approaches cannot provide. Database storage enables precise family tracking, immediate revocation, and comprehensive audit trails essential for production OAuth2 deployments.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires database operations for every refresh, enables immediate revocation and breach detection, supports comprehensive audit logging, scales with database performance characteristics.\n\n> **Decision: Client Credentials Token Lifetime**\n> - **Context**: Client credentials tokens represent service-to-service authentication and can have different lifetime requirements than user-authorized tokens.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Same lifetime as user tokens (30 minutes) - consistent but potentially inefficient\n>   2. Longer lifetime (2-24 hours) - reduced authentication overhead\n>   3. Configurable per-client lifetime - maximum flexibility\n> - **Decision**: Default 2-hour lifetime with per-client configuration support\n> - **Rationale**: Service-to-service authentication typically involves lower risk than user delegation and benefits from reduced authentication overhead. 2 hours provides reasonable security while minimizing unnecessary token refresh operations. Per-client configuration allows high-security services to use shorter lifetimes.\n> - **Consequences**: Reduces authentication overhead for service clients, requires revocation list maintenance for longer periods, enables risk-appropriate lifetime configuration per service.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Including Sensitive Data in JWT Payload**\n\nA common mistake is storing sensitive information like passwords, social security numbers, or private user data in JWT claims. Since JWTs are only base64-encoded (not encrypted), anyone who obtains the token can decode and read the payload.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: JWT payloads are readable by anyone with access to the token. Base64 encoding provides no confidentiality - it's just a text encoding format, not encryption.\n\n**How to fix**: Only include non-sensitive claims in JWTs. Use the subject (`sub`) field to identify users and let resource servers look up detailed user information from secure databases using the subject identifier.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Implementing Proper Refresh Token Rotation**\n\nMany implementations reuse the same refresh token multiple times instead of generating a new token on each refresh operation, missing critical security benefits of token rotation.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Reusing refresh tokens prevents detection of token theft. If a refresh token is compromised, the attacker can continue using it indefinitely without the legitimate client detecting the breach.\n\n**How to fix**: Generate a new refresh token on every refresh operation and invalidate the old one. Implement family tracking to detect when old tokens are reused and revoke the entire family when this occurs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Using Weak Random Number Generation**\n\nUsing predictable random number generators or insufficient entropy for token generation creates security vulnerabilities where tokens can be guessed or predicted.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Predictable tokens enable attackers to forge valid tokens or guess other users' tokens, completely bypassing the authorization system.\n\n**How to fix**: Use cryptographically secure random number generators (`crypto/rand` in Go) with sufficient entropy (at least 128 bits for authorization codes, 256 bits for refresh tokens). Never use `math/rand` or timestamp-based generation for security tokens.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Validating JWT Expiration with Clock Skew Tolerance**\n\nImplementing strict expiration checking without accounting for clock differences between servers can cause valid tokens to be rejected due to minor time synchronization issues.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Distributed systems have inevitable clock skew, and rejecting tokens due to minor time differences (1-2 minutes) creates unnecessary authentication failures.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement clock skew tolerance (typically 2-5 minutes) when validating JWT expiration times. Accept tokens that expired within the tolerance window while still enforcing meaningful expiration limits.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Atomic Database Operations for Token Rotation**\n\nFailing to use database transactions when rotating refresh tokens can create inconsistent states where both old and new tokens remain valid, or neither token is valid.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Race conditions during token rotation can leave the database in an inconsistent state, causing authentication failures or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**How to fix**: Use database transactions to atomically create new refresh tokens and invalidate old ones. Ensure that either both operations succeed or both fail, never leaving the system in a partially updated state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Implementing Proper Client Scope Validation**\n\nAllowing clients to request any scope during client credentials grants without validating against registered scopes enables privilege escalation attacks.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Clients could request scopes they weren't authorized for during registration, gaining access to resources beyond their intended permissions.\n\n**How to fix**: Always validate that requested scopes are within the client's registered allowed scopes. Reject requests that attempt to escalate privileges beyond what was granted during client registration.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| JWT Library | `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` | `github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2` |\n| Database | SQLite with `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` | PostgreSQL with `github.com/lib/pq` |\n| Cryptographic Random | `crypto/rand` package | Hardware security module (HSM) |\n| Key Management | File-based RSA keys | AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault |\n| Token Storage | In-memory map with mutex | Redis with TTL support |\n| Time Handling | `time.Now()` with manual skew | NTP-synchronized time service |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n\n```\ninternal/token/\n  endpoint.go           ← HTTP handlers for token endpoint\n  generator.go          ← JWT generation and signing logic\n  refresh.go           ← Refresh token rotation and family tracking\n  client_credentials.go ← Client credentials grant implementation\n  validator.go         ← JWT validation and revocation checking\n  storage.go           ← Token persistence interfaces\n  crypto.go            ← Cryptographic utilities and key management\ninternal/storage/\n  refresh_token_store.go ← Refresh token database operations\n  revocation_store.go   ← JWT revocation list management\ninternal/crypto/\n  keys.go              ← RSA/ECDSA key loading and management\n  random.go            ← Secure random token generation\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\n**Cryptographic Key Management (crypto/keys.go):**\n\n```go\npackage crypto\n\nimport (\n    \"crypto/rand\"\n    \"crypto/rsa\"\n    \"crypto/x509\"\n    \"encoding/pem\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\ntype KeyManager struct {\n    privateKey *rsa.PrivateKey\n    keyID      string\n}\n\nfunc NewKeyManager(keyPath, keyID string) (*KeyManager, error) {\n    keyData, err := os.ReadFile(keyPath)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to read private key: %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    block, _ := pem.Decode(keyData)\n    if block == nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"invalid PEM format\")\n    }\n    \n    privateKey, err := x509.ParsePKCS1PrivateKey(block.Bytes)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse private key: %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    return &KeyManager{\n        privateKey: privateKey,\n        keyID:      keyID,\n    }, nil\n}\n\nfunc (km *KeyManager) GetPrivateKey() *rsa.PrivateKey {\n    return km.privateKey\n}\n\nfunc (km *KeyManager) GetKeyID() string {\n    return km.keyID\n}\n\nfunc GenerateSecureToken(length int) (string, error) {\n    bytes := make([]byte, length)\n    if _, err := rand.Read(bytes); err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"failed to generate random bytes: %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    // Convert to URL-safe base64\n    return base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString(bytes), nil\n}\n```\n\n**Refresh Token Storage (storage/refresh_token_store.go):**\n\n```go\npackage storage\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\ntype RefreshTokenStore struct {\n    db *sql.DB\n}\n\nfunc NewRefreshTokenStore(db *sql.DB) *RefreshTokenStore {\n    return &RefreshTokenStore{db: db}\n}\n\nfunc (store *RefreshTokenStore) CreateRefreshToken(ctx context.Context, token *RefreshToken) error {\n    query := `\n        INSERT INTO refresh_tokens \n        (token, client_id, user_id, scope, expires_at, token_family, parent_token, created_at)\n        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n    `\n    \n    _, err := store.db.ExecContext(ctx, query,\n        token.Token, token.ClientID, token.UserID, token.Scope,\n        token.ExpiresAt, token.TokenFamily, token.ParentToken, token.CreatedAt)\n    \n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create refresh token: %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc (store *RefreshTokenStore) GetRefreshToken(ctx context.Context, tokenStr string) (*RefreshToken, error) {\n    query := `\n        SELECT token, client_id, user_id, scope, expires_at, token_family, \n               parent_token, revoked, created_at, last_used_at\n        FROM refresh_tokens \n        WHERE token = ?

it handles signing, verification, and claims parsing automatically\n- Use `crypto/rand.Read()` for generating cryptographically secure random tokens - never use `math/rand` for security tokens  \n- Use `time.Now().Unix()` for JWT timestamp claims - OAuth2 specs require Unix timestamps\n- Use database transactions (`db.BeginTx()`) for atomic refresh token rotation to prevent race conditions\n- Use `bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword()` for client secret verification with constant-time comparison\n- Use `base64.RawURLEncoding` for token encoding to avoid padding characters that break URLs\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the token endpoint component:\n\n1. **Test Authorization Code Exchange**: Start your OAuth2 server and make a POST request to `/oauth/token` with `grant_type=authorization_code`. You should receive a JSON response with `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_in` fields.\n\n2. **Verify JWT Structure**: Decode the access token at jwt.io to verify it contains the expected claims (`sub`, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `jti`, `scope`).\n\n3. **Test Refresh Token Rotation**: Use the refresh token from step 1 to request new tokens. Verify you receive a new access token and refresh token, and that the old refresh token becomes invalid.\n\n4. **Test Client Credentials Grant**: Make a POST request with `grant_type=client_credentials` and valid client credentials. Verify you receive an access token without a refresh token.\n\n5. **Test Security Measures**: Try reusing an old refresh token and verify the entire token family gets revoked with an `invalid_grant` error.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- Token endpoint responds to POST requests at `/oauth/token`\n- Authorization code exchange returns `{\"access_token\":\"...\", \"token_type\":\"Bearer\", \"expires_in\":1800, \"refresh_token\":\"...\"}`\n- JWT access tokens are properly signed and contain required claims\n- Refresh token rotation generates new tokens and invalidates old ones\n- Client credentials grant works for machine-to-machine authentication\n\n**Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| JWT signature verification fails | Wrong signing key or algorithm | Check private key matches public key, verify algorithm (RS256) | Ensure consistent key pair usage |\n| Refresh token rotation fails | Database transaction issues | Check database logs for constraint violations | Use proper transactions and unique constraints |\n| Client credentials returns invalid_client | Client authentication failure | Log client_id and verify against database | Check client secret hashing/comparison |\n| Access tokens expire immediately | Wrong timestamp format | Verify exp claim is Unix timestamp | Use `time.Now().Unix()` not `time.Now()` |\n\n\n## Token Introspection and Revocation Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3 - Token Introspection & Revocation\n\n### Mental Model: ID Verification System\n\nThink of token introspection and revocation like a sophisticated ID verification system at a high-security facility. When someone presents an access badge (access token) at a checkpoint, the security guard doesn't just look at the badge - they scan it in a verification system that checks multiple things: Is this badge authentic? Has it expired? Has it been reported stolen or lost? Is the person authorized for the specific area they're trying to access?\n\nToken introspection works the same way. When a resource server receives an access token, it can query the authorization server's introspection endpoint to verify the token's authenticity, check its expiration status, and confirm what permissions (scopes) it actually grants. The introspection endpoint acts like the central security database that knows the current status of every issued badge.\n\nToken revocation is like reporting a lost or stolen ID card. When someone's badge is compromised, stolen, or no longer needed, it gets added to a revocation list. The next time someone tries to use that badge, the verification system immediately rejects it, even if the badge itself looks valid and hasn't technically expired yet. In OAuth2, this happens when users revoke permissions, administrators disable access, or security incidents require immediate token invalidation.\n\nThe critical insight here is that JWTs, while self-contained and verifiable through their cryptographic signatures, still need a way to be revoked before their natural expiration. Unlike a traditional session token stored in a database (where you can simply delete the record), JWTs carry their validity within themselves. This creates a tension between the stateless nature of JWTs and the security requirement to immediately invalidate compromised tokens. The solution involves maintaining a revocation list and providing introspection endpoints for real-time validation.\n\n### Introspection Endpoint\n\nThe token introspection endpoint, defined by RFC 7662, provides a standardized way for resource servers to validate tokens by querying the authorization server. This endpoint bridges the gap between stateless JWT tokens and the need for real-time validity checking, including revocation status.\n\n**Introspection Request Processing**\n\nWhen a resource server receives an access token from a client, it may need to validate that token's current status beyond what can be determined from the JWT signature and claims alone. The resource server makes an introspection request to the authorization server, presenting the token for validation along with client credentials to authenticate the introspection request itself.\n\nThe introspection endpoint processes these requests by first authenticating the requesting client. Not all clients should be able to introspect arbitrary tokens - typically, only resource servers and privileged clients receive this capability. The endpoint verifies the client's credentials using the same authentication mechanisms employed by the token endpoint.\n\nOnce the client is authenticated, the endpoint examines the presented token. For JWT access tokens, this involves several validation steps: verifying the signature using the appropriate public key, checking standard claims like expiration (`exp`) and issued-at (`iat`), and validating that the issuer (`iss`) and audience (`aud`) claims match expected values.\n\n**Revocation Status Checking**\n\nA critical aspect of introspection is checking whether the token has been explicitly revoked. Since JWTs are stateless, the authorization server must maintain a revocation list - a data structure tracking tokens that have been invalidated before their natural expiration. This revocation list is indexed by the JWT's unique identifier (the `jti` claim) to enable fast lookups.\n\nThe revocation list presents several implementation challenges. First, it grows continuously as tokens are revoked, but entries can be safely removed once the corresponding token's natural expiration time passes. Second, the list must be quickly accessible from the introspection endpoint, which may handle high request volumes. Third, in distributed deployments, the revocation list must be consistent across all authorization server instances.\n\n| Revocation Tracking Component | Purpose | Implementation Notes |\n|------------------------------|---------|---------------------|\n| `jti` Claim | Unique token identifier | Generated during token creation, immutable |\n| Revocation Store | Persistent revocation list | Redis or database with TTL matching token expiry |\n| Cache Layer | Fast revocation lookups | In-memory cache with background refresh |\n| Cleanup Process | Remove expired entries | Background job running periodically |\n| Replication Mechanism | Consistency across instances | Event-driven updates or shared storage |\n\n**Introspection Response Format**\n\nThe introspection endpoint returns a JSON response conforming to RFC 7662 specifications. The response always includes an `active` boolean field indicating whether the token is currently valid and usable. When `active` is true, the response includes additional metadata about the token, such as the scopes it grants, the client it was issued to, and its expiration time.\n\n| Response Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|---------------|------|----------|-------------|\n| `active` | boolean | Yes | Whether the token is active and valid |\n| `scope` | string | No | Space-separated list of granted scopes |\n| `client_id` | string | No | Client identifier the token was issued to |\n| `username` | string | No | Human-readable user identifier |\n| `exp` | integer | No | Token expiration timestamp (Unix epoch) |\n| `iat` | integer | No | Token issued-at timestamp (Unix epoch) |\n| `sub` | string | No | Subject identifier (user ID) |\n| `aud` | string | No | Audience the token is intended for |\n| `iss` | string | No | Issuer identifier |\n| `jti` | string | No | Unique token identifier |\n| `token_type` | string | No | Type of token (typically \"Bearer\") |\n\nWhen a token is invalid, expired, or revoked, the response contains only `{\"active\": false}`. This prevents information leakage about invalid tokens while still providing the binary validity information that resource servers need.\n\n**Client Authentication for Introspection**\n\nThe introspection endpoint must authenticate clients making introspection requests to prevent unauthorized token validation attempts. This authentication typically uses the same client credential mechanisms as the token endpoint: HTTP Basic authentication with client ID and secret, or POST body parameters.\n\nDifferent clients may have different introspection privileges. Resource servers typically can introspect any token presented to them, while regular OAuth clients might only be able to introspect tokens they originally requested. This authorization policy is enforced after client authentication but before token validation.\n\n> **Decision: Require Client Authentication for Introspection**\n> - **Context**: RFC 7662 makes client authentication optional, but allowing unauthenticated introspection creates security risks\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Allow anonymous introspection for simplicity\n>   - Require authentication for all introspection requests\n>   - Support both modes with configuration\n> - **Decision**: Require client authentication for all introspection requests\n> - **Rationale**: Unauthenticated introspection enables token scanning attacks where malicious actors probe tokens to determine their validity. Client authentication provides accountability and enables fine-grained access control policies.\n> - **Consequences**: Increases complexity for resource servers (must have client credentials) but significantly improves security posture and enables audit logging\n\n### Revocation Endpoint\n\nThe token revocation endpoint, specified by RFC 7009, allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously issued token is no longer needed and should be considered invalid immediately. This endpoint is crucial for security scenarios where tokens may be compromised or when users explicitly revoke permissions.\n\n**Revocation Request Processing**\n\nClients make revocation requests by posting the token they wish to revoke along with their client credentials for authentication. The revocation endpoint accepts both access tokens and refresh tokens, though the specific revocation behavior differs depending on token type.\n\nWhen a client submits a revocation request, the endpoint first authenticates the client using the same mechanisms as the token endpoint. The client must be authorized to revoke the presented token - typically meaning the client must be the same one that originally requested the token, or a privileged administrative client.\n\nThe endpoint then processes the token to determine its type and current status. For JWT access tokens, this involves parsing the token structure, verifying the signature, and extracting the unique identifier (`jti` claim). For refresh tokens, the endpoint queries the refresh token store to retrieve the token record and verify its association with the requesting client.\n\n**Access Token Revocation**\n\nRevoking JWT access tokens presents unique challenges because these tokens are designed to be self-contained and stateless. The authorization server cannot directly invalidate a JWT that has already been issued and distributed to resource servers.\n\nInstead, access token revocation works by adding the token's unique identifier to a revocation list. When resource servers validate tokens (either through introspection or local validation), they must check this revocation list to determine if an otherwise-valid token has been explicitly revoked.\n\nThe revocation process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Token Identification**: Extract the `jti` claim from the JWT to obtain a unique identifier\n2. **Ownership Verification**: Confirm that the requesting client has permission to revoke this specific token\n3. **Revocation Recording**: Add the token identifier to the revocation list with metadata about when and why it was revoked\n4. **Cache Invalidation**: If caching is used, invalidate any cached positive validation results for this token\n5. **Audit Logging**: Record the revocation event for security monitoring and compliance\n\n| Revocation Record Field | Type | Purpose |\n|------------------------|------|---------|\n| `jti` | string | Unique token identifier being revoked |\n| `client_id` | string | Client that requested the revocation |\n| `revoked_at` | timestamp | When the revocation occurred |\n| `reason` | string | Why the token was revoked (user request, security incident, etc.) |\n| `expires_at` | timestamp | When this revocation record can be cleaned up |\n| `token_type` | string | Whether this was an access token or refresh token |\n\n**Refresh Token Revocation**\n\nRefresh token revocation is more straightforward than access token revocation because refresh tokens are stored server-side and can be directly invalidated. However, refresh token revocation often has broader implications due to token family relationships.\n\nWhen a refresh token is revoked, the authorization server marks it as invalid in the refresh token store. Additionally, if the implementation uses refresh token rotation with family tracking, revoking one refresh token may trigger revocation of the entire token family. This is a security measure that assumes if one token in the family is compromised, all related tokens should be considered potentially compromised.\n\nThe refresh token revocation process includes:\n\n1. **Token Lookup**: Query the refresh token store to find the token record\n2. **Authorization Check**: Verify the requesting client owns this token\n3. **Family Assessment**: Determine if other tokens in the same family should be revoked\n4. **Database Update**: Mark the token (and potentially family members) as revoked\n5. **Related Token Cleanup**: Optionally revoke associated access tokens\n\n**Token Family Revocation**\n\nToken families provide a security mechanism for detecting and responding to token theft scenarios. When refresh tokens are rotated (a new refresh token is issued each time the old one is used), all tokens issued from the same original authorization form a \"family\" with a shared family identifier.\n\nIf an old refresh token from a family is presented for use after a newer token in the same family has already been used, this indicates a potential security breach - someone may be replaying a stolen token. In response, the authorization server revokes the entire token family, forcing the legitimate client to re-authenticate.\n\nToken family revocation extends to explicit revocation requests. When a user revokes consent for an application or an administrator terminates a session, revoking the entire token family ensures that all related tokens become invalid, regardless of where they might be stored or cached.\n\n> **Decision: Implement Token Family Revocation for Security Breach Detection**\n> - **Context**: Refresh token rotation creates families of related tokens, but detection of replay attacks requires family-level revocation\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Revoke only the specific token requested\n>   - Revoke token families only on detected replay attacks\n>   - Always revoke entire families for any revocation request\n> - **Decision**: Revoke entire token families when replay attacks are detected, individual tokens for explicit user/admin revocation\n> - **Rationale**: Balances security (detecting token theft) with usability (not over-revoking for legitimate revocation requests)\n> - **Consequences**: Requires family tracking infrastructure but provides strong protection against token theft scenarios\n\n### JWT Validation Library\n\nResource servers need the ability to validate JWT access tokens locally without always requiring introspection calls to the authorization server. A JWT validation library provides this capability while properly handling the complexities of cryptographic verification, claims validation, and revocation checking.\n\n**Local JWT Validation Process**\n\nLocal JWT validation offers significant performance and availability advantages over introspection-based validation. Resource servers can validate tokens independently, reducing network round-trips and eliminating dependencies on authorization server availability for routine token validation.\n\nThe validation process involves multiple steps, each addressing different aspects of token integrity and authenticity:\n\n1. **Token Structure Parsing**: Parse the JWT into header, payload, and signature components\n2. **Header Validation**: Verify algorithm specification matches expected values and extract key identifier\n3. **Signature Verification**: Cryptographically verify the token signature using the appropriate public key\n4. **Standard Claims Validation**: Check expiration (`exp`), not-before (`nbf`), and issued-at (`iat`) timestamps\n5. **Custom Claims Validation**: Verify issuer (`iss`), audience (`aud`), and subject (`sub`) claims match expected values\n6. **Revocation Checking**: Query revocation list or cache to confirm token hasn't been explicitly revoked\n7. **Scope Authorization**: Verify that granted scopes authorize the requested resource access\n\n| Validation Step | Purpose | Failure Response |\n|----------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Structure Parse | Ensure valid JWT format | 401 Unauthorized |\n| Algorithm Check | Prevent algorithm substitution attacks | 401 Unauthorized |\n| Signature Verify | Confirm token authenticity | 401 Unauthorized |\n| Expiration Check | Reject expired tokens | 401 Unauthorized |\n| Audience Validate | Ensure token intended for this resource | 403 Forbidden |\n| Revocation Check | Respect explicit token invalidation | 401 Unauthorized |\n| Scope Authorize | Confirm permission for requested resource | 403 Forbidden |\n\n**Cryptographic Key Management**\n\nJWT validation requires access to the public keys used by the authorization server to sign tokens. The validation library must securely obtain and manage these keys, handling key rotation and multiple concurrent keys during transition periods.\n\nThe authorization server typically publishes its public keys through a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, following the well-known configuration pattern. The validation library fetches these keys and caches them locally, refreshing periodically or when encountering tokens signed with unknown key identifiers.\n\nKey management includes several critical security considerations. The library must validate that keys are obtained from the correct authorization server to prevent key substitution attacks. It should cache keys with appropriate expiration times to balance performance with security - too long and revoked keys remain trusted, too short and performance suffers from constant key fetching.\n\n| Key Management Component | Responsibility | Security Consideration |\n|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| JWKS Client | Fetch public keys from authorization server | Verify HTTPS and certificate validation |\n| Key Cache | Store keys locally for performance | Implement reasonable TTL (1-24 hours) |\n| Key Rotation Handler | Detect and handle key changes | Support multiple keys during rotation |\n| Algorithm Validator | Ensure only secure algorithms accepted | Reject symmetric algorithms (HS256) |\n| Key ID Resolver | Map token `kid` to verification key | Handle missing or unknown key IDs |\n\n**Revocation Checking Integration**\n\nEven with local JWT validation, resource servers must still check token revocation status to handle tokens that have been explicitly invalidated before expiration. The validation library can implement this in several ways, each with different performance and consistency trade-offs.\n\nThe most secure approach queries the introspection endpoint for every token validation, but this eliminates the performance benefits of local validation. A more balanced approach maintains a local cache of revoked token identifiers, periodically refreshed from the authorization server or updated through push notifications.\n\nFor high-performance scenarios, the library might implement a bloom filter or similar probabilistic data structure to quickly eliminate tokens that definitely haven't been revoked, falling back to introspection only for tokens that might be revoked. This approach requires careful tuning to balance false positive rates with performance requirements.\n\n**Validation Result Caching**\n\nJWT validation involves computationally expensive operations, particularly signature verification. The validation library can cache successful validation results to avoid repeating these operations for frequently-used tokens, but this caching must be implemented carefully to maintain security properties.\n\nValidation result caching must consider token expiration times, ensuring cached results don't outlive the token's validity period. It should also integrate with revocation checking, invalidating cached results when tokens are revoked. The cache size should be limited to prevent memory exhaustion from token scanning attacks.\n\n> **Decision: Implement Validation Result Caching with Revocation Integration**\n> - **Context**: JWT signature verification is computationally expensive, but caching validation results risks serving revoked tokens\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - No caching - validate every request completely\n>   - Cache validation results with token expiration TTL\n>   - Cache validation results with shorter TTL for revocation safety\n> - **Decision**: Cache validation results with TTL of min(token_expiration, 5_minutes) and invalidate on revocation\n> - **Rationale**: Provides significant performance improvement while maintaining revocation security through short cache windows\n> - **Consequences**: Requires cache invalidation infrastructure but reduces CPU load by 80-90% for repeated token usage\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n**Decision: Use Redis for Distributed Revocation List**\n\n> **Decision: Use Redis for Distributed Revocation List**\n> - **Context**: Token revocation must be consistent across multiple authorization server instances, and revocation lists need fast access for introspection\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Database-only storage with caching\n>   - Redis with database backup\n>   - In-memory with event propagation\n> - **Decision**: Redis as primary revocation store with database backup for durability\n> - **Rationale**: Redis provides sub-millisecond access times, built-in TTL for automatic cleanup, and pub/sub for cache invalidation.

Since JWT access tokens have limited lifetimes, revocation entries can be safely removed after the token's natural expiration time passes.\n\nWhy this breaks: The revocation list grows without bound, consuming memory and storage space. Eventually, the system runs out of resources or performance degrades due to large list sizes. Additionally, keeping expired revocation entries provides no security benefit since the tokens they reference are already naturally invalid.\n\nHow to fix: Implement a cleanup process that runs periodically (hourly or daily) and removes revocation entries where the token's expiration time has passed. If using Redis, leverage the TTL feature to automatically expire entries. For database storage, use a background job that deletes old records based on the `expires_at` timestamp.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Token Scanning Through Unauthenticated Introspection**\n\nAllowing unauthenticated access to the introspection endpoint enables attackers to scan randomly generated tokens to determine which ones are valid. Even though the introspection response for invalid tokens only returns `{\"active\": false}`, the difference in response timing or HTTP status codes can leak information about token validity.\n\nWhy this breaks: Attackers can systematically probe token values to discover valid tokens, then use those tokens to access protected resources. This is particularly dangerous if tokens use predictable formats or if the JWT structure reveals patterns that can be exploited in brute force attacks.\n\nHow to fix: Always require client authentication for introspection requests. Implement rate limiting per client to prevent rapid scanning attempts. Use constant-time responses for both valid and invalid tokens to prevent timing-based information leakage. Consider implementing CAPTCHA or other anti-automation measures for suspicious request patterns.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Revocation Status in JWT Validation Libraries**\n\nWhen implementing JWT validation libraries for resource servers, developers often focus on cryptographic signature verification and claims validation while forgetting to check revocation status. This creates a security gap where revoked tokens continue to work until their natural expiration.\n\nWhy this breaks: Users who revoke permissions or administrators who disable access expect those actions to take immediate effect. If resource servers only validate JWT signatures and claims, revoked tokens remain functional, violating user expectations and security policies. This is particularly problematic for high-privilege tokens or sensitive resources.\n\nHow to fix: Always include revocation checking as part of JWT validation. This can be implemented through periodic introspection calls, maintaining a local cache of revoked token IDs, or subscribing to revocation events from the authorization server. Design the validation library to fail securely - if revocation status cannot be determined, treat the token as potentially invalid.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-Caching Validation Results Without Revocation Consideration**\n\nTo improve performance, validation libraries often cache JWT validation results to avoid repeated signature verification. However, long-lived caches can serve stale positive results for tokens that have been revoked, creating a window where revoked tokens remain functional.\n\nWhy this breaks: The security benefit of token revocation is negated if cached validation results aren't invalidated when tokens are revoked. Users who revoke permissions expect immediate effect, but cached results can extend token lifetime beyond revocation by hours or even days, depending on cache configuration.\n\nHow to fix: Implement cache invalidation mechanisms that respond to revocation events. Use shorter cache TTLs (5-15 minutes maximum) for validation results. Consider implementing a two-tier approach where signature validation is cached longer but revocation status is checked more frequently. Provide cache invalidation APIs that can be called when tokens are revoked.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Token Family Revocation Logic**\n\nWhen implementing refresh token rotation with family tracking, developers sometimes implement inconsistent revocation logic - revoking individual tokens in some cases and entire families in others, without clear criteria for when each approach should be used.\n\nWhy this breaks: Inconsistent revocation behavior confuses users and creates security gaps. If replay attack detection revokes entire families but user-initiated revocation only revokes individual tokens, stolen tokens from the same family might remain valid. Conversely, over-aggressive family revocation can log out users unexpectedly from all their devices.\n\nHow to fix: Establish clear rules for when individual tokens vs. entire families should be revoked. Typically: revoke entire families for security events (replay detection, breach response), revoke individual tokens for user-initiated actions (single device logout), and provide administrative options for both approaches. Document these behaviors clearly and implement them consistently across all revocation scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Exposing Sensitive Information in Introspection Responses**\n\nThe introspection endpoint response format allows returning various claims and metadata about tokens. Developers sometimes include sensitive information like internal user IDs, detailed permission lists, or system-specific metadata that should not be exposed to resource servers.\n\nWhy this breaks: Resource servers only need to know whether a token is valid and what scopes it grants. Additional information creates privacy risks and potential attack vectors. Internal user IDs might be used for user enumeration attacks, detailed permissions might reveal system architecture, and system metadata could assist in other attack vectors.\n\nHow to fix: Only include necessary information in introspection responses. Standard fields like `scope`, `client_id`, `exp`, and `active` are usually sufficient. If additional claims are needed, carefully evaluate their security implications. Use different response formats for different types of clients - resource servers might receive minimal information while administrative tools get more detailed responses.\n\n### Implementation

implementing this component, verify the following functionality:\n\n**Introspection Endpoint Testing:**\n```bash\n# Test valid token introspection\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/introspect \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'client_id:client_secret' | base64)\" \\\n  -d \"token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\"\n\n# Expected response for valid token:\n#

Testing:**\n```bash\n# Test token revocation\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/revoke \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'client_id:client_secret' | base64)\" \\\n  -d

response (should now show active:false):\n# {\"active\":false}\n```\n\n**JWT Validation Library Testing:**\n```bash\n# Test the validation library in a resource server\ngo test -v ./pkg/validation/ -run TestJWTValidator\n\n# Check that validation correctly identifies:\n# - Valid tokens with proper signatures and claims\n# - Expired tokens (should fail validation)  \n# - Revoked tokens (should fail validation)\n# - Tokens with invalid signatures (should fail validation)\n# - Tokens with missing required scopes (should fail authorization)\n```\n\n**Signs Something is Wrong:**\n- Introspection always returns `active: false` → Check client authentication and JWT parsing\n- Revocation doesn't take effect → Verify RevocationStore integration and jti claim extraction\n- High CPU usage → JWT signature verification may be inefficient, check caching\n- Memory leaks → Validation result cache may not be expiring entries properly\n- Tokens work after revocation → RevocationStore queries may be failing silently\n\n\n## UserInfo and Consent Management Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 4 - UserInfo Endpoint & Consent Management\n\n### Mental Model: Medical Records Release\n\nThink of the UserInfo endpoint and consent management system like a hospital's medical records release department. When a patient (resource owner) visits a hospital, they accumulate various pieces of medical information - personal details, test results, treatment history, insurance data. Later, when external parties like insurance companies (client applications) or specialists (resource servers) need access to specific portions of this information, they must go through a formal request process.\n\nThe patient doesn't give blanket access to their entire medical file. Instead, they carefully review each request and decide which specific types of information can be shared. The insurance company might get access to basic demographics and billing codes, but not detailed psychiatric notes. A consulting specialist might receive test results and treatment history, but not financial information. The medical records department maintains detailed logs of what information was shared with whom and when, and the patient can revoke these permissions at any time.\n\nIn our OAuth2 system, the UserInfo endpoint serves as this medical records release department. The `User` profile contains various claims (like medical record fields), the scopes define categories of information that can be requested (like \"billing information\" or \"test results\"), and the consent records track what the user has authorized each client application to access. Just as hospitals maintain strict HIPAA compliance by only releasing authorized information, our system enforces scope-based filtering to ensure clients receive only the claims they've been granted permission to access.\n\nThis analogy helps explain why consent persistence is crucial - patients shouldn't have to re-authorize the same specialist every time they need a follow-up consultation, but they should be able to revoke access if they switch providers. Similarly, users shouldn't face consent fatigue from repeated authorization prompts, but they must retain control over their data sharing decisions.\n\n![Consent Management Flow](./diagrams/consent-management-sequence.svg)\n\n### UserInfo Endpoint: OIDC Compliant User Profile Claims Service\n\nThe **UserInfo endpoint** represents the crown jewel of OpenID Connect functionality - it's where client applications finally retrieve the user profile information they were granted access to during the authorization flow. This endpoint bridges the gap between authorization (what scopes were granted) and actual data access (which specific user claims are returned). The endpoint must implement RFC specifications precisely while maintaining security through proper token validation and scope-based filtering.\n\nThe UserInfo endpoint serves a fundamentally different purpose than typical REST APIs. Rather than providing comprehensive user management functionality, it acts as a read-only, scope-filtered window into user profile data. Client applications present their access tokens, and the endpoint returns only those user claims that correspond to the scopes originally granted by the user. This design ensures that even if a client somehow obtains a valid access token, it cannot exceed the permissions the user explicitly authorized.\n\nThe endpoint's security model relies entirely on **bearer token authentication** using the access tokens issued by our token endpoint. Unlike traditional API authentication that might use API keys or basic authentication, the UserInfo endpoint exclusively accepts OAuth2 access tokens in the Authorization header. This token-centric approach ensures that every data access request can be traced back to a specific user consent decision and that token revocation immediately terminates data access.\n\nThe OIDC specification defines standard claim names and their expected formats, but our implementation must be flexible enough to handle custom claims while maintaining interoperability. Standard claims like `sub` (subject identifier), `name`, `email`, `picture`, and `locale` have defined semantics, but organizations often need to expose additional profile attributes. Our scope-to-claims mapping system accommodates both scenarios while ensuring consistent behavior for standard OIDC flows.\n\n| UserInfo Endpoint Method | HTTP Method | Path | Authentication | Description |\n|--------------------------|-------------|------|----------------|-------------|\n| `GetUserInfo` | GET | `/userinfo` | Bearer Token | Returns user claims filtered by granted scopes |\n| `GetUserInfo` | POST | `/userinfo` | Bearer Token | Alternative POST method for clients that prefer form data |\n\nThe endpoint must handle both GET and POST requests to comply with OIDC specifications, though GET requests are more common. POST support accommodates clients that prefer sending the access token in the request body rather than headers, though this approach is less secure and generally discouraged.\n\nToken validation for the UserInfo endpoint involves multiple layers of verification. The endpoint must first extract and validate the JWT access token signature, then verify that the token hasn't expired, hasn't been revoked, and contains the required claims for user identification. Unlike other endpoints that might perform lightweight token checks, UserInfo requires comprehensive validation because it directly exposes user data.\n\n| Token Validation Step | Check Performed | Failure Response | Error Code |\n|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Token Extraction | Authorization header present and properly formatted | `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` | 401 |\n| JWT Signature | Cryptographic signature verification against public key | `invalid_token` | 401 |\n| Token Expiration | Current time before `exp` claim | `invalid_token` | 401 |\n| Revocation Status | Token ID not in revocation list | `invalid_token` | 401 |\n| User Existence | User ID from `sub` claim exists in user store | `invalid_token` | 401 |\n| Scope Validation | Token contains valid scope claim | `insufficient_scope` | 403 |\n\nThe endpoint returns user claims as a JSON object, with claim names as keys and claim values following OIDC data type specifications. String claims are returned as JSON strings, boolean claims as JSON booleans, and numeric claims as JSON numbers. Array claims like `groups` or `roles` are returned as JSON arrays. The response must never include claims that weren't authorized by the granted scopes, even if the user profile contains additional data.\n\nError handling for the UserInfo endpoint follows OIDC specifications rather than general OAuth2 error formats. When token validation fails, the endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header containing error details. When the token is valid but lacks sufficient scope for the requested operation, the endpoint returns `403 Forbidden` with an `insufficient_scope` error. These specific error responses help client applications distinguish between authentication failures and authorization failures.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The UserInfo endpoint serves as the trust boundary between authorization decisions and actual data access. While the authorization flow establishes what the user consented to share, the UserInfo endpoint enforces those decisions through cryptographic token validation and scope-based filtering. This separation of concerns allows the authorization system to focus on consent workflows while the UserInfo endpoint specializes in secure data delivery.\n\nPerformance considerations for the UserInfo endpoint center around token validation overhead and user data retrieval patterns. Since every request requires full JWT validation and potential revocation checking, the endpoint benefits significantly from validation result caching and efficient revocation list lookups. However, caching must be balanced against security requirements - overly aggressive caching can delay the effects of token revocation or user profile updates.\n\nThe endpoint must handle high request volumes efficiently since client applications often call UserInfo frequently to refresh user profile data. Connection pooling for database access, Redis caching for revocation lists, and JWT validation result caching become crucial for production performance. However, the endpoint should never cache actual user profile data, as user information changes must be reflected immediately in API responses.\n\n### Scope to Claims Mapping: Filtering User Profile Data Based on Granted Scopes\n\nThe **scope to claims mapping** system represents the enforcement mechanism that translates high-level user consent decisions into specific data access permissions. When a user grants the `profile` scope to a client application, they're not authorizing access to a generic \"profile\" - they're specifically authorizing access to claims like `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `picture`, and `locale`. This mapping system ensures that scope grants translate into precise, predictable data access patterns that users can understand and trust.\n\nOIDC defines several standard scopes with specific claim mappings that our implementation must honor for interoperability. The `openid` scope is mandatory for all OIDC flows and doesn't directly map to claims - instead, it signals that the client wants OIDC functionality rather than pure OAuth2. The remaining standard scopes have well-defined claim mappings that client applications rely on for consistent behavior across different identity providers.\n\n| OIDC Standard Scope | Associated Claims | Purpose | User-Facing Description |\n|---------------------|-------------------|---------|------------------------|\n| `openid` | None (enables OIDC) | Signals OIDC request | \"Confirm your identity\" |\n| `profile` | `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, `nickname`, `preferred_username`, `profile`, `picture`, `website`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `zoneinfo`, `locale`, `updated_at` | Basic profile information | \"Access your basic profile information\" |\n| `email` | `email`, `email_verified` | Email address and verification status | \"Access your email address\" |\n| `address` | `address` (structured object) | Physical address information | \"Access your address information\" |\n| `phone` | `phone_number`, `phone_number_verified` | Phone number and verification status | \"Access your phone number\" |\n\nBeyond standard OIDC scopes, organizations often need custom scopes for application-specific data access. Our mapping system must accommodate custom scopes while maintaining the security properties of the standard mappings. Custom scopes like `employee_info`, `billing_data`, or `medical_records` can map to organization-specific user profile fields, but they must follow the same filtering principles as standard scopes.\n\nThe mapping implementation must handle **overlapping scopes** correctly when clients request multiple scopes simultaneously. If a client requests both `profile` and `email` scopes, the resulting claim set includes the union of claims from both mappings, not their intersection. This additive behavior matches user expectations - granting additional scopes provides additional access rather than restricting it.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Static vs. Dynamic Scope Mapping**\n> - **Context**: We need to decide whether scope-to-claims mappings should be hardcoded in application logic or stored in a configurable database table\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Static mappings in Go constants/maps for standard scopes only\n>   2. Database-driven mappings for all scopes with admin UI\n>   3. Hybrid approach with static standard mappings and configurable custom mappings\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with static standard mappings and configurable custom mappings\n> - **Rationale**: Standard OIDC scope mappings never change and benefit from compile-time validation, while custom organizational scopes need runtime flexibility. Hybrid approach provides both reliability and flexibility.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables OIDC compliance through guaranteed standard mappings while supporting organizational customization. Requires careful validation to prevent conflicts between standard and custom scope names.\n\nClaim filtering must handle **conditional claims** where the availability of certain claims depends on user profile completeness or verification status. The `email_verified` claim should only be included when the user's email has been verified, and the claim value should reflect the actual verification status. Similarly, optional profile fields like `middle_name` or `website` should be omitted entirely when not present in the user profile, rather than returned with null values.\n\n| Claim Filtering Rule | Condition | Behavior | Example |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Standard Claim Present | User profile contains claim value | Include claim in response | `\"name\": \"John Smith\"` |\n| Standard Claim Missing | User profile lacks claim value | Omit claim from response | `middle_name` not included |\n| Verification Claim | Depends on verification status | Include with boolean value | `\"email_verified\": true` |\n| Scope Not Granted | Scope not in access token | Omit all associated claims | Email claims omitted without `email` scope |\n| Custom Claim Present | Custom scope granted and data exists | Include claim in response | `\"employee_id\": \"EMP123\"` |\n\nThe filtering algorithm must process scopes in a specific order to ensure consistent results across different request patterns. First, extract all granted scopes from the access token's `scope` claim and validate that each scope is recognized by the system. Then, build the union of all claim names associated with the granted scopes. Finally, retrieve user profile data and include only those claims that appear in both the authorized claim set and the user's actual profile data.\n\nError handling in scope-to-claims mapping focuses on graceful degradation rather than request failure. If a custom scope refers to a non-existent claim field, the system should log the configuration error but continue processing other valid claims. If the user profile is missing optional standard claims, the response simply omits those claims. Only severe errors like database connectivity failures or access token corruption should result in request failure.\n\nThe mapping system must support **nested claims** for complex data structures like addresses. The OIDC `address` scope maps to a single `address` claim containing a structured object with fields like `street_address`, `locality`, `region`, `postal_code`, and `country`. Our implementation must handle these nested structures correctly while applying the same filtering principles to sub-claims within the nested object.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Scope-to-claims mapping serves as a privacy-by-design mechanism that ensures users receive granular control over their data sharing. By mapping abstract scope names to specific claim sets, users can make informed consent decisions without needing to understand technical details about API fields or database schemas. This abstraction layer protects user privacy while providing developers with predictable data access patterns.\n\nPerformance optimization for scope mapping centers around **mapping cache efficiency** and **user data retrieval patterns**. Since scope-to-claims mappings change rarely (especially standard OIDC mappings), aggressive caching provides significant performance benefits. However, custom scope mappings may change more frequently and require cache invalidation strategies. The system should cache mapping results at the application level while maintaining the ability to refresh mappings without service restart.\n\n### Consent Persistence and Management: Storing and Managing User Authorization Decisions\n\n**Consent persistence** transforms ephemeral user authorization decisions into durable access control policies that can be enforced across multiple API interactions. When a user clicks \"Allow\" on a consent screen, that decision must be recorded, indexed, tracked, and made revocable to provide users with meaningful control over their data sharing. The consent management system bridges the gap between one-time authorization flows and ongoing data access patterns.\n\nThe `ConsentRecord` data model captures the essential elements of a user's authorization decision in a way that supports both access control enforcement and user privacy management. Each consent record represents a specific user's decision to grant specific scopes to a specific client application at a specific point in time. This granular approach allows users to make different decisions for different applications while maintaining precise audit trails.\n\n| ConsentRecord Field | Type | Purpose | Example Value |\n|---------------------|------|---------|---------------|\n| `UserID` | string | Links consent to specific user | \"user_123456\" |\n| `ClientID` | string | Links consent to specific client application | \"client_abc789\" |\n| `Scope` | string | Space-separated list of granted scopes | \"openid profile email\" |\n| `GrantedAt` | time.Time | When user initially granted consent | \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\" |\n| `LastUsedAt` | *time.Time | Most recent access using this consent | \"2024-01-15T14:22:00Z\" |\n| `ExpiresAt` | *time.Time | Optional consent expiration time | \"2024-07-15T10:30:00Z\" |\n| `Revoked` | bool | Whether user has revoked this consent | false |\n| `RevokedAt` | *time.Time | When consent was revoked (if applicable) | null |\n\nConsent record storage must support **efficient lookups** for multiple access patterns. During authorization flows, the system needs to quickly determine whether a user has previously consented to specific scopes for a specific client. During UserInfo requests, the system needs to validate that the current access token corresponds to valid, non-revoked consent. During user privacy management, the system needs to retrieve all consent records for a specific user across all client applications.\n\nThe consent checking algorithm runs during authorization flows to determine whether the consent screen should be displayed or skipped. If a user is requesting scopes they've previously granted to the same client application, and that consent hasn't been revoked or expired, the system can skip the consent screen and proceed directly to authorization code generation. However, if the client requests any new scopes beyond those previously granted, the consent screen must be displayed to capture the user's decision on the additional permissions.\n\n| Consent Check Scenario | Existing Consent | New Request | Behavior | Rationale |\n|------------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Exact Match | `openid profile email` | `openid profile email` | Skip consent screen | User already authorized these exact scopes |\n| Subset Request | `openid profile email` | `openid profile` | Skip consent screen | Requesting fewer permissions than previously granted |\n| Superset Request | `openid profile` | `openid profile email` | Show consent screen | New `email` scope requires additional consent |\n| Partial Overlap | `openid profile` | `openid email` | Show consent screen | Mixed of old and new scopes requires re-consent |\n| No Previous Consent | None | `openid profile` | Show consent screen | First-time authorization requires consent |\n\n**Consent expiration** provides a mechanism for implementing organizational policies around consent freshness while respecting user privacy preferences. Some organizations require re-consent every 12 months for compliance reasons, while others prefer persistent consent until explicitly revoked. Our system supports optional expiration through the `ExpiresAt` field, allowing administrators to configure consent lifetime policies per client application or globally.\n\nConsent revocation must be **immediately effective** across all system components. When a user revokes consent for a client application, several things must happen atomically: the consent record is marked as revoked, any active refresh tokens for that client/user combination are invalidated, and future authorization requests for that client must display the consent screen regardless of previous consent history. This immediate revocation ensures that users maintain meaningful control over their data sharing.\n\nThe consent management interface provides users with visibility and control over their authorization decisions. Users must be able to view all client applications they've authorized, see what scopes each application was granted, review when each authorization occurred and was last used, and revoke consent for any application at any time. This self-service approach empowers users to manage their privacy without requiring administrator intervention.\n\n| User Consent Management Action | Database Operation | Side Effects | User Feedback |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| View All Consents | Query consent records by UserID | None | Display list of authorized applications |\n| View Consent Details | Query specific consent record | None | Show scopes, dates, usage information |\n| Revoke Single Consent | Update consent record, set Revoked=true | Invalidate related refresh tokens | Confirm revocation successful |\n| Revoke All Consents | Update all user's consent records | Invalidate all user's refresh tokens | Confirm bulk revocation successful |\n| Download Consent History | Query and export consent records | Generate audit report | Provide downloadable report |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Consent Record Granularity**\n> - **Context**: We must decide whether to store one consent record per user-client pair or separate records for each scope grant\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single record per user-client with comma-separated scopes\n>   2. Separate record for each user-client-scope combination\n>   3. Single record per user-client with JSON array of scope objects\n> - **Decision**: Single record per user-client with space-separated scopes matching OAuth2 format\n> - **Rationale**: Matches OAuth2 scope parameter format, simplifies consent checking logic, reduces database rows while maintaining queryability. Scope changes for same client update existing record rather than creating new records.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables efficient consent checking and revocation. Requires careful handling of scope additions/removals. Audit trail captured through updated_at timestamps rather than separate records.\n\n**Consent analytics** help organizations understand user adoption patterns and identify potential friction points in authorization flows. Aggregate metrics like consent grant rates, revocation patterns, and scope popularity can inform UX improvements and policy decisions. However, these analytics must be implemented carefully to avoid creating privacy risks through detailed user behavior tracking.\n\nThe consent persistence layer must handle **concurrent modifications** gracefully when multiple authorization flows occur simultaneously for the same user-client combination. Database-level constraints and optimistic locking prevent race conditions that could result in inconsistent consent states. If two authorization flows attempt to create consent records simultaneously, one should succeed while the other should detect the existing consent and proceed accordingly.\n\nIntegration with the authorization endpoint requires careful coordination between consent checking, consent screen display, and consent record creation. The authorization flow must atomically create or update consent records during successful authorization to ensure that subsequent requests can benefit from the stored consent decision. Failure to persist consent decisions results in users facing repeated consent prompts, creating poor user experience and consent fatigue.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Consent persistence transforms user authorization from a one-time authentication event into an ongoing privacy management relationship. By storing and making consent decisions visible and revocable, the system shifts from a \"ask once, access forever\" model to a \"transparent, controllable access\" model that respects user autonomy and supports evolving privacy requirements.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: UserInfo Response Caching Strategy**\n> - **Context**: UserInfo endpoint may receive high request volumes and user profile data changes relatively infrequently, suggesting potential benefits from response caching. However, caching user data raises privacy concerns and could delay reflection of profile updates or consent revocations.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. No caching - fetch user data fresh for every request\n>   2. Aggressive caching with 15-minute TTL on complete UserInfo responses\n>   3. Cache user profile data only, validate tokens and consent fresh\n>   4. Cache validation results only, fetch user data fresh\n> - **Decision**: Cache validation results only with 2-minute TTL, fetch user data fresh for each request\n> - **Rationale**: Token validation (JWT signature, revocation checking) is computationally expensive and can benefit from short-term caching without privacy implications. User profile data must be fresh to reflect immediate updates and consent changes. 2-minute TTL balances performance with security responsiveness.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides 80% of caching performance benefits while maintaining data freshness. Requires cache invalidation on token revocation. May still face database load from user profile queries but eliminates cryptographic validation overhead.\n\n| Caching Option | Performance Gain | Privacy Risk | Data Freshness | Complexity |\n|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| No Caching | None | None | Immediate | Low |\n| Full Response Cache | High | High | Delayed | Medium |\n| Profile Data Only | Medium | Medium | Delayed | Medium |\n| Validation Only | Medium | Low | Immediate | Medium |\n\n> **Decision: Scope Addition Consent Handling**\n> - **Context**: When client applications request additional scopes beyond those previously granted, we must decide whether to show a consent screen for only the new scopes or re-consent for all requested scopes including previously granted ones.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Incremental consent - show consent screen only for new scopes\n>   2. Full re-consent - show all requested scopes including previously granted ones\n>   3. Hybrid - show all scopes but pre-check previously granted ones\n> - **Decision**: Incremental consent showing only new scopes with clear indication of previously granted scopes\n> - **Rationale**: Reduces consent fatigue by not re-prompting for already-granted permissions. Users can review existing permissions through separate privacy dashboard. Clearly communicates what new access is being requested. Matches user mental model of \"additional permissions\".\n> - **Consequences**: Enables smoother user experience for scope expansion. Requires more complex consent screen UI to show both new and existing grants. Consent records must track scope additions over time rather than replacing previous grants.\n\n> **Decision: Custom Claims Namespace Management**\n> - **Context**: Organizations need custom user profile claims beyond standard OIDC claims, but custom claims could conflict with future OIDC standards or between different organizational systems.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. No restrictions - allow any custom claim names\n>   2. Mandatory namespace prefix for all custom claims (e.g., \"org:employee_id\")\n>   3. Reserved namespace for standard claims, unrestricted custom claims\n>   4. Configuration-driven claim validation with conflict detection\n> - **Decision**: Reserved namespace for standard claims with unrestricted custom claims, plus runtime conflict detection\n> - **Rationale**: Preserves OIDC interoperability by protecting standard claim names. Allows organizational flexibility without imposing naming overhead. Runtime validation catches conflicts before they impact production. Enables gradual migration if new OIDC standards introduce conflicting names.\n> - **Consequences**: Prevents accidental override of standard OIDC claims. Requires validation logic to detect conflicts between custom and standard claims. May require claim name migration if future OIDC versions conflict with existing custom claims.\n\n| Custom Claims Approach | Interoperability | Flexibility | Migration Risk | Implementation Complexity |\n|------------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| No Restrictions | Low | High | High | Low |\n| Mandatory Prefixes | High | Medium | Low | Medium |\n| Reserved Standard | High | High | Medium | Medium |\n| Full Validation | High | High | Low | High |\n\n> **Decision: Consent Record Database Schema Design**\n> - **Context**: Consent records need to support efficient lookups for authorization flows, user privacy management, and audit requirements while handling scope changes and revocation scenarios.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single table with composite primary key (user_id, client_id)\n>   2. Separate tables for active consent and consent history\n>   3. Event sourcing with consent granted/revoked events\n>   4. Hybrid current state table plus audit log table\n> - **Decision**: Single table with composite primary key plus separate audit log table for compliance\n> - **Rationale**: Simple schema supports all required query patterns efficiently. Composite key ensures one active consent per user-client pair. Separate audit table provides compliance reporting without impacting operational queries. Balances simplicity with audit requirements.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables fast consent checking during authorization flows. Requires careful handling of scope updates to maintain data consistency. Audit table provides compliance trail without performance impact. May require data migration for schema changes.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Including Claims Without Scope Authorization**\n\nOne of the most dangerous mistakes in UserInfo endpoint implementation is returning user claims that weren't authorized by the granted scopes. Developers might implement a simple \"return all user profile data\" approach without properly filtering based on access token scopes, inadvertently exposing sensitive information that users never consented to share.\n\nThis mistake typically occurs when developers focus on JWT validation but skip the crucial scope-to-claims mapping step. The access token might be cryptographically valid and non-expired, but if it only contains the `openid profile` scopes, returning email addresses or phone numbers violates the user's consent decision and potentially breaches privacy regulations.\n\n**How to avoid**: Always implement scope-based filtering as a mandatory step in UserInfo response generation. Start with an empty claims object, then add only those claims that correspond to granted scopes. Never use user profile data as the starting point and filter out unauthorized claims - this approach is error-prone and may accidentally leak data during implementation changes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Caching UserInfo Responses Without Considering Consent Revocation**\n\nAggressive caching of UserInfo responses can create a significant security vulnerability where revoked consent doesn't take effect immediately. If the system caches complete UserInfo responses for performance, a user's consent revocation might not prevent continued data access until the cache expires, potentially violating the user's privacy expectations and regulatory requirements.\n\nThis problem is particularly severe when cache TTL values are set too high or when cache invalidation doesn't account for consent changes. A user might revoke a client's access and expect immediate effect, but cached responses could continue serving their profile data for minutes or hours after revocation.\n\n**How to avoid**: Never cache complete UserInfo responses containing actual user profile data. Instead, cache only the expensive operations like JWT validation and revocation checking. Implement cache invalidation triggers that immediately clear relevant cached data when consent records are modified or tokens are revoked.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Consent Checking Logic Between Authorization and UserInfo**\n\nImplementing different consent validation logic in the authorization endpoint versus the UserInfo endpoint creates subtle security gaps where tokens issued under one set of rules are validated under different rules. This inconsistency might allow access tokens to be used for data access even when the underlying consent has been modified or revoked.\n\nThe problem typically manifests when the authorization endpoint creates consent records in one format but the UserInfo endpoint expects a different format, or when consent checking algorithms diverge between components due to separate development or different developers implementing different parts of the system.\n\n**How to avoid**: Centralize consent checking logic in a shared service that both the authorization endpoint and UserInfo endpoint use. Ensure that consent record creation, validation, and revocation follow identical business rules across all system components. Implement comprehensive integration tests that verify consistent behavior between authorization and data access flows.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Exposing Internal User IDs in UserInfo Responses**\n\nThe OIDC `sub` claim should contain a **stable, unique identifier** for the user that's specific to the client application, not the internal database primary key or user ID used within the identity provider system. Exposing internal user IDs creates privacy risks and potential security vulnerabilities if those IDs are used in other system contexts.\n\nMany developers mistakenly use the same user ID across all client applications, which enables cross-application user correlation and violates privacy principles. Different client applications should receive different `sub` claim values for the same user to prevent tracking across applications.\n\n**How to avoid**: Generate client-specific subject identifiers using a one-way hash of the internal user ID and client ID. This approach ensures that each client receives a unique, stable identifier for each user while preventing cross-client correlation. Store these pairwise pseudonymous identifiers if consistent values are required across multiple token issuances.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Failing to Handle Missing or Unverified Claims Appropriately**\n\nWhen user profile data is incomplete or unverified, the UserInfo endpoint must handle missing claims correctly according to OIDC specifications. Simply returning null values or empty strings for missing claims can break client application logic that expects either valid data or complete omission of the claim.\n\nVerification status claims like `email_verified` must reflect actual verification state rather than defaulting to false or being omitted when verification status is unknown. Client applications rely on these verification claims to make security decisions about user authentication strength.\n\n**How to avoid**: Omit claims entirely from UserInfo responses when the corresponding user profile data is missing or null. For verification claims, include them only when verification status is definitively known, and set the value to reflect actual verification state. Document clearly which claims are optional and may be omitted based on user profile completeness.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Consent Screen Information for User Decision Making**\n\nConsent screens that display only scope names like \"profile\" and \"email\" without explaining what specific information will be shared leave users unable to make informed decisions about their data sharing. Users can't meaningfully consent when they don't understand what they're authorizing.\n\nGeneric consent screens that don't identify the specific client application requesting access or that fail to explain how the data will be used prevent users from making contextual privacy decisions. The same scopes might be appropriate for one application but inappropriate for another based on the application's purpose and trustworthiness.\n\n**How to avoid**: Design consent screens that clearly identify the requesting client application, explain in plain language what information each scope provides access to, and when possible, include information about how the client intends to use the data. Provide scope descriptions that are meaningful to non-technical users, such as \"Access your name and profile picture\" rather than just \"profile scope\".\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n####

split space-separated scope strings from OAuth2 parameters\n- Leverage struct tags (`json:\"claim_name\"`) to map between Go field names and OIDC claim names\n- Use `sql.NullString` and `sql.NullTime` for optional database fields like `middle_name` or `expires_at`\n- Implement `http.HandlerFunc` pattern for UserInfo endpoint to integrate with existing HTTP routing\n- Use `context.WithTimeout()` for database operations to prevent hanging requests\n- Cache JWT validation results using `sync.Map` or Redis with appropriate TTL values\n- Use `html/template` for consent screens with automatic XSS protection through template escaping\n- Implement proper error handling with structured logging using `log/slog` package\n\n**Database Integration Patterns:**\n\n- Use prepared statements for all database queries to prevent SQL injection\n- Implement connection pooling with `sql.SetMaxOpenConns()` and `sql.SetMaxIdleConns()`\n- Use database transactions for operations that modify multiple tables (consent + audit logs)\n- Implement proper NULL handling for optional user profile fields\n- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields: `user_id`, `client_id`, `(user_id, client_id)`\n- Use `UPSERT` operations (PostgreSQL) or `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` (MySQL) for consent updates\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the UserInfo and consent management components, verify the following behavior:\n\n**UserInfo Endpoint Verification:**\n1. **Token Validation**: `curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>\" http://localhost:8080/userinfo` should return filtered user claims as JSON\n2. **Invalid Token**: `curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer invalid\" http://localhost:8080/userinfo` should return 401 with `WWW-Authenticate` header\n3. **Scope Filtering**: Token with only `openid profile` scopes should not return email claims even if user has email address\n4. **Missing Claims**: User profile missing optional fields should omit those claims from response, not return null values\n\n**Expected UserInfo Response Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"sub\": \"user_123456\",\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"given_name\": \"John\",\n  \"family_name\": \"Smith\",\n  \"preferred_username\": \"jsmith\",\n  \"picture\": \"https://example.com/photos/jsmith.jpg\",\n  \"locale\": \"en-US\"\n}\n```\n\n**Consent Screen Verification:**\n1. **Display**: Navigate to `/consent?client_id=test&scope=openid+profile+email&redirect_uri=...` should show consent form\n2. **Client Info**: Consent screen should display client name and readable scope descriptions\n3. **Allow Flow**: Clicking \"Allow\" should redirect back to client with authorization code\n4. **Deny Flow**: Clicking \"Deny\" should redirect back to client with `access_denied` error\n\n**Consent Persistence Verification:**\n1. **Skip Consent**: Second authorization request with same scopes should skip consent screen\n2. **Additional Scopes**: Request with new scopes should show consent screen for additional permissions\n3. **Revocation**: User revoking consent should force consent screen on next authorization\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- UserInfo returns claims not authorized by token scopes → Check scope-to-claims mapping logic\n- Consent screen shows technical scope names instead of user-friendly descriptions → Update scope descriptions\n- Repeated consent prompts for same client/scopes → Check consent record creation and lookup\n- 500 errors on UserInfo requests → Check database connectivity and user profile schema\n- CSRF attacks possible on consent form → Ensure CSRF token validation in POST handler\n\n\n## Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section integrates concepts from all milestones (1-4), showing how the individual components work together in complete OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows\n\n### Mental Model: Airport Security System\n\nThink of the OAuth2 provider's interactions like a comprehensive airport security system. The authorization code grant flow is like checking in for a flight - you present your ID (authentication), get a boarding pass (authorization code), then exchange it at the gate for actual access to the plane (access token). The refresh token flow is like a frequent flyer program - you have a special card that lets you get new boarding passes without going through the full check-in process again. The client credentials flow is like airline staff accessing restricted areas - they have special badges that grant direct access without passenger processing. The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint is like the airport information desk - it tells everyone where to find all the different services and what procedures to follow.\n\nThis mental model helps us understand that OAuth2 isn't just about individual components, but about orchestrated workflows that move users and applications through a secure, standardized process. Each flow has different security requirements, different participants, and different success criteria, just like different types of airport access have different procedures and verification steps.\n\nThe key insight is that these flows are **state machines with cryptographic checkpoints**. Each step validates the previous step's output and produces cryptographically bound artifacts for the next step. This creates an audit trail and prevents attackers from skipping steps or replaying old interactions.\n\n### Authorization Code Grant Flow\n\nThe **authorization code grant flow** represents the gold standard for OAuth2 security, designed specifically for web applications that can securely store credentials. This flow implements the principle of **least privilege** by separating the authorization decision (made by the user) from the token issuance (handled by the authorization server), while ensuring that sensitive tokens never pass through potentially insecure channels like browser redirects.\n\n![Authorization Code Grant Flow](./diagrams/authorization-code-flow-sequence.svg)\n\nThe flow consists of six distinct phases, each with specific security properties and failure modes. Understanding the purpose and implementation of each phase is crucial for building a secure OAuth2 provider.\n\n#### Phase 1: Client Redirect and Parameter Validation\n\nThe flow begins when the client application redirects the resource owner (user) to the authorization endpoint. This redirect carries several critical parameters that must be validated before proceeding. The client constructs an authorization URL containing the client identifier, requested scopes, redirect URI, state parameter for CSRF protection, and PKCE code challenge for additional security.\n\n| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Validation Rules |\n|-----------|----------|---------|------------------|\n| `client_id` | Yes | Identifies the requesting application | Must match registered client |\n| `redirect_uri` | Yes | Where to send the authorization response | Must exactly match registered URI |\n| `scope` | Yes | Permissions being requested | Must be subset of client's allowed scopes |\n| `state` | Yes | CSRF protection token | Must be cryptographically random |\n| `code_challenge` | Yes (PKCE) | SHA256 hash of code verifier | Must be valid base64url encoding |\n| `code_challenge_method` | Yes (PKCE) | Hash algorithm used | Must be \"S256\" |\n| `response_type` | Yes | Type of response expected | Must be \"code\" |\n\nThe authorization server receives this request and immediately begins a multi-step validation process. First, it validates the client_id by looking up the client registration in the `ClientStore`. If the client doesn't exist, the server responds with an `ErrorInvalidClient` directly to the user (not via redirect) since we cannot trust the redirect_uri without a valid client.\n\nOnce the client is validated, the server performs redirect URI validation using exact string matching. This is a critical security control - partial matches or pattern matching can lead to authorization code interception attacks. The redirect_uri in the request must exactly match one of the URIs registered for the client during the registration process.\n\n> **Security Insight**: Redirect URI validation is the primary defense against authorization code interception. An attacker who registers a malicious application cannot steal authorization codes intended for legitimate applications because they cannot predict or control the exact redirect URI that legitimate applications will use.\n\nThe server also validates the requested scopes to ensure they are a subset of the scopes the client is authorized to request. Scope validation prevents privilege escalation attacks where a client might attempt to request more permissions than originally granted during registration.\n\n#### Phase 2: PKCE Code Challenge Processing\n\n**Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** adds an additional layer of security specifically designed to protect against authorization code interception attacks, particularly relevant for mobile and single-page applications but recommended for all OAuth2 clients as a defense-in-depth measure.\n\nThe PKCE flow requires the client to generate a cryptographically random `code_verifier` (43-128 characters, base64url-encoded) and derive a `code_challenge` by applying SHA256 hashing and base64url encoding. The client sends only the code_challenge in the authorization request, keeping the code_verifier secret until the token exchange phase.\n\n| PKCE Component | Generation Method | Security Property |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| `code_verifier` | Cryptographically random 43-128 chars | High entropy, unpredictable |\n| `code_challenge` | SHA256(code_verifier), base64url encoded | One-way function, tamper evident |\n| `code_challenge_method` | Always \"S256\" | Specifies hash algorithm |\n\nThe authorization server stores the code_challenge alongside the generated authorization code, creating a cryptographic binding between the authorization request and the eventual token request. This binding ensures that only the client that initiated the authorization flow can complete it, even if an attacker intercepts the authorization code during the redirect.\n\n```\nPKCE Security Flow:\n1. Client generates random code_verifier: \"dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk\"\n2. Client computes code_challenge: SHA256(code_verifier) → base64url encode\n3. Authorization server stores code_challenge with authorization code\n4. Attacker intercepts authorization code but lacks code_verifier\n5. Token request fails PKCE validation without correct code_verifier\n```\n\n#### Phase 3: User Authentication and Consent\n\nAfter parameter validation, the authorization server must authenticate the resource owner and obtain their consent for the requested access. This phase typically involves redirecting the user to a login page (if not already authenticated) followed by a consent screen that clearly displays what the client application is requesting.\n\nThe consent screen serves multiple security and usability purposes. It provides **informed consent** by showing the user exactly what permissions they are granting, to which application, and for what purpose. It also serves as a **phishing detection** mechanism - legitimate consent screens will accurately display the client application's registered name and icon, while phishing attempts often contain obvious discrepancies.\n\n| Consent Screen Element | Purpose | Security Consideration |\n|----------------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Client Name | Identifies the requesting application | Must match registered name exactly |\n| Client Icon/Logo | Visual identification | Should be displayed consistently |\n| Requested Scopes | Shows specific permissions | Must use clear, non-technical language |\n| Scope Descriptions | Explains what each permission allows | Should be specific, not vague |\n| Allow/Deny Buttons | Captures user decision | Must be equally prominent |\n| User Information | Shows who is granting consent | Prevents confused deputy attacks |\n\nThe consent mechanism also implements **consent persistence** to improve user experience. If a user has previously granted the same scopes to the same client, the authorization server can skip the consent screen and proceed directly to authorization code generation, unless the client explicitly requests re-consent or additional scopes.\n\n> **Design Principle**: Consent screens should optimize for **informed decision-making** rather than conversion rates. Users need sufficient information to make security decisions, even if this occasionally results in denied requests.\n\n#### Phase 4: Authorization Code Generation and Binding\n\nUpon receiving user consent, the authorization server generates a cryptographically secure authorization code and binds it to the specific authorization request parameters. This binding is crucial for preventing various attack scenarios including authorization code replay, client substitution, and parameter modification attacks.\n\nThe `AuthorizationCode` structure captures all the essential binding information:\n\n| Field | Purpose | Security Binding |\n|-------|---------|------------------|\n| `Code` | The authorization code itself | Cryptographically random, 128+ bits entropy |\n| `ClientID` | Which client can use this code | Prevents cross-client code usage |\n| `UserID` | Which user granted consent | Prevents user substitution |\n| `RedirectURI` | Where the response should go | Prevents redirect attacks |\n| `Scope` | What permissions were granted | Prevents scope elevation |\n| `CodeChallenge` | PKCE challenge for verification | Prevents code interception |\n| `ExpiresAt` | When the code becomes invalid | Limits attack window |\n| `Used` | Whether code has been exchanged | Prevents replay attacks |\n\nAuthorization codes must be **single-use** and **short-lived** (maximum 10 minutes, recommended 5 minutes). The short lifetime limits the window of opportunity for interception attacks, while single-use prevents replay attacks even if an attacker obtains a valid code.\n\nThe authorization server generates the code using a cryptographically secure random number generator with at least 128 bits of entropy. The code should be base64url encoded to ensure safe transmission through URL parameters without requiring additional encoding.\n\n#### Phase 5: Authorization Response and Redirect\n\nAfter generating the authorization code, the authorization server constructs the authorization response and redirects the user back to the client application. This redirect carries the authorization code and the state parameter, allowing the client to continue the flow and verify that the response corresponds to its original request.\n\n| Response Parameter | Required | Purpose | Validation by Client |\n|-------------------|----------|---------|---------------------|\n| `code` | Yes | The authorization code | Store securely for token exchange |\n| `state` | Yes | CSRF protection token | Must match original request |\n\nThe redirect uses HTTP 302 status with the authorization code and state appended as query parameters to the registered redirect_uri. The client application receives this redirect and immediately validates the state parameter to ensure the response corresponds to its original authorization request, providing protection against CSRF attacks.\n\n```\nSuccessful Authorization Response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://client.example.com/callback?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=af0ifjsldkj\n\nError Authorization Response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://client.example.com/callback?error=access_denied&error_description=User+denied+access&state=af0ifjsldkj\n```\n\nIf the user denies consent or an error occurs during processing, the authorization server redirects back to the client with an error parameter instead of an authorization code. This allows the client application to handle the denial gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback.\n\n#### Phase 6: Authorization Code Exchange for Tokens\n\nThe final phase occurs when the client exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens at the token endpoint. This exchange happens server-to-server, providing confidentiality and allowing for strong client authentication.\n\nThe token request must include several parameters that are validated against the stored authorization code:\n\n| Token Request Parameter | Required | Purpose | Validation |\n|------------------------|----------|---------|------------|\n| `grant_type` | Yes | Must be \"authorization_code\" | Specifies the grant type |\n| `code` | Yes | The authorization code | Must exist and be unused |\n| `redirect_uri` | Yes | Must match original request | Prevents parameter modification |\n| `code_verifier` | Yes (PKCE) | Proves client identity | Must hash to stored challenge |\n| `client_id` | Yes | Client authentication | Must match code binding |\n| `client_secret` | Yes (confidential) | Client authentication | Must be valid for client |\n\nThe authorization server performs comprehensive validation of the token request:\n\n1. **Client Authentication**: Verify the client credentials using the registered authentication method (client_secret_basic or client_secret_post)\n2. **Authorization Code Validation**: Confirm the code exists, hasn't been used, and hasn't expired\n3. **Parameter Binding Validation**: Ensure the redirect_uri matches the original authorization request\n4. **PKCE Verification**: Hash the code_verifier and compare against the stored code_challenge\n5. **Client Binding Validation**: Confirm the requesting client matches the client for whom the code was issued\n\nUpon successful validation, the authorization server issues an access token and refresh token, marks the authorization code as used, and returns the token response to the client.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Authorization Code Single-Use Enforcement**\n> - **Context**: Authorization codes could theoretically be reused multiple times until expiration\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Allow multiple uses until expiration\n>   - Single-use with immediate invalidation\n>   - Limited number of uses (e.g., 3 attempts)\n> - **Decision**: Single-use with immediate invalidation\n> - **Rationale**: Single-use provides the strongest security posture by eliminating replay attack windows and simplifying the security model. The OAuth2 specification recommends single-use, and the marginal complexity of handling client retry scenarios is outweighed by the security benefits.\n> - **Consequences**: Clients must implement proper error handling for network failures during token exchange, but the overall system security is significantly improved with no additional complexity in the authorization server.\n\n### Refresh Token Flow\n\nThe **refresh token flow** provides a secure mechanism for clients to obtain new access tokens without requiring user interaction. This flow is essential for maintaining long-term access to protected resources while preserving the security principle of short-lived access tokens.\n\nThe refresh token flow implements **token rotation** as a key security feature. Each time a refresh token is used, the authorization server issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one. This rotation provides forward security and enables detection of token theft through the identification of refresh token reuse attempts.\n\n#### Mental Model: Subscription Renewal System\n\nThink of refresh tokens like magazine subscriptions with automatic renewal cards. You get an initial subscription (access token) that expires after a short period, but you also receive a renewal card (refresh token) that lets you extend your subscription. Each time you use the renewal card, you get a new subscription period and a new renewal card, while the old renewal card becomes invalid. If someone steals your old renewal card and tries to use it, the magazine company knows something suspicious is happening because that card should no longer exist.\n\n#### Token Family Tracking and Rotation Security\n\nRefresh tokens are organized into **token families** that track the lineage of refresh token rotations. Each token family has a unique identifier that remains constant across all refresh token rotations within that authorization grant. This family tracking enables sophisticated security features like breach detection and family-wide revocation.\n\n| Token Family Concept | Purpose | Security Benefit |\n|---------------------|---------|------------------|\n| `TokenFamily` ID | Groups related refresh tokens | Enables family-wide operations |\n| `ParentToken` reference | Tracks rotation lineage | Detects unauthorized reuse |\n| Family revocation | Invalidates entire token family | Limits breach impact |\n| Rotation audit log | Records all token usage | Enables forensic analysis |\n\nWhen a refresh token is used legitimately, the following sequence occurs:\n\n1. Client presents refresh token to token endpoint\n2. Authorization server validates the token and checks revocation status\n3. Server generates new access token with fresh expiration\n4. Server generates new refresh token in the same family\n5. Server marks the old refresh token as used/revoked\n6. Server updates the parent-child relationship in the token family\n7. Server returns new tokens to the client\n\nThe critical security feature is **breach detection through reuse identification**. If an attacker obtains a refresh token that has already been rotated, their attempt to use the old token triggers a security alert. The authorization server can then revoke the entire token family, preventing the attacker from using any tokens while forcing the legitimate client to re-authenticate.\n\n```\nNormal Rotation Sequence:\nRT1 (active) → exchange → RT2 (active), RT1 (revoked)\nRT2 (active) → exchange → RT3 (active), RT2 (revoked)\n\nBreach Detection Scenario:\nRT2 (revoked) → reuse attempt → SECURITY ALERT: revoke entire family\nLegitimate client with RT3 → next exchange fails → re-authentication required\n```\n\n#### Refresh Token Request Processing\n\nThe refresh token exchange follows a structured validation process that ensures both security and correctness. The client makes a POST request to the token endpoint with the refresh token grant type.\n\n| Refresh Request Parameter | Required | Purpose | Validation |\n|--------------------------|----------|---------|------------|\n| `grant_type` | Yes | Must be \"refresh_token\" | Specifies grant type |\n| `refresh_token` | Yes | The current refresh token | Must be valid and not revoked |\n| `scope` | No | Requested scope (subset) | Must not exceed original grant |\n| `client_id` | Yes | Client identification | Must match token binding |\n| `client_secret` | Yes (confidential) | Client authentication | Must be valid for client |\n\nThe authorization server processes the refresh token request through several validation phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Token Format and Existence Validation**\nThe server first validates that the refresh token exists in the `RefreshTokenStore` and retrieves its associated metadata. This includes checking the token's format, ensuring it hasn't been marked as revoked, and confirming it hasn't exceeded its maximum lifetime.\n\n**Phase 2: Client Authentication and Binding Validation**\nThe server authenticates the client using the provided credentials and verifies that the refresh token was originally issued to this client. This prevents clients from using refresh tokens issued to other clients, even if they somehow obtain them.\n\n**Phase 3: Token Family and Lineage Validation**\nThe server checks the token's position in its token family and verifies that it represents the current active token in the family lineage. This is where breach detection occurs - if the token has already been rotated (has a child token), the server knows this is likely a replay attack.\n\n**Phase 4: Scope Validation and Filtering**\nIf the client requests specific scopes in the refresh request, the server validates that these scopes are a subset of the originally granted scopes. This prevents scope elevation attacks where a client might attempt to gain additional permissions during token refresh.\n\n#### Token Rotation Implementation\n\nUpon successful validation, the authorization server performs the token rotation process that maintains security while providing the client with fresh credentials.\n\nThe rotation process follows these steps:\n\n1. **Generate New Access Token**: Create a fresh JWT access token with updated expiration time and the same user/client/scope binding as the original grant\n2. **Generate New Refresh Token**: Create a new refresh token in the same token family, setting the current token as its parent\n3. **Update Token Family State**: Mark the old refresh token as used and establish the parent-child relationship\n4. **Persist State Changes**: Atomically commit all state changes to prevent inconsistencies\n5. **Return Token Response**: Provide the new tokens to the client in standard OAuth2 format\n\nThe atomic persistence of state changes is crucial for preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency. If multiple refresh requests arrive simultaneously (due to network retries or client bugs), only one should succeed while others should fail gracefully.\n\n| Token Response Field | Purpose | Value Source |\n|---------------------|---------|--------------|\n| `access_token` | New JWT access token | Freshly generated with updated expiration |\n| `token_type` | Always \"Bearer\" | OAuth2 standard |\n| `expires_in` | Access token lifetime in seconds | From JWT expiration claim |\n| `refresh_token` | New refresh token | Generated in same family as replaced token |\n| `scope` | Granted scopes | From original authorization or filtered request |\n\n#### Refresh Token Lifetime and Management\n\nRefresh tokens have significantly longer lifetimes than access tokens, typically ranging from days to months depending on the security requirements and user experience goals. However, they are not unlimited in duration and must eventually expire to limit the impact of undetected breaches.\n\n| Refresh Token Attribute | Typical Value | Security Rationale |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Maximum lifetime | 30-90 days | Balances convenience with security exposure |\n| Rotation frequency | Every access token refresh | Provides forward security |\n| Family size limit | 10-20 tokens | Prevents unbounded growth |\n| Revocation propagation | Immediate | Ensures consistent security state |\n\nThe authorization server implements **refresh token cleanup** processes that remove expired tokens and their associated metadata. This cleanup is essential for preventing database growth and ensuring that old, potentially compromised tokens cannot be misused even if storage security is breached.\n\n> **Design Principle**: Refresh token rotation should be transparent to well-behaved clients while making token theft immediately detectable and automatically mitigated.\n\n### Client Credentials Flow\n\nThe **client credentials flow** provides a streamlined authentication mechanism for machine-to-machine communication where no human user is involved. This flow is essential for service-to-service authentication, background jobs, and API integration scenarios where applications need to access resources based on their own identity rather than on behalf of a user.\n\n#### Mental Model: Corporate ID Badge System\n\nThink of the client credentials flow like a corporate ID badge system for employees accessing different buildings or systems. An employee (client application) presents their company-issued badge (client credentials) to a security reader (authorization server), which immediately grants or denies access based on the badge's validity and the employee's clearance level. There's no additional approval process or human intervention - the badge itself contains all the necessary authorization information.\n\nThis analogy helps illustrate why the client credentials flow is both simpler and more restrictive than user-centric flows. The badge (client credentials) represents the application's inherent permissions rather than delegated user permissions, and access is immediate rather than requiring consent or multi-step validation.\n\n#### Client Authentication Methods\n\nThe client credentials flow supports multiple authentication methods, allowing organizations to choose the approach that best fits their security requirements and infrastructure capabilities.\n\n| Authentication Method | Security Level | Use Case | Implementation |\n|----------------------|----------------|----------|----------------|\n| `client_secret_basic` | Medium | Traditional web services | HTTP Basic authentication with client_id:client_secret |\n| `client_secret_post` | Medium | APIs that can't use Basic auth | client_id and client_secret in request body |\n| `client_secret_jwt` | High | High-security environments | JWT signed with shared secret |\n| `private_key_jwt` | Very High | Zero-shared-secret requirements | JWT signed with client's private key |\n\n**HTTP Basic Authentication** represents the most common implementation, where the client encodes its client_id and client_secret as a Base64-encoded string in the Authorization header. This method provides reasonable security when used over HTTPS but requires secure storage of the client secret.\n\n**POST Body Authentication** offers an alternative for clients that cannot easily set HTTP headers or prefer to send credentials in the request body. While functionally equivalent to Basic authentication, this method may be preferred in certain API gateway or proxy configurations.\n\n**JWT Authentication Methods** provide enhanced security by eliminating the need to transmit secrets directly. In `client_secret_jwt`, the client creates a JWT assertion signed with its registered secret, while `private_key_jwt` uses asymmetric cryptography to eliminate shared secrets entirely.\n\n#### Client Credentials Request Processing\n\nThe client credentials flow follows a simplified request-response pattern that bypasses user authentication and consent while maintaining rigorous client authentication and authorization validation.\n\n| Request Parameter | Required | Purpose | Validation |\n|------------------|----------|---------|------------|\n| `grant_type` | Yes | Must be \"client_credentials\" | Specifies the grant type |\n| `scope` | Optional | Requested permissions | Must be subset of client's allowed scopes |\n| `client_id` | Yes | Client identification | Must match authenticated client |\n| `client_secret` | Conditional | Client authentication | Required for secret-based auth methods |\n\nThe authorization server processes client credentials requests through a focused validation pipeline:\n\n**Client Authentication**: The server authenticates the client using the provided credentials and the client's registered authentication method. This authentication must be successful before any authorization decisions are made.\n\n**Grant Type Authorization**: The server verifies that the client is authorized to use the client credentials grant type. Not all registered clients should be permitted to use this flow - it should be restricted to applications with legitimate machine-to-machine access requirements.\n\n**Scope Validation**: If the client requests specific scopes, the server validates that these scopes are within the client's pre-authorized scope set. Unlike user-centric flows, there is no dynamic consent process - all permissions must be pre-configured during client registration.\n\n**Token Generation**: Upon successful validation, the server generates an access token that represents the client's identity and authorized scopes. No refresh token is typically issued since clients can re-authenticate using their credentials whenever needed.\n\n#### Client-Scoped Access Tokens\n\nAccess tokens issued through the client credentials flow have different characteristics than user-delegated tokens. These tokens represent the client application's inherent permissions rather than user-granted permissions, and their claims structure reflects this distinction.\n\n| JWT Claim | Purpose | Client Credentials Value |\n|-----------|---------|-------------------------|\n| `sub` | Subject identifier | Client ID or client-specific identifier |\n| `aud` | Intended audience | Resource server(s) the token is valid for |\n| `iss` | Token issuer | Authorization server identifier |\n| `exp` | Expiration time | Typically shorter than user tokens (1-24 hours) |\n| `iat` | Issued at time | Current timestamp |\n| `scope` | Granted permissions | Client's authorized scopes |\n| `client_id` | Client identifier | Explicitly identifies the client |\n| `token_type` | Token classification | \"client_credentials\" or similar |\n\nThe absence of user-related claims (like user ID or user profile information) clearly indicates that these tokens represent application-level access rather than user-delegated access. Resource servers can use this distinction to apply different authorization policies for machine-to-machine access versus user-initiated access.\n\n#### Security Considerations for Machine-to-Machine Access\n\nClient credentials flows require careful security consideration because they bypass many of the user-centric protections built into other OAuth2 flows. Applications using this flow have persistent, programmatic access to resources without human oversight, making security breaches potentially more severe and harder to detect.\n\n**Credential Rotation**: Client credentials should be rotated regularly to limit the impact of credential compromise. Unlike user passwords, client credentials are typically stored in configuration files or environment variables, making them vulnerable to different types of attacks.\n\n**Scope Minimization**: Clients should be granted only the minimum scopes necessary for their legitimate functions. Since there is no user consent process to limit scope abuse, pre-authorization during client registration becomes the primary access control mechanism.\n\n**Audit Logging**: All client credentials usage should be logged for security monitoring and compliance purposes. These logs should capture which client accessed what resources when, enabling detection of unusual patterns or potential abuse.\n\n**Network Security**: Client credentials flows assume secure transport (HTTPS) and may benefit from additional network-level protections like API gateways, IP allowlisting, or mutual TLS authentication.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Refresh Token Omission in Client Credentials Flow**\n> - **Context**: Client credentials flow could issue refresh tokens for consistency with other flows\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Issue refresh tokens with rotation\n>   - Omit refresh tokens, require re-authentication\n>   - Make refresh token issuance configurable per client\n> - **Decision**: Omit refresh tokens by default\n> - **Rationale**: Clients can re-authenticate using their credentials anytime, eliminating the complexity of refresh token management without significant usability impact. This also reduces the attack surface by eliminating long-lived tokens that could be compromised.\n> - **Consequences**: Clients must handle access token expiration by re-authenticating, but this is typically automated and transparent to users. Security is improved by eliminating persistent tokens.\n\n### OpenID Connect Discovery\n\n**OpenID Connect Discovery** provides a standardized mechanism for clients to automatically discover the endpoints, capabilities, and configuration of an OpenID Connect provider. This discovery mechanism eliminates the need for manual configuration and enables dynamic client registration and endpoint resolution.\n\n#### Mental Model: Airport Information System\n\nThink of OpenID Connect Discovery like the information systems at a major airport. When you arrive at an unfamiliar airport, you don't need to memorize the locations of every gate, restaurant, and service - instead, you consult the information displays and maps that tell you where everything is located. Similarly, OAuth2 clients don't need to have the authorization server's endpoints hard-coded - they can query the well-known discovery endpoint to learn about all available services, their locations, and their capabilities.\n\nThis discovery system makes the OAuth2 ecosystem more dynamic and maintainable. Just as airports can relocate services or add new amenities without requiring travelers to update their personal navigation systems, authorization servers can change endpoints or add new features without breaking existing client integrations.\n\n#### Well-Known Configuration Endpoint\n\nThe discovery process centers around the **well-known configuration endpoint**, which must be available at a standardized location relative to the authorization server's issuer identifier. This endpoint returns a JSON document containing comprehensive information about the provider's capabilities and endpoint locations.\n\nThe well-known endpoint follows the pattern: `{issuer}/.well-known/openid_configuration`\n\nFor example:\n- Issuer: `https://auth.example.com`\n- Discovery endpoint: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid_configuration`\n\nThis standardized location allows clients to discover provider capabilities using only the issuer identifier, enabling truly dynamic configuration and reducing deployment complexity.\n\n#### Discovery Document Structure\n\nThe discovery document contains extensive metadata about the OpenID Connect provider, organized into several categories of information that clients use for different purposes.\n\n| Configuration Category | Purpose | Client Usage |\n|----------------------|---------|--------------|\n| Endpoint URLs | Locations of OAuth2/OIDC endpoints | Endpoint resolution for API calls |\n| Supported Features | Capabilities and optional features | Feature detection and client adaptation |\n| Cryptographic Information | Key locations and algorithms | Token validation and security setup |\n| Metadata | Provider identification and contact | Error reporting and support |\n\n**Core Endpoint Configuration**:\n\n| Endpoint Field | Required | Purpose | Example Value |\n|---------------|----------|---------|---------------|\n| `issuer` | Yes | Provider identifier | `https://auth.example.com` |\n| `authorization_endpoint` | Yes | OAuth2 authorization URL | `https://auth.example.com/oauth2/authorize` |\n| `token_endpoint` | Yes | OAuth2 token exchange URL | `https://auth.example.com/oauth2/token` |\n| `userinfo_endpoint` | Yes (OIDC) | User profile claims URL | `https://auth.example.com/oidc/userinfo` |\n| `jwks_uri` | Yes | JSON Web Key Set location | `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json` |\n| `introspection_endpoint` | No | RFC 7662 token validation | `https://auth.example.com/oauth2/introspect` |\n| `revocation_endpoint` | No | RFC 7009 token revocation | `https://auth.example.com/oauth2/revoke` |\n\n**Capability Declaration**:\n\n| Capability Field | Purpose | Example Values |\n|-----------------|---------|----------------|\n| `response_types_supported` | Supported OAuth2 response types | `[\"code\", \"code id_token\"]` |\n| `grant_types_supported` | Supported grant types | `[\"authorization_code\", \"refresh_token\", \"client_credentials\"]` |\n| `scopes_supported` | Available scopes | `[\"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\", \"offline_access\"]` |\n| `response_modes_supported` | Supported response modes | `[\"query\", \"fragment\", \"form_post\"]` |\n| `code_challenge_methods_supported` | PKCE methods | `[\"S256\"]` |\n\n**Token and Cryptographic Configuration**:\n\n| Security Field | Purpose | Example Values |\n|---------------|---------|----------------|\n| `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` | ID token signature algorithms | `[\"RS256\", \"ES256\"]` |\n| `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` | Client authentication methods | `[\"client_secret_basic\", \"client_secret_post\", \"private_key_jwt\"]` |\n| `claims_supported` | Available user claims | `[\"sub\", \"name\", \"email\", \"picture\", \"email_verified\"]` |\n| `subject_types_supported` | Subject identifier types | `[\"public\", \"pairwise\"]` |\n\n#### Dynamic Client Configuration\n\nDiscovery enables **dynamic client configuration**, where client applications can adapt their behavior based on the provider's capabilities rather than requiring manual configuration updates. This capability is particularly valuable in multi-tenant environments or when integrating with multiple identity providers.\n\nClient applications can use discovery information to:\n\n**Endpoint Resolution**: Dynamically determine the correct URLs for authorization, token exchange, and user information requests without hard-coding endpoint locations.\n\n**Feature Detection**: Check whether the provider supports specific features like PKCE, token introspection, or particular authentication methods before attempting to use them.\n\n**Algorithm Selection**: Choose appropriate cryptographic algorithms for token validation based on the provider's supported algorithm list.\n\n**Scope Discovery**: Present users with accurate information about available permissions and claims based on the provider's capability declarations.\n\n```\nDynamic Configuration Example:\n1. Client discovers provider supports [\"S256\"] for PKCE\n2. Client generates PKCE challenge using SHA256\n3. Client discovers authorization endpoint URL\n4. Client constructs authorization request with discovered endpoint\n5. Client discovers supported scopes and presents appropriate UI\n```\n\n#### JWKS Endpoint Integration\n\nThe **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)** endpoint provides cryptographic public keys that clients use to validate JWT tokens issued by the authorization server. The discovery document includes the `jwks_uri` field pointing to this endpoint, enabling automated key retrieval and rotation.\n\n| JWKS Field | Purpose | Example Value |\n|------------|---------|---------------|\n| `keys` | Array of public keys | JSON Web Key objects |\n| `kty` | Key type | \"RSA\", \"EC\" |\n| `use` | Key usage | \"sig\" (signature) |\n| `kid` | Key identifier | \"2023-10-key-1\" |\n| `alg` | Algorithm | \"RS256\", \"ES256\" |\n| `n`, `e` | RSA public key components | Base64url-encoded values |\n\nClients cache JWKS information but must handle key rotation gracefully. When token validation fails due to an unknown key ID, clients should refresh their JWKS cache and retry validation before concluding that the token is invalid.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Static vs Dynamic JWKS**\n> - **Context**: JWKS endpoint could serve static keys or dynamically rotate keys\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Static keys with manual rotation procedures\n>   - Dynamic rotation with cache invalidation\n>   - Hybrid approach with predictable rotation schedule\n> - **Decision**: Dynamic rotation with cache-friendly headers\n> - **Rationale**: Dynamic key rotation provides better security through regular key renewal while cache headers (`Cache-Control: max-age=3600`) balance security with performance. Clients can cache keys safely while ensuring they detect rotations within a reasonable timeframe.\n> - **Consequences**: Clients must implement JWKS caching and refresh logic, but overall system security is improved through automated key rotation.\n\n#### Caching and Performance Considerations\n\nDiscovery documents are relatively stable but may change when providers add new features, endpoints, or capabilities. Proper caching strategies balance the need for current information with performance and availability requirements.\n\n| Cache Strategy | Cache Duration | Update Trigger | Use Case |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------|\n| Time-based | 1-24 hours | Cache expiration | General purpose caching |\n| ETag-based | Until changed | HTTP ETag mismatch | Bandwidth optimization |\n| Failure-tolerant | Indefinite with refresh attempts | Provider availability | High availability scenarios |\n| Event-driven | Until notified | Provider notification | Real-time updates |\n\nClients should implement **graceful degradation** when discovery endpoints are unavailable. This might involve falling back to cached discovery documents or pre-configured endpoint information while continuing to attempt discovery refresh in the background.\n\nThe discovery endpoint should return appropriate HTTP caching headers to guide client caching behavior:\n\n```\nHTTP Response Headers for Discovery:\nCache-Control: public, max-age=3600\nETag: \"discovery-v1.2.3\"\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\nThese headers indicate that the discovery document can be cached publicly for one hour and provide an ETag for efficient cache validation on subsequent requests.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Authorization Code Replay Attacks**\nFailing to mark authorization codes as single-use allows attackers who intercept codes to replay them for token access. Always mark codes as used immediately upon successful exchange and reject any subsequent attempts to use the same code.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: PKCE Challenge Reuse**\nStoring PKCE challenges without proper cleanup can lead to challenges being reused across multiple authorization attempts. Always bind PKCE challenges to specific authorization codes and clean them up when codes expire or are used.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Refresh Token Family Cleanup Failures**\nNot properly cleaning up revoked refresh token families can lead to database bloat and potential security issues. Implement automated cleanup processes that remove expired and revoked tokens while maintaining audit trails.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Client Credentials Scope Elevation**\nAllowing clients to request arbitrary scopes in client credentials flow bypasses the pre-authorization security model. Always validate that requested scopes are a subset of the client's registered allowed scopes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Discovery Document Staleness**\nServing outdated discovery documents can break client integrations when endpoints change. Implement proper cache invalidation and ensure discovery documents accurately reflect current provider capabilities.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Token Rotation**\nSimultaneous refresh token requests can lead to multiple valid tokens or corrupted token family state. Use atomic database operations and proper locking to ensure only one refresh operation succeeds per token.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Error Context**\nReturning generic error messages makes debugging integration issues difficult for client developers. Provide specific error descriptions that help identify the exact validation failure while avoiding information disclosure.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| HTTP Server | `net/http` with `gorilla/mux` | `gin-gonic/gin` with middleware |\n| Database Access | Direct `database/sql` with PostgreSQL | `GORM` ORM with connection pooling |\n| JWT Handling | `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` | Custom implementation with key rotation |\n| Cryptographic Operations | `crypto/rand` and `crypto/sha256` | `golang.org/x/crypto` for advanced features |\n| Configuration Management | Environment variables with `viper` | Consul or etcd for dynamic configuration |\n| Caching Layer | In-memory map with mutex | Redis with clustering |\n| Logging and Monitoring | `log/slog` structured logging | OpenTelemetry with distributed tracing |\n\n#### File Structure for Flow Orchestration\n\n```\ninternal/\n  flows/\n    authorization_code.go     ← Authorization code grant orchestration\n    refresh_token.go         ← Refresh token flow implementation\n    client_credentials.go    ← Client credentials flow\n    flow_common.go           ← Shared flow utilities\n  discovery/\n    discovery.go             ← OpenID Connect discovery endpoint\n    jwks.go                 ← JSON Web Key Set management\n  handlers/\n    oauth2_handlers.go       ← HTTP handlers for OAuth2 endpoints\n    oidc_handlers.go        ← HTTP handlers for OIDC endpoints\n  middleware/\n    cors.go                 ← CORS headers for browser clients\n    rate_limiting.go        ← Rate limiting and abuse prevention\n    request_logging.go      ← Request/response logging\n```\n\n#### Complete Authorization Code Flow Implementation\n\n```go\npackage flows\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"time\"\n    \n    \"internal/models\"\n    \"internal/services\"\n)\n\n// AuthorizationCodeFlow orchestrates the complete authorization code grant flow\ntype AuthorizationCodeFlow struct {\n    clientStore     services.ClientStore\n    authzService    *services.AuthorizationService\n    tokenGenerator  *services.JWTGenerator\n    pkceValidator   *services.PKCEValidator\n    codeStore      services.AuthorizationCodeStore\n    refreshStore   services.RefreshTokenStore\n    userStore      services.UserStore\n    consentStore   services.ConsentStore\n}\n\n// HandleAuthorizationRequest processes the initial authorization request\nfunc (f *AuthorizationCodeFlow) HandleAuthorizationRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // TODO 1: Parse and validate authorization request parameters\n    // -

Just as airport security has different checkpoints for different types of threats—document verification, metal detectors, baggage scanning—an OAuth2 provider needs different error handling layers for different types of failures. Each checkpoint has standardized procedures for handling problems: clear error codes, escalation paths, and recovery mechanisms. When something goes wrong, the system doesn't just fail silently—it provides specific, actionable feedback while maintaining security. A suspicious bag triggers a specific protocol, just as an invalid OAuth2 request triggers a standardized error response that helps the client application understand what went wrong and how to fix it.\n\nThe key insight is that error handling in OAuth2 isn't just about preventing crashes—it's about maintaining security boundaries while providing enough information for legitimate clients to succeed. Like airport security, you want to be helpful to legitimate travelers while being completely opaque to potential attackers.\n\n### OAuth2 Error Response Format\n\nOAuth2 defines a standardized error response format that ensures consistent communication between authorization servers and client applications. This standardization is crucial because client applications need to programmatically handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.\n\nThe OAuth2 error response structure follows RFC 6749 specifications and includes several required and optional fields that provide different levels of detail about the failure. The `OAuth2Error` structure encapsulates all necessary information for proper error communication:\n\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| Error | string | Yes | Standard OAuth2 error code from RFC 6749 |\n| ErrorDescription | string | No | Human-readable description providing additional context |\n| ErrorURI | string | No | URI pointing to documentation about the error |\n| State | string | No | Exact state parameter value from the original request |\n\nThe standardized error codes provide specific categories of failures that client applications can handle programmatically. Each error code represents a different class of problem with different recovery strategies:\n\n| Error Code | HTTP Status | Usage Context | Client Action |\n|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n| ErrorInvalidRequest | 400 | Missing or malformed parameters | Fix request parameters and retry |\n| ErrorInvalidClient | 401 | Client authentication failed | Check client credentials |\n| ErrorInvalidGrant | 400 | Authorization code/refresh token invalid | Restart authorization flow |\n| ErrorUnauthorizedClient | 400 | Client not authorized for grant type | Check client registration |\n| ErrorUnsupportedGrantType | 400 | Grant type not supported | Use supported grant type |\n| ErrorInvalidScope | 400 | Scope invalid or exceeds registered scopes | Request valid scopes only |\n| ErrorAccessDenied | 403 | User denied authorization request | Inform user, don't retry automatically |\n| ErrorUnsupportedResponseType | 400 | Response type not supported | Use supported response type |\n| ErrorServerError | 500 | Internal server error occurred | Retry with exponential backoff |\n| ErrorTemporarilyUnavailable | 503 | Service temporarily overloaded | Retry with exponential backoff |\n| ErrorInvalidToken | 401 | Access token invalid or expired | Refresh token or re-authenticate |\n| ErrorInsufficientScope | 403 | Token lacks required scope | Request higher scope or inform user |\n\n> **Decision: Structured Error Response Format**\n> - **Context**: OAuth2 providers must communicate errors clearly to client applications while maintaining security\n> - **Options Considered**: Custom error format, HTTP status codes only, OAuth2 standard format\n> - **Decision**: Implement OAuth2 RFC 6749 standard error format with structured JSON responses\n> - **Rationale**: Standard format ensures interoperability, provides programmatic error handling, and includes security considerations for error disclosure\n> - **Consequences**: Enables robust client error handling, maintains consistency with OAuth2 ecosystem, requires careful error message sanitization\n\nThe error response formatting process involves several critical steps to ensure both usability and security. When an error occurs, the system must determine the appropriate error code, construct a helpful but secure error description, and format the response according to OAuth2 standards.\n\nError response construction follows this algorithm:\n\n1. Identify the specific failure condition from the request processing pipeline\n2. Map the failure to the appropriate OAuth2 error code from the standard set\n3. Determine the correct HTTP status code based on the error type and context\n4. Construct a sanitized error description that helps legitimate clients without exposing sensitive information\n5. Include the original state parameter if present to maintain CSRF protection\n6. Format the response as JSON with proper Content-Type headers\n7. Log the error with full context for debugging while returning sanitized information to the client\n\nThe `WriteOAuth2Error` function centralizes error response formatting to ensure consistency across all endpoints. This function takes the HTTP response writer, appropriate status code, error code, and description, then formats them according to OAuth2 specifications.\n\n> The critical insight is that OAuth2 error responses serve dual purposes: they must provide enough information for legitimate clients to recover from transient failures, while revealing nothing useful to potential attackers probing for vulnerabilities.\n\nError response formatting includes several security considerations that protect against information disclosure attacks. Error descriptions must be carefully crafted to avoid leaking sensitive information about internal system state, registered clients, or user accounts. For example, when a client_id doesn't exist, the error response should be identical to when client authentication fails, preventing enumeration attacks.\n\n### Security Edge Cases\n\nOAuth2 providers face numerous security edge cases that require careful handling to prevent token theft, replay attacks, and other sophisticated threats. These edge cases often involve timing attacks, token reuse detection, and proper handling of cryptographic failures.\n\nToken theft represents one of the most serious security threats to OAuth2 systems. When an attacker gains access to a valid access token or refresh token, they can impersonate the legitimate client or user. The system must implement several layers of defense to detect and mitigate token theft scenarios:\n\n| Threat Type | Detection Method | Mitigation Strategy | Recovery Action |\n|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Access Token Theft | Unusual usage patterns, geo-location | Short token lifetime, scope validation | Token revocation, user notification |\n| Refresh Token Theft | Token family reuse detection | Refresh token rotation | Revoke entire token family |\n| Authorization Code Interception | PKCE verification failure | Mandatory PKCE for public clients | Reject token exchange |\n| Client Secret Compromise | Abnormal client behavior patterns | Client secret rotation | Invalidate all client tokens |\n| Replay Attack | Token reuse detection | Nonce validation, timestamp checks | Reject duplicate requests |\n\nThe refresh token rotation mechanism provides the strongest defense against token theft. When a refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens, the system issues a completely new refresh token and marks the old one as invalid. This creates a \"token family\" where each refresh operation creates a new generation of tokens linked to the previous ones.\n\nToken family tracking algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. When issuing the first refresh token, generate a unique token family identifier\n2. Store the token family ID with the refresh token record in the database\n3. When a refresh token is used, verify it belongs to a valid, active token family\n4. Generate a new refresh token with the same family ID but new token value\n5. Mark the old refresh token as used and store a reference to the new token\n6. If an old refresh token is presented again, detect potential theft and revoke the entire family\n7. Maintain family lineage until the last token in the family expires naturally\n\n> **Decision: Refresh Token Rotation with Family Tracking**\n> - **Context**: Refresh tokens are long-lived and valuable targets for attackers, requiring sophisticated theft detection\n> - **Options Considered**: Static refresh tokens, simple rotation, family-based rotation with theft detection\n> - **Decision**: Implement family-based refresh token rotation with automatic theft detection and family revocation\n> - **Rationale**: Provides strongest security against token theft while maintaining usability for legitimate clients\n> - **Consequences**: Requires complex token family management, enables automatic breach detection, may impact client implementations\n\nReplay attack prevention requires careful handling of request uniqueness and timing constraints. The system must track request identifiers and enforce appropriate time windows for token exchange operations. Authorization codes must be single-use and short-lived, while refresh token usage must be monitored for suspicious patterns.\n\nTiming attack mitigation is crucial for protecting against cryptographic side-channel attacks. Token validation, client secret verification, and other security-sensitive operations must use constant-time comparison functions to prevent timing-based information disclosure:\n\n```\nTiming Attack Mitigation Checklist:\n1. Client secret verification must use constant-time comparison (bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword)\n2. Token signature verification must not leak timing information about validity\n3. Authorization code lookup must take consistent time regardless of code validity\n4. PKCE code verifier validation must use constant-time comparison\n5. Database queries for security operations should have consistent response times\n6. Error responses must be generated in consistent time regardless of error type\n```\n\nThe system must also handle cryptographic failures gracefully without exposing information about the failure mode. When JWT signature verification fails, the error response should be identical whether the signature is invalid, the key is wrong, or the token is malformed. This prevents attackers from using error response variations to gain information about the cryptographic implementation.\n\n> Timing attacks are particularly dangerous in OAuth2 because they can be used to validate tokens, enumerate client credentials, or break PKCE protection. Every security-sensitive comparison must be implemented with constant-time algorithms.\n\n### Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention\n\nOAuth2 endpoints are attractive targets for various types of abuse including credential stuffing, token enumeration, and denial-of-service attacks. Effective rate limiting requires different strategies for different endpoints based on their usage patterns and security requirements.\n\nThe authorization endpoint faces unique challenges because legitimate users may retry authorization requests due to browser issues or user confusion. However, automated attacks against this endpoint can attempt to enumerate valid client_id values or overwhelm the consent screen infrastructure.\n\nRate limiting strategy varies by endpoint and request type:\n\n| Endpoint | Limiting Factor | Normal Rate | Burst Allowance | Abuse Threshold |\n|----------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Authorization | IP address + client_id | 10/minute | 3 burst | 100/hour |\n| Token Endpoint | Client credentials | 60/minute | 10 burst | 1000/hour |\n| Token Introspection | Client credentials | 100/minute | 20 burst | 10000/hour |\n| UserInfo | Access token | 60/minute | 10 burst | 1000/hour |\n| Client Registration | IP address | 5/hour | 2 burst | 10/day |\n| Token Revocation | Client credentials | 30/minute | 5 burst | 500/hour |\n\nThe rate limiting implementation uses a multi-layered approach with different algorithms for different scenarios. Token bucket algorithms work well for allowing burst traffic while maintaining overall rate limits, while sliding window algorithms provide more precise control over request timing.\n\nRate limiting algorithm for token endpoint requests:\n\n1. Extract the client_id from the authenticated request (after client authentication succeeds)\n2. Look up the current token bucket state for this client from the rate limiting store\n3. Calculate tokens to add based on time elapsed since last request and configured refill rate\n4. Add calculated tokens to bucket, capping at maximum bucket size (burst allowance)\n5. Check if bucket contains sufficient tokens for this request (typically 1 token)\n6. If sufficient tokens available, decrement bucket and allow request to proceed\n7. If insufficient tokens, reject request with HTTP 429 and Retry-After header\n8. Update bucket state in rate limiting store with new token count and timestamp\n\nDistributed rate limiting presents additional challenges when the OAuth2 provider runs across multiple servers. The rate limiting state must be shared across instances while maintaining high performance and avoiding race conditions.\n\n> **Decision: Redis-Based Distributed Rate Limiting**\n> - **Context**: OAuth2 provider needs consistent rate limiting across multiple server instances\n> - **Options Considered**: In-memory per-instance, database-based, Redis-based distributed\n> - **Decision**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting with Lua scripts for atomic operations\n> - **Rationale**: Provides low-latency distributed state sharing with atomic increment operations and automatic expiration\n> - **Consequences**: Adds Redis dependency, enables consistent multi-instance rate limiting, requires careful Redis failover handling\n\nAbuse detection goes beyond simple rate limiting to identify sophisticated attack patterns. The system monitors for suspicious behaviors like credential stuffing attempts, token enumeration attacks, and coordinated attacks from multiple IP addresses.\n\nSuspicious behavior detection patterns include:\n\n| Attack Pattern | Detection Signals | Response Strategy | Escalation Trigger |\n|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Credential Stuffing | High failure rate from single IP | Progressive delays, CAPTCHA | >50 failures/hour |\n| Client Enumeration | Sequential client_id probing | IP-based blocking | >20 invalid clients |\n| Token Brute Force | Rapid token validation attempts | Client rate limiting | >100 invalid tokens |\n| Distributed Attack | Coordinated requests from multiple IPs | Geographic analysis | >1000 requests/minute |\n| Account Takeover | Unusual location/device patterns | Additional authentication | Risk score >0.8 |\n\nThe system implements progressive response strategies that escalate from warnings to complete blocking based on the severity and persistence of suspicious behavior. Initial violations might trigger longer response delays or CAPTCHA challenges, while persistent abuse results in temporary or permanent IP blocking.\n\nAnomaly detection uses statistical models to identify unusual request patterns that might indicate automated attacks. The system establishes baseline behavior for each client and endpoint, then flags significant deviations for investigation.\n\n> The key insight for abuse prevention is that legitimate OAuth2 traffic has predictable patterns—clients authenticate periodically, users authorize applications occasionally, and tokens are refreshed on schedule. Attackers typically generate traffic that violates these natural patterns.\n\n### Graceful Degradation\n\nOAuth2 providers depend on various external systems including databases, cache layers, cryptographic services, and user authentication systems. When these dependencies fail, the provider must gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining security guarantees.\n\nDependency failure modes and their handling strategies require careful planning to ensure that partial failures don't compromise the security model. Some operations can continue with reduced functionality, while others must fail completely to maintain security boundaries.\n\nGraceful degradation strategies by system component:\n\n| Component | Failure Mode | Degraded Operation | Security Impact | Recovery Action |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Primary Database | Connection lost | Read-only from replica | None if replica current | Failover to replica |\n| Redis Cache | Unavailable | Direct database queries | Performance only | Cache rebuilding |\n| User Authentication | Service down | No new authorizations | Existing tokens valid | Queue auth requests |\n| Key Management | Key unavailable | Token validation fails | High - stop issuing tokens | Emergency key rotation |\n| Rate Limiting Store | Redis failure | Per-instance rate limiting | Reduced abuse protection | Restart with memory limits |\n| Audit Logging | Log system down | Continue operations | Compliance risk | Queue logs for replay |\n\nDatabase failover represents the most critical degradation scenario because OAuth2 operations require persistent state for security. The system must distinguish between read operations that can use potentially stale replica data and write operations that require consistent primary database access.\n\nDatabase degradation handling algorithm:\n\n1. Detect primary database connection failure through health check or operation timeout\n2. Evaluate current operation type—read-only (token introspection) vs. write-required (token issuance)\n3. For read operations, attempt failover to database replica with staleness checks\n4. For write operations, enter degraded mode and reject new token issuance requests\n5. Continue serving existing valid tokens through replica database or cache\n6. Monitor primary database recovery and gradually restore full functionality\n7. Perform consistency checks after primary database recovery to detect any data loss\n\nCache failure handling focuses on maintaining performance while preserving correctness. When Redis or other caching layers become unavailable, the system falls back to direct database queries but must be careful about query load.\n\n> **Decision: Fail-Safe Security Model**\n> - **Context**: System dependencies will occasionally fail, requiring graceful degradation without security compromise\n> - **Options Considered**: Continue all operations, fail completely, selective degradation based on security impact\n> - **Decision**: Implement selective degradation that maintains security properties while reducing functionality\n> - **Rationale**: Preserves security boundaries while maximizing availability for low-risk operations\n> - **Consequences**: Requires complex failure mode analysis, enables high availability, may impact user experience during outages\n\nCryptographic service failures require immediate response because they directly impact security. When key management systems become unavailable or keys are compromised, the system must stop issuing new tokens while continuing to validate existing ones until they expire naturally.\n\nCircuit breaker patterns help prevent cascading failures when external dependencies become unreliable. The system monitors dependency health and automatically stops sending requests to failing services while providing fallback responses.\n\nCircuit breaker state management:\n\n1. **Closed State**: Normal operation, all requests pass through to dependency\n2. **Open State**: Dependency failed, all requests immediately return failure response\n3. **Half-Open State**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed through to test dependency health\n4. Monitor failure rate and response times to determine when to change circuit breaker state\n5. Implement exponential backoff for recovery testing to avoid overwhelming recovering services\n6. Provide meaningful error responses that help clients understand service degradation\n\nThe system must also handle partial functionality scenarios where some OAuth2 flows work while others don't. For example, if user authentication services are down, existing access tokens continue to work, but new authorization requests must be queued or rejected.\n\n> The fundamental principle of graceful degradation in OAuth2 is that security properties must never be compromised for availability. It's better to reject requests than to issue tokens with compromised security guarantees.\n\nUser communication during degraded operation helps maintain trust and reduces support burden. The system should provide clear error messages that explain service limitations and expected recovery times when possible.\n\n![OAuth2 Error Response Handling](./diagrams/error-handling-flowchart.svg)\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Information Disclosure in Error Messages**\n\nMany implementations inadvertently leak sensitive information through overly detailed error messages. For example, responding \"client_id xyz does not exist\" vs. \"invalid client credentials\" allows attackers to enumerate valid client identifiers. The error message should be identical whether the client doesn't exist or the secret is wrong.\n\n**Fix**: Use generic error messages for authentication failures and implement detailed logging separately for debugging purposes. The `WriteOAuth2Error` function should sanitize all user-facing error descriptions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Non-Constant Time Security Operations**\n\nUsing standard string comparison for client secret validation or PKCE code verifier checking creates timing side-channels that can be exploited to extract secrets. Go's `==` operator returns immediately on the first differing byte, creating measurable timing differences.\n\n**Fix**: Always use constant-time comparison functions like `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for security-sensitive operations. For password hashing, use `bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword` which includes timing attack protection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Rate Limiting Granularity**\n\nApplying the same rate limiting rules to all endpoints or request types fails to account for different usage patterns and attack vectors. The authorization endpoint needs different limits than the token introspection endpoint.\n\n**Fix**: Implement endpoint-specific rate limiting with appropriate limiting factors (IP, client_id, user_id) based on the endpoint's function and typical usage patterns.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Improper Error Code Selection**\n\nUsing generic HTTP status codes without proper OAuth2 error codes prevents clients from implementing appropriate error handling. Returning HTTP 500 for all failures provides no actionable information.\n\n**Fix**: Map specific failure conditions to appropriate OAuth2 error codes and HTTP status codes. Implement comprehensive error classification that helps clients determine whether to retry, fix parameters, or escalate to users.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Token Family Cleanup**\n\nImplementing refresh token rotation without proper cleanup of old token families leads to database bloat and potential security issues. Old revoked tokens should be removed after they expire.\n\n**Fix**: Implement background cleanup processes that remove expired revocation entries and old token family records. Set appropriate TTL values in Redis or database to automatically clean up stale data.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Synchronous External Dependency Calls**\n\nMaking synchronous calls to external services (user authentication, audit logging) in the critical path creates failure points where external service issues directly impact OAuth2 operations.\n\n**Fix**: Use asynchronous patterns for non-critical external calls, implement circuit breakers for external dependencies, and provide meaningful fallback responses when external services are unavailable.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Rate Limiting | In-memory token bucket (sync.Map) | Redis with Lua scripts |\n| Circuit Breaker | Simple failure counter | go-kit circuit breaker |\n| Error Logging | Standard log package | Structured logging (logrus/zap) |\n| Metrics Collection | Simple counters | Prometheus metrics |\n| Distributed Tracing | Manual request IDs | OpenTelemetry tracing |\n| Cache Layer | Built-in map with cleanup | Redis cluster |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\ninternal/oauth2/\n  errors/\n    oauth2_error.go          ← OAuth2Error struct and WriteOAuth2Error\n    error_codes.go           ← Standard error code constants\n    error_handler.go         ← Centralized error handling middleware\n  ratelimit/\n    ratelimiter.go          ← Rate limiting interface and implementations\n    redis_limiter.go        ← Redis-based distributed rate limiter\n    memory_limiter.go       ← In-memory fallback rate limiter\n  security/\n    timing_safe.go          ← Constant-time comparison utilities\n    abuse_detector.go       ← Suspicious behavior detection\n    circuit_breaker.go      ← External dependency protection\n  health/\n    health_checker.go       ← Dependency health monitoring\n    graceful_shutdown.go    ← Clean shutdown handling\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n```go\n// errors/oauth2_error.go -

Just as security inspectors must verify that each layer—from perimeter fences to biometric scanners to vault locks—functions correctly both individually and as an integrated system, OAuth2 testing requires verification at multiple levels.\n\nThe perimeter inspection corresponds to **protocol compliance testing**—ensuring that your OAuth2 provider correctly implements the standardized communication protocols that all clients expect. The security system testing represents **security property testing**—verifying that cryptographic operations, token handling, and access controls actually provide the security guarantees they promise. The operational readiness testing matches **integration testing**—confirming that real OAuth2 clients can successfully interact with your provider in realistic scenarios. Finally, the checkpoint inspections align with **milestone verification**—systematic validation that each phase of construction meets its acceptance criteria before proceeding to the next layer.\n\nThis multi-layer approach is essential because OAuth2 security failures can occur at any level. A provider might implement perfect cryptography but violate the OAuth2 specification, leading to client compatibility issues. Conversely, it might handle the OAuth2 protocol correctly but contain cryptographic vulnerabilities that enable token forgery. Comprehensive testing ensures that security properties hold at every layer of the system.\n\n### Security Property Testing: Testing Cryptographic Properties and Attack Resistance\n\nSecurity property testing for an OAuth2 provider focuses on verifying that the cryptographic foundations and security mechanisms actually provide their promised protection against real-world attacks. Unlike functional testing that verifies correct behavior under normal conditions, security testing specifically probes for vulnerabilities by simulating adversarial conditions and attack scenarios.\n\n#### Cryptographic Property Verification\n\nThe foundation of OAuth2 security rests on cryptographic operations that must be tested for correctness, randomness quality, and resistance to cryptographic attacks. These tests verify that the mathematical and algorithmic security properties hold under implementation.\n\n**Token Generation Randomness Testing** verifies that authorization codes, client secrets, and refresh tokens contain sufficient entropy to resist brute force and prediction attacks. The testing approach involves generating large samples of tokens and applying statistical randomness tests to detect patterns or bias. For authorization codes, collect samples of 10,000 generated codes and apply the NIST SP 800-22 statistical test suite to verify that the randomness passes frequency tests, runs tests, and serial correlation tests. Any detectable pattern indicates a vulnerability in the random number generation that could allow attackers to predict future tokens.\n\n**JWT Signature Verification Testing** ensures that JWT access tokens cannot be forged or tampered with by attackers who lack the signing keys. Create test JWTs with various manipulations—altered payloads, modified headers, incorrect signatures—and verify that the `JWTValidator` correctly rejects all invalid tokens. Test edge cases like JWTs with valid signatures but from different keys, tokens with algorithm confusion attacks (changing \"RS256\" to \"HS256\"), and tokens with subtle payload modifications. The validator must reject every tampered token while accepting all legitimate tokens.\n\n**PKCE Security Property Testing** verifies that the Proof Key for Code Exchange mechanism actually prevents authorization code interception attacks. Generate PKCE challenges and verifiers, then test that the `PKCEValidator` correctly accepts only the matching verifier for each challenge. Test attack scenarios where an attacker intercepts an authorization code but lacks the code verifier—the token exchange must fail. Also test that slight modifications to the code verifier (single character changes, case modifications) result in validation failures.\n\n**Timing Attack Resistance Testing** ensures that cryptographic operations use constant-time comparisons to prevent timing side-channel attacks. Implement timing measurement tests for critical operations like client secret verification and token comparison. The `VerifyClientSecret` function must take the same time to reject an incorrect secret as it takes to accept a correct one. Measure execution times over thousands of iterations with both correct and incorrect inputs—any statistically significant timing difference indicates a timing attack vulnerability.\n\n| Test Category | Security Property | Test Method | Failure Indicators |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Token Randomness | Unpredictability | NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests on 10K+ samples | Patterns, bias, or predictability in token generation |\n| JWT Integrity | Tamper resistance | Signature verification with modified payloads/headers | Acceptance of tampered or forged tokens |\n| PKCE Binding | Authorization code protection | Verifier validation with intercepted codes | Code exchange without valid verifier |\n| Timing Attacks | Side-channel resistance | Statistical timing analysis of crypto operations | Timing differences revealing secret information |\n| Key Management | Key security | Private key access and rotation testing | Unauthorized key access or stale key usage |\n\n#### Attack Simulation Testing\n\nAttack simulation testing systematically attempts common OAuth2 attacks against your provider to verify that security mechanisms effectively prevent real-world threats. These tests should be automated and run regularly to catch security regressions.\n\n**Authorization Code Replay Attack Testing** simulates attackers attempting to reuse intercepted authorization codes. Generate a valid authorization code through the normal flow, then attempt to exchange it for tokens multiple times. The first exchange should succeed and return valid tokens, but subsequent attempts must fail with `ErrorInvalidGrant`. Additionally, test that codes expire after their configured timeout (typically 10 minutes) and cannot be used after expiration.\n\n**Token Theft and Misuse Testing** simulates scenarios where attackers obtain valid tokens through various means and attempt to misuse them. Test that revoked tokens immediately become unusable across all endpoints, including the UserInfo endpoint and any resource servers using your JWT validation. Test that expired tokens are rejected with proper error codes. Test that tokens issued to one client cannot be used by a different client by attempting cross-client token usage.\n\n**Refresh Token Family Attack Testing** simulates the critical refresh token theft detection mechanism. Create a refresh token family by issuing an initial refresh token and rotating it several times. Then simulate an attack by attempting to use a previously rotated (old) refresh token. The system must detect this as potential theft and revoke the entire token family, invalidating all related tokens. Verify that legitimate token rotation continues to work while detecting and preventing family replay attacks.\n\n**Client Impersonation Attack Testing** attempts various forms of OAuth2 client impersonation to verify client authentication mechanisms. Test scenarios where attackers attempt to use legitimate client IDs with incorrect secrets, stolen client credentials from one environment in another, and various client credential manipulation attacks. All unauthorized client authentication attempts must fail with `ErrorInvalidClient` without revealing information about valid client IDs.\n\n**PKCE Bypass Attack Testing** specifically targets the PKCE implementation with various bypass attempts. Test scenarios where public clients attempt to skip PKCE verification, use weak code challenges, submit incorrect code challenge methods, or attempt to replay code challenges from other authorization flows. The authorization endpoint must enforce PKCE for public clients and reject any bypass attempts.\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: Security property testing must assume an intelligent adversary who understands OAuth2 specifications and common implementation vulnerabilities. Tests should not just verify correct behavior but actively attempt to break security assumptions through edge cases and malicious inputs.\n\n#### Security Test Implementation Strategy\n\nSecurity tests require specialized infrastructure to generate attack scenarios, measure cryptographic properties, and simulate adversarial conditions. The testing framework should include utilities for token manipulation, timing measurements, and statistical analysis.\n\nCreate a dedicated security testing suite that runs independently of functional tests. This suite should include test utilities for generating malicious inputs, measuring response times with microsecond precision, and analyzing token distributions for randomness properties. The security tests should run in a dedicated testing environment that can simulate network delays, partial failures, and concurrent attack scenarios without affecting development workflows.\n\n**Test Data Generation for Security Tests** requires creating large datasets of tokens, authorization codes, and cryptographic challenges for statistical analysis. Implement generators that can produce thousands of test tokens with controlled variations for randomness testing. Create test databases with realistic client registrations, user accounts, and token histories to support attack simulation scenarios.\n\n**Security Test Metrics and Reporting** should provide clear indicators of security posture and track security properties over time. Implement metrics that measure token entropy, cryptographic operation timing consistency, and attack resistance rates. Security test failures should provide detailed forensic information about the specific vulnerability discovered, including reproducible attack scenarios and recommended remediation steps.\n\n### Protocol Compliance Testing: Validating OAuth2 and OIDC Specification Adherence\n\nProtocol compliance testing ensures that your OAuth2 provider correctly implements the standardized specifications that OAuth2 clients expect. Unlike security testing that focuses on adversarial scenarios, compliance testing verifies correct behavior according to RFC 6749 (OAuth2), RFC 7636 (PKCE), RFC 7662 (Token Introspection), RFC 7009 (Token Revocation), and the OpenID Connect Core specification.\n\n#### OAuth2 Specification Compliance Testing\n\nOAuth2 compliance testing systematically verifies that each endpoint correctly handles the request and response formats, error conditions, and behavioral requirements specified in the relevant RFCs. This testing is critical because OAuth2 clients are built to expect specific protocol behaviors, and deviations can cause integration failures or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Authorization Endpoint Compliance Testing** verifies that the authorization endpoint correctly implements the OAuth2 authorization code grant flow according to RFC 6749 Section 4.1. Test all required parameters (`response_type`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state`) and verify that missing required parameters result in proper error responses. Test the optional `state` parameter handling—when provided by the client, it must be returned unchanged in both success and error responses.\n\nThe authorization endpoint must validate redirect URIs according to exact string matching requirements. Test scenarios with legitimate redirect URIs, URIs that are subpaths or subdomains of registered URIs (which should be rejected), URIs with additional query parameters (which should be rejected), and completely invalid URIs. The endpoint must reject authorization requests with redirect URIs that don't exactly match registered values.\n\n**Token Endpoint Compliance Testing** ensures that token exchanges follow RFC 6749 Section 4.1.3 requirements precisely. Test the authorization code grant with all required parameters (`grant_type`, `code`, `redirect_uri`, `client_id`) and verify that client authentication works correctly. For confidential clients, test both HTTP Basic authentication and request body client credentials. For public clients, verify that client authentication is not required but client identification is still validated.\n\nTest refresh token grant compliance according to RFC 6749 Section 6. When processing refresh token grants, verify that the system issues new access tokens with the same or reduced scope, optionally issues new refresh tokens (implementing token rotation), and properly handles refresh token expiration and revocation.\n\n**Client Credentials Grant Compliance Testing** verifies machine-to-machine authentication according to RFC 6749 Section 4.4. Test that the client credentials grant bypasses user authorization and issues tokens directly to authenticated clients. Verify that the issued tokens have appropriate scope limitations and cannot access user-specific resources without explicit user consent.\n\n| Endpoint | RFC Requirement | Test Scenario | Expected Behavior |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Authorization | Parameter validation (RFC 6749 4.1.1) | Missing `client_id` parameter | HTTP 400 with `invalid_request` error |\n| Authorization | Redirect URI validation (RFC 6749 3.1.2) | URI substring of registered URI | Reject with error page (no redirect) |\n| Token | Authorization code validation (RFC 6749 4.1.3) | Expired authorization code | HTTP 400 with `invalid_grant` error |\n| Token | Client authentication (RFC 6749 2.3) | Invalid client credentials | HTTP 401 with `invalid_client` error |\n| Token | Refresh token grant (RFC 6749 6) | Valid refresh token exchange | New access token with same/reduced scope |\n\n#### PKCE Specification Compliance Testing\n\nPKCE compliance testing verifies implementation according to RFC 7636, which defines critical security extensions for OAuth2 authorization code flows. PKCE compliance is mandatory for public clients and should be supported for all client types.\n\n**PKCE Challenge and Verification Testing** ensures that code challenges and verifiers are handled correctly throughout the authorization flow. Test that the authorization endpoint accepts and stores code challenges with both `S256` and `plain` challenge methods, though production systems should enforce `S256` for security. When the token endpoint processes authorization code exchanges, verify that the system correctly validates code verifiers against the stored code challenge using the specified challenge method.\n\nTest PKCE parameter validation thoroughly. The `code_challenge` parameter must be a base64url-encoded string of appropriate length for the challenge method. The `code_verifier` must be a cryptographically random string between 43 and 128 characters in length. Test boundary conditions with verifiers of exactly 43 characters, exactly 128 characters, and invalid lengths outside this range.\n\n**PKCE Enforcement Policy Testing** verifies that your provider correctly enforces PKCE requirements based on client type and configuration. For public clients (mobile apps, single-page applications), PKCE should be mandatory—authorization requests without valid PKCE parameters should be rejected. For confidential clients, PKCE may be optional but should still be validated when present.\n\n#### OpenID Connect Specification Compliance Testing\n\nOpenID Connect compliance testing ensures that the identity layer built on top of OAuth2 correctly implements OIDC Core specifications. This includes ID token generation, UserInfo endpoint behavior, and discovery document format.\n\n**ID Token Generation Compliance Testing** verifies that ID tokens contain required claims and follow JWT formatting requirements. Test that ID tokens include mandatory claims (`iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `auth_time`, `nonce`) when appropriate. The `sub` claim must be locally unique and never reassigned within your provider. The `aud` claim must contain the client ID that requested the ID token. The `nonce` parameter from the authorization request must be included in the ID token if provided.\n\n**UserInfo Endpoint Compliance Testing** ensures that the UserInfo endpoint returns user profile claims according to OIDC specifications. Test that the endpoint requires valid access tokens and returns user information only for the authenticated user (identified by the `sub` claim in the access token). Verify that the returned claims match the granted scopes—requests with `profile` scope should return profile-related claims, while requests with `email` scope should return email-related claims.\n\n**Discovery Document Compliance Testing** verifies that the well-known configuration endpoint returns a valid OIDC discovery document according to OIDC Discovery specifications. Test that required fields (`issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `userinfo_endpoint`, `jwks_uri`) are present and contain correct URLs. Test that the supported grant types, response types, and scopes are accurately declared.\n\n> **Protocol Compliance Critical Point**: OAuth2 and OIDC specifications include numerous optional features and edge cases that real clients depend on. Compliance testing must cover not just the \"happy path\" scenarios but also error conditions, edge cases, and optional parameter handling that clients may rely on.\n\n#### Compliance Test Framework Implementation\n\nProtocol compliance testing requires systematic coverage of specification requirements and automated validation of request/response formats. Implement a compliance testing framework that can parse OAuth2 specifications and generate comprehensive test cases for each requirement.\n\n**Specification-Driven Test Generation** creates test cases directly from RFC requirements and OIDC specification sections. For each endpoint, enumerate all required parameters, optional parameters, and error conditions specified in the relevant standards. Generate positive test cases that verify correct behavior and negative test cases that verify proper error handling for each requirement.\n\n**Response Format Validation Testing** ensures that all endpoint responses exactly match the formats specified in OAuth2 and OIDC standards. Implement JSON schema validation for token responses, error responses, and UserInfo responses. Validate HTTP status codes, Content-Type headers, and Cache-Control headers according to specification requirements.\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints: Verification Steps for Each Implementation Milestone\n\nMilestone checkpoints provide structured verification that each phase of OAuth2 provider development meets its acceptance criteria before proceeding to the next milestone. These checkpoints combine automated testing, manual verification, and integration testing to ensure comprehensive validation of implemented functionality.\n\n#### Milestone 1 Checkpoint: Client Registration & Authorization Endpoint\n\nThe first milestone checkpoint verifies that client registration and authorization endpoint functionality works correctly with proper security properties. This checkpoint establishes the foundation for all subsequent OAuth2 flows.\n\n**Client Registration Verification** tests that the `RegistrationService` correctly creates OAuth2 clients with proper credential generation and storage. Verify that the `RegisterClient` function generates cryptographically secure client IDs and client secrets, properly hashes client secrets using bcrypt, and stores client information with correct redirect URI associations.\n\nCreate test scenarios with various client registration inputs—single redirect URI, multiple redirect URIs, different client names, and edge cases like extremely long names or URIs. Verify that the registration process validates redirect URIs for proper format and rejects obviously invalid URIs like localhost (in production configurations) or URIs with user credentials.\n\nTest the client credential verification process by attempting authentication with correct client credentials, incorrect secrets, non-existent client IDs, and various malformed credential formats. The `VerifyClientSecret` function must use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks while correctly accepting valid credentials and rejecting invalid ones.\n\n**Authorization Endpoint Verification** tests the complete authorization flow from initial redirect through user consent to authorization code generation. Start by testing parameter validation—send authorization requests with various combinations of required and optional parameters. Verify that requests with missing `client_id`, `response_type`, or `redirect_uri` parameters result in appropriate error responses.\n\nTest redirect URI validation thoroughly by sending authorization requests with redirect URIs that exactly match registered URIs (should succeed), URIs that are subpaths or subdomains of registered URIs (should fail), and URIs with additional query parameters or fragments (should fail). The authorization endpoint must implement exact string matching for redirect URI validation.\n\nVerify PKCE implementation by sending authorization requests with valid PKCE parameters (`code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method`), invalid PKCE parameters, and missing PKCE parameters for public clients. The system should store PKCE challenges correctly and enforce PKCE requirements based on client type configuration.\n\n**Authorization Code Generation Verification** tests that authorization codes are generated securely and bound to the correct parameters. Generate authorization codes through the consent flow and verify that each code is cryptographically random, unique, and properly associated with the client ID, redirect URI, and user ID. Test that authorization codes expire after the configured timeout period and cannot be reused after a successful token exchange.\n\n| Verification Step | Test Method | Success Criteria | Failure Indicators |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Client registration | API call with valid parameters | Client record created with hashed secret | Registration fails or secret stored in plaintext |\n| Redirect URI validation | Authorization request with various URIs | Only exact matches accepted | Partial matches accepted or valid URIs rejected |\n| PKCE parameter handling | Authorization request with PKCE parameters | Challenge stored and bound to authorization code | PKCE parameters ignored or incorrectly validated |\n| Authorization code binding | Token exchange with generated code | Code validates against correct client/URI | Code accepts incorrect client or redirect URI |\n\n#### Milestone 2 Checkpoint: Token Endpoint & JWT Generation\n\nThe second milestone checkpoint verifies that token generation, JWT signing, and refresh token rotation work correctly. This milestone establishes the core token-based security mechanisms for the OAuth2 provider.\n\n**Token Exchange Verification** tests that the token endpoint correctly exchanges authorization codes for access and refresh tokens. Send token exchange requests with valid authorization codes and verify that the response includes a properly formatted access token (JWT), refresh token, token type (\"Bearer\"), and expiration information. Test that the authorization code becomes invalid after successful exchange and cannot be reused.\n\nVerify client authentication during token exchange by testing with correct client credentials (both HTTP Basic and request body formats), incorrect credentials, and missing credentials for confidential clients. Public clients should be able to exchange tokens without client authentication but must still provide client identification for validation.\n\nTest PKCE verification during token exchange by providing correct code verifiers, incorrect verifiers, and missing verifiers for authorization codes that were issued with PKCE challenges. The token endpoint must validate code verifiers against stored code challenges and reject exchanges with invalid or missing verifiers.\n\n**JWT Access Token Verification** tests that generated access tokens are properly formatted JWTs with correct claims and signatures. Parse generated access tokens and verify that they contain required claims (`sub`, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `scope`) with correct values. The `sub` claim should identify the user who granted authorization, `aud` should identify the client that will use the token, and `scope` should reflect the granted permissions.\n\nTest JWT signature validation using your `JWTValidator` service. Verify that legitimate tokens are accepted and provide correct user and client identification. Test that tokens with modified payloads, invalid signatures, or expired timestamps are rejected with appropriate error codes.\n\n**Refresh Token Rotation Verification** tests that refresh token grants issue new tokens while implementing security through token family tracking. Use a refresh token to obtain new access and refresh tokens, then verify that the old refresh token becomes invalid (if implementing rotation) and the new tokens are properly formatted and functional.\n\nTest refresh token family security by attempting to reuse an old refresh token after it has been rotated. If your implementation includes token family tracking for theft detection, verify that reusing an old refresh token triggers family revocation and invalidates all related tokens.\n\n**Client Credentials Grant Verification** tests machine-to-machine authentication for confidential clients. Send client credentials grant requests with valid client credentials and verify that access tokens are issued without user involvement. Test that these tokens have appropriate scope limitations and work correctly with protected resources.\n\n#### Milestone 3 Checkpoint: Token Introspection & Revocation\n\nThe third milestone checkpoint verifies that token introspection and revocation endpoints work correctly according to RFC 7662 and RFC 7009 specifications. This milestone establishes token lifecycle management and validation capabilities.\n\n**Token Introspection Verification** tests that the introspection endpoint returns correct token metadata according to RFC 7662 format. Send introspection requests with valid access tokens and verify that the response includes `active: true` along with token metadata like `sub`, `client_id`, `exp`, and `scope`. Test with expired tokens and verify that `active: false` is returned without additional metadata.\n\nTest client authentication for the introspection endpoint by sending requests with correct client credentials, incorrect credentials, and missing authentication. The introspection endpoint should be protected and require client authentication to prevent unauthorized token validation.\n\nVerify JWT validation integration by testing introspection of JWT access tokens that have been modified, expired, or revoked. The introspection endpoint should correctly identify invalid JWTs and return `active: false` for compromised tokens.\n\n**Token Revocation Verification** tests that the revocation endpoint immediately invalidates tokens according to RFC 7009. Revoke valid access and refresh tokens, then verify that subsequent introspection requests return `active: false` and attempts to use the tokens with protected resources fail with authentication errors.\n\nTest revocation endpoint client authentication and verify that only authorized clients can revoke tokens. Test scenarios where clients attempt to revoke tokens that were issued to other clients—these requests should be rejected to prevent unauthorized token manipulation.\n\n**Token Family Revocation Verification** tests advanced security features for refresh token theft detection. If implementing token families, test that revoking a refresh token also revokes related tokens in the same family. Test that detected refresh token replay attacks trigger automatic family revocation to prevent token theft exploitation.\n\n#### Milestone 4 Checkpoint: UserInfo Endpoint & Consent Management\n\nThe fourth milestone checkpoint verifies that the UserInfo endpoint and consent management functionality work correctly according to OIDC specifications. This milestone completes the OpenID Connect identity provider implementation.\n\n**UserInfo Endpoint Verification** tests that the UserInfo endpoint returns user profile claims based on granted scopes. Send UserInfo requests with access tokens that have different scope grants (`profile`, `email`, `openid`) and verify that only appropriate claims are returned. Tokens with `profile` scope should return profile-related claims like `name` and `picture`, while tokens with `email` scope should return email-related claims like `email` and `email_verified`.\n\nTest UserInfo endpoint authentication by sending requests with valid access tokens, expired tokens, revoked tokens, and invalid tokens. Only valid access tokens should result in successful UserInfo responses with appropriate user claims.\n\n**Consent Management Verification** tests that user consent decisions are properly stored and respected in subsequent authorization requests. Grant consent for specific scopes with a particular client, then initiate new authorization requests with the same client and scopes—users should not be prompted for consent again for previously granted permissions.\n\nTest consent revocation functionality by allowing users to revoke previously granted consent, then verify that subsequent authorization requests re-prompt for consent approval. Test that partial consent revocation (revoking some but not all granted scopes) works correctly.\n\n**Scope-to-Claims Mapping Verification** tests that the `ClaimsMapper` service correctly filters user profile information based on granted scopes. Create test users with comprehensive profile information, then request UserInfo with various scope combinations and verify that only authorized claims are returned.\n\nTest edge cases like requesting scopes that weren't granted during authorization, using access tokens with reduced scopes (compared to the original authorization), and handling custom scopes that map to organization-specific user claims.\n\n| Milestone | Core Verification | Security Verification | Integration Verification |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Milestone 1 | Client registration and authorization codes | PKCE implementation and redirect URI validation | Authorization flow with test OAuth2 client |\n| Milestone 2 | JWT generation and refresh token rotation | Token binding and cryptographic signatures | Token exchange with multiple client types |\n| Milestone 3 | Introspection and revocation endpoints | Token family security and theft detection | Resource server integration with JWT validation |\n| Milestone 4 | UserInfo endpoint and consent persistence | Scope-based claims filtering | Complete OIDC flow with real identity clients |\n\n### Integration Testing: End-to-End Testing with Real OAuth2 Clients\n\nIntegration testing validates that your OAuth2 provider works correctly with real OAuth2 and OpenID Connect clients in realistic deployment scenarios. Unlike unit tests that verify individual components or compliance tests that check specification adherence, integration tests focus on end-to-end workflows and real-world compatibility.\n\n#### Real Client Integration Testing\n\nReal client integration testing uses actual OAuth2 client libraries and applications to validate that your provider works with existing OAuth2 ecosystem components. This testing catches integration issues that might not appear in isolated component tests.\n\n**OAuth2 Client Library Integration** tests your provider with popular OAuth2 client libraries in different programming languages. Set up test environments using libraries like `golang.org/x/oauth2` for Go, `requests-oauthlib` for Python, `passport-oauth2` for Node.js, and `Spring Security OAuth2` for Java. Each library may have different implementation assumptions or edge case handling that reveals compatibility issues.\n\nCreate integration test scenarios where these client libraries attempt complete OAuth2 flows against your provider. Test authorization code flows with PKCE, client credentials flows, and refresh token flows. Verify that the client libraries can parse your token responses, handle your error responses appropriately, and successfully obtain and use access tokens for protected resource access.\n\n**Single-Page Application Integration** tests your provider with JavaScript-based OAuth2 clients that run in web browsers. Deploy test single-page applications that use libraries like `oauth2-pkce` or `oidc-client-js` to perform OAuth2 flows with your provider. These clients are particularly sensitive to CORS configuration, redirect URI handling, and PKCE implementation details.\n\nTest browser-based authorization flows including popup-based authorization, redirect-based authorization, and iframe-based silent token renewal. Verify that your authorization endpoint correctly handles JavaScript origins, that your token endpoint supports appropriate CORS headers, and that generated tokens work correctly with browser-based resource access.\n\n**Mobile Application Integration** tests your provider with native mobile OAuth2 clients on iOS and Android platforms. Mobile clients have specific requirements for redirect URI handling (custom URL schemes, universal links), PKCE enforcement, and token storage security. Set up test mobile applications that implement OAuth2 flows using platform-specific OAuth2 libraries.\n\nTest mobile-specific OAuth2 patterns including custom URL scheme redirects, universal link redirects, and system browser-based authorization flows. Verify that your authorization endpoint correctly validates mobile redirect URIs and that generated tokens work appropriately with mobile application lifecycles and background/foreground transitions.\n\n**Enterprise SSO Integration** tests your provider with enterprise single sign-on solutions and identity federation systems. Many organizations use OAuth2 providers as identity sources for enterprise applications, SAML identity providers, and other federation scenarios. Test integration scenarios where your OAuth2 provider serves as an identity source for enterprise SSO systems.\n\nCreate test configurations where enterprise SSO solutions like Auth0, Okta, or Azure Active Directory can federate identity from your OAuth2 provider. Test user provisioning, attribute mapping, and session management across federated identity scenarios.\n\n#### Resource Server Integration Testing\n\nResource server integration testing verifies that APIs and services can successfully validate tokens issued by your OAuth2 provider and enforce appropriate access controls based on token content.\n\n**JWT Validation Integration** tests that resource servers can validate JWT access tokens using your public keys and JWT validation libraries. Deploy test resource servers that use JWT validation libraries like `jwt-go` for Go, `PyJWT` for Python, or `jsonwebtoken` for Node.js. These servers should fetch your public keys from your JWKS endpoint and validate incoming access tokens.\n\nTest various token validation scenarios including valid tokens (should grant access), expired tokens (should deny access), tampered tokens (should deny access), and revoked tokens (should deny access after checking revocation status). Verify that resource servers correctly extract user identity, client identity, and scope information from validated tokens.\n\n**Introspection-Based Validation Integration** tests resource servers that use token introspection for validation instead of local JWT validation. Deploy test resource servers that call your introspection endpoint to validate opaque tokens or JWT tokens. Test that these servers correctly handle introspection responses and make appropriate access control decisions based on the returned token metadata.\n\nTest introspection integration scenarios including successful validation (active tokens), failed validation (inactive tokens), and error handling (network failures, authentication errors). Resource servers should gracefully handle introspection endpoint unavailability and implement appropriate caching strategies for validation results.\n\n**Scope-Based Authorization Integration** tests that resource servers correctly enforce authorization based on token scopes. Create test APIs with different endpoints that require different scope combinations, then test access using tokens with various scope grants. Verify that tokens with insufficient scopes are rejected while tokens with appropriate scopes grant access to authorized resources.\n\nTest complex scope scenarios including hierarchical scopes (where `admin` scope grants `user` scope access), scope intersection requirements (endpoints that require multiple specific scopes), and dynamic scope evaluation (where scope requirements change based on request context).\n\n#### Load and Performance Integration Testing\n\nLoad testing validates that your OAuth2 provider maintains correct behavior and security properties under realistic traffic loads and concurrent usage patterns.\n\n**Authorization Flow Load Testing** simulates concurrent authorization flows from multiple clients and users. Generate test scenarios with hundreds of simultaneous authorization requests, consent decisions, and token exchanges. Measure response times, error rates, and system resource utilization during peak load scenarios.\n\nTest load scenarios that stress different components—concurrent client registrations, simultaneous authorization code generation, parallel token exchanges, and concurrent UserInfo requests. Verify that your provider maintains security properties (no token reuse, proper randomness) even under heavy concurrent load.\n\n**Token Validation Load Testing** simulates high-frequency token validation scenarios that resource servers typically generate. Create test scenarios with thousands of concurrent JWT validation operations, introspection requests, and revocation checks. Measure the performance impact of revocation list checks and JWKS key fetching under load.\n\nTest caching effectiveness by monitoring cache hit rates, cache invalidation performance, and memory usage during high-frequency validation scenarios. Verify that caching improves performance without compromising security properties like immediate token revocation.\n\n**Database and Storage Load Testing** validates that your provider's data storage systems can handle realistic usage patterns without compromising data consistency or security. Test concurrent client registrations, authorization code generation, token storage, and consent record management under load.\n\nMonitor database performance metrics including connection pool utilization, query performance, and lock contention during high-concurrency scenarios. Test database failure scenarios and verify that your provider handles database unavailability gracefully without compromising security or losing critical data.\n\n> **Integration Testing Critical Insight**: Real-world OAuth2 deployments face complex integration challenges including network failures, partial system outages, clock skew between systems, and varying client implementation quality. Integration testing must simulate these realistic conditions to validate production readiness.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete implementation approaches for building

Just as a doctor follows a structured approach — gathering symptoms, running diagnostic tests, reviewing past medical history, and applying proven treatments — debugging OAuth2 implementations requires methodical investigation. The \"symptoms\" are user reports and error logs, the \"diagnostic tests\" are specialized OAuth2 debugging tools and protocol analyzers, the \"medical history\" is audit trails and token lifecycle tracking, and the \"treatments\" are specific fixes for well-known OAuth2 security and implementation issues. Like medicine, OAuth2 debugging benefits from pattern recognition — experienced practitioners quickly recognize common symptom clusters and know which diagnostic approaches yield the fastest path to resolution.\n\nThe debugging process becomes particularly crucial in OAuth2 systems because security vulnerabilities often manifest as subtle behavioral anomalies rather than obvious crashes. A timing attack vulnerability might only be detectable through careful response time analysis, while a token binding flaw could allow privilege escalation without generating obvious error messages. This section establishes systematic diagnostic techniques that help developers identify both obvious functional bugs and subtle security vulnerabilities that could compromise the entire authorization system.\n\n### Common Implementation Bugs\n\nOAuth2 provider implementations exhibit predictable failure patterns that stem from the complex interaction between cryptographic operations, protocol state management, and security enforcement. Understanding these common bugs enables faster diagnosis and prevention of issues that could compromise security or break client application integrations.\n\n| Symptom | Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Fix Implementation |\n|---------|------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Authorization codes accepted multiple times | Missing single-use enforcement in code validation | Check database for `AuthorizationCode.Used` field updates | Set `Used = true` atomically during token exchange |\n| PKCE bypass allows code interception | Code verifier validation skipped or incorrect | Test with invalid code_verifier in token request | Implement proper SHA256 challenge verification |\n| Refresh token families not revoked on theft | Token reuse detection missing or incomplete | Monitor for refresh token usage after rotation | Revoke entire `TokenFamily` when old token reused |\n| Client secrets compared with timing vulnerability | Using `==` operator instead of constant-time comparison | Measure response times for correct vs incorrect secrets | Use `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for all secret validation |\n| JWT tokens accepted after explicit revocation | Revocation list not checked during validation | Test token access after calling revocation endpoint | Query `RevocationStore` during `JWTValidator.ValidateToken` |\n| Authorization codes bound to wrong redirect URI | URI validation logic flawed or missing | Submit code exchange with different redirect_uri | Store and validate `RedirectURI` in `AuthorizationCode` |\n| State parameter validation bypassed | CSRF protection implementation incomplete | Omit state parameter or use predictable values | Generate cryptographically random state, validate exact match |\n| Token endpoint accepts expired authorization codes | Expiration checking missing or incorrect | Submit token request with old authorization code | Check `AuthorizationCode.ExpiresAt` before token issuance |\n| Scope escalation in token exchange | Granted scopes exceed originally requested scopes | Request broader scopes in token exchange than authorization | Copy exact `Scope` from `AuthorizationCode` to tokens |\n| Client authentication bypassed entirely | Client credential validation missing | Submit token requests without client authentication | Validate client credentials before processing grant requests |\n| Access tokens lack proper audience validation | JWT aud claim missing or not validated | Use access token with unintended resource server | Include and validate `aud` claim in `JWTGenerator` |\n| Refresh token rotation creates orphaned tokens | Database cleanup logic incomplete | Monitor database growth after token rotations | Implement `RevokeTokenFamily` with cascade deletion |\n| UserInfo endpoint leaks unauthorized claims | Scope-to-claims filtering bypassed | Request UserInfo with limited scopes, check response | Filter claims through `ClaimsMapper.FilterClaims` |\n| Rate limiting ineffective against distributed attacks | Rate limits applied per-IP instead of per-client | Coordinate attack from multiple IP addresses | Implement composite rate limiting by client_id and IP |\n| Consent decisions not persisted correctly | `ConsentRecord` creation or retrieval logic flawed | Grant consent, refresh page, observe re-prompting | Store consent with proper `UserID` and `ClientID` binding |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming OAuth2 Errors Are Always Client Mistakes**\n\nMany developers assume that OAuth2 protocol violations always indicate client implementation errors, leading them to focus debugging efforts on client applications rather than their own provider implementation. This assumption delays resolution because the actual bug often lies in the authorization server's parameter validation, token generation, or protocol state management. For example, when clients report \"invalid_grant\" errors during code exchange, the issue might be the provider's authorization code expiration logic rather than client timing problems.\n\nThe correct debugging approach systematically validates the provider's implementation first — checking authorization code generation, storage, and validation logic — before concluding that client applications are at fault. This prevents debugging dead ends and ensures that subtle provider bugs don't get misclassified as integration issues.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overlooking Race Conditions in Token Operations**\n\nOAuth2 implementations often contain race conditions that only manifest under concurrent load, making them difficult to reproduce in development environments. Common examples include authorization codes being marked as used after validation but before token generation (allowing double redemption), refresh token rotation logic that doesn't properly handle concurrent requests from the same client, and client registration operations that can create duplicate client_id values under specific timing conditions.\n\nThese race conditions require specific testing approaches that simulate concurrent operations rather than sequential test cases. Debugging them effectively requires understanding the critical sections in token lifecycle management and implementing proper database transaction isolation to prevent state corruption.\n\n### Debugging Techniques\n\nEffective OAuth2 debugging requires specialized techniques that account for the protocol's cryptographic nature, multi-step flows, and security-sensitive operations. Standard application debugging approaches often fall short because OAuth2 bugs frequently involve subtle timing issues, cryptographic validation failures, and protocol state mismatches that don't generate obvious error messages.\n\n#### Structured Logging Strategy\n\nOAuth2 providers should implement comprehensive audit logging that captures every significant protocol operation with sufficient context for post-incident analysis. The logging strategy must balance security (avoiding credential exposure) with diagnostic utility (providing enough detail for effective debugging).\n\n| Event Type | Required Fields | Security Considerations | Retention Period |\n|------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Authorization Request | `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state` hash, `code_challenge` hash, timestamp | Never log full `state` or `code_challenge` — use SHA256 hashes | 30 days |\n| Authorization Code Generation | `client_id`, `user_id`, code hash, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, expiration time | Log code hash, never plaintext authorization code | 30 days |\n| Token Exchange Request | `client_id`, `grant_type`, code hash (for authorization code grant), `scope` | Never log `client_secret` or `code_verifier` in plaintext | 90 days |\n| Token Generation Success | `client_id`, `user_id`, `token_id` (JWT jti claim), `scope`, token type, expiration | Log JWT ID for revocation tracking, never full token | 1 year |\n| Token Validation | `token_id`, validation result, `scope` requested, client context | Include validation failure reasons for debugging | 30 days |\n| Token Revocation | `token_id`, `client_id`, revocation timestamp, reason code | Track both explicit revocations and family revocations | 1 year |\n| Consent Decisions | `user_id`, `client_id`, `scope`, grant/deny decision, timestamp | Essential for consent management debugging | 2 years |\n| Security Events | Failed authentication attempts, rate limit violations, suspicious patterns | Include IP addresses and user agents for attack analysis | 6 months |\n\n> **Design Insight**: OAuth2 audit logs serve dual purposes as debugging tools and security incident response evidence. The logging design must ensure that legitimate debugging scenarios have sufficient information while preventing credential leakage that could compromise security if logs are exposed.\n\n#### Protocol State Inspection Tools\n\nOAuth2 debugging benefits from specialized inspection tools that can decode and validate protocol state at each step of the authorization flow. These tools help identify exactly where protocol violations occur and whether they stem from client behavior or provider implementation bugs.\n\n**Authorization Code Flow State Inspection**\n\n1. **Request Parameter Validation**: Create debugging middleware that logs the complete parameter set for authorization requests, highlighting any missing required parameters, invalid parameter combinations, or security violations like missing PKCE parameters for public clients.\n\n2. **Code Generation Verification**: Implement debug endpoints (disabled in production) that can verify authorization code binding to specific clients, redirect URIs, and PKCE challenges without consuming the code for token exchange.\n\n3. **Token Exchange Parameter Tracing**: Log detailed token exchange requests showing client authentication method, grant type parameters, and the complete parameter validation sequence that led to success or failure.\n\n4. **JWT Token Inspection**: Provide debugging utilities that can decode JWT access tokens (without validating signatures) to inspect claims, expiration times, and scope grants for manual verification.\n\n**Database State Consistency Checks**\n\nOAuth2 providers maintain complex state relationships between clients, authorization codes, tokens, and consent records. Debugging often requires verifying that these relationships remain consistent and that cleanup operations properly remove expired or revoked state.\n\n| Consistency Check | Query Pattern | Expected Result | Common Inconsistencies |\n|------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Authorization Code Cleanup | Count codes where `ExpiresAt < NOW()` and `Used = false` | Should be 0 with proper cleanup | Expired codes not cleaned, blocking future requests |\n| Refresh Token Family Integrity | Verify all tokens in family have same `TokenFamily` ID | All family members consistent | Orphaned tokens with incorrect family assignments |\n| Consent Record Validity | Check consent expiration vs token issuance times | Active tokens have valid consent | Tokens issued after consent expiration |\n| Revocation List Accuracy | Cross-reference revoked `token_id` with active token usage | No active usage of revoked tokens | Revoked tokens still accepted by validation |\n| Client Registration Integrity | Verify all `AuthorizationCode` records reference existing clients | No dangling client references | Authorization codes for deleted clients |\n\n#### Cryptographic Operation Debugging\n\nOAuth2 security depends entirely on proper cryptographic operations for client authentication, PKCE verification, JWT signing, and token validation. Debugging cryptographic failures requires systematic verification of each cryptographic operation in isolation.\n\n**PKCE Challenge Verification Testing**\n\nPKCE implementation bugs are notoriously difficult to debug because the SHA256 hashing operation either works perfectly or fails completely, with little middle ground. Effective PKCE debugging requires test cases that verify the complete challenge generation and verification pipeline.\n\n1. **Code Verifier Generation Testing**: Generate multiple code verifiers and verify they meet RFC 7636 requirements for length (43-128 characters) and character set (unreserved characters only).\n\n2. **Challenge Generation Testing**: For each valid code verifier, generate the corresponding SHA256 challenge using base64url encoding and verify the result matches expected test vectors.\n\n3. **Challenge Verification Testing**: Test the complete verification pipeline with known good verifier/challenge pairs, known bad pairs, and edge cases like incorrect encoding or malformed challenges.\n\n4. **Attack Resistance Testing**: Verify that challenge verification properly rejects attempts to bypass PKCE using empty challenges, incorrect challenge methods, or malformed base64url encoding.\n\n**JWT Signature Verification Debugging**\n\nJWT signature validation failures can stem from key management issues, algorithm mismatches, or subtle encoding problems that are difficult to diagnose without systematic verification.\n\n1. **Key Material Verification**: Verify that the `KeyManager` correctly loads and provides the expected public/private key pairs for JWT signing and verification operations.\n\n2. **Algorithm Consistency Testing**: Ensure that JWT headers specify the same signing algorithm (`alg` claim) that the `JWTGenerator` actually uses for signature generation.\n\n3. **Claims Validation Testing**: Verify that required claims (`iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub`) are correctly generated and validated according to the application's security requirements.\n\n4. **Cross-Implementation Testing**: Use external JWT libraries to verify that tokens generated by the OAuth2 provider can be validated by standard JWT implementations, ensuring interoperability.\n\n### Security Issue Debugging\n\nOAuth2 security vulnerabilities often manifest as subtle behavioral anomalies that require specialized debugging techniques to identify and analyze. Unlike functional bugs that cause obvious failures, security issues may allow systems to operate normally while creating exploitable attack vectors.\n\n#### Timing Attack Detection\n\nTiming attacks exploit variations in cryptographic operation duration to extract sensitive information like client secrets or authorization codes. Detecting timing vulnerabilities requires careful measurement and statistical analysis of operation durations under different input conditions.\n\n**Constant-Time Comparison Verification**\n\nThe most critical timing attack vector in OAuth2 implementations involves client secret verification during client authentication. Debugging timing vulnerabilities requires systematic measurement of comparison operations with correct and incorrect inputs.\n\n```\nTiming Attack Detection Protocol:\n1. Measure 1000+ secret comparison operations with correct client_secret\n2. Measure 1000+ secret comparison operations with incorrect client_secret  \n3. Calculate mean response times for both groups\n4. Apply statistical significance testing (t-test) to response time distributions\n5. Flag timing differences > 10 microseconds as potential vulnerabilities\n6. Verify that bcrypt comparison provides consistent timing regardless of input correctness\n```\n\n**PKCE Verification Timing Analysis**\n\nPKCE code challenge verification can also be vulnerable to timing attacks if the SHA256 hashing and comparison operations don't use constant-time algorithms. The debugging approach systematically tests challenge verification timing across different input patterns.\n\n| Test Case | Input Pattern | Expected Timing | Vulnerability Indicator |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Correct Verifier | Valid code verifier matching stored challenge | T ± σ (consistent) | Timing variance < 5% |\n| Wrong Length Verifier | Code verifier with incorrect length | T ± σ (consistent) | Early rejection detectable by timing |\n| Wrong Content Verifier | Code verifier with correct length, wrong content | T ± σ (consistent) | Content comparison timing leak |\n| Malformed Verifier | Invalid base64url encoding in verifier | T ± σ (consistent) | Parsing error timing differences |\n| Empty Verifier | Missing code_verifier parameter | T ± σ (consistent) | Validation shortcut timing |\n\n> **Security Insight**: Timing attack detection requires statistical analysis because single timing measurements can vary significantly due to system load, garbage collection, and other environmental factors. The debugging process must collect sufficient samples to distinguish genuine timing vulnerabilities from random timing variation.\n\n#### Token Binding Verification\n\nOAuth2 security relies on proper token binding — ensuring that authorization codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens are cryptographically or logically bound to the specific client and context that should be authorized to use them. Debugging token binding issues requires systematic verification that tokens cannot be used outside their intended context.\n\n**Authorization Code Binding Tests**\n\nAuthorization codes must be bound to the specific client that initiated the authorization request and the exact redirect URI specified in that request. Debugging code binding requires testing various code interchange scenarios.\n\n1. **Cross-Client Code Exchange**: Generate authorization code for Client A, attempt to exchange it using Client B's credentials. Should fail with `invalid_grant` error.\n\n2. **Redirect URI Modification**: Generate authorization code with redirect_uri \"https://app.example.com/callback\", attempt exchange with redirect_uri \"https://app.example.com/callback/modified\". Should fail validation.\n\n3. **PKCE Challenge Binding**: Generate authorization code with PKCE challenge, attempt exchange with different code_verifier. Should fail PKCE verification.\n\n4. **Code Replay Detection**: Successfully exchange authorization code once, attempt to exchange the same code again. Should fail with single-use violation.\n\n**Refresh Token Family Tracking**\n\nRefresh token security depends on proper family tracking that can detect token theft and revoke entire token families when suspicious usage patterns are identified.\n\n| Attack Scenario | Test Implementation | Expected Behavior | Security Failure Indicator |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Token Reuse After Rotation | Use old refresh token after successful rotation | Entire family revoked | Old token still accepted |\n| Concurrent Token Usage | Submit simultaneous requests with same refresh token | One succeeds, others fail | Multiple successful responses |\n| Family Revocation Bypass | Revoke token family, attempt to use different family member | All family tokens rejected | Any family token still works |\n| Cross-Client Token Usage | Use refresh token generated for Client A with Client B | Authentication failure | Token accepted by wrong client |\n| Stolen Token Detection | Simulate attacker using intercepted refresh token | Family revocation triggered | No security response |\n\n#### Privilege Escalation Detection\n\nOAuth2 implementations can be vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks where clients obtain broader access than originally authorized through scope manipulation, token substitution, or authorization bypasses.\n\n**Scope Escalation Testing**\n\nScope escalation occurs when clients receive access tokens with broader permissions than they requested or were authorized to receive. Debugging scope escalation requires systematic testing of scope handling throughout the authorization flow.\n\n1. **Authorization Request Scope Tracking**: Record exact scope values in authorization requests and verify they are preserved unchanged through code generation and token exchange.\n\n2. **Consent Screen Scope Verification**: Verify that consent screens display only the scopes actually requested, and that user consent decisions are accurately captured and enforced.\n\n3. **Token Exchange Scope Limitation**: Ensure that access tokens contain only scopes that were present in the original authorization code, preventing scope expansion during token exchange.\n\n4. **UserInfo Endpoint Scope Enforcement**: Test that UserInfo endpoint returns claims only for scopes present in the access token, not broader scopes the client might have been authorized for in the past.\n\n**Client Privilege Verification**\n\nDifferent OAuth2 clients should have different privilege levels based on their registration parameters, grant types, and trust levels. Debugging client privilege violations requires testing cross-client authorization scenarios.\n\n| Privilege Test | Setup | Attack Vector | Expected Defense |\n|----------------|-------|---------------|------------------|\n| Public Client PKCE Bypass | Register public client without client_secret | Submit authorization without PKCE | Request rejected |\n| Confidential Client Impersonation | Register confidential client with client_secret | Submit request without secret | Authentication failure |\n| Grant Type Restriction | Register client with specific grant_types | Attempt unauthorized grant type | Grant type rejected |\n| Redirect URI Validation | Register client with specific redirect_uris | Use unauthorized redirect_uri | URI validation failure |\n| Scope Limitation | Register client with limited allowed scopes | Request broader scopes | Scope request rejected |\n\n### Performance Debugging\n\nOAuth2 providers must maintain consistent performance under varying loads while ensuring that security operations don't create performance bottlenecks that could be exploited for denial of service attacks. Performance debugging requires understanding the computational cost of cryptographic operations and identifying optimization opportunities that don't compromise security.\n\n#### Token Operation Profiling\n\nOAuth2 token operations involve expensive cryptographic computations that can become performance bottlenecks under high load. Performance debugging requires systematic profiling of each token operation to identify optimization opportunities.\n\n**JWT Generation Performance Analysis**\n\nJWT access token generation involves RSA or ECDSA signature operations that have significant computational cost. Profiling JWT generation helps identify whether signing operations are creating throughput limitations.\n\n| Operation | Typical Duration | Optimization Opportunities | Security Trade-offs |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| RSA-2048 Signature Generation | 2-5 milliseconds | Use ECDSA-256 for faster signing | Must ensure client compatibility |\n| ECDSA-256 Signature Generation | 0.5-1 millisecond | Cache key material in memory | Increases memory usage |\n| JWT Claims Serialization | 0.1-0.2 milliseconds | Pre-serialize static claims | Limits dynamic claim generation |\n| Base64url Encoding | 0.05-0.1 milliseconds | Use optimized encoding library | Minimal optimization potential |\n| Complete JWT Generation | 3-6 milliseconds | Parallel signing operations | Requires careful concurrency management |\n\n**Database Operation Performance**\n\nOAuth2 providers perform frequent database operations for client lookup, token storage, and revocation checking. Performance debugging requires identifying which database operations are causing latency spikes.\n\n1. **Client Lookup Performance**: Profile `ClientStore.GetClient` operations under various load conditions to identify slow queries or missing database indexes.\n\n2. **Authorization Code Storage**: Measure `AuthorizationCode` creation and retrieval performance, particularly focusing on cleanup operations that remove expired codes.\n\n3. **Refresh Token Management**: Profile refresh token rotation operations, which involve creating new tokens, marking old tokens as revoked, and potentially revoking entire token families.\n\n4. **Revocation List Queries**: Measure performance of `RevocationStore.IsRevoked` operations, which occur during every token validation and can become expensive without proper indexing.\n\n#### Concurrency Issue Identification\n\nOAuth2 implementations must handle concurrent requests safely while maintaining protocol correctness and security properties. Concurrency bugs often manifest as race conditions that corrupt protocol state or create security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Authorization Code Race Conditions**\n\nAuthorization codes must be single-use, but concurrent token exchange requests can create race conditions where the same code is successfully exchanged multiple times before the database can enforce single-use restrictions.\n\n```\nRace Condition Detection Test:\n1. Generate authorization code through normal authorization flow\n2. Submit 10 concurrent token exchange requests using same authorization code\n3. Verify that exactly one request succeeds with valid tokens\n4. Verify that all other requests fail with invalid_grant error\n5. Verify that authorization code is marked as Used=true in database\n6. Confirm no orphaned tokens exist from failed concurrent exchanges\n```\n\n**Refresh Token Rotation Concurrency**\n\nRefresh token rotation logic can create race conditions when the same refresh token is used concurrently, potentially causing token family corruption or allowing multiple successful token renewals.\n\n| Concurrency Scenario | Test Implementation | Expected Behavior | Race Condition Indicator |\n|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Simultaneous Refresh Requests | Submit same refresh token from multiple threads | One success, others fail | Multiple successful responses |\n| Rotation During Revocation | Rotate token while revoking family | Either rotation or revocation succeeds | Both operations succeed |\n| Family Tracking Update | Multiple tokens in family updated simultaneously | Consistent family state | Inconsistent family relationships |\n| Cleanup During Usage | Expired token cleanup during active usage | Active tokens preserved | Active tokens accidentally cleaned |\n\n**Client Registration Concurrency**\n\nClient registration operations can create race conditions if multiple registration requests attempt to create clients with the same identifiers or if cleanup operations interfere with active registration processes.\n\n1. **Client ID Generation**: Test concurrent client registration to verify that `client_id` generation produces unique values without collisions.\n\n2. **Redirect URI Validation**: Verify that redirect URI validation during registration doesn't conflict with concurrent client lookup operations.\n\n3. **Secret Hash Generation**: Ensure that bcrypt hash generation for client secrets operates correctly under concurrent load without timing vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Database Transaction Isolation**: Verify that client creation uses appropriate database transaction isolation to prevent partial registration states.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n####

registration and authorization endpoint:\n- Run: `go test ./internal/debug/... -v` to execute security and timing tests\n- Expected: All timing attack tests pass, authorization code binding tests pass\n- Manual verification: Submit authorization request with missing PKCE, should fail\n- Warning signs: Authorization codes accepted multiple times, timing differences > 10μs\n\n**Milestone 2 Debugging Checkpoint**\nAfter implementing token endpoint and JWT generation:\n- Run: `./cmd/debug/token_inspector <jwt_token>` to analyze generated tokens\n- Expected: JWT contains proper claims, signature validates, no timing vulnerabilities\n- Manual verification: Use same authorization code twice, second should fail\n- Warning signs: JWT signature verification inconsistent, refresh token reuse allowed\n\n**Milestone 3 Debugging Checkpoint**\nAfter implementing introspection and revocation:\n- Run: Revoke token, then attempt introspection - should show active=false\n- Expected: Revoked tokens consistently rejected, family revocation works\n- Manual verification: Revoke refresh token family, verify all family tokens invalidated\n- Warning signs: Revoked tokens still validate as active, family tracking broken\n\n**Milestone 4 Debugging Checkpoint**\nAfter implementing UserInfo and consent management:\n- Run: Request UserInfo with limited scopes, verify claim filtering works\n- Expected: Only authorized claims returned, consent persistence prevents re-prompting\n- Manual verification: Revoke consent, next authorization should re-prompt user\n- Warning signs: Unauthorized claims leaked, consent decisions not persisted\n\n\n## Future Extensions\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides a roadmap for extending the OAuth2/OIDC provider beyond the core implementation covered in milestones 1-4, establishing a foundation for production-ready features and enterprise integration capabilities.\n\n### Mental Model: Software Evolution Ecosystem\n\nThink of these future extensions like expanding a successful local business into a multi-location enterprise. Your OAuth2 provider starts as a focused identity service solving the core authentication and authorization problem, much like a local bank serving basic checking and savings accounts. But as your organization grows and integrates with partners, you need additional services: international transfers (federation), business credit lines (advanced security features), automated teller networks (additional grant types), and corporate reporting (operational features).\n\nEach extension builds upon the solid foundation established in the core implementation, adding specialized capabilities without disrupting the essential services that existing clients depend upon. The key insight is that these extensions follow the same architectural patterns and security principles as the core system—they're not bolted-on afterthoughts, but natural evolutions that leverage the existing infrastructure.\n\nJust as a bank's expansion into investment services still relies on the same customer identification and account management systems, OAuth2 extensions reuse the same client registration, token generation, and validation mechanisms while adding new endpoints, flows, and integration points. The mental model helps us understand that each extension should feel like a natural part of the ecosystem, not a foreign addition.\n\n### Additional Grant Types\n\nBeyond the authorization code flow and client credentials grant implemented in the core milestones, the OAuth2 ecosystem includes several specialized grant types designed for specific use cases and device capabilities. Each grant type represents a different approach to the fundamental OAuth2 challenge: how do we securely establish trust between a client application and the authorization server when the capabilities and constraints of the client environment vary significantly?\n\nThe **device authorization grant** (RFC 8628) addresses the challenge of OAuth2 authentication on input-constrained devices like smart TVs, gaming consoles, or IoT devices that lack a web browser or have limited text input capabilities. Think of this like trying to log into Netflix on your TV—you don't want to type your password with a remote control, so instead the TV displays a code that you enter on your phone or computer where typing is easier.\n\nThe device flow introduces a polling-based mechanism where the device requests a device code and user code from a device authorization endpoint, displays the user code to the user, and then polls the token endpoint while the user completes authentication on a secondary device. This requires new endpoints and state management beyond the core implementation.\n\nDevice Flow Data Structures:\n\n| Structure | Field | Type | Description |\n|-----------|-------|------|-------------|\n| `DeviceAuthorizationRequest` | ClientID | string | Identifying the device application |\n| | Scope | string | Requested permissions for device access |\n| `DeviceAuthorizationResponse` | DeviceCode | string | Server-generated code for device polling |\n| | UserCode | string | Human-readable code for user entry |\n| | VerificationURI | string | URL where user enters the user code |\n| | VerificationURIComplete | string | Optional URL with user code pre-filled |\n| | ExpiresIn | int | Lifetime of the device code in seconds |\n| | Interval | int | Minimum polling interval in seconds |\n| `DeviceTokenRequest` | GrantType | string | Must be \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code\" |\n| | DeviceCode | string | The device code from authorization response |\n| | ClientID | string | Device client identifier |\n\nThe **implicit grant** was historically used for single-page applications but is now deprecated in favor of authorization code with PKCE due to security concerns. However, understanding its mechanics helps illustrate why PKCE was necessary. The implicit flow returns access tokens directly from the authorization endpoint in the URL fragment, bypassing the token endpoint entirely. This eliminates the need for client authentication but creates security vulnerabilities around token exposure in browser history and referer headers.\n\n> **Security Insight**: The deprecation of the implicit grant demonstrates how OAuth2 security best practices evolve. What seemed like a reasonable trade-off for browser limitations in 2012 became a security liability as we better understood browser security models and as CORS enabled cross-origin requests from JavaScript.\n\n**Custom grant types** allow organizations to implement domain-specific authentication flows while maintaining OAuth2 token compatibility. Examples include integrating with legacy authentication systems, implementing step-up authentication for sensitive operations, or creating specialized flows for partner integrations. Custom grants follow the same token endpoint pattern but with organization-specific grant type identifiers and validation logic.\n\nCustom Grant Implementation Patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Use Case | Validation Requirements | Token Response |\n|---------|----------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Legacy Integration | Bridge to SAML/LDAP systems | Validate external assertion | Standard OAuth2 tokens |\n| Step-up Authentication | Additional security for sensitive ops | Verify primary token + secondary auth | Enhanced scope tokens |\n| Partner Exchange | B2B integration flows | Validate partner credentials + user consent | Audience-specific tokens |\n| Certificate-based | PKI client authentication | Validate client certificate chain | Client-bound tokens |\n\n> **Decision: Device Flow State Management**\n> - **Context**: Device flows require managing long-lived authorization requests while users complete authentication on secondary devices, creating new state tracking requirements\n> - **Options Considered**: In-memory maps, database tables with TTL, Redis with expiration\n> - **Decision**: Database table with TTL and background cleanup, similar to authorization code storage\n> - **Rationale**: Reuses existing database patterns, survives server restarts, enables horizontal scaling with shared database\n> - **Consequences**: Adds one new table but leverages existing cleanup mechanisms; polling load requires rate limiting\n\nThe device authorization endpoint introduces new security considerations around code generation and polling behavior. Device codes must be cryptographically random and sufficiently long to prevent brute force attacks, while user codes should be short and human-readable but still unpredictable. The polling mechanism requires rate limiting to prevent abuse while ensuring responsive user experience.\n\nDevice Flow Security Requirements:\n\n| Component | Security Requirement | Implementation Approach | Threat Mitigated |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Device Code | Cryptographically random, 128+ bits | Same generator as authorization codes | Code prediction attacks |\n| User Code | Short but unpredictable, 6-8 characters | Base32 encoding of random bytes | Code guessing attacks |\n| Polling Rate | Respect interval parameter | Rate limiting by client_id + device_code | Resource exhaustion attacks |\n| Code Expiration | Short-lived, 10-15 minutes | TTL in storage, background cleanup | Credential exposure |\n\n### Identity Federation\n\nIdentity federation extends the OAuth2 provider to trust and integrate with external identity sources, enabling single sign-on across organizational boundaries and reducing user friction through existing identity relationships. Think of federation like a hotel accepting multiple forms of ID—whether you present a driver's license, passport, or military ID, the hotel can verify your identity through different trusted authorities while providing the same room access.\n\n**SAML integration** allows the OAuth2 provider to accept SAML assertions from enterprise identity providers as authentication evidence, bridging the gap between SAML-based enterprise SSO systems and OAuth2-based cloud applications. This typically involves implementing a SAML assertion grant type where clients can exchange valid SAML assertions for OAuth2 tokens.\n\nSAML Integration Components:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Key Operations | Security Requirements |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| `SAMLAssertionValidator` | Validate incoming SAML assertions | Signature verification, condition checking | Trust store management, XML signature validation |\n| `SAMLGrantHandler` | Process SAML assertion grant requests | Assertion validation, user mapping | Audience restriction, time window validation |\n| `IdentityMapper` | Map SAML attributes to local user profiles | Attribute extraction, profile creation/update | Attribute validation, conflict resolution |\n| `TrustManager` | Manage trusted SAML identity providers | Certificate validation, metadata processing | Certificate chain validation, revocation checking |\n\n**Social login integration** enables users to authenticate using existing accounts from providers like Google, GitHub, or Microsoft, reducing registration friction and leveraging established identity relationships. This involves implementing OAuth2 client capabilities within your authorization server, where your provider acts as a client to upstream identity providers during user authentication.\n\nSocial Login Flow Components:\n\n| Phase | Component Action | External Provider Interaction | User Experience |\n|-------|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Discovery | Present provider options | Fetch provider metadata | Choose authentication method |\n| Upstream Authentication | Redirect to social provider | Standard OAuth2/OIDC flow | Authenticate with existing account |\n| Token Exchange | Receive upstream tokens | Validate tokens, fetch profile | Transparent to user |\n| Local Account Creation | Create or link local profile | Store identity linkage | Optional profile completion |\n\nThe social login flow creates identity linkage challenges where users may have multiple upstream identities that should map to a single local account, or where users may want to unlink social accounts while maintaining local account access. This requires careful user experience design and robust account management capabilities.\n\n> **Decision: Identity Linkage Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Users may authenticate via multiple social providers or want to link social accounts to existing local accounts\n> - **Options Considered**: Automatic email-based linking, manual account linking, separate accounts per provider\n> - **Decision**: Manual linking with email verification for automatic suggestions\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents account takeover via email compromise while providing user convenience; gives users control over identity consolidation\n> - **Consequences**: Requires additional UI for account management but provides strongest security properties\n\n**Enterprise SSO integration** extends beyond simple SAML support to include full enterprise identity workflows like just-in-time provisioning, group-based access control, and integration with enterprise directories. This often involves implementing SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) endpoints for automated user and group synchronization.\n\nEnterprise SSO Extended Features:\n\n| Feature | Purpose | Implementation Components | Business Value |\n|---------|---------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| JIT Provisioning | Automatic user creation on first login | User creation pipeline, default role assignment | Reduces admin overhead |\n| Group Synchronization | Mirror enterprise groups in OAuth provider | SCIM endpoint, group mapping rules | Enables group-based authorization |\n| Directory Integration | Real-time user status updates | LDAP connector, user deactivation workflows | Maintains security during role changes |\n| Audit Integration | Enterprise audit trail requirements | Audit event formatting, SIEM integration | Compliance and security monitoring |\n\nFederation introduces complex trust management requirements where the OAuth2 provider must maintain and validate relationships with multiple external identity sources. Each federated identity provider requires its own trust configuration, including certificate management, endpoint validation, and metadata synchronization.\n\n### Advanced Security Features\n\nModern OAuth2 deployments face sophisticated attack vectors that require security enhancements beyond the core specification. These advanced security features implement cutting-edge OAuth2 security research and industry best practices to protect against evolving threats while maintaining protocol compatibility and user experience.\n\n**Pushed Authorization Requests** (PAR, RFC 9126) addresses the security limitations of passing authorization parameters via browser redirects by requiring clients to push authorization request parameters directly to the authorization server before initiating the front-channel authorization flow. Think of PAR like submitting a loan application at the bank before meeting with a loan officer—sensitive details are communicated securely through a direct channel rather than discussed in the public lobby.\n\nPAR Implementation Architecture:\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Security Benefit | Implementation Requirements |\n|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| `PAREndpoint` | Accept and validate pushed authorization requests | Eliminates parameter tampering in authorization URL | Client authentication, parameter validation |\n| `RequestObjectStore` | Store authorization parameters with unique identifier | Prevents replay attacks through one-time use | Secure storage, TTL management |\n| `AuthorizationEndpoint` (enhanced) | Accept PAR request URIs instead of full parameters | Reduces authorization URL size and complexity | Request URI validation, parameter retrieval |\n| `ParameterValidator` | Validate authorization parameters server-side | Prevents client-side parameter manipulation | Schema validation, business rule enforcement |\n\nPAR transforms the authorization flow by introducing a preliminary step where clients authenticate and submit their authorization request parameters via a secure back-channel POST request. The authorization server validates the parameters, stores them with a unique request URI, and returns the request URI to the client. The client then initiates the normal authorization flow using only the request URI instead of embedding all parameters in the authorization URL.\n\nPAR Security Benefits:\n\n| Attack Vector | Traditional Authorization | PAR Protection | Additional Security |\n|---------------|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Parameter Tampering | Parameters visible in URL, browser history | Parameters hidden in server-side storage | Request integrity verification |\n| Authorization URL Length | Limited by browser URL length constraints | Unlimited parameter complexity support | Complex policy expression |\n| Phishing Attacks | Malicious sites can construct convincing auth URLs | Request URIs meaningless without server context | Server-side validation enforcement |\n| Traffic Analysis | Authorization parameters visible to network observers | Only opaque request URI visible | Parameter confidentiality |\n\n**Rich Authorization Requests** (RAR, RFC 9396) extends OAuth2 scopes with structured authorization request details that enable fine-grained, context-aware authorization decisions. Instead of simple scope strings like \"payments:read\", RAR allows clients to request specific permissions with detailed context like \"access account 12345 for payments between $1-$1000 during business hours\".\n\nRAR Data Structures:\n\n| Structure | Field | Type | Description |\n|-----------|-------|------|-------------|\n| `AuthorizationDetail` | Type | string | The authorization detail type identifier |\n| | Locations | []string | Resource server locations for this authorization |\n| | Actions | []string | Specific actions permitted on the resource |\n| | DataTypes | []string | Types of data that can be accessed |\n| | Privileges | map[string]interface{} | Type-specific privilege details |\n| `RichAuthorizationRequest` | AuthorizationDetails | []AuthorizationDetail | List of detailed authorization requests |\n| | Scope | string | Traditional scopes for backward compatibility |\n| `AuthorizationDetailResponse` | AuthorizationDetails | []AuthorizationDetail | Granted authorization details (may differ from requested) |\n\nRAR enables sophisticated authorization scenarios like time-bounded access, amount-limited transactions, or resource-specific permissions while maintaining backward compatibility with scope-based authorization. The authorization server can modify requested authorization details during the consent process, granting subset permissions or adding additional constraints based on policy rules.\n\n> **Decision: RAR Processing Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Rich authorization requests require complex validation, policy evaluation, and consent presentation beyond simple scope checking\n> - **Options Considered**: Inline processing in authorization endpoint, separate policy engine, rule-based configuration\n> - **Decision**: Pluggable policy engine with rule-based configuration and extensible evaluation context\n> - **Rationale**: Enables complex authorization logic without hardcoding business rules; supports compliance requirements and custom policies\n> - **Consequences**: Adds complexity to authorization endpoint but provides necessary flexibility for enterprise requirements\n\n**FAPI (Financial-grade API) compliance** implements the security requirements defined by the OpenID Foundation for financial services, including strong authentication, request object requirements, and advanced threat protection. FAPI represents the highest security standard for OAuth2 deployments and serves as a model for other high-security industries.\n\nFAPI Security Requirements:\n\n| FAPI Level | Authentication Requirement | Authorization Requirement | Token Requirement | Network Requirement |\n|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| FAPI 1.0 Baseline | Multi-factor authentication | Signed request objects | Short-lived access tokens | TLS 1.2 with perfect forward secrecy |\n| FAPI 1.0 Advanced | Certificate-bound tokens | Encrypted request objects | MTLS or token binding | TLS 1.2 with specific cipher suites |\n| FAPI 2.0 | Strong authentication | PAR + signed request objects | DPoP or MTLS | TLS 1.3 with approved cipher suites |\n\nFAPI implementation requires extensive security enhancements including request object validation, certificate-based client authentication, token binding mechanisms, and advanced threat detection. These requirements often necessitate significant architectural changes to support certificate management, cryptographic operations, and real-time security monitoring.\n\nCertificate-bound tokens (mutual TLS) create a binding between OAuth2 tokens and client certificates, ensuring that tokens can only be used by clients possessing the corresponding private key. This prevents token theft attacks even if access tokens are intercepted, as attackers cannot present the required client certificate.\n\n### Operational Features\n\nProduction OAuth2 deployments require comprehensive operational capabilities for monitoring, management, and maintenance that extend beyond the core protocol functionality. These operational features transform a functional OAuth2 implementation into a production-ready service capable of supporting enterprise-scale deployments with appropriate observability, security monitoring, and administrative capabilities.\n\n**Metrics and monitoring** provide visibility into OAuth2 provider performance, usage patterns, and security events through comprehensive instrumentation and alerting. Effective monitoring enables proactive identification of performance bottlenecks, security anomalies, and operational issues before they impact users or security posture.\n\nOAuth2 Metrics Categories:\n\n| Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Alert Conditions |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Performance | Request latency, token generation time, database query duration | Histogram metrics with percentiles | P99 latency > 500ms, error rate > 1% |\n| Usage | Requests per second, active tokens, client activity | Counter and gauge metrics | Unusual traffic spikes, dormant client patterns |\n| Security | Failed authentication attempts, token validation errors, suspicious patterns | Counter metrics with labels | Brute force patterns, token enumeration attacks |\n| Business | New client registrations, user consent decisions, scope usage | Counter and gauge metrics | Unusual consent patterns, scope escalation attempts |\n\nOAuth2-specific monitoring requires tracking token lifecycles, authorization flow completion rates, and client behavior patterns. Unlike traditional web application monitoring, OAuth2 monitoring must account for multi-step flows where failures at any stage can indicate security issues or integration problems.\n\nToken Lifecycle Monitoring:\n\n| Lifecycle Stage | Metrics | Security Indicators | Performance Indicators |\n|-----------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Authorization Request | Request rate, validation failures | Parameter tampering attempts | Consent screen load times |\n| Code Exchange | Exchange success rate, code expiration | Code replay attempts | Token generation latency |\n| Token Usage | Validation requests, scope checks | Invalid token presentations | Validation cache hit rates |\n| Token Expiration | Natural expiration vs revocation | Premature revocation patterns | Cleanup operation efficiency |\n\n**Administrative interfaces** enable OAuth2 provider operators to manage clients, monitor system health, and respond to security incidents through web-based dashboards and API endpoints. Administrative capabilities must balance operational efficiency with security controls, ensuring that administrative access follows the same security principles as the OAuth2 flows themselves.\n\nAdministrative Interface Components:\n\n| Component | Functionality | Security Requirements | User Experience Requirements |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n| `ClientManagementUI` | Create, modify, delete OAuth2 clients | Role-based access control, audit logging | Bulk operations, search and filtering |\n| `UserManagementUI` | View user profiles, consent history | User privacy controls, data minimization | Efficient user lookup, consent visualization |\n| `SecurityDashboard` | Monitor threats, investigate incidents | Real-time alerting, correlation analysis | Interactive threat timeline, drill-down capabilities |\n| `SystemHealthUI` | View metrics, configure alerts | System administration roles | Real-time dashboards, historical trending |\n\nAdministrative interfaces require careful authorization design to prevent privilege escalation while enabling efficient operations. Administrative users need different permission levels—from read-only monitoring access to full client management capabilities—and these permissions must integrate with the organization's existing identity and access management systems.\n\n> **Decision: Administrative Authentication Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Administrative interfaces need strong authentication while integrating with existing enterprise identity systems\n> - **Options Considered**: Separate admin accounts, federated SSO integration, OAuth2 self-authentication\n> - **Decision**: Federated SSO with OAuth2 self-authentication as fallback, plus mandatory MFA for admin operations\n> - **Rationale**: Leverages existing enterprise authentication while providing OAuth2 provider independence; MFA requirement addresses high-privilege access risks\n> - **Consequences**: Requires federation implementation but provides strongest security and operational integration\n\n**Audit and compliance** capabilities ensure that OAuth2 provider operations meet regulatory requirements and security standards through comprehensive logging, reporting, and data retention policies. Audit systems must capture all security-relevant events while protecting user privacy and enabling compliance demonstration.\n\nAudit Event Categories:\n\n| Event Type | Required Information | Retention Period | Compliance Standards |\n|------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Authentication Events | User ID, client ID, timestamp, outcome, IP address | 7 years | SOX, GDPR, PCI DSS |\n| Authorization Events | User consent decisions, scope grants, expiration | 7 years | Financial regulations, healthcare compliance |\n| Administrative Actions | Admin user, action type, affected resources | 10 years | Security frameworks, audit standards |\n| Security Events | Threat detection, incident response, remediation | 7 years | Incident reporting requirements |\n\nAudit logging must balance comprehensive event capture with performance and storage costs. High-volume events like token validation require sampling or aggregation strategies, while security events require complete capture with tamper-evident storage.\n\n**Backup and disaster recovery** ensure OAuth2 provider availability and data integrity through systematic backup procedures, recovery testing, and disaster response planning. OAuth2 providers contain critical security state that must be protected against data loss while enabling rapid service restoration.\n\nBackup and Recovery Components:\n\n| Component | Backup Frequency | Recovery Priority | Recovery Time Objective |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Client Registration Database | Continuous replication | Critical | < 1 hour |\n| User Profile Database | Daily backup with continuous replication | High | < 4 hours |\n| Token Revocation Lists | Real-time replication | Critical | < 15 minutes |\n| Cryptographic Keys | Secure offline backup | Critical | < 30 minutes |\n| Configuration and Secrets | Version-controlled backup | High | < 2 hours |\n\nDisaster recovery testing must validate not only data restoration but also security property preservation. Recovered OAuth2 providers must maintain the same trust relationships, cryptographic properties, and security configurations as the original deployment to prevent security gaps during recovery operations.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe implementation of future extensions requires careful architectural planning to ensure that new features integrate seamlessly with the core OAuth2 provider while maintaining security properties and operational stability. Each extension should be designed as a modular component that can be enabled or disabled based on deployment requirements.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Extension Category | Simple Implementation | Advanced Implementation |\n|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Device Flow | In-memory polling state with Redis backup | Distributed state with Kafka event streams |\n| SAML Integration | XML parsing with crypto/xml libraries | Dedicated SAML library (go-saml) with metadata management |\n| Social Login | HTTP clients with provider-specific

establishing clear terminology used throughout the OAuth2/OIDC provider implementation\n\n### Mental Model: Technical Dictionary for Authorization Systems\n\nThink of this glossary as a specialized dictionary for authorization systems, similar to how medical professionals use precise terminology to avoid confusion in high-stakes environments. Just as a doctor distinguishes between \"acute\" and \"chronic\" conditions because the treatment implications are vastly different, OAuth2 and OpenID Connect use precise terminology where subtle distinctions have significant security implications. For example, an \"authorization code\" versus an \"access token\" might sound similar to a newcomer, but they serve completely different purposes in the security model - one is a temporary voucher for obtaining credentials, while the other is the actual credential for accessing resources.\n\nThis glossary serves as your reference guide for understanding the precise meaning of terms used throughout this design document. Each definition includes not just what the term means, but why the distinction matters for implementation and security. Understanding these terms precisely is crucial because OAuth2 and OIDC are security protocols where ambiguous language can lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n### OAuth2 Core Protocol Terms\n\nThe foundational OAuth2 specification defines a specific vocabulary that must be understood precisely for secure implementation. These terms form the building blocks of all OAuth2 flows and security mechanisms.\n\n| Term | Definition | Implementation Significance |\n|------|------------|----------------------------|\n| **OAuth2** | An authorization framework enabling third-party applications to obtain limited access to user accounts without exposing user credentials. Defined in RFC 6749. | The core protocol that all our components implement. Understanding OAuth2 versus authentication protocols is crucial for security boundaries. |\n| **Authorization Server** | The server that issues access tokens after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. In our implementation, this is the complete OAuth2 provider system. | This is what we're building - the central security component that all clients trust for token issuance and validation. |\n| **Resource Server** | The server hosting protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. | External systems that will validate our JWT tokens and enforce scope-based access control. |\n| **Client Application** | An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with the resource owner's authorization. Also called \"OAuth2 client.\" | Third-party applications that register with our system and request user authorization through standardized flows. |\n| **Resource Owner** | An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an \"end-user.\" | The user who owns the data and grants permission for client applications to access it on their behalf. |\n| **Authorization Grant** | A credential representing the resource owner's authorization to access protected resources. OAuth2 defines several grant types including authorization code, client credentials, and refresh token. | The security proof that a client has been authorized to access specific resources with specific scopes. |\n| **Authorization Code** | A temporary credential that represents the resource owner's authorization, designed to be exchanged for access tokens. Short-lived and single-use. | Critical security token that must be bound to client and redirect URI, expire quickly (max 10 minutes), and be used exactly once. |\n| **Access Token** | A credential used to access protected resources. In our implementation, these are signed JWT tokens containing claims about the authorization. | The actual credential that resource servers validate. Must contain scope, expiration, and subject information for proper access control. |\n| **Refresh Token** | A credential used to obtain new access tokens without requiring resource owner re-authorization. Long-lived but revocable. | Enables long-term access while maintaining access token security through short lifetimes. Requires family tracking for theft detection. |\n\n### Token and Credential Management Terms\n\nToken lifecycle management is central to OAuth2 security. Understanding the precise meaning of token-related terms is essential for implementing secure token handling, validation, and revocation.\n\n| Term | Definition | Security Implications |\n|------|------------|----------------------|\n| **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. Consists of header, payload, and signature components separated by dots. Defined in RFC 7519. | Our access tokens are JWTs, enabling stateless validation by resource servers. Signature verification and claims validation are critical for security. |\n| **Token Introspection** | An OAuth2 extension (RFC 7662) that allows resource servers to query the authorization server about the state of an access token. | Enables real-time token validation and revocation checking for resource servers that cannot validate JWTs locally. |\n| **Token Revocation** | An OAuth2 extension (RFC 7009) that allows clients to notify the authorization server that a token should no longer be considered valid. | Critical for security incidents and user-initiated logout. Requires tracking revoked token IDs until expiration. |\n| **Client ID** | A public identifier for OAuth2 client applications, generated during client registration. Not confidential and can appear in redirect URIs. | Used to identify clients in authorization requests. Must be unpredictable to prevent client enumeration attacks. |\n| **Client Secret** | A confidential credential known only to the client and authorization server, used for client authentication. | Must be stored as bcrypt hash, never in plaintext. Required for confidential clients but not public clients (mobile/SPA). |\n| **Redirect URI** | The URI where the authorization server redirects the user after completing authorization. Must be registered during client registration. | Critical security boundary - exact string matching prevents authorization code theft through redirect manipulation. |\n| **Scope** | A parameter that defines the specific permissions being requested by the client application. Maps to specific resource access or user claims. | Determines what data access is granted. Must be validated against client's registered scopes and user consent decisions. |\n| **State Parameter** | An unguessable random string used to maintain state between authorization request and callback, providing CSRF protection. | Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks in authorization flows. Must be unpredictable and verified on callback. |\n\n### OpenID Connect Terms\n\nOpenID Connect adds an identity layer on top of OAuth2, introducing additional concepts for user authentication and profile information sharing.\n\n| Term | Definition | OIDC-Specific Purpose |\n|------|------------|----------------------|\n| **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** | An identity layer on top of OAuth2, enabling clients to verify the identity of end-users and obtain basic profile information. Defined in OpenID Connect Core 1.0. | Adds standardized user authentication and profile sharing to OAuth2's authorization framework. |\n| **ID Token** | A security token that contains claims about the authentication of an end-user by an authorization server. Always a signed JWT in OIDC. | Provides proof of user authentication to client applications. Contains authentication event information, not for API access. |\n| **UserInfo Endpoint** | An OIDC endpoint that returns claims about the authenticated end-user, protected by an OAuth2 access token. | Provides user profile information based on granted scopes. Must validate access token and filter claims appropriately. |\n| **Claims** | Pieces of information about an entity (typically the end-user). OIDC defines standard claims like `sub`, `name`, `email`, and `picture`. | User profile data returned by UserInfo endpoint. Must be filtered based on granted scopes and consent decisions. |\n| **Standard Claims** | OIDC-defined user profile fields such as `sub` (subject identifier), `name`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `email`, `picture`, etc. | Provides interoperability between OIDC providers and clients. Implementation must support core claims for compliance. |\n| **Scope to Claims Mapping** | The system that determines which user profile claims are returned based on the OAuth2 scopes granted to the client. | Critical for privacy - ensures clients only receive user data they're authorized to access based on granted scopes. |\n| **Discovery Document** | A JSON document describing the OIDC provider's configuration, available at the well-known configuration endpoint. | Enables automatic client configuration. Must accurately reflect provider capabilities and endpoint URLs. |\n| **Well-Known Configuration Endpoint** | A standardized URL (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) where OIDC providers publish their discovery document. | Provides automated discovery of provider capabilities and endpoints for OIDC clients. |\n\n### PKCE and Security Extension Terms\n\nProof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and other OAuth2 security extensions provide additional protection against various attack vectors.\n\n| Term | Definition | Security Purpose |\n|------|------------|------------------|\n| **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** | An OAuth2 security extension (RFC 7636) that provides protection against authorization code interception attacks, especially for public clients. | Essential for mobile and single-page applications. Prevents authorization code theft through dynamic client secret generation. |\n| **Code Verifier** | A cryptographically random string used as input to the PKCE challenge. Generated by the client and never transmitted directly to the authorization server. | Secret proof held by legitimate client. Must be cryptographically random and sufficiently long (43-128 characters). |\n| **Code Challenge** | A derived value from the code verifier, transmitted during authorization request. Can be plain text or SHA256 hash of verifier. | Public value that allows verification of code verifier without exposing it. SHA256 method required for security. |\n| **Code Challenge Method** | The method used to derive the code challenge from the code verifier. Either `plain` or `S256` (SHA256). | `S256` is required for security. `plain` method is deprecated and should not be accepted for public clients. |\n| **Client Type** | Classification of OAuth2 clients as either \"confidential\" (can securely store credentials) or \"public\" (cannot securely store credentials). | Determines authentication requirements. Public clients must use PKCE and cannot have client secrets. |\n| **Token Family** | A security concept where refresh tokens are grouped into families for tracking and coordinated revocation when theft is detected. | Enables detection of refresh token theft - if old token is reused, entire family can be revoked as security measure. |\n| **Token Rotation** | Security practice of issuing a new refresh token each time it's used and invalidating the old one. | Limits blast radius of token theft and enables detection of concurrent usage indicating compromise. |\n\n### Cryptographic and Security Terms\n\nOAuth2 and OIDC rely heavily on cryptographic primitives and security concepts that must be implemented correctly to maintain system security.\n\n| Term | Definition | Cryptographic Significance |\n|------|------------|---------------------------|\n| **JWT Signature Verification** | The process of validating that a JWT token was issued by the claimed authorization server and has not been tampered with. | Critical for access token security. Resource servers must verify signature before trusting token claims. |\n| **Bearer Token Authentication** | An OAuth2 token usage method where the access token is included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header. | Standard method for presenting access tokens to resource servers. Requires HTTPS to prevent token interception. |\n| **Constant-Time Comparison** | Cryptographic technique for comparing sensitive values (like tokens or secrets) in a way that doesn't leak information through timing differences. | Prevents timing attacks that could be used to guess tokens or secrets through response time analysis. |\n| **JTI Claim** | The \"JWT ID\" claim providing a unique identifier for a JWT token, used for revocation tracking and preventing token replay. | Enables efficient revocation checking and prevents token replay attacks by tracking used token IDs. |\n| **JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)** | A set of cryptographic keys published by the authorization server for verifying JWT signatures. Available at the JWKS endpoint. | Enables distributed JWT validation without sharing private keys. Resource servers fetch public keys for signature verification. |\n| **Asymmetric Cryptography** | Cryptographic system using key pairs (public/private) where tokens are signed with private key and verified with public key. | Enables stateless token validation - resource servers can verify tokens without contacting authorization server. |\n| **Token Binding** | Security technique that cryptographically or logically associates tokens with their authorized usage context (client, user, session). | Prevents token misuse by ensuring tokens can only be used in their intended context. |\n| **Entropy** | Measure of randomness or unpredictability in generated tokens, codes, and secrets. Higher entropy means harder to guess. | Critical for security - insufficient entropy in tokens/codes makes them vulnerable to brute force attacks. |\n\n### Client and Application Management Terms\n\nManaging OAuth2 clients and their lifecycle involves specific concepts for registration, authentication, and authorization.\n\n| Term | Definition | Management Purpose |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Client Registration** | The process of establishing an OAuth2 client application's identity and configuration with the authorization server. | Creates trusted relationship between client and authorization server. Generates client credentials and stores configuration. |\n| **Dynamic Client Registration** | OAuth2 extension (RFC 7591) allowing clients to register programmatically via API rather than manual administrative process. | Enables automated client onboarding but requires additional security controls to prevent abuse. |\n| **Client Authentication** | Process of verifying OAuth2 client identity using client credentials, client assertion, or other authentication methods. | Ensures token requests come from legitimate clients. Required for confidential clients, not applicable to public clients. |\n| **Grant Types** | The method by which a client obtains an access token. Common types include authorization_code, client_credentials, and refresh_token. | Determines the flow and security requirements for token issuance. Must be validated against client's registered grant types. |\n| **Response Type** | Parameter in authorization requests indicating the desired response. Typically \"code\" for authorization code flow. | Determines what the authorization endpoint returns. Must be validated against client's registered response types. |\n| **Client Credentials Grant** | OAuth2 flow where clients authenticate directly with the authorization server using their credentials to obtain access tokens for machine-to-machine access. | Enables server-to-server authentication without user involvement. No refresh tokens issued since client can re-authenticate. |\n| **Redirect URI Validation** | Security process ensuring authorization callbacks only go to pre-registered, exact-match URIs. | Prevents authorization code theft through redirect manipulation. Must use exact string matching, not pattern matching. |\n\n### Consent and User Experience Terms\n\nUser consent management and experience concepts are crucial for privacy compliance and user trust in OAuth2 systems.\n\n| Term | Definition | User Privacy Purpose |\n|------|------------|---------------------|\n| **Consent Screen** | User interface where resource owners review and approve or deny client applications' requests for access to protected resources. | Provides informed consent opportunity. Must clearly describe requested permissions and data access. |\n| **Consent Record** | Persistent storage of user authorization decisions, including granted scopes, timestamp, and revocation status. | Enables consent persistence to avoid repeated prompts and supports user consent management and revocation. |\n| **Consent Persistence** | System capability to remember user consent decisions so repeat authorization requests can skip the consent screen for previously approved scopes. | Improves user experience while maintaining security. Must respect consent expiration and revocation. |\n| **Consent Revocation** | User action to withdraw previously granted authorization, immediately invalidating associated access and making future requests require new consent. | Critical for user privacy control. Must immediately revoke associated tokens and reset consent state. |\n| **Consent Fatigue** | User frustration resulting from excessive consent prompts, leading to less careful review of authorization requests. | Design consideration for consent flows. Balance security with user experience through intelligent consent persistence. |\n| **Scope Description** | Human-readable explanation of what access each OAuth2 scope grants, displayed on consent screens. | Essential for informed consent. Must clearly explain data access implications in user-friendly language. |\n| **Claims Filtering** | Process of returning only user profile data that the granted scopes authorize, preventing over-disclosure of user information. | Privacy protection ensuring clients only receive data they're authorized to access based on user consent. |\n| **Consent Expiration** | Automatic invalidation of consent records after a specified time period, requiring fresh user authorization. | Balances user convenience with security by ensuring long-term access requires periodic reauthorization. |\n\n### Error Handling and Security Terms\n\nOAuth2 defines specific error handling patterns and security concepts that must be implemented correctly to maintain protocol compliance and security.\n\n| Term | Definition | Security Context |\n|------|------------|------------------|\n| **OAuth2 Error Response Format** | Standardized structure for communicating errors in OAuth2 flows, including error code, description, and optional error URI. | Ensures interoperability while avoiding information disclosure that could aid attackers. |\n| **Error Codes** | Standardized OAuth2 error identifiers like `invalid_request`, `invalid_client`, `invalid_grant`, `unauthorized_client`, etc. | Provides precise error communication for client handling while avoiding security-sensitive details. |\n| **Timing Attack** | Side-channel attack that uses variations in response times to infer information about secrets or internal state. | Critical concern for token validation and client authentication. Must use constant-time comparisons for security operations. |\n| **Replay Attack** | Attack attempting to reuse intercepted tokens, authorization codes, or other credentials to gain unauthorized access. | Prevented through single-use codes, token expiration, and nonce tracking. |\n| **Token Theft** | Unauthorized acquisition of valid OAuth2 tokens through interception, storage compromise, or other means. | Mitigated through short token lifetimes, refresh token rotation, and revocation capabilities. |\n| **Client Impersonation** | Attack where malicious client attempts to masquerade as legitimate client to steal authorization codes or tokens. | Prevented through client authentication, redirect URI validation, and PKCE verification. |\n| **Authorization Code Injection** | Attack where stolen authorization code is injected into legitimate client session to gain unauthorized access. | Prevented by PKCE, state parameter validation, and authorization code binding to client. |\n| **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** | Attack that tricks users into performing unintended actions on applications where they're authenticated. | Prevented in OAuth2 through state parameter validation and proper session management. |\n\n### Performance and Operational Terms\n\nProduction OAuth2 deployments require understanding of performance, monitoring, and operational concepts.\n\n| Term | Definition | Operational Purpose |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Rate Limiting** | Mechanism to control the frequency of requests to OAuth2 endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage. | Prevents brute force attacks and denial of service. Must be applied to all public endpoints with appropriate limits. |\n| **Token Validation Caching** | Performance optimization that stores JWT validation results temporarily to reduce cryptographic operations and database queries. | Improves response times for frequently validated tokens while maintaining security through appropriate cache expiration. |\n| **Revocation List** | Data structure tracking explicitly revoked tokens that haven't yet expired naturally. | Enables immediate token invalidation while avoiding storage growth through automatic cleanup of expired entries. |\n| **Circuit Breaker** | Reliability pattern that prevents cascade failures by temporarily blocking requests to failing dependencies. | Protects OAuth2 provider from external service failures while providing graceful degradation. |\n| **Graceful Degradation** | System design approach that maintains core functionality even when some components or dependencies are unavailable. | Ensures OAuth2 provider remains available for critical operations even during partial system failures. |\n| **Token Lifecycle Management** | Comprehensive approach to managing tokens from creation through expiration, including usage tracking, revocation, and cleanup. | Essential for security, compliance, and system performance in production OAuth2 deployments. |\n| **Audit Logging** | Comprehensive logging of all OAuth2 operations for security monitoring, compliance, and forensic analysis. | Required for security incident response and compliance with regulations like GDPR, SOC 2, and financial services requirements. |\n| **Metrics and Monitoring** | Observability system tracking OAuth2 provider performance, security events, and operational health. | Enables proactive incident response and capacity planning for production OAuth2 deployments. |\n\n### Advanced OAuth2 Extensions\n\nBeyond core OAuth2 and OIDC, several extensions provide additional capabilities for specialized use cases and enhanced security.\n\n| Term | Definition | Extension Purpose |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Device Authorization Grant** | OAuth2 extension (RFC 8628) enabling authorization for devices with limited input capabilities by using a separate device for user interaction. | Enables OAuth2 for smart TVs, IoT devices, and command-line tools that cannot display web interfaces. |\n| **Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)** | Security extension (RFC 9126) requiring clients to submit authorization parameters via POST request before redirecting users to authorization endpoint. | Enhances security by preventing parameter manipulation and enables larger request sizes through direct HTTP rather than URL parameters. |\n| **Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)** | Extension enabling structured, fine-grained authorization requests beyond simple scope strings. | Allows complex permission requests with specific contexts, resources, and action limitations. |\n| **Financial-grade API (FAPI)** | Security profile for OAuth2 providing enhanced protection for high-risk environments like financial services. | Adds requirements for mutual TLS, certificate-bound tokens, and additional security controls for sensitive financial data access. |\n| **Mutual TLS** | Authentication method using client certificates for strong client authentication and token binding. | Provides cryptographic client authentication and enables certificate-bound access tokens for enhanced security. |\n| **Identity Federation** | Integration pattern allowing OAuth2 provider to accept authentication from external identity providers like SAML or social login services. | Enables enterprise SSO and social login while maintaining OAuth2 interface for client applications. |\n\n### Implementation and Testing Terms\n\nSpecific concepts related to implementing and testing OAuth2 providers require precise understanding for successful development.\n\n| Term | Definition | Development Context |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Protocol Compliance Testing** | Systematic validation that OAuth2 implementation correctly follows RFC specifications and handles edge cases appropriately. | Ensures interoperability with standard OAuth2 clients and libraries. Critical for production readiness. |\n| **Security Property Testing** | Testing approach focused on verifying cryptographic properties and resistance to known attack patterns. | Validates that security mechanisms actually provide intended protection against realistic threats. |\n| **Attack Simulation** | Testing methodology that systematically attempts common OAuth2 attacks to verify security controls are effective. | Provides confidence that security measures work in practice, not just in theory. |\n| **Load Testing** | Performance testing that validates OAuth2 provider behavior under realistic traffic loads and stress conditions. | Ensures production readiness and helps identify performance bottlenecks before deployment. |\n| **Integration Testing** | Testing approach that validates OAuth2 provider functionality with real client libraries and applications. | Verifies interoperability and identifies integration issues that unit tests might miss. |\n| **Milestone Checkpoint** | Structured verification point during development that validates specific functionality is working correctly before proceeding. | Ensures incremental progress and catches issues early in development process. |\n| **Compliance Test Framework** | Automated testing infrastructure that validates OAuth2 implementation against specification requirements. | Provides ongoing assurance that code changes don't break protocol compliance. |\n\nUnderstanding these terms precisely is essential for implementing a secure, compliant, and maintainable OAuth2/OIDC provider. Each term represents concepts that have specific security, functional, or operational implications that must be understood for successful implementation.\n"}
