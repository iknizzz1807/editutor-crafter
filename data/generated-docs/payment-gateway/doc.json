{"html":"<h1 id=\"payment-gateway-integration-design-document\">Payment Gateway Integration: Design Document</h1>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>This system builds a secure payment processing gateway that handles credit card transactions, maintains PCI compliance, and ensures reliable payment state management through idempotency controls and webhook reconciliation. The key architectural challenge is maintaining data consistency across multiple external payment providers while handling the complexities of asynchronous payment flows, dispute management, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Foundation for all milestones - understanding the payment processing domain is essential before implementing payment intents (Milestone 1), payment processing (Milestone 2), refunds/disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Payment processing represents one of the most complex and regulated domains in software engineering, where the stakes of implementation errors extend far beyond typical application bugs. A failed payment can mean lost revenue, regulatory violations, or compromised customer trust. Unlike many software systems where eventual consistency and best-effort delivery are acceptable, payment systems demand strict consistency, cryptographic security, and regulatory compliance that can make or break a business.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge lies in orchestrating a distributed transaction across multiple parties - the customer&#39;s bank, the merchant&#39;s bank, payment networks like Visa or Mastercard, and various intermediary processors - while maintaining data integrity and handling the inevitable network partitions, timeouts, and edge cases that occur in real-world financial infrastructure. Each party in this ecosystem has different data models, error handling approaches, and timing requirements, yet the end customer expects a seamless experience where their payment either succeeds completely or fails cleanly with clear error messaging.</p>\n<p>Modern payment processing must also navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape including PCI DSS compliance for handling card data, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements under PSD2 in Europe, and various anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. These requirements aren&#39;t optional features that can be added later - they must be designed into the system architecture from the beginning, influencing everything from data storage patterns to API design decisions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"payment-processing-mental-model\">Payment Processing Mental Model</h3>\n<p>Think of payment processing like orchestrating a complex banking transaction that involves multiple banks, but instead of happening face-to-face with a teller who can handle unexpected situations, everything must be automated through a series of computer-to-computer messages sent over unreliable networks. In the physical world, if you write a check to pay for groceries, the cashier can immediately see if your signature matches, but they won&#39;t know if you have sufficient funds until later when the check clears through the banking system. Similarly, when a customer enters their credit card information on a website, the initial response only tells you whether the card details are valid and the issuing bank initially approves the transaction - the actual movement of money happens later through a settlement process.</p>\n<p>The <strong>payment intent</strong> concept maps to the moment when a customer decides to buy something and provides their payment information, but before any money actually moves. Think of this like signing a contract that says &quot;I intend to pay $50 for this item&quot; - it&#39;s a commitment, but not yet a completed transaction. The merchant can use this intent to reserve the item for the customer and begin preparing for shipment, but they haven&#39;t actually been paid yet. This separation between intent and execution is crucial because many things can still go wrong: the customer&#39;s bank might decline the transaction upon further review, the customer might need to complete additional authentication steps, or the merchant might discover the item is out of stock.</p>\n<p><strong>3D Secure authentication</strong> resembles the process of a bank calling you to verify a large or unusual transaction. Just as your bank might call and ask &quot;Did you really try to spend $2000 at a electronics store in another state?&quot;, 3D Secure redirects the customer to their bank&#39;s website where they must prove their identity through a password, SMS code, or biometric verification. The merchant never sees this authentication process - they just know that the customer either passed or failed the verification, similar to how a store clerk doesn&#39;t hear your conversation with the bank when they call to verify a large purchase.</p>\n<p>The <strong>webhook reconciliation</strong> process functions like the end-of-day settlement that happens in traditional banking. Throughout the day, banks keep track of all the promises to pay (authorizations) and actual fund transfers (captures), but they don&#39;t reconcile their books until later. Similarly, payment processors send webhook notifications to update merchants about status changes that happened after the initial API response. A payment might initially appear successful, but a webhook hours later might indicate it was actually declined due to fraud detection, or a pending payment might transition to completed once it fully settles through the banking networks.</p>\n<p><strong>Idempotency</strong> in payments mirrors the banking principle that you cannot accidentally deposit the same check twice. In the physical world, banks have check numbers and can detect duplicate deposits. In payment processing, idempotency keys serve the same purpose - if a customer accidentally clicks &quot;Pay Now&quot; twice due to a slow internet connection, the second request should be safely ignored rather than charging their card twice. This isn&#39;t just about preventing duplicate charges; it&#39;s about maintaining the fundamental accounting principle that every financial transaction should happen exactly once.</p>\n<p>The <strong>dispute and chargeback</strong> process resembles the consumer protection mechanisms in traditional banking. When a customer calls their bank to report an unauthorized charge or defective merchandise, the bank can forcibly reverse the transaction and require the merchant to prove the charge was legitimate. This happens outside of the normal payment flow - the merchant only learns about it when they receive a chargeback notification, similar to how a check might bounce several days after you deposited it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-payment-gateway-approaches\">Existing Payment Gateway Approaches</h3>\n<p>Payment gateway implementation involves several architectural patterns, each representing different trade-offs between security, user experience, development complexity, and regulatory compliance. Understanding these patterns is essential before choosing an implementation approach, as the decision affects everything from PCI compliance requirements to the customer checkout experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Payment Gateway Integration Pattern</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Applications need to accept payments while minimizing security risks and development complexity. Different integration patterns offer varying levels of control over the payment experience versus security and compliance burden.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Hosted payment pages (redirect model), direct API integration (server-to-server), embedded payment forms (client-side tokenization)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach using embedded forms with server-side completion for optimal balance of security and user experience</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides seamless user experience without handling raw card data, reduces PCI scope while maintaining control over checkout flow, enables advanced features like saved payment methods</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful implementation of client-side tokenization and server-side payment completion, but offers maximum flexibility for future enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Pattern</th>\n<th>Security Model</th>\n<th>PCI Compliance Scope</th>\n<th>User Experience</th>\n<th>Development Complexity</th>\n<th>Control Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hosted Payment Pages</td>\n<td>Provider handles all card data</td>\n<td>Minimal (SAQ A)</td>\n<td>Redirect disruption</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Limited customization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Direct API Integration</td>\n<td>Server handles raw card data</td>\n<td>Full compliance required (SAQ D)</td>\n<td>Seamless</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Complete control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Embedded Forms</td>\n<td>Client-side tokenization</td>\n<td>Moderate (SAQ A-EP)</td>\n<td>Seamless</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>High customization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Hosted Payment Pages</strong> represent the most secure but least flexible approach. In this pattern, the merchant&#39;s website redirects customers to the payment processor&#39;s hosted checkout page, similar to how PayPal checkout works. The customer completes their payment on the processor&#39;s domain, then returns to the merchant site with a success or failure result. This approach minimizes the merchant&#39;s PCI compliance burden since they never handle card data directly, requiring only the simplest Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ A). However, the redirect disrupts the user experience and provides limited customization options. Many customers abandon purchases during redirects, particularly on mobile devices where the transition feels jarring.</p>\n<p>The security benefit stems from the fact that sensitive card data never touches the merchant&#39;s servers or even their web pages. The payment processor bears full responsibility for securing card data, handling PCI compliance, and managing fraud detection. For small businesses or startups with limited security expertise, this approach offers the fastest time to market with minimal ongoing compliance overhead. However, the merchant sacrifices control over the checkout experience and cannot easily implement features like saved payment methods or subscription billing without additional integration work.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct API Integration</strong> provides maximum control and flexibility by allowing the merchant&#39;s server to communicate directly with the payment processor&#39;s APIs using raw card data. The customer enters their payment information on the merchant&#39;s website, which submits it directly to the merchant&#39;s server for processing. This approach enables seamless user experiences, complete customization of the payment flow, and easy implementation of advanced features like subscription billing or marketplace payments.</p>\n<p>However, direct integration comes with significant security and compliance responsibilities. The merchant must achieve full PCI DSS compliance (SAQ D), which requires extensive security controls including network segmentation, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and formal security policies. Any server that processes, stores, or transmits card data must be secured according to PCI standards, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars annually for compliance assessments and security infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The technical complexity extends beyond just API integration to include secure data handling, encryption key management, and comprehensive logging for compliance audits. Many organizations underestimate the ongoing operational burden of maintaining PCI compliance, particularly as their infrastructure evolves and scales. A single security vulnerability or compliance gap can result in fines, increased processing fees, or loss of payment processing privileges.</p>\n<p><strong>Embedded Payment Forms</strong> offer a hybrid approach that balances security with user experience through client-side tokenization. The customer enters their payment information into form fields that appear to be part of the merchant&#39;s website but are actually served from the payment processor&#39;s domain through iframe embedding or JavaScript widgets. When the customer submits the form, their card data goes directly to the payment processor, which returns a token representing the payment method. The merchant&#39;s server then uses this token to complete the payment without ever handling raw card data.</p>\n<p>This approach reduces PCI scope to SAQ A-EP, which is significantly simpler than full compliance but more involved than SAQ A. The merchant must secure their web pages that host the embedded forms and ensure they don&#39;t intercept or store card data. The user experience remains seamless since customers never leave the merchant&#39;s website, while the security model ensures sensitive data never reaches the merchant&#39;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The implementation complexity lies in properly integrating the client-side tokenization with server-side payment completion. The merchant must handle the asynchronous nature of client-side tokenization, validate that tokens correspond to actual payment intents, and implement proper error handling when tokenization fails. Additionally, advanced features like saved payment methods require careful coordination between client-side token management and server-side customer records.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: The Token Security Model</strong>\nTokenization represents a fundamental shift in payment security thinking. Instead of treating card data as something to be protected through encryption and access controls, tokenization eliminates the sensitive data entirely from the merchant&#39;s environment. The token is cryptographically useless outside the specific merchant-processor relationship, so even if it&#39;s compromised, it cannot be used to make unauthorized payments elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Security Consideration</th>\n<th>Hosted Pages</th>\n<th>Direct Integration</th>\n<th>Embedded Forms</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Card data handling</td>\n<td>Never touches merchant</td>\n<td>Raw data on servers</td>\n<td>Client-side tokenization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PCI compliance burden</td>\n<td>Minimal annual questionnaire</td>\n<td>Full compliance program</td>\n<td>Moderate questionnaire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data breach risk</td>\n<td>Limited to transaction IDs</td>\n<td>Complete card data exposure</td>\n<td>Token exposure only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraud liability</td>\n<td>Shared with processor</td>\n<td>Primary merchant responsibility</td>\n<td>Shared with processor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation timeline</td>\n<td>Days to weeks</td>\n<td>Months to years</td>\n<td>Weeks to months</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Cross-cutting Security Considerations</strong> affect all integration patterns and must be carefully evaluated regardless of the chosen approach. Transport layer security requires TLS 1.2 or higher for all payment-related communications, with proper certificate validation and HSTS implementation. Session management must prevent session fixation attacks and ensure payment tokens are properly scoped to authenticated users. Client-side security involves Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent script injection and proper CORS configuration for cross-domain API calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong> extends beyond PCI DSS to include regional requirements like Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under PSD2 in Europe, which mandates two-factor authentication for most online payments. The chosen integration pattern affects how easily these requirements can be implemented. Hosted pages typically include built-in compliance features, while direct integration requires custom implementation of authentication flows and regulatory reporting.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability and Performance</strong> characteristics vary significantly between patterns. Hosted pages eliminate payment-related load from the merchant&#39;s infrastructure but introduce dependency on the processor&#39;s availability and performance. Direct integration puts full load on the merchant&#39;s servers but provides complete control over performance optimization. Embedded forms balance these concerns by handling the most resource-intensive operations (card validation, fraud checking) on the processor&#39;s infrastructure while keeping the merchant in control of the overall checkout flow.</p>\n<p>The choice of integration pattern fundamentally shapes the rest of the payment system architecture. A system designed for hosted pages cannot easily migrate to direct integration due to the different security and compliance requirements. Similarly, a direct integration approach requires substantially different infrastructure and operational procedures compared to embedded forms. This decision should be made early in the design process with careful consideration of long-term business requirements, technical capabilities, and risk tolerance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section establishes the foundational understanding necessary for implementing a secure payment gateway.

Language-Specific Best Practices</strong></p>\n<p>For Python payment processing implementations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decimal Arithmetic</strong>: Always use <code>decimal.Decimal</code> for monetary amounts, never <code>float</code>. Floating-point arithmetic introduces rounding errors that can cause accounting discrepancies.</li>\n<li><strong>Environment Variables</strong>: Store all secrets in environment variables, never in code. Use <code>python-dotenv</code> for local development and proper secret management in production.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Transactions</strong>: Wrap all payment operations in database transactions using SQLAlchemy&#39;s session management. Payment operations must be atomic.</li>\n<li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Use Pydantic models for all API input validation. Payment systems cannot tolerate invalid data reaching business logic.</li>\n<li><strong>Error Logging</strong>: Log all payment errors with sufficient detail for debugging, but never log sensitive data like full card numbers or CVV codes.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Handling</strong>: Use UTC for all timestamps and convert to local time only for display. Payment reconciliation across time zones requires consistent time handling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>F.

Development Environment Setup</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Database Setup</strong>: Install PostgreSQL and create development database with proper encoding (UTF-8) and collation for international character support.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Environment Configuration</strong>: Create <code>.env</code> file with all required settings. Use strong, randomly generated values for secrets in development.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Dependency Management</strong>: Use <code>pip-tools</code> or <code>poetry</code> for reproducible dependency management. Payment systems require stable, auditable dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Testing Infrastructure</strong>: Configure pytest with database fixtures that create/tear down test data for each test. Payment tests must be isolated and repeatable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Linting and Formatting</strong>: Configure <code>black</code>, <code>isort</code>, and <code>flake8</code> for consistent code style. Financial code requires high readability standards.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>H. Milestone Validation Checkpoints</strong></p>\n<p>After completing each milestone, validate progress with these concrete checks:</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1 Checkpoint (Payment Intents)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create payment intent via API with valid idempotency key</li>\n<li>Attempt duplicate creation with same key - should return original intent</li>\n<li>Verify payment intent state transitions are properly validated</li>\n<li>Check database constraints prevent invalid state changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2 Checkpoint (Payment Processing)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process test payment with valid card details</li>\n<li>Trigger 3D Secure flow with test card requiring authentication</li>\n<li>Verify payment method tokenization prevents card data storage</li>\n<li>Test payment confirmation after successful authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3 Checkpoint (Refunds/Disputes)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process full refund against completed payment</li>\n<li>Process partial refund with proper amount validation</li>\n<li>Simulate chargeback notification and verify dispute creation</li>\n<li>Test refund state transitions and accounting accuracy</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4 Checkpoint (Webhooks)</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive webhook with valid signature - should process successfully</li>\n<li>Send webhook with invalid signature - should reject</li>\n<li>Test webhook idempotency with duplicate event IDs</li>\n<li>Verify state reconciliation detects and corrects discrepancies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each checkpoint should include both automated tests and manual verification steps to ensure the implementation meets production readiness standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-non-goals\">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Foundation for all milestones - clearly scoped requirements guide implementation decisions across payment intents (Milestone 1), payment processing (Milestone 2), refunds and disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Setting clear boundaries for a payment gateway implementation is like drawing a fence around a construction site. Without explicit boundaries, scope creep inevitably leads to an over-engineered system that tries to solve every conceivable payment problem. Payment processing touches on numerous complex domains—fraud detection, regulatory compliance, international banking, subscription management, marketplace settlements, and more. Each of these areas could consume months of development effort on its own. This section establishes what our payment gateway will accomplish within a reasonable implementation timeline, what quality attributes it must satisfy, and crucially, what advanced features we explicitly defer to future iterations.</p>\n<p>The mental model for goal-setting in payment systems is similar to designing a bridge. Functional goals define what the bridge carries (cars, pedestrians, weight limits). Non-functional goals specify how well it carries them (earthquake resistance, expected lifespan, maintenance requirements). Non-goals clarify what the bridge won&#39;t support (freight trains, aircraft landings, unlimited weight). Without this clarity, engineers either under-build (bridge collapses) or over-build (bridge costs 10x more than necessary and takes years longer to complete).</p>\n<p>Our payment gateway serves as the critical intermediary between merchant applications and external payment providers like Stripe, processing sensitive financial transactions that demand both functional correctness and robust operational characteristics. The scope decisions made here directly impact implementation complexity, security requirements, compliance obligations, and long-term maintainability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-goals\">Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>The functional goals define the core payment processing capabilities our system must deliver. Think of these as the fundamental promises our payment gateway makes to merchant applications that integrate with it. Each goal maps directly to one or more implementation milestones and represents functionality that must work reliably in production environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Intent Management</strong> forms the foundation of our transaction processing model. A payment intent represents a customer&#39;s commitment to pay a specific amount for goods or services, created before any money actually moves. This abstraction separates the business decision to charge a customer from the technical complexity of processing that charge, enabling better error handling and user experience flows. Our system must create payment intents with client-provided idempotency keys, preventing duplicate charges when network issues cause request retries. The payment intent tracks metadata about the transaction (order number, customer ID, product details) and progresses through a well-defined state machine from creation to completion or cancellation. Intent expiration handling automatically cancels payment intents that remain uncompleted after reasonable time periods, preventing indefinite resource consumption.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Payment Intent Operation</th>\n<th>Input Parameters</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Error Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Create Intent</td>\n<td>amount, currency, idempotency_key, metadata</td>\n<td>Returns intent ID and client secret</td>\n<td>Invalid amount/currency, duplicate key with different params</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Retrieve Intent</td>\n<td>intent_id</td>\n<td>Returns current intent state and metadata</td>\n<td>Intent not found, unauthorized access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cancel Intent</td>\n<td>intent_id</td>\n<td>Transitions to canceled state if possible</td>\n<td>Intent already processed, invalid state transition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>List Intents</td>\n<td>filters, pagination</td>\n<td>Returns matching intents with metadata</td>\n<td>Invalid filter parameters, pagination limits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Payment Processing and Authentication</strong> handles the actual movement of money from customer payment methods to merchant accounts. Our system must tokenize payment method details (credit card numbers, bank account information) to avoid storing sensitive data directly. The charge creation process submits tokenized payment information to external providers and handles both immediate responses and asynchronous processing flows. 3D Secure authentication support ensures compliance with Strong Customer Authentication requirements by redirecting customers to their card issuer for identity verification when required. Payment confirmation completes the charge process after successful authentication, updating local records and triggering downstream business processes.</p>\n<p>The key complexity here lies in handling the state transitions correctly. Unlike simple API calls, payment processing involves multiple round-trips between customer, merchant, payment provider, and card issuer. Our system must maintain consistent state throughout these interactions while gracefully handling failures at any step.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Payment Processing Stage</th>\n<th>Required Actions</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Method Tokenization</td>\n<td>Securely exchange card details for token</td>\n<td>Token stored, card details discarded</td>\n<td>Invalid card data, provider rejection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charge Creation</td>\n<td>Submit payment request to provider</td>\n<td>Charge ID returned, status tracking initiated</td>\n<td>Network failure, provider error response</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3DS Authentication</td>\n<td>Handle issuer redirect flow</td>\n<td>Customer authenticated, ready to capture</td>\n<td>Authentication declined, timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment Confirmation</td>\n<td>Complete authorized payment</td>\n<td>Money transferred, local state updated</td>\n<td>Capture failure, settlement delay</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Refund and Dispute Management</strong> provides mechanisms for reversing completed payments and handling customer-initiated chargebacks. Full refund processing returns the entire payment amount to the customer&#39;s original payment method, while partial refund support enables returning portions of the original charge (useful for partial order cancellations or shipping adjustments). Refund state tracking monitors the refund lifecycle from initiation through completion, as refunds typically take 5-10 business days to appear on customer statements. Dispute handling manages chargeback notifications received from payment networks, tracking deadlines for evidence submission and automating responses where possible. Chargeback prevention features help identify potentially disputable transactions before they become formal disputes.</p>\n<p>The accounting complexity in refund management requires careful attention to ledger integrity. Our system must track total refunded amounts against original charges to prevent over-refunding, maintain audit trails for compliance purposes, and handle the timing differences between refund initiation and actual fund return.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Refund Operation</th>\n<th>Input Requirements</th>\n<th>Processing Logic</th>\n<th>State Updates</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Full Refund</td>\n<td>charge_id, reason</td>\n<td>Validate refundable amount, submit to provider</td>\n<td>Create refund record, update charge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial Refund</td>\n<td>charge_id, amount, reason</td>\n<td>Check remaining refundable balance</td>\n<td>Track cumulative refund total</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dispute Response</td>\n<td>dispute_id, evidence</td>\n<td>Submit evidence within deadline</td>\n<td>Update dispute status, set alerts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chargeback Processing</td>\n<td>webhook_data</td>\n<td>Parse reason codes, determine response</td>\n<td>Create dispute record, notify merchant</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Webhook Processing and Event Handling</strong> maintains synchronization between our local payment state and the authoritative state held by external payment providers. Webhooks provide near-real-time notifications about payment status changes, refund completions, dispute updates, and other significant events. Our system must receive webhook payloads, verify their cryptographic signatures to prevent spoofing attacks, and update local records based on the event data. Event deduplication ensures that webhook retries don&#39;t cause duplicate processing, while event ordering handles cases where webhooks arrive out of chronological sequence.</p>\n<p>Webhook reconciliation provides a safety net against webhook delivery failures by periodically comparing local payment state against provider APIs. This background process identifies discrepancies and corrects them, ensuring our local records remain consistent with provider records even when webhooks fail silently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-functional-goals\">Non-Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>Non-functional goals define how well our payment system performs its functional duties. These quality attributes are just as critical as functional capabilities because payment processing demands high reliability, security, and performance standards. Think of non-functional goals as the operational excellence requirements that enable the system to handle real-world production workloads.</p>\n<p><strong>Security and Compliance Standards</strong> ensure our payment gateway meets industry requirements for handling sensitive financial data. PCI DSS compliance is mandatory for any system that processes, stores, or transmits payment card information. Our implementation targets <code>SAQ_A</code> compliance level by avoiding direct handling of card data, instead relying on tokenization to replace sensitive information with non-sensitive tokens. All data transmission must use <code>TLS_1_2</code> or higher encryption, and webhook signature verification prevents unauthorized parties from spoofing payment events. Access control mechanisms ensure only authenticated users can access payment information, with proper authorization checks preventing cross-customer data exposure.</p>\n<p>Secure coding practices include input validation on all API endpoints, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, and proper error handling that doesn&#39;t leak sensitive information in responses. Audit logging captures all significant payment operations for compliance reporting and security incident investigation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Security Requirement</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Validation Method</th>\n<th>Compliance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PCI DSS Compliance</td>\n<td>Tokenization, no card storage</td>\n<td>Self-assessment questionnaire</td>\n<td>Reduces compliance scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Encryption</td>\n<td>TLS 1.2+ for transport, encrypted storage</td>\n<td>Certificate validation, encryption testing</td>\n<td>Protects data in transit/rest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Access Control</td>\n<td>Authentication + authorization</td>\n<td>Security testing, access reviews</td>\n<td>Prevents unauthorized access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audit Logging</td>\n<td>Structured logs for all operations</td>\n<td>Log analysis, retention compliance</td>\n<td>Supports compliance reporting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Reliability and Error Handling</strong> characteristics ensure payment processing continues functioning correctly despite various failure scenarios. Idempotency guarantees prevent duplicate charges when clients retry requests due to network issues or timeouts. Database transaction isolation ensures payment state changes are atomic—either all related updates succeed or none do, preventing partial state corruption. Circuit breaker patterns protect against cascading failures when external payment providers experience outages. Graceful degradation allows the system to continue operating with reduced functionality rather than complete failure.</p>\n<p>Error recovery mechanisms handle both transient failures (network timeouts, temporary provider unavailability) and permanent failures (invalid payment methods, insufficient funds). Retry strategies use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming failing systems while still providing timely recovery when issues resolve.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Reliability Feature</th>\n<th>Failure Scenarios Addressed</th>\n<th>Recovery Mechanism</th>\n<th>Success Metrics</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Idempotency</td>\n<td>Network retries, client errors</td>\n<td>Unique constraint on idempotency keys</td>\n<td>Zero duplicate charges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transaction Integrity</td>\n<td>Database failures, partial updates</td>\n<td>Atomic database transactions</td>\n<td>Consistent state recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circuit Breakers</td>\n<td>Provider outages, cascading failures</td>\n<td>Automatic failover, degraded mode</td>\n<td>Maintained availability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Retry Logic</td>\n<td>Transient network/provider issues</td>\n<td>Exponential backoff with jitter</td>\n<td>Successful eventual processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong> requirements enable the system to handle realistic payment volumes with acceptable response times. Payment intent creation should complete within 200ms for 95% of requests, providing responsive user experience during checkout flows. Payment processing latency depends on external provider performance but should typically complete within 2-3 seconds for card payments not requiring 3D Secure authentication. Webhook processing must handle provider retry patterns without overwhelming the system, typically processing events within 1-2 seconds of receipt.</p>\n<p>Throughput requirements scale with merchant transaction volumes. A typical small-to-medium merchant might process 100-1000 payments per day, while larger merchants could handle 10,000+ daily transactions. Our architecture should gracefully scale from development workloads to production volumes without requiring fundamental design changes.</p>\n<p>Database performance optimization ensures payment queries remain fast as transaction history grows. Proper indexing on frequently-queried fields (payment intent ID, customer ID, creation timestamps) and archive strategies for historical data maintain query performance over time.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Metric</th>\n<th>Target Threshold</th>\n<th>Measurement Method</th>\n<th>Optimization Strategies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Intent Creation Latency</td>\n<td>200ms p95</td>\n<td>Application monitoring</td>\n<td>Database indexing, caching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment Processing Time</td>\n<td>3s p95 (non-3DS)</td>\n<td>End-to-end tracing</td>\n<td>Provider optimization, parallelization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Webhook Processing</td>\n<td>2s p95</td>\n<td>Queue monitoring</td>\n<td>Background job processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Throughput</td>\n<td>1000+ payments/day</td>\n<td>Load testing</td>\n<td>Horizontal scaling, async processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Monitoring and Observability</strong> capabilities provide visibility into system health, performance trends, and business metrics. Application metrics track key performance indicators like payment success rates, average processing times, and error frequencies. Payment-specific dashboards display business-critical information such as daily transaction volumes, refund rates, and dispute trends. Alert systems notify operations teams about system degradation, unusual error patterns, or compliance-related issues.</p>\n<p>Structured logging captures detailed information about each payment operation, enabling debugging of specific transaction issues and forensic analysis when problems occur. Distributed tracing follows payment requests across multiple system components and external provider calls, helping identify performance bottlenecks and failure points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Explicitly documenting what our payment gateway will NOT implement is crucial for maintaining reasonable scope and preventing feature creep. These non-goals represent important payment-related functionality that we consciously defer to future development phases or external systems. Think of non-goals as the features that would be nice to have but would significantly increase implementation complexity beyond the core learning objectives.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Fraud Detection and Risk Management</strong> represents a sophisticated domain that could easily consume months of development effort. While basic validation (amount limits, currency checks) falls within our scope, we explicitly exclude machine learning-based fraud scoring, velocity checks across customer behaviors, device fingerprinting, and advanced risk assessment algorithms. Payment providers typically offer fraud protection services that merchants can enable, reducing the need for custom fraud detection in many scenarios.</p>\n<p>Real-world fraud detection requires extensive historical data, complex rule engines, and specialized expertise in payment fraud patterns. Building effective fraud prevention is a full-time specialty that extends far beyond basic payment processing implementation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Fraud Detection Feature</th>\n<th>Complexity Level</th>\n<th>Why Excluded</th>\n<th>Alternative Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ML Fraud Scoring</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>Requires data science expertise, training data</td>\n<td>Use provider fraud tools</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Velocity Checking</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Complex rules, customer behavior tracking</td>\n<td>Implement basic rate limiting only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device Fingerprinting</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Browser/device analysis, privacy concerns</td>\n<td>Rely on provider capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Risk Assessment Rules</td>\n<td>Medium-High</td>\n<td>Domain expertise, extensive configuration</td>\n<td>Use provider risk management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Multi-Currency and International Support</strong> adds significant complexity around exchange rates, local payment methods, regulatory compliance, and tax calculation. While our system supports specifying currency codes for payments, we don&#39;t implement currency conversion, localized payment methods (SEPA, Alipay, etc.), country-specific compliance requirements, or multi-currency settlement. International payment processing involves understanding banking regulations, tax obligations, and business practices across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Supporting international payments properly requires partnerships with local payment providers, understanding of regional customer preferences, and compliance with diverse regulatory frameworks. This expansion would multiply the complexity of every system component.</p>\n<p><strong>Subscription and Recurring Billing</strong> involves complex business logic around billing cycles, proration calculations, dunning management for failed payments, and subscription lifecycle management. While our payment processing engine could theoretically handle recurring charges, we exclude the subscription management layer that would coordinate billing schedules, handle plan changes, manage customer communication for billing issues, and integrate with business systems for usage-based billing.</p>\n<p>Subscription billing is essentially a complete business application built on top of payment processing primitives. The complexity lies not in charging cards repeatedly, but in managing all the business rules, customer communication, and operational processes around subscription relationships.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Subscription Feature</th>\n<th>Business Complexity</th>\n<th>Technical Complexity</th>\n<th>External Dependencies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Billing Cycles</td>\n<td>High - multiple cycle types, proration</td>\n<td>Medium - scheduling, date math</td>\n<td>Calendar systems, time zones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dunning Management</td>\n<td>High - customer communication, retry logic</td>\n<td>Medium - workflow automation</td>\n<td>Email systems, notification services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plan Management</td>\n<td>Very High - pricing rules, feature gates</td>\n<td>High - configuration management</td>\n<td>Product catalog, entitlement systems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Usage Billing</td>\n<td>Very High - metering, rating, aggregation</td>\n<td>Very High - data processing pipelines</td>\n<td>Usage tracking, analytics systems</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Marketplace and Multi-Party Payments</strong> enable platforms to facilitate payments between multiple parties with split settlements, escrow functionality, and complex fee structures. While conceptually similar to basic payment processing, marketplace payments require additional legal frameworks, compliance considerations, and business logic around fund holding, dispute resolution between multiple parties, and tax reporting for platform transactions.</p>\n<p>The regulatory complexity of marketplace payments varies significantly by jurisdiction, often requiring money transmitter licenses and additional compliance obligations beyond basic payment processing.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Reporting and Analytics</strong> beyond basic transaction reporting falls outside our scope. We exclude comprehensive business intelligence dashboards, predictive analytics, customer behavior analysis, and advanced financial reporting. While our system maintains audit logs and basic transaction history, we don&#39;t build sophisticated reporting tools, data warehousing capabilities, or integration with business intelligence platforms.</p>\n<p>Payment analytics can become extremely sophisticated, involving customer segmentation, cohort analysis, revenue forecasting, and integration with broader business metrics. This represents a separate application domain that consumes payment data rather than processing payments directly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle: Focused Scope</strong></p>\n<p>By explicitly limiting scope to core payment processing functionality, we can implement a robust, well-tested payment gateway within reasonable time constraints. Each excluded feature could easily double the implementation effort and introduce additional failure modes, external dependencies, and compliance requirements. The goal is building a solid foundation that supports future extensions rather than attempting to solve every payment-related problem immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Legacy System Integration</strong> with existing merchant systems, ERP platforms, accounting software, and custom business applications requires extensive configuration, data transformation, and workflow coordination capabilities. While our payment gateway provides standard REST APIs that can integrate with various systems, we don&#39;t build custom connectors, data synchronization tools, or workflow orchestration engines for specific business systems.</p>\n<p>Integration complexity grows exponentially with the number and diversity of systems involved. Each integration often requires understanding the target system&#39;s data model, business processes, and technical constraints—work that typically requires business analysis and custom development for each merchant.</p>\n<p><strong>Compliance Beyond PCI DSS</strong> such as SOX financial reporting, GDPR data protection, industry-specific regulations (healthcare, government), and regional payment regulations represents additional complexity that extends beyond basic payment processing. While our system design considers privacy and security principles, we don&#39;t implement comprehensive compliance frameworks for specialized industries or jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Different compliance requirements often conflict with each other or require extensive documentation, testing, and audit procedures that significantly impact development timelines and system complexity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>Building a payment gateway with clear scope boundaries requires establishing development practices that resist feature creep while ensuring core functionality meets production quality standards.

Just as an airport has distinct terminals (domestic, international, cargo), specialized staff (air traffic control, security, customs), and coordination systems (flight tracking, baggage handling), our payment gateway orchestrates multiple specialized components that must work in perfect harmony to move money safely from customers to merchants.</p>\n<p>The architectural challenge mirrors managing a complex transportation hub: we must handle high-volume traffic (thousands of payments per minute), maintain strict security protocols (PCI compliance), coordinate with external systems (payment providers, banks), and ensure nothing gets lost in transit (payment reconciliation). Each component has specialized responsibilities, but they must communicate seamlessly to deliver a unified payment experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview\">Component Overview</h3>\n<p>Our payment gateway architecture divides responsibilities among five core components, each designed with a specific purpose in the overall payment processing ecosystem. This separation follows the principle of single responsibility while enabling loose coupling between components for maintainability and scalability.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Intent Manager</strong> serves as the initial point of contact for all payment requests, functioning like a reservation system at a restaurant. When a customer decides to make a purchase, this component creates a payment intent - essentially a commitment that payment will be attempted with specific terms (amount, currency, metadata). The manager handles idempotency key validation to prevent duplicate charges, manages the payment intent lifecycle through various states, and provides the foundation for all subsequent payment operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Processing Engine</strong> acts as the core transaction processor, similar to how a bank&#39;s wire transfer department handles actual money movement. This component takes validated payment intents and orchestrates the complex process of charging payment methods through external providers. It manages payment method tokenization for security, implements 3D Secure authentication flows for regulatory compliance, and handles the intricate dance of authorization and capture that defines modern payment processing.</p>\n<p><strong>Refund and Dispute Handler</strong> manages the post-payment lifecycle, functioning like a customer service department with the authority to reverse transactions. This component processes both merchant-initiated refunds and customer-initiated chargebacks, maintains careful accounting to ensure refund amounts never exceed original charges, and implements the complex workflows required for dispute evidence submission and chargeback management.</p>\n<p><strong>Webhook Processor</strong> serves as the system&#39;s nervous system, receiving and processing real-time notifications from external payment providers. Like a financial news ticker that updates traders on market movements, this component ensures our local payment state stays synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by payment providers, handling the complexities of signature verification, event deduplication, and ordered processing.</p>\n<p><strong>State Reconciliation Service</strong> acts as the system&#39;s auditing department, periodically comparing our local payment records against the authoritative state maintained by payment providers. This component catches discrepancies that might arise from missed webhooks, network failures, or processing errors, ensuring long-term data consistency even in the face of temporary communication failures.</p>\n<p>The following table details each component&#39;s specific responsibilities:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Operations</th>\n<th>Data Ownership</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Payment Intent Manager</td>\n<td>Intent lifecycle management</td>\n<td>Create intent, validate idempotency, track expiration</td>\n<td><code>PaymentIntent</code> records, idempotency keys</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Processing Engine</td>\n<td>Payment execution</td>\n<td>Tokenize payment methods, process charges, handle 3DS</td>\n<td><code>Charge</code> records, payment method tokens</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refund and Dispute Handler</td>\n<td>Payment reversals</td>\n<td>Process refunds, handle chargebacks, manage disputes</td>\n<td><code>Refund</code> records, dispute evidence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Webhook Processor</td>\n<td>Real-time state sync</td>\n<td>Verify signatures, process events, update records</td>\n<td><code>WebhookEvent</code> logs, processing state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Reconciliation Service</td>\n<td>Periodic consistency checks</td>\n<td>Compare states, detect discrepancies, trigger corrections</td>\n<td>Reconciliation reports, sync status</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Microservice vs Monolithic Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Payment systems require high reliability and clear component boundaries, but also need strong consistency guarantees and transactional integrity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Microservices with event-driven communication</li>\n<li>Modular monolith with clear internal boundaries</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with core payments as monolith and auxiliary services separate</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Modular monolith with clear internal component boundaries</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Payment processing requires ACID transactions across multiple operations (intent creation, charge processing, state updates). Distributed transactions are complex and introduce failure modes. A monolith allows database transactions to span components while still maintaining clear separation of concerns through interfaces and dependency injection.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Simpler deployment and testing, stronger consistency guarantees, but requires discipline to maintain component boundaries and may require refactoring to microservices if scaling demands exceed single-instance capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"data-flow-patterns\">Data Flow Patterns</h3>\n<p>Payment data flows through our system following predictable patterns that mirror real-world financial transactions. Understanding these flows is crucial because payment processing is inherently stateful - each step depends on the successful completion of previous steps, and failures at any point require careful rollback or compensation logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Intent Creation Flow</strong> begins when a client application (web frontend, mobile app, or API integration) initiates a payment request. The flow starts with HTTP request validation, ensuring all required fields are present and properly formatted. The system validates the monetary amount using <code>validate_amount()</code> to convert dollar amounts to cents and prevent floating-point arithmetic errors. Currency validation through <code>validate_currency()</code> ensures compliance with ISO 4217 standards. The idempotency key undergoes validation via <code>validate_idempotency_key()</code> to ensure proper format and uniqueness constraints.</p>\n<p>The Payment Intent Manager checks for existing intents with the same idempotency key. If found, it returns the existing intent without creating a duplicate, implementing true idempotent behavior. If no duplicate exists, the manager creates a new <code>PaymentIntent</code> record with status <code>created</code>, stores it in the database within a transaction, and returns the intent details including a client secret for subsequent operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Processing Flow</strong> activates when a client confirms a payment intent by submitting payment method details. The Processing Engine receives the confirmation request along with the payment method information (credit card details, bank account information, or alternative payment method tokens). The engine immediately tokenizes sensitive payment data, replacing credit card numbers with opaque tokens that cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal the original information.</p>\n<p>For credit card payments requiring 3D Secure authentication, the engine initiates the authentication challenge by redirecting the customer to their issuing bank&#39;s authentication page. The customer completes the authentication (entering a password, using biometric verification, or confirming via mobile app), and the bank redirects back to our system with authentication results.</p>\n<p>Upon successful authentication (or for payments not requiring 3DS), the engine submits the charge request to the external payment provider. The provider processes the payment through banking networks, applying fraud checks, verifying account balances, and obtaining authorization from the issuing bank. The response updates our local <code>Charge</code> record with the final status and transaction identifiers.</p>\n<p><strong>Webhook Reconciliation Flow</strong> operates asynchronously as payment providers send real-time notifications about payment state changes. The Webhook Processor receives HTTP POST requests at our webhook endpoint, immediately verifying the payload signature using HMAC-SHA256 to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing attacks.</p>\n<p>Valid webhooks undergo event processing where the processor extracts payment identifiers, determines the event type (charge succeeded, payment failed, refund completed), and updates corresponding local records. The processor implements deduplication by checking webhook event IDs against previously processed events, ensuring idempotent handling even when providers retry webhook delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>State Reconciliation Flow</strong> runs periodically (typically every 15-30 minutes) to catch any discrepancies between local payment state and provider authoritative state. The reconciliation service queries recent payment records from our database, fetches corresponding payment status from external providers via API calls, and compares the states. Discrepancies trigger alert notifications and automated correction workflows where possible.</p>\n<p>The following table illustrates the complete data transformation journey:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Flow Stage</th>\n<th>Input Data</th>\n<th>Processing Component</th>\n<th>Output Data</th>\n<th>Persistence Layer</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Intent Creation</td>\n<td>Client payment request</td>\n<td>Payment Intent Manager</td>\n<td><code>PaymentIntent</code> with status <code>created</code></td>\n<td>PostgreSQL payment_intents table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Method Tokenization</td>\n<td>Raw payment method data</td>\n<td>Processing Engine</td>\n<td>Payment method token</td>\n<td>Secure token vault (encrypted)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3DS Authentication</td>\n<td>Customer credentials</td>\n<td>External issuer bank</td>\n<td>Authentication result token</td>\n<td>Processing Engine memory (temporary)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charge Processing</td>\n<td>Tokenized payment method</td>\n<td>Processing Engine</td>\n<td><code>Charge</code> with status <code>succeeded</code>/<code>failed</code></td>\n<td>PostgreSQL charges table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Webhook Processing</td>\n<td>Provider notification</td>\n<td>Webhook Processor</td>\n<td>Updated payment status</td>\n<td>PostgreSQL webhook_events table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Reconciliation</td>\n<td>Local vs provider state</td>\n<td>Reconciliation Service</td>\n<td>Consistency report</td>\n<td>PostgreSQL reconciliation_logs table</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight here is that payment data never travels in a straight line - it flows through multiple validation, transformation, and storage steps, with each step designed to be recoverable in case of failures. This pipeline approach ensures we can trace any payment&#39;s journey and resume processing from any interruption point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Error Recovery Flow</strong> activates when any step in the normal processing flow encounters a failure. The system maintains detailed audit logs at each processing stage, allowing precise identification of failure points. For transient failures (network timeouts, provider rate limiting), the system implements exponential backoff retry logic with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. For permanent failures (invalid payment methods, insufficient funds), the system updates payment status accordingly and triggers customer notification workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-project-structure\">Recommended Project Structure</h3>\n<p>A well-organized codebase is essential for payment systems because regulatory compliance, security audits, and maintenance require clear separation between different types of functionality. Our project structure reflects the architectural components while providing clear boundaries between business logic, external integrations, and infrastructure concerns.</p>\n<p>The project follows a layered architecture pattern where each directory has a specific purpose and dependency direction flows from outer layers (HTTP handlers) toward inner layers (domain logic) toward infrastructure layers (database, external APIs). This structure enables easy testing by allowing infrastructure dependencies to be mocked or stubbed during unit tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Top-Level Organization</strong> separates executable entry points, internal business logic, external integrations, database schemas, and configuration. The <code>cmd/</code> directory contains main functions for different deployment modes (web server, background workers, CLI tools). The <code>internal/</code> directory houses all business logic and is not importable by external packages, enforcing encapsulation. The <code>pkg/</code> directory contains utilities that could be shared with other projects. The <code>migrations/</code> directory contains database schema evolution scripts with version control.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Module Structure</strong> within the <code>internal/</code> directory maps directly to our architectural components. Each component gets its own subdirectory with a consistent internal structure: main business logic files, test files, internal interfaces, and component-specific utilities. This organization makes it easy for developers to locate functionality and maintain clear boundaries between components.</p>\n<p><strong>External Integration Structure</strong> isolates all third-party dependencies in dedicated modules. Payment provider integrations live in separate subdirectories under <code>internal/providers/</code>, allowing easy swapping between different providers (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen) through common interfaces. Database access layers provide abstraction over SQL queries, enabling database migrations and testing with different database engines.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration and Deployment Structure</strong> separates environment-specific configuration from code. The <code>config/</code> directory contains YAML or JSON files for different deployment environments (development, staging, production). Docker files and Kubernetes manifests live in <code>deployments/</code> directory. Documentation and API specifications reside in <code>docs/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the complete recommended project structure:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>payment-gateway/\n├── cmd/\n│   ├── server/\n│   │   └── main.go                    #

Think of the data model as a comprehensive audit trail for a bank - every action, state change, and monetary movement must be precisely recorded with immutable timestamps and references. Unlike typical application data that can be updated in-place, payment data follows append-only patterns where historical states are preserved for regulatory compliance and dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>The core challenge in payment data modeling is handling the inherent asynchrony of financial systems. A single customer payment intent spawns multiple interconnected records across different tables as the transaction flows through various stages: intent creation, authorization, capture, settlement, and potential refunds or disputes. Each stage may occur minutes, hours, or even days apart, requiring careful relationship management and state consistency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fpayment-data-model.svg\" alt=\"Payment Data Model Relationships\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"core-payment-entities\">Core Payment Entities</h3>\n<p>The payment system&#39;s data model centers around four primary entities that represent different aspects of the payment lifecycle. These entities form a hierarchical relationship where each level adds specificity and operational detail to the layer above.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Intent</strong> represents the customer&#39;s commitment to pay before any money actually moves. Think of a payment intent as a formal IOU that establishes the transaction context, amount, currency, and associated metadata. The intent serves as the immutable anchor point that persists throughout the entire payment lifecycle, providing a stable identifier that remains constant even as the underlying payment methods, amounts, or processing details change.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Globally unique payment intent identifier (pi_xxxx format)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>amount</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Payment amount in smallest currency unit (cents for USD)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>currency</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>ISO 4217 three-letter currency code (USD, EUR, GBP)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>status</code></td>\n<td><code>PaymentIntentStatus</code></td>\n<td>Current state in the payment intent lifecycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>idempotency_key</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Client-provided unique key for duplicate request prevention</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>dict</code></td>\n<td>Arbitrary key-value data attached by merchant application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Immutable timestamp when intent was first created</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>expires_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Automatic cancellation timestamp for stale intents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>client_secret</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Secret token for client-side payment confirmation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>last_payment_error</code></td>\n<td><code>dict</code></td>\n<td>Most recent error encountered during payment processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>amount</code> field stores monetary values as integers in the smallest currency unit to eliminate floating-point precision errors. For USD, $10.00 becomes 1000 cents. The <code>idempotency_key</code> enables safe retry behavior - if a client sends the same key twice, they receive the same response rather than creating duplicate payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Charge</strong> represents the actual movement of money from customer to merchant for a specific payment intent. While a payment intent declares the intention to pay, a charge executes that intention by submitting payment details to the card network or bank. Multiple charges may be associated with a single payment intent if the first charge fails and requires retry with different payment methods.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Globally unique charge identifier (ch_xxxx format)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>payment_intent_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Foreign key reference to associated payment intent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>amount</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Actual charged amount in smallest currency unit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>status</code></td>\n<td><code>ChargeStatus</code></td>\n<td>Current processing status of the charge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>payment_method_token</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Tokenized reference to customer payment method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_code</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Standardized error code if charge failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_message</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable error description if charge failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>network_transaction_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Payment network&#39;s identifier for this transaction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>authorization_code</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Bank authorization code for successful charges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when charge was initiated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>settled_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when funds were actually transferred</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>payment_method_token</code> field contains an opaque reference to the customer&#39;s payment details rather than storing sensitive card information directly. This tokenization approach maintains PCI DSS compliance by ensuring sensitive data never touches the merchant&#39;s systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Refund</strong> represents the return of previously charged funds back to the customer. Refunds maintain a direct relationship to their originating charge and track the complex state transitions involved in reversing money movement through banking networks. Partial refunds are supported, allowing merchants to return portions of the original charge while retaining the remainder.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Globally unique refund identifier (re_xxxx format)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>charge_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Foreign key reference to the charge being refunded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>amount</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Refund amount in smallest currency unit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>status</code></td>\n<td><code>RefundStatus</code></td>\n<td>Current processing status of the refund</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>reason</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Merchant-provided reason for the refund</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>network_transaction_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Payment network identifier for refund transaction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_code</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Error code if refund processing failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_message</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable error description if refund failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when refund was initiated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processed_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when refund completed processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Webhook Event</strong> captures all payment-related notifications received from external payment providers.

Webhook events use NO ACTION because they represent historical audit data that must be preserved regardless of entity lifecycle changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Entity Relationships:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Allowing Null Foreign Keys in Financial Records</strong>\nFinancial entities should never have orphaned records due to null foreign keys. Every charge must belong to a payment intent, every refund must reference a charge. Null foreign keys in payment processing indicate data corruption and can lead to reconciliation failures. Use NOT NULL constraints on all relationship columns and validate relationships before insertion.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Cascade Rules for Payment Intent Cleanup</strong>\nPayment intents that fail early in the lifecycle may accumulate without proper cleanup, leading to database bloat and performance degradation. Implement time-based cascade rules that automatically remove failed payment intents after appropriate retention periods, ensuring associated charges and events are cleaned up appropriately.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Referential Integrity for Polymorphic Webhook References</strong>\nSince webhooks use JSON payload references rather than foreign keys, application code must validate that referenced entities exist before processing events. Implement validation triggers or application-level checks to ensure webhook events never reference non-existent payment entities, preventing webhook processing failures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The payment data model requires careful implementation to handle the unique requirements of financial data: immutability, auditability, and strict consistency guarantees. The recommended approach uses a combination of relational database features and application-level validation to ensure data integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology

Just as that purchase contract has a lifecycle (signed, inspected, financed, closed), payment intents move through defined states from creation to completion. The critical insight is that creating the intent is separate from processing the payment, which allows us to handle complex scenarios like authentication challenges, network failures, and duplicate requests without accidentally charging customers multiple times.</p>\n<p>Payment intent management forms the foundation of reliable payment processing by establishing a clear contract between merchant and customer before attempting to move money. This separation of intent from execution enables sophisticated error handling, prevents duplicate charges through idempotency controls, and provides a clear audit trail for every payment attempt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"payment-intent-lifecycle\">Payment Intent Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>The payment intent state machine governs how payment requests progress from initial creation through final resolution. Think of this like a restaurant order workflow - the order starts as &quot;placed&quot; (customer committed), moves to &quot;preparing&quot; (kitchen working), might require &quot;customer confirmation&quot; (special requests), and finally reaches &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;cancelled&quot;. Each transition is controlled and reversible only within certain windows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fpayment-intent-states.svg\" alt=\"Payment Intent State Machine\"></p>\n<p><strong>State Definitions and Transitions:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Valid Next States</th>\n<th>Trigger Event</th>\n<th>Business Logic</th>\n<th>Rollback Allowed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>created</code></td>\n<td><code>requires_action</code>, <code>processing</code>, <code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>Client confirms payment, 3DS required, timeout/cancellation</td>\n<td>Initial state after intent creation</td>\n<td>Yes - no money movement yet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>requires_action</code></td>\n<td><code>processing</code>, <code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>Customer completes 3DS, timeout/cancellation</td>\n<td>Waiting for customer authentication</td>\n<td>Yes - authentication not completed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processing</code></td>\n<td><code>succeeded</code>, <code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>Provider confirms/rejects charge</td>\n<td>Payment submitted to provider</td>\n<td>Limited - may be too late</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>succeeded</code></td>\n<td>None (terminal)</td>\n<td>Provider settles successfully</td>\n<td>Money transferred, receipt generated</td>\n<td>No - only via separate refund</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>None (terminal)</td>\n<td>Explicit cancellation or timeout</td>\n<td>Intent abandoned or expired</td>\n<td>No - final state</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The state machine enforces critical business rules that prevent money movement until all preconditions are met. For example, an intent cannot jump directly from <code>created</code> to <code>succeeded</code> - it must pass through <code>processing</code> to ensure proper provider interaction and audit logging.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Critical Insight</strong>: Terminal states (<code>succeeded</code>, <code>canceled</code>) are permanent by design. Once money has moved or an intent has been definitively abandoned, the intent becomes immutable. This prevents accidental state corruption and provides clear audit boundaries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>State Transition Validation Logic:</strong></p>\n<p>Each state transition must satisfy specific preconditions to maintain system integrity.

Think of them like check numbers on paper checks - each check has a unique number, and if you accidentally submit the same check twice to your bank, the second submission is rejected rather than processed again. Similarly, idempotency keys ensure that network retries, browser refreshes, or accidental double-clicks don&#39;t result in multiple charges.</p>\n<p>The idempotency system creates a binding between a client-provided unique identifier and a specific payment operation. Once that binding is established, any future request with the same idempotency key returns the result of the original operation rather than creating a new payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Idempotency Key Lifecycle and Storage:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Key Status</th>\n<th>Database State</th>\n<th>Client Behavior</th>\n<th>System Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>First Request</td>\n<td>New</td>\n<td>Key + request hash stored</td>\n<td>Provides key + payment params</td>\n<td>Process normally, store result</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Duplicate Request (same params)</td>\n<td>Exists, params match</td>\n<td>Key + request hash + result stored</td>\n<td>Same key + same params</td>\n<td>Return stored result</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conflicting Request</td>\n<td>Exists, params differ</td>\n<td>Key + different request hash found</td>\n<td>Same key + different params</td>\n<td>Return 400 error - key reused incorrectly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expired Key</td>\n<td>Exists but expired</td>\n<td>Key marked expired in database</td>\n<td>Same key after expiration</td>\n<td>Allow new request with same key</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Processing Request</td>\n<td>Exists, no result yet</td>\n<td>Key stored, payment in progress</td>\n<td>Same key while processing</td>\n<td>Return current payment status</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The core challenge is distinguishing between legitimate retries (same operation, network hiccup) and incorrect key reuse (same key, different operation). We solve this by hashing the request parameters and storing that hash alongside the idempotency key.</p>\n<p><strong>Request Parameter Hashing Strategy:</strong></p>\n<p>To detect parameter conflicts, we hash the essential payment parameters that define the operation&#39;s intent. The hash must be stable (same inputs always produce same hash) but sensitive to meaningful changes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter Category</th>\n<th>Included in Hash</th>\n<th>Excluded from Hash</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Core Payment Data</td>\n<td><code>amount</code>, <code>currency</code>, <code>customer_id</code></td>\n<td><code>metadata</code>, <code>description</code></td>\n<td>Financial impact vs. contextual info</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment Method</td>\n<td><code>payment_method_id</code>, <code>payment_method_types</code></td>\n<td><code>receipt_email</code>, <code>statement_descriptor</code></td>\n<td>Payment execution vs. presentation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Context</td>\n<td><code>application_fee_amount</code>, <code>transfer_data</code></td>\n<td><code>expand</code>, <code>trace_id</code></td>\n<td>Business logic vs. debugging/display</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timing Data</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>created_at</code>, <code>last_updated</code></td>\n<td>Parameters shouldn&#39;t include server-generated timestamps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The parameter hash serves as a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of the payment intent.

Think of intent expiration like restaurant reservations - if you don&#39;t show up within a reasonable window, the table gets released to other customers. Intent expiration prevents resource leaks, cleans up abandoned sessions, and ensures payment methods remain valid when processing occurs.</p>\n<p>The expiration system operates on multiple timescales: short-term expiration for active user sessions, medium-term expiration for abandoned intents, and long-term cleanup for historical records. Each expiration tier serves different business and technical requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Expiration Timing and Business Rules:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Intent State</th>\n<th>Default Expiration</th>\n<th>Business Justification</th>\n<th>System Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>created</code></td>\n<td>60 minutes</td>\n<td>User actively in checkout flow</td>\n<td>Transition to <code>canceled</code>, notify client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>requires_action</code></td>\n<td>30 minutes</td>\n<td>Waiting for 3DS authentication</td>\n<td>Transition to <code>canceled</code>, release payment method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processing</code></td>\n<td>10 minutes</td>\n<td>Provider should respond quickly</td>\n<td>Investigate with provider, potential retry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>succeeded</code></td>\n<td>Never expires</td>\n<td>Permanent record for accounting</td>\n<td>Archive to cold storage after 7 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>Archive after 90 days</td>\n<td>Fraud analysis and debugging</td>\n<td>Move to historical archive</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The expiration times balance user experience (don&#39;t expire too quickly) with resource management (don&#39;t hold resources indefinitely).

Fix this by checking payment status before forcing expiration and allowing a brief grace period for in-flight transactions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cascading Expiration Failures</strong>\nIf the expiration background service fails, expired intents accumulate and can overwhelm the system when it recovers. Implement circuit breakers and gradual ramp-up when processing large backlogs of expired intents.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Timezone Confusion in Expiration Logic</strong>\nStoring expiration times in local timezone or mixing timezone-aware and naive timestamps leads to incorrect expiration behavior. Always use UTC for internal expiration tracking and convert to local time only for display purposes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Expiration Monitoring</strong>\nHigh expiration rates might indicate UX problems, system performance issues, or integration bugs, but without proper monitoring, these problems go undetected.

implementing payment confirmation with 3D Secure authentication flow, processing card payments through external providers, handling authentication redirects, and supporting multiple payment methods</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The payment processing engine transforms payment intents into actual money movement by coordinating with external payment providers. Think of this component as the execution engine of a stock trading system - while payment intents represent trading orders waiting to be executed, the processing engine actually submits those orders to the market (payment networks) and handles the complex choreography of authentication, authorization, and settlement.</p>\n<p>This engine must orchestrate multiple asynchronous operations: tokenizing sensitive payment data, submitting charges to external providers, handling Strong Customer Authentication (3D Secure) redirects, and managing the various success and failure scenarios that can occur during payment processing. Unlike simple API calls, payment processing involves state machines, external redirects, and reconciliation across multiple systems.</p>\n<p>The core challenge lies in maintaining payment state consistency while handling the inherently asynchronous nature of modern payment flows. When a customer initiates a payment, the system may need to redirect them to their bank for authentication, wait for external webhook confirmations, and handle various failure modes - all while ensuring the customer has a coherent experience and the merchant&#39;s accounting remains accurate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"charge-processing-flow\">Charge Processing Flow</h3>\n<p>The charge processing flow represents the core algorithm that transforms a payment intent into an actual charge against a customer&#39;s payment method. Think of this process like conducting an orchestra - multiple instruments (tokenization, provider APIs, authentication flows) must play their parts in precise coordination to create a harmonious payment experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fwebhook-processing-flow.svg\" alt=\"Webhook Processing Pipeline\"></p>\n<p>The flow begins when a payment intent transitions from the <code>created</code> status to active processing. At this point, the system has already validated the payment amount, currency, and idempotency constraints through the payment intent management layer. The processing engine&#39;s responsibility is to execute the actual charge while handling the various authentication and authorization steps required by modern payment regulations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Asynchronous Processing with State Persistence</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Payment processing involves multiple external API calls, potential redirects for authentication, and variable response times from payment providers</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Synchronous blocking processing, asynchronous with callbacks, event-driven state machine</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Asynchronous processing with persistent state tracking through database records</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Payment flows can take minutes (3DS authentication) or hours (bank transfers) to complete, making synchronous processing unsuitable for web applications. State persistence ensures resilience against server restarts and provides audit trails for compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables scalable payment processing and better user experience through non-blocking operations, but requires careful state management and introduces complexity in error handling and recovery scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The charge processing algorithm follows a predictable sequence of operations designed to maximize success rates while providing clear error reporting for failed transactions:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Processing Step</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Payment Method Validation</td>\n<td>Verify tokenized payment method is valid and not expired</td>\n<td>Token exists in vault, not marked as expired</td>\n<td>Return validation error to client</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider Selection</td>\n<td>Choose appropriate payment provider based on currency, amount, risk factors</td>\n<td>Provider supports currency and has sufficient capacity</td>\n<td>Fallback to secondary provider or return error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charge Creation</td>\n<td>Submit payment request to external provider with tokenized payment data</td>\n<td>Provider returns charge ID and initial status</td>\n<td>Log provider error, update charge record with failure details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication Check</td>\n<td>Determine if Strong Customer Authentication (3DS) is required</td>\n<td>Provider indicates no authentication needed or returns auth challenge</td>\n<td>Handle authentication flow or return auth-required status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization Processing</td>\n<td>Process the actual payment authorization against customer&#39;s account</td>\n<td>Provider confirms funds are available and reserved</td>\n<td>Update charge status to failed with provider error details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Confirmation Handling</td>\n<td>Finalize the charge based on provider response and any authentication results</td>\n<td>Charge moves to succeeded status with authorization code</td>\n<td>Implement retry logic for transient failures</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The processing engine maintains detailed charge records throughout this flow, creating an immutable audit trail of each processing attempt. This audit trail proves essential for debugging payment failures, handling disputes, and maintaining compliance with financial regulations that require transaction traceability.</p>\n<p><strong>Charge State Management</strong></p>\n<p>Each charge progresses through a well-defined state machine that reflects its current processing status.

Think of 3DS as a security checkpoint at an airport - while it adds friction to the payment process, it provides essential fraud protection and regulatory compliance that benefits all parties in the long term.</p>\n<p>The 3D Secure protocol enables card issuers to authenticate their cardholders directly during online transactions, reducing fraud liability for merchants while complying with regulations like PSD2 in Europe. However, implementing 3DS requires careful orchestration of redirects, state management, and fallback scenarios to maintain a acceptable user experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2F3ds-flow-sequence.svg\" alt=\"3D Secure Authentication Flow\"></p>\n<p>The authentication flow involves four primary parties: the customer, merchant (our payment gateway), payment provider, and issuing bank. Each party has specific responsibilities and timing requirements that must be carefully coordinated to prevent authentication failures or security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>3DS Flow Orchestration</strong></p>\n<p>The 3D Secure authentication process follows a well-established sequence that balances security requirements with user experience considerations. The processing engine must handle this flow while maintaining payment state consistency and providing clear status updates to the merchant application:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Authentication Assessment</strong>: When creating a charge, the payment provider analyzes transaction risk factors (amount, merchant category, customer history, issuer requirements) to determine if 3DS authentication is mandatory, recommended, or unnecessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Challenge Preparation</strong>: If authentication is required, the provider generates a unique authentication session and returns a secure authentication URL along with session parameters that identify this specific payment attempt.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Customer Redirect</strong>: The merchant application redirects the customer to the authentication URL, typically in a popup window or iframe to maintain context of the original purchase flow.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Issuer Authentication</strong>: The customer&#39;s bank presents their authentication interface (SMS codes, mobile app push notifications, biometric verification) and validates the customer&#39;s identity according to their internal policies.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Authentication Response</strong>: Upon completing authentication, the issuer redirects the customer back to a merchant-provided return URL with authentication results embedded as URL parameters.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Payment Confirmation</strong>: The merchant backend extracts authentication results and calls the provider&#39;s confirmation endpoint to complete the original payment using the authentication proof.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Final Settlement</strong>: With authentication confirmed, the provider processes the payment authorization and returns final charge status to complete the payment flow.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The processing engine tracks this multi-step flow through careful state management and timeout handling. Each step has specific failure modes and recovery procedures that must be implemented to provide reliable payment processing.</p>\n<p><strong>3DS State Management</strong></p>\n<p>During 3D Secure authentication, payment intents transition through specialized states that reflect the current stage of the authentication process. This state tracking enables proper customer communication and prevents duplicate authentication attempts:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Payment Intent Status</th>\n<th>3DS Context</th>\n<th>Customer Experience</th>\n<th>System Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>created</code></td>\n<td>Initial state before processing</td>\n<td>Payment form submitted, waiting for response</td>\n<td>System preparing to submit charge to provider</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>requires_action</code></td>\n<td>3DS authentication challenge issued</td>\n<td>Redirected to bank authentication page</td>\n<td>Waiting for customer to complete authentication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processing</code></td>\n<td>Authentication completed, finalizing payment</td>\n<td>&quot;Please wait&quot; message while payment completes</td>\n<td>Confirming payment with authentication proof</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>succeeded</code></td>\n<td>Payment authorized and authenticated</td>\n<td>Success page displayed</td>\n<td>Payment complete, funds will settle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>canceled</code></td>\n<td>Authentication failed or timed out</td>\n<td>Error message with retry option</td>\n<td>Payment attempt recorded as failed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>requires_action</code> status proves particularly important for merchant integrations, as it indicates the payment flow requires customer interaction rather than backend processing. Merchant applications must handle this status by presenting the authentication interface rather than polling for completion.</p>\n<p><strong>Authentication Challenge Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Modern 3D Secure implementations support multiple authentication methods depending on the customer&#39;s bank and device capabilities. The processing engine must handle these variations while providing consistent merchant APIs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Authentication Method</th>\n<th>User Experience</th>\n<th>Technical Implementation</th>\n<th>Fallback Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frictionless</td>\n<td>No customer interaction, authentication happens behind scenes</td>\n<td>Provider returns immediate success/failure</td>\n<td>None needed - standard processing continues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SMS Challenge</td>\n<td>Customer enters code sent to registered phone number</td>\n<td>Redirect to issuer page with SMS input form</td>\n<td>Allow multiple SMS requests with rate limiting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mobile App Push</td>\n<td>Customer approves transaction in banking mobile app</td>\n<td>Redirect shows &quot;Check your mobile app&quot; message</td>\n<td>Timeout after 5 minutes, offer SMS alternative</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Browser Redirect</td>\n<td>Full redirect to issuer website for complex authentication</td>\n<td>Customer leaves merchant site temporarily</td>\n<td>Return URL must restore shopping context</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Biometric</td>\n<td>Fingerprint or face recognition through mobile browser APIs</td>\n<td>WebAuthn API integration with device capabilities</td>\n<td>Fallback to traditional authentication methods</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The processing engine stores authentication context in the charge record to enable proper handling of return flows and timeout scenarios. This context includes the authentication method attempted, timestamps for timeout calculation, and return URL parameters for session restoration.</p>\n<p><strong>Return URL Management</strong></p>\n<p>3D Secure authentication requires merchants to provide return URLs where customers are redirected after completing authentication. The processing engine must generate unique, secure return URLs that restore payment context and prevent authentication replay attacks:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Return URL Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Consideration</th>\n<th>Example Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Base Domain</td>\n<td>Merchant&#39;s verified domain for customer return</td>\n<td>Must match merchant registration to prevent phishing</td>\n<td><code>https://shop.example.com</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return Endpoint</td>\n<td>Specific handler for 3DS authentication results</td>\n<td>Should be dedicated endpoint, not general payment handler</td>\n<td><code>/payments/3ds-return</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Token</td>\n<td>Unique identifier linking return to original payment</td>\n<td>Must be cryptographically secure and single-use</td>\n<td><code>3ds_sess_1a2b3c4d5e6f</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment Intent ID</td>\n<td>Identifies which payment this authentication completes</td>\n<td>Allows state restoration and duplicate detection</td>\n<td><code>pi_1234567890abcdef</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timestamp</td>\n<td>When authentication session was created</td>\n<td>Enables timeout enforcement and replay prevention</td>\n<td><code>1703123456</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature</td>\n<td>HMAC proving URL authenticity and preventing tampering</td>\n<td>Computed from all other parameters using secret key</td>\n<td><code>hmac_sha256_abc123def456</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The return URL handler must validate all components, check authentication session expiry, and extract authentication results from provider-supplied parameters. Failed validations should be treated as potential security attacks and logged for investigation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: Return URLs represent a potential attack vector where malicious actors might attempt to bypass authentication by crafting fake return requests. Always validate HMAC signatures and check authentication session state before completing payments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"payment-method-tokenization\">Payment Method Tokenization</h3>\n<p>Payment method tokenization transforms sensitive card details into secure, opaque tokens that can be safely stored and transmitted without PCI DSS compliance burden. Think of tokenization like a coat check system at a restaurant - customers surrender their valuable items (card details) in exchange for a numbered ticket (token) that can later be used to retrieve the original item when needed.</p>\n<p>The tokenization process removes raw payment card data from our systems while maintaining the ability to process payments, refunds, and recurring charges. This approach dramatically reduces security scope, compliance costs, and the potential impact of data breaches while enabling full payment functionality.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Provider-Managed Tokenization vs Self-Managed Vault</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Payment card data requires strict security controls and PCI DSS compliance that significantly increases operational complexity and cost</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Self-managed encryption vault, third-party tokenization service, provider-managed tokenization</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Provider-managed tokenization using payment processor&#39;s secure vault services</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Eliminates PCI DSS scope for card storage, reduces security infrastructure requirements, leverages provider&#39;s specialized security expertise and compliance certifications</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables rapid development with reduced compliance burden and security risk, but creates dependency on provider tokenization APIs and limits ability to switch providers easily</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tokenization Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The payment processing engine integrates tokenization at multiple points in the payment flow, ensuring sensitive data never persists in application databases or appears in application logs. This integration requires careful API design to maintain security boundaries while providing intuitive developer experiences.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tokenization Stage</th>\n<th>Input Data</th>\n<th>Security Boundary</th>\n<th>Output Token</th>\n<th>Usage Context</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Card Collection</td>\n<td>Raw card number, expiry, CVV from customer</td>\n<td>Client-side form submission over TLS</td>\n<td>Single-use collection token</td>\n<td>Temporary token for immediate payment processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment Method Storage</td>\n<td>Collection token + customer billing details</td>\n<td>Server-to-provider API call</td>\n<td>Reusable payment method token</td>\n<td>Stored for future payments and subscription billing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charge Processing</td>\n<td>Payment method token + charge details</td>\n<td>Internal API with token reference</td>\n<td>Provider charge ID</td>\n<td>Links token to specific charge attempt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refund Processing</td>\n<td>Original charge ID and refund amount</td>\n<td>Provider refund API using charge reference</td>\n<td>Refund transaction ID</td>\n<td>Enables partial refunds without re-exposing card data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The tokenization architecture maintains a clear separation between temporary collection tokens (valid for minutes) and persistent payment method tokens (valid for years). This separation enables different security policies and lifecycle management for each token type.</p>\n<p><strong>Secure Token Collection</strong></p>\n<p>Modern tokenization implementations collect card details directly from customer browsers to payment provider systems, ensuring sensitive data never reaches merchant servers. This approach requires careful integration of client-side JavaScript libraries with backend payment processing logic:</p>\n<p>The collection process begins when customers enter card details in the merchant&#39;s payment form. Instead of submitting this data to the merchant server, client-side JavaScript intercepts the form submission and securely transmits card details directly to the payment provider&#39;s tokenization endpoint over encrypted connections.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collection Step</th>\n<th>Client-Side Action</th>\n<th>Server-Side Response</th>\n<th>Security Measure</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Form Initialization</td>\n<td>Load provider JavaScript library with merchant API keys</td>\n<td>Verify merchant domain against provider whitelist</td>\n<td>API keys scoped to domain, no secret credentials in browser</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Card Data Entry</td>\n<td>Customer types card details in merchant-styled form fields</td>\n<td>No server involvement - data stays in browser</td>\n<td>Form fields replaced with provider-controlled secure inputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tokenization Request</td>\n<td>JavaScript sends card data directly to provider tokenization API</td>\n<td>Provider validates card format and returns collection token</td>\n<td>Card data transmitted over TLS to provider, not merchant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token Submission</td>\n<td>Form submits collection token (not card data) to merchant server</td>\n<td>Merchant server receives token for payment processing</td>\n<td>Merchant never sees raw card data, only secure token reference</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This architecture ensures that card details flow directly from customer browsers to payment provider systems without ever existing in merchant application memory, databases, or log files. The merchant application only handles opaque tokens that cannot be used to reconstruct original card data.</p>\n<p><strong>Token Storage and Lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>Payment method tokens require careful lifecycle management to balance security, usability, and regulatory compliance. The processing engine implements token storage patterns that support various merchant use cases while maintaining strict security controls:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Storage Pattern</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n<th>Token Validity</th>\n<th>Security Controls</th>\n<th>Compliance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Session Tokens</td>\n<td>Single checkout process</td>\n<td>30 minutes</td>\n<td>Automatic expiry, single-use validation</td>\n<td>No PCI scope - tokens expire quickly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Customer Tokens</td>\n<td>Saved payment methods for registered users</td>\n<td>1-2 years or until card expiry</td>\n<td>Customer authentication required for token usage</td>\n<td>Minimal PCI scope - no cardholder data stored</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subscription Tokens</td>\n<td>Recurring billing for ongoing services</td>\n<td>Until customer cancellation or card expiry</td>\n<td>Additional fraud monitoring, velocity limits</td>\n<td>Enhanced monitoring required for unattended payments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Merchant Tokens</td>\n<td>Customer service operations and refunds</td>\n<td>Tied to original transaction lifecycle</td>\n<td>Role-based access controls, audit logging</td>\n<td>Administrative access controls and compliance reporting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The token storage system maintains metadata about each tokenized payment method without storing sensitive card details.

The processing engine implements multiple layers of token protection:</p>\n<p>Authentication controls ensure only authorized parties can use payment method tokens. Customer tokens require customer authentication, while merchant tokens require staff authentication with appropriate role-based permissions. These controls prevent token theft from resulting in unauthorized charges.</p>\n<p>Authorization controls validate each token usage against business rules and risk factors. Unusual spending patterns, geographic inconsistencies, or velocity violations trigger additional verification steps before processing payments. These controls provide defense-in-depth protection against token abuse.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Security Control</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n<th>Protection Against</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Customer Authentication</td>\n<td>JWT tokens or session validation</td>\n<td>Unauthorized customer token usage</td>\n<td>Minimal - cached authentication state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Role-Based Access</td>\n<td>Permission matrix for staff operations</td>\n<td>Internal fraud and unauthorized refunds</td>\n<td>Low - permission check per request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fraud Scoring</td>\n<td>Machine learning risk analysis</td>\n<td>Stolen token usage and synthetic fraud</td>\n<td>Medium - ML inference per transaction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Velocity Limits</td>\n<td>Rate limiting based on token usage patterns</td>\n<td>Automated attacks and bulk fraud</td>\n<td>Low - counter increment per usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Geographic Controls</td>\n<td>IP geolocation vs billing address comparison</td>\n<td>Cross-border fraud patterns</td>\n<td>Low - geolocation lookup per request</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device Fingerprinting</td>\n<td>Browser/device characteristics tracking</td>\n<td>Account takeover and device spoofing</td>\n<td>Medium - fingerprint generation and comparison</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The token security system logs all usage attempts, successful authentications, and security violations to provide comprehensive audit trails for compliance reporting and fraud investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Storing Collection Tokens Long-Term</strong>\nMany implementations mistakenly treat collection tokens as permanent payment method references and attempt to store them for future use. Collection tokens are designed for immediate usage and typically expire within 30 minutes of creation. Attempting to use expired collection tokens results in cryptic error messages and payment failures. Always convert collection tokens to payment method tokens for storage, or implement proper token refresh logic with clear expiry handling.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mixing Test and Production Tokens</strong>\nToken formats appear identical between test and production environments, making it easy to accidentally submit test tokens to production payment endpoints or vice versa. This mistake causes confusing authorization failures that appear as customer card problems. Always validate token prefixes against expected environment indicators, maintain separate database schemas for test vs production tokens, and implement environment consistency checks in API request validation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Token Metadata Validation</strong>\nRelying solely on tokenization for security while ignoring token metadata validation creates vulnerabilities around duplicate payment methods and customer identity verification. Attackers may create multiple tokens for the same card or use valid tokens with incorrect customer associations. Always validate token fingerprints against existing customer payment methods, verify customer ownership before allowing token usage, and implement duplicate token detection based on card fingerprints rather than token IDs.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Token Cleanup</strong>\nUnused payment method tokens accumulate over time, creating security liability and potential compliance issues during audits. Expired tokens, tokens from deleted customer accounts, and tokens that haven&#39;t been used for extended periods should be systematically purged. Implement automated token cleanup jobs that respect retention requirements, provide customer notification before removing saved payment methods, and maintain audit logs of token deletion activities for compliance purposes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The payment processing engine requires careful integration of external provider APIs, secure token handling, and complex state management for 3D Secure authentication flows.

When you return an item to a store, the clerk processes a refund by reversing part or all of your original transaction - this happens through the same card network that processed your payment, but in reverse. Disputes are like filing a complaint with your credit card company when something goes wrong - the card issuer investigates and may force the merchant to return your money, often before the merchant even knows there&#39;s a problem. Our system needs to handle both scenarios gracefully while maintaining accurate accounting records.</p>\n<p>The complexity comes from the asynchronous nature of these operations. Unlike the immediate feedback you get when making a purchase, refunds can take days to appear on a customer&#39;s statement, and disputes can take weeks or months to resolve. Meanwhile, money moves through multiple parties - your business, the payment processor, the card networks, and various banks - each maintaining their own records that must eventually reconcile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"refund-processing-logic\">Refund Processing Logic</h3>\n<p><strong>Refunds represent the reversal of value transfer from a completed charge.</strong> Unlike voiding a transaction (which cancels it before settlement), refunds actually move money backward through the payment network. This fundamental difference affects timing, fees, and the customer experience.</p>\n<p>The refund state machine mirrors the charge lifecycle but with important distinctions. Refunds begin in a <code>pending</code> status while the payment processor validates the request and initiates the reversal. They transition to <code>succeeded</code> when the processor confirms the refund will be sent to the customer&#39;s account, or <code>failed</code> if validation fails or the refund is rejected. The time between initiation and customer visibility varies significantly - typically 3-10 business days for card refunds.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>pending</code></td>\n<td><code>processor_confirms</code></td>\n<td><code>succeeded</code></td>\n<td>Update network transaction ID, set processed_at timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pending</code></td>\n<td><code>processor_rejects</code></td>\n<td><code>failed</code></td>\n<td>Record failure code and message, alert operations team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>succeeded</code></td>\n<td><em>none</em></td>\n<td><em>terminal</em></td>\n<td>No further state changes allowed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failed</code></td>\n<td><em>none</em></td>\n<td><em>terminal</em></td>\n<td>No further state changes allowed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Partial refunds introduce additional validation complexity.</strong> The system must track the cumulative refunded amount against the original charge to prevent over-refunding. This requires maintaining a running total of successful refunds and comparing it against the original charge amount before approving new refund requests.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Refund Amount Validation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Partial refunds require preventing over-refunding while allowing multiple small refunds against a single charge</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Pre-calculate remaining refundable amount and store it</li>\n<li>Calculate refundable amount dynamically by summing existing refunds</li>\n<li>Rely on payment processor to validate refund amounts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Calculate refundable amount dynamically by summing existing refunds</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Avoids data synchronization issues and provides authoritative validation using the database as single source of truth</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires database query on each refund but ensures accuracy and simplifies concurrent refund handling</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The refund validation algorithm follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Load the original charge</strong> using the provided charge ID and verify it exists in <code>succeeded</code> status</li>\n<li><strong>Query all existing refunds</strong> for this charge that have <code>succeeded</code> status</li>\n<li><strong>Calculate the total refunded amount</strong> by summing the amounts from all successful refunds</li>\n<li><strong>Determine the remaining refundable amount</strong> by subtracting total refunded from original charge amount</li>\n<li><strong>Validate the requested refund amount</strong> is positive and does not exceed the remaining refundable amount</li>\n<li><strong>Check charge age constraints</strong> - most processors limit refunds to charges made within 180 days</li>\n<li><strong>Verify charge settlement status</strong> - some processors require charges to be fully settled before allowing refunds</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Refund Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Unique refund identifier generated by our system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>charge_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Foreign key reference to the original charge being refunded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>amount</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Refund amount in smallest currency unit (cents)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>status</code></td>\n<td><code>RefundStatus</code></td>\n<td>Current refund state: pending, succeeded, failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>reason</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Merchant-provided reason for the refund (fraud, return, duplicate, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>network_transaction_id</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Payment processor&#39;s refund transaction identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_code</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Processor-specific error code if refund failed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failure_message</code></td>\n<td><code>str</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable failure description</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when refund was initiated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processed_at</code></td>\n<td><code>datetime</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when processor confirmed refund completion</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Refund reasons serve both operational and compliance purposes.</strong> Common reason codes include &quot;duplicate&quot; for accidentally charged transactions, &quot;fraudulent&quot; for confirmed fraud cases, &quot;requested_by_customer&quot; for returns and cancellations, and &quot;expired_uncaptured_charge&quot; for authorization reversals. These reasons help with reconciliation, dispute prevention, and regulatory reporting.</p>\n<p>The interaction between refunds and the original payment method adds complexity. Card refunds must go back to the original card - you cannot refund a Visa charge to a Mastercard or to a bank account. If the original card has been closed or replaced, the refund may fail, requiring alternative resolution methods like check payments or store credit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight: Refund Idempotency</strong>\nRefund requests must be idempotent to prevent duplicate refunds from UI retries or API client errors. Include an idempotency key parameter in refund creation requests and store it alongside the refund record to detect duplicates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Frefund-dispute-states.svg\" alt=\"Refund and Dispute State Machines\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"dispute-and-chargeback-workflow\">Dispute and Chargeback Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong>Disputes represent forced payment reversals initiated by the customer&#39;s bank rather than the merchant.</strong> Think of this as the difference between voluntarily returning an item versus filing a complaint with customer service that forces a refund. The merchant has limited control over the process and faces strict deadlines for response.</p>\n<p>The dispute lifecycle begins when a cardholder contacts their bank claiming a problem with a transaction. The bank may issue a chargeback immediately (taking money from the merchant account) or send a warning that gives the merchant a chance to resolve the issue first. This early warning system, sometimes called &quot;pre-arbitration,&quot; allows merchants to voluntarily refund disputed transactions before facing forced chargebacks.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dispute Status</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Merchant Action Required</th>\n<th>Timeline</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>warning_needs_response</code></td>\n<td>Bank inquiry before formal chargeback</td>\n<td>Respond with refund or evidence</td>\n<td>7-10 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>under_review</code></td>\n<td>Formal chargeback filed, evidence submitted</td>\n<td>Wait for network decision</td>\n<td>30-75 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>charge_refunded</code></td>\n<td>Merchant voluntarily refunded during warning</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Terminal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>won</code></td>\n<td>Evidence accepted, funds returned to merchant</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Terminal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>lost</code></td>\n<td>Evidence rejected, chargeback upheld</td>\n<td>Accept loss or appeal</td>\n<td>May appeal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Chargeback reason codes determine the appropriate response strategy.</strong> Fraud-related chargebacks (reason code 10.4 for Visa) require different evidence than authorization disputes (code 11.1) or processing errors (code 12.1). Understanding these codes allows automated evidence collection and response routing.</p>\n<p>Common reason categories include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fraud</strong>: Customer claims they didn&#39;t make the transaction</li>\n<li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Transaction processed without proper authorization</li>\n<li><strong>Processing Errors</strong>: Duplicate processing, wrong amount, or currency issues  </li>\n<li><strong>Consumer Disputes</strong>: Product not received, defective, or not as described</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Automated vs Manual Dispute Response</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Disputes require evidence submission within tight deadlines but manual review ensures quality</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Fully automated evidence submission based on reason codes</li>\n<li>Manual review for all disputes with staff assignment</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with automation for simple cases, manual for complex</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with automation for fraud and authorization disputes, manual review for consumer disputes</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fraud disputes have standardized evidence requirements while consumer disputes need contextual judgment about product/service delivery</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Reduces response time for high-volume fraud disputes while maintaining quality for complex cases</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The evidence collection system must gather relevant data based on the dispute type. For fraud disputes, this includes customer authentication records, device fingerprinting data, shipping confirmations, and previous successful transactions. For authorization disputes, the focus shifts to AVS (Address Verification Service) responses, CVV matches, and authorization codes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Evidence Type</th>\n<th>Fraud Disputes</th>\n<th>Authorization Disputes</th>\n<th>Consumer Disputes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Customer authentication</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shipping/delivery proof</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Product description</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Customer communication</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authorization codes</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device fingerprint</td>\n<td>Required</td>\n<td>Optional</td>\n<td>Not applicable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Dispute fees apply regardless of outcome.</strong> Most payment processors charge $15-25 per dispute even if the merchant ultimately wins. This creates a strong incentive for dispute prevention through clear billing descriptors, proactive customer service, and fraud prevention systems.</p>\n<p>The automated evidence submission system follows this workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Receive dispute notification</strong> via webhook from payment processor</li>\n<li><strong>Parse reason code and dispute details</strong> to determine evidence requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Query relevant data sources</strong> including order systems, shipping providers, and authentication logs</li>\n<li><strong>Compile evidence package</strong> according to card network specifications</li>\n<li><strong>Submit evidence</strong> through payment processor API before deadline</li>\n<li><strong>Update dispute status</strong> and schedule follow-up for network decision</li>\n<li><strong>Handle dispute resolution</strong> by updating accounting records and notifying relevant systems</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Evidence Deadlines</strong>\nDispute evidence deadlines are strictly enforced - missing a deadline by even minutes results in automatic loss. Implement alert systems that notify operations teams 48-72 hours before deadlines and automate evidence submission for standard cases. Never rely on manual processes for time-critical compliance requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"payment-accounting-ledger\">Payment Accounting Ledger</h3>\n<p><strong>Payment accounting requires double-entry bookkeeping to maintain accurate records across refunds, disputes, and fees.</strong> Think of this as maintaining a detailed bank register that tracks every penny moving in and out of your business, with each transaction affecting multiple accounts simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Traditional payment systems often use simple status fields and running balances, but this approach breaks down with complex scenarios like partial refunds, dispute fees, and chargeback reversals. A proper ledger system records each financial event as journal entries affecting multiple accounts, providing an audit trail and ensuring mathematical consistency.</p>\n<p>The core insight is that every financial event affects at least two accounts. When processing a $100 payment, we debit &quot;Customer Payments Receivable&quot; for $100 and credit &quot;Sales Revenue&quot; for $100. When refunding $30 of that payment, we debit &quot;Refunds Expense&quot; for $30 and credit &quot;Customer Refunds Payable&quot; for $30.

Payment processors provide daily settlement reports showing actual fund movements, which must match the sum of confirmed ledger entries.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Reconciliation Field</th>\n<th>Internal Calculation</th>\n<th>External Source</th>\n<th>Variance Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Gross Sales</td>\n<td>Sum of confirmed sales revenue entries</td>\n<td>Processor gross sales</td>\n<td>$0.01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total Refunds</td>\n<td>Sum of confirmed refund expense entries</td>\n<td>Processor total refunds</td>\n<td>$0.01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Processing Fees</td>\n<td>Sum of confirmed fee entries</td>\n<td>Processor fee report</td>\n<td>$0.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Settlement</td>\n<td>Gross - Refunds - Fees</td>\n<td>Processor net deposit</td>\n<td>$0.10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Settlement timing differences require careful handling.</strong> Payment processors typically settle funds 1-2 business days after transaction processing, but the exact timing varies by transaction type, risk assessment, and processor policies. The ledger must track these timing differences to provide accurate cash flow projections.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Currency Precision Errors</strong>\nStore all monetary amounts as integers in the smallest currency unit (cents for USD) to avoid floating-point precision errors. A $10.00 payment is stored as 1000 cents. This is critical for ledger accuracy - even one-cent discrepancies multiply across thousands of transactions and cause reconciliation failures.</p>\n<p>The ledger query interface provides standard reports for business operations:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Report Type</th>\n<th>Query Logic</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Daily Sales</td>\n<td>Sum confirmed sales entries by date</td>\n<td>Revenue reporting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refund Analysis</td>\n<td>Sum refunds by reason and date range</td>\n<td>Return pattern analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dispute Impact</td>\n<td>Sum dispute fees and chargebacks</td>\n<td>Loss prevention metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settlement Forecast</td>\n<td>Sum pending entries by expected settlement date</td>\n<td>Cash flow planning</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

Instead of constantly calling the provider asking &quot;has anything changed?&quot; (polling), the provider calls you immediately when something important happens to a payment. Think of it as the difference between repeatedly asking a friend &quot;are you there yet?&quot; during a road trip versus having them text you when they arrive. Webhooks eliminate the delay and uncertainty of polling while ensuring your system stays synchronized with the provider&#39;s authoritative payment state.</p>\n<p>However, this convenience comes with significant challenges. Unlike API calls that you initiate and control, webhooks arrive asynchronously from external systems over the public internet. This creates a fundamental trust problem: how do you know a webhook claiming to be from your payment provider actually came from them and wasn&#39;t forged by an attacker? Additionally, network reliability issues mean webhooks can be delivered multiple times, arrive out of order, or fail to arrive at all. Your system must handle these realities while maintaining accurate payment state.</p>\n<p>The webhook processing architecture addresses three critical concerns: <strong>authenticity</strong> (is this webhook genuine?), <strong>idempotency</strong> (can we safely process it multiple times?), and <strong>completeness</strong> (did we miss any events?). This section explores how to build a robust webhook processing pipeline that maintains payment state consistency even under adverse network conditions and potential security threats.</p>\n<h3 id=\"webhook-security-and-verification\">Webhook Security and Verification</h3>\n<p><strong>Webhook signatures</strong> serve as cryptographic proof that an incoming webhook payload was generated by your payment provider and has not been tampered with during transmission. Think of webhook signatures like the wax seal on official letters from medieval times - they provide both authentication (this came from the claimed sender) and integrity verification (the contents haven&#39;t been altered). Without signature verification, your webhook endpoint becomes a vulnerability that attackers can exploit to manipulate your payment state.</p>\n<p>The signature verification process relies on <strong>HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)</strong> cryptography. When your payment provider sends a webhook, they combine the webhook payload with a secret key (that only you and they know) and generate a cryptographic hash. This hash is included in the webhook headers. Your system performs the same calculation using the received payload and your copy of the secret key. If the hashes match, you can be confident the webhook is authentic and unmodified.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: HMAC-SHA256 for Webhook Signature Verification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to verify webhook authenticity and prevent spoofed payment notifications that could manipulate transaction state</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>No signature verification (trust all incoming webhooks)</li>\n<li>HMAC-SHA256 with timestamp validation  </li>\n<li>RSA digital signatures with certificate validation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: HMAC-SHA256 with timestamp validation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides strong cryptographic verification while remaining simple to implement. HMAC-SHA256 is the industry standard for webhook signatures (used by Stripe, PayPal, etc.). RSA signatures add complexity without meaningful security benefits for this use case. No verification is completely unacceptable for payment systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires secure webhook secret management and proper timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks. Enables confident processing of webhook events knowing they&#39;re authentic.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The webhook signature verification process follows a precise algorithm that must be implemented exactly as specified by your payment provider. Most providers include the signature in a header like <code>Stripe-Signature</code> or <code>X-Webhook-Signature</code>. The header typically contains multiple components: the timestamp when the webhook was sent, and one or more signature values computed using different versions of the signing algorithm.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Signature Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Timestamp</td>\n<td>Prevents replay attacks by limiting webhook validity window</td>\n<td><code>t=1634567890</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Primary Signature</td>\n<td>HMAC-SHA256 hash of timestamp + payload using current secret</td>\n<td><code>v1=3f5b8a7c9d...</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fallback Signature</td>\n<td>Hash using previous secret during key rotation periods</td>\n<td><code>v0=7a9c3d5f8b...</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The signature verification algorithm proceeds through several critical steps that must be executed in the correct order. First, your system extracts the timestamp and signature components from the webhook headers. The timestamp serves dual purposes: it&#39;s part of the signed payload (preventing timestamp manipulation) and enables replay attack protection by rejecting webhooks older than a configured threshold (typically 5-10 minutes).</p>\n<p>Next, your system reconstructs the signed payload exactly as the provider created it. This typically involves concatenating the timestamp, a delimiter character (usually a period), and the raw webhook payload body. It&#39;s crucial to use the raw, unmodified payload bytes - any JSON parsing, whitespace normalization, or character encoding changes will cause signature verification to fail.</p>\n<p>Your system then computes the HMAC-SHA256 hash of this reconstructed payload using your webhook secret. The resulting hash must be compared with the signature from the webhook headers using a timing-safe comparison function to prevent timing attacks. Standard string equality comparison can leak information about partial matches through execution time variations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Security Insight</strong>: Never use standard string comparison (<code>==</code>) for signature verification. Use a constant-time comparison function that always takes the same amount of time regardless of how many characters match. This prevents timing attacks where attackers could gradually deduce valid signatures by measuring response times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Timestamp validation</strong> prevents replay attacks where an attacker captures a legitimate webhook and resends it later to trigger duplicate processing. Your system should reject webhooks with timestamps older than your configured tolerance window. However, be cautious about making this window too narrow - legitimate webhooks can be delayed by network issues, provider retries, or load balancer queuing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Check</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Rejection Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Timestamp Age</td>\n<td>Within last 10 minutes</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request with &quot;Webhook too old&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature Format</td>\n<td>Valid header format with t= and v1= components</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request with &quot;Invalid signature format&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature Match</td>\n<td>HMAC matches computed value</td>\n<td>401 Unauthorized with &quot;Invalid signature&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payload Size</td>\n<td>Within reasonable limits (typically 1MB)</td>\n<td>413 Payload Too Large</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The webhook secret itself requires careful management. It should be stored securely (environment variables, secrets management systems) and never logged or included in error messages. Payment providers typically allow webhook secret rotation, which requires your system to support multiple secrets during transition periods. During rotation, providers may include signatures computed with both old and new secrets, allowing your system to verify using either one.</p>\n<p><strong>Rate limiting and IP allowlisting</strong> provide additional security layers. Payment providers typically send webhooks from specific IP address ranges that you can allowlist. However, these ranges can change, so IP allowlisting should supplement, not replace, signature verification. Rate limiting prevents abuse if your webhook endpoint is discovered by attackers, but be careful not to block legitimate webhook bursts during high-volume periods.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Signature Verification Bypass in Development</strong>\nMany developers disable signature verification in development environments for convenience, then accidentally deploy this configuration to production. This creates a critical security vulnerability where attackers can manipulate payment state by sending fake webhooks. Always enforce signature verification in all environments - use test webhook secrets in development, never skip verification entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"event-processing-pipeline\">Event Processing Pipeline</h3>\n<p>The <strong>event processing pipeline</strong> transforms incoming webhook notifications into reliable updates to your payment system&#39;s state. Think of this pipeline like a factory assembly line for processing mail - incoming packages (webhooks) must be inspected for authenticity, sorted by type, checked for duplicates, processed according to their contents, and tracked to ensure nothing gets lost. Each stage has specific responsibilities and failure modes that must be handled gracefully.</p>\n<p>The pipeline operates on a fundamental principle: <strong>at-least-once delivery semantics</strong>. Payment providers will retry failed webhook deliveries, potentially multiple times over several hours or days. This means your system will likely receive duplicate webhooks for the same event. Rather than trying to prevent duplicates (which is impossible to guarantee), your system must be <strong>idempotent</strong> - processing the same webhook multiple times should produce the same final state as processing it once.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Database-First Webhook Processing with Explicit Deduplication</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to handle duplicate webhook deliveries reliably while ensuring payment state updates are never lost or applied incorrectly</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>In-memory deduplication with immediate event processing</li>\n<li>Database-first with explicit deduplication table</li>\n<li>Message queue with exactly-once delivery guarantees</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Database-first with explicit deduplication table</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides durability guarantees by persisting webhooks before processing. Database transactions ensure atomic deduplication and state updates. Message queues add complexity and external dependencies without solving the core idempotency challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful transaction management and proper indexing for webhook deduplication. Enables reliable processing with clear audit trails of all webhook events.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The webhook processing flow begins with <strong>webhook receipt and persistence</strong>. When a webhook arrives at your endpoint, the first action is to persist it to your database with a unique identifier, timestamp, and processing status. This creates a permanent audit trail and ensures no webhook can be lost due to process crashes or network failures. The webhook record captures all essential metadata needed for processing and debugging.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>WebhookEvent Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td>Unique webhook identifier</td>\n<td><code>wh_1234567890abcdef</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>event_type</code></td>\n<td>Type of payment event</td>\n<td><code>payment_intent.succeeded</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>payload</code></td>\n<td>Complete webhook payload</td>\n<td><code>{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;pi_...&quot;, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;succeeded&quot;}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>signature</code></td>\n<td>Webhook signature for verification</td>\n<td><code>t=1634567890,v1=3f5b8a...</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processed_at</code></td>\n<td>When processing completed successfully</td>\n<td><code>2023-10-15T14:30:00Z</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processing_attempts</code></td>\n<td>Number of processing attempts</td>\n<td><code>2</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>last_processing_error</code></td>\n<td>Most recent processing error</td>\n<td><code>&quot;Payment intent not found&quot;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>source_ip</code></td>\n<td>IP address of webhook sender</td>\n<td><code>54.187.174.169</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>created_at</code></td>\n<td>When webhook was received</td>\n<td><code>2023-10-15T14:29:45Z</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Event deduplication</strong> prevents duplicate processing when the same webhook is delivered multiple times. The challenge is determining webhook uniqueness - you cannot rely solely on the webhook ID from the provider because different event types might reuse IDs, and some providers don&#39;t include stable IDs. Instead, create a composite deduplication key combining the provider webhook ID, event type, and resource ID (like payment intent ID).</p>\n<p>The deduplication process works by attempting to insert a webhook record with a unique constraint on the deduplication key. If the insert succeeds, this is the first time you&#39;ve seen this webhook, and processing should continue. If the insert fails due to a duplicate key violation, you&#39;ve already processed this webhook, and you should return success immediately without further processing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: Webhook deduplication must happen at the database level using unique constraints, not application-level checks. Application-level checks are subject to race conditions where concurrent webhook deliveries could both pass the duplicate check before either commits their processing transaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Event ordering and causality</strong> present complex challenges because webhooks can arrive out of order due to network delays, provider retry logic, or load balancer routing. For example, you might receive a <code>charge.succeeded</code> webhook before the corresponding <code>payment_intent.processing</code> webhook. Your processing logic must handle these ordering issues gracefully.</p>\n<p>One approach is to implement <strong>causal dependency checking</strong> where each webhook processing step verifies that prerequisite events have occurred. For instance, before processing <code>charge.succeeded</code>, verify that the payment intent exists and is in a state that allows charge completion. If prerequisites aren&#39;t met, defer processing using exponential backoff until dependencies are satisfied or timeout occurs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Processing State</th>\n<th>Next Action</th>\n<th>Retry Schedule</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>pending</code></td>\n<td>Attempt initial processing</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>retrying</code></td>\n<td>Retry with exponential backoff</td>\n<td>1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>failed</code></td>\n<td>Manual review required</td>\n<td>None (alert operations)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>processed</code></td>\n<td>No further action</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>deferred</code></td>\n<td>Wait for dependencies</td>\n<td>Check every 30s for 10 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>event processing handler</strong> contains the business logic that applies webhook events to your payment system state. This handler must be implemented as an idempotent transaction that can be safely repeated. The handler pattern typically follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parse and validate</strong> the webhook payload against expected schema for the event type</li>\n<li><strong>Load current state</strong> of the relevant payment entities (payment intent, charge, refund, etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>Validate state transitions</strong> to ensure the webhook event represents a legal state change</li>\n<li><strong>Update entity state</strong> with new information from the webhook</li>\n<li><strong>Persist state changes</strong> and mark webhook as processed within a single database transaction</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger downstream actions</strong> like sending customer notifications or updating analytics</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Concurrent processing</strong> requires careful consideration because multiple webhooks for the same payment might arrive simultaneously. Use database row-level locking or optimistic concurrency control to ensure consistent state updates. Pessimistic locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) guarantees exclusive access but can create deadlocks under high concurrency. Optimistic locking using version numbers allows higher concurrency but requires retry logic when conflicts occur.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Webhook Processing Outside Database Transactions</strong>\nProcessing webhook events outside of database transactions creates race conditions where webhook processing can succeed but state updates fail, or vice versa. This leads to webhook events being marked as processed when they actually weren&#39;t, or payment state becoming inconsistent with provider state. Always wrap webhook processing and state updates in a single atomic transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Error handling and retry logic</strong> must distinguish between transient failures (database connection timeout, external service unavailable) and permanent failures (malformed webhook payload, invalid state transition). Transient failures should trigger exponential backoff retries with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. Permanent failures should be logged, marked for manual review, and not retried automatically.</p>\n<p>The retry mechanism should implement <strong>circuit breaker</strong> patterns to prevent cascading failures when downstream systems are unhealthy. If webhook processing consistently fails for a period, temporarily stop processing webhooks to allow systems to recover, while continuing to accept and store incoming webhooks for later processing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"state-reconciliation-logic\">State Reconciliation Logic</h3>\n<p><strong>State reconciliation</strong> serves as the safety net that ensures your payment system&#39;s local state remains consistent with the authoritative state maintained by your payment provider. Think of reconciliation like balancing a checkbook - you periodically compare your records against the bank&#39;s official statement to identify and correct any discrepancies. In payment systems, these discrepancies can occur due to missed webhooks, processing failures, network partitions, or provider-side issues.</p>\n<p>The reconciliation process operates on a fundamental assumption: <strong>the payment provider&#39;s state is authoritative</strong>. When discrepancies are discovered between your local records and the provider&#39;s records, your system should generally defer to the provider&#39;s version and update local state accordingly. However, this process requires careful handling to avoid overwriting legitimate local state changes or creating inconsistent audit trails.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Periodic Pull-Based Reconciliation with Event-Driven Triggers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to detect and correct payment state inconsistencies that arise from missed webhooks, processing failures, or provider-side issues</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Real-time reconciliation on every payment operation</li>\n<li>Periodic batch reconciliation with fixed schedules  </li>\n<li>Event-driven reconciliation triggered by anomalies</li>\n<li>Hybrid periodic + event-driven approach</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid periodic + event-driven approach</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Periodic reconciliation provides systematic coverage of all payments. Event-driven reconciliation enables rapid correction of detected inconsistencies. Real-time reconciliation is too expensive for every operation. Fixed schedules miss urgent corrections.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires maintaining reconciliation schedules and anomaly detection logic. Provides comprehensive consistency guarantees with efficient resource usage.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reconciliation triggers</strong> determine when your system initiates state synchronization with the payment provider. Multiple trigger types work together to provide comprehensive coverage while optimizing for different scenarios and urgency levels.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Reconciliation Trigger</th>\n<th>Frequency</th>\n<th>Scope</th>\n<th>Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Scheduled Full Scan</td>\n<td>Daily at 2 AM</td>\n<td>All payments from last 30 days</td>\n<td>Systematic consistency checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scheduled Incremental</td>\n<td>Every 4 hours</td>\n<td>Payments updated in last 24 hours</td>\n<td>Recent payment verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Webhook Processing Failure</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Single payment entity</td>\n<td>Rapid error correction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Customer Service Request</td>\n<td>On-demand</td>\n<td>Customer&#39;s payment history</td>\n<td>Support case resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Payment State Anomaly</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Related payment entities</td>\n<td>Automated inconsistency detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider Status Page Alert</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>All active payments</td>\n<td>Provider incident response</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>reconciliation algorithm</strong> follows a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and resolve state differences. The process begins by fetching current state from both your local database and the payment provider&#39;s API for a specific set of payment entities. The comparison logic must handle the complexities of different data formats, field mappings, and temporal consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>State comparison logic</strong> examines multiple dimensions of payment entity state to identify meaningful differences. Simple field-by-field comparison is insufficient because providers often return additional metadata, different timestamp formats, or normalized values that don&#39;t exactly match your stored data. The comparison focuses on semantically significant differences that indicate actual state inconsistencies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Comparison Dimension</th>\n<th>Local Source</th>\n<th>Provider Source</th>\n<th>Reconciliation Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Payment Status</td>\n<td><code>payment_intent.status</code></td>\n<td><code>payment_intent.status</code></td>\n<td>Update if provider differs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charge Amount</td>\n<td><code>charge.amount</code></td>\n<td><code>charge.amount_captured</code></td>\n<td>Flag if mismatch exceeds tolerance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refund Total</td>\n<td>Sum of <code>refund.amount</code></td>\n<td><code>charge.amount_refunded</code></td>\n<td>Update local refund records</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settlement Status</td>\n<td><code>charge.settled_at</code></td>\n<td><code>charge.paid</code></td>\n<td>Update settlement timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Reason</td>\n<td><code>charge.failure_code</code></td>\n<td><code>charge.outcome.reason</code></td>\n<td>Update failure details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Metadata Changes</td>\n<td><code>payment_intent.metadata</code></td>\n<td><code>payment_intent.metadata</code></td>\n<td>Merge non-conflicting updates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The reconciliation process must handle <strong>temporal consistency challenges</strong> where state differences result from legitimate timing delays rather than actual inconsistencies. For example, a payment that shows as <code>processing</code> in your local system but <code>succeeded</code> at the provider might simply reflect normal processing delays rather than a missed webhook. The reconciliation logic should account for reasonable timing windows before treating status differences as inconsistencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflict resolution strategies</strong> define how to handle different types of state discrepancies. The strategy depends on the nature of the difference, the confidence level in local versus provider data, and the potential business impact of incorrect resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reconciliation Conflict Resolution Principles</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provider Authority</strong>: When in doubt, the provider&#39;s state takes precedence for payment status and financial amounts</li>\n<li><strong>Audit Preservation</strong>: Never overwrite local records - create new records with reconciliation metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Business Logic Validation</strong>: Ensure state changes don&#39;t violate business rules or create inconsistent customer experience</li>\n<li><strong>Human Review Required</strong>: Flag complex conflicts for manual review rather than making potentially incorrect automated decisions</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Batch reconciliation processing</strong> optimizes performance when reconciling large numbers of payment entities. Rather than making individual API calls for each payment, batch operations group multiple payment IDs into single provider API requests. This approach reduces API rate limit consumption and improves overall reconciliation performance.</p>\n<p>The batch processing algorithm chunks payment entities into appropriately sized groups (typically 50-100 entities per batch), makes parallel API requests with appropriate rate limiting, and processes results in transaction batches to maintain consistency. Failed batches are retried with exponential backoff, and individual payment failures within successful batches are handled separately.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Batch Processing Parameter</th>\n<th>Recommended Value</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Batch Size</td>\n<td>50-100 payment entities</td>\n<td>Balances API efficiency with memory usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrent Batches</td>\n<td>3-5 parallel requests</td>\n<td>Respects rate limits while improving throughput</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Retry Attempts</td>\n<td>3 attempts with exponential backoff</td>\n<td>Handles transient API failures gracefully</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transaction Size</td>\n<td>500 database operations</td>\n<td>Balances transaction performance with lock duration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Progress Checkpointing</td>\n<td>Every 1000 processed entities</td>\n<td>Enables resumption after process interruption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Reconciliation result handling</strong> processes the outcomes of state comparison and applies appropriate corrections to local payment state. The handling logic must maintain audit trails, update related entities consistently, and trigger appropriate downstream actions like customer notifications or accounting updates.</p>\n<p>When reconciliation identifies state differences, the correction process creates detailed audit records documenting the discrepancy, the resolution action taken, and the source of authoritative data. These audit records are essential for debugging webhook processing issues, identifying provider-side problems, and maintaining compliance with financial record-keeping requirements.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Reconciliation Infinite Loops</strong>\nPoorly designed reconciliation logic can create infinite loops where corrections made during reconciliation trigger webhook events that cause the system to revert changes, which then triggers another reconciliation cycle. Prevent this by adding reconciliation metadata to updated records and checking for recent reconciliation activity before making corrections.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconciliation monitoring and alerting</strong> tracks the health of the reconciliation process and identifies trends that might indicate systemic issues. Key metrics include reconciliation success rates, types and frequencies of state discrepancies, and time-to-correction for identified inconsistencies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Reconciliation Metric</th>\n<th>Alert Threshold</th>\n<th>Possible Causes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Discrepancy Rate</td>\n<td>&gt;1% of reconciled payments</td>\n<td>Webhook processing issues, provider problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failed Reconciliation Rate</td>\n<td>&gt;5% of reconciliation attempts</td>\n<td>API connectivity, authentication issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High-Value Discrepancies</td>\n<td>Any amount &gt;$1000</td>\n<td>Critical payment processing failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reconciliation Duration</td>\n<td>&gt;2 hours for daily reconciliation</td>\n<td>Performance degradation, rate limiting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consecutive Failures</td>\n<td>3 failed reconciliation attempts</td>\n<td>Persistent system or provider issues</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The reconciliation system should also provide <strong>manual reconciliation tools</strong> for customer service teams and system operators.

Just as the conductor coordinates when the violins, trumpets, and drums each contribute to the symphony, our payment gateway coordinates when the payment intent manager, processing engine, webhook handler, and external providers each execute their responsibilities. The difference is that in payments, a missed note or wrong timing can mean lost money or compliance violations - so the coordination must be absolutely precise and recoverable.</p>\n<p>This section details how all system components communicate with each other, the exact message formats they exchange, and the precise sequence of operations for both successful and error scenarios. Understanding these interactions is critical because payment processing involves multiple external services, asynchronous operations, and strict consistency requirements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Payment Gateway System Architecture\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"complete-payment-flow-sequence\">Complete Payment Flow Sequence</h3>\n<p>The complete payment flow represents the &quot;happy path&quot; - when everything works correctly from payment intent creation through final webhook confirmation.

Unlike typical web applications where a failed request can simply return an error, payment systems deal with real money where failures have financial consequences. A network timeout during payment processing doesn&#39;t just mean &quot;try again later&quot; - it creates uncertainty about whether money actually moved, requiring sophisticated reconciliation to resolve.</p>\n<p>The mental model for payment error handling resembles air traffic control systems: multiple redundant safety mechanisms, clear protocols for every failure scenario, and the ability to maintain safe operations even when individual components fail. Just as air traffic controllers have backup communication systems and predetermined procedures for radio failures, payment systems need comprehensive error handling strategies that account for partial failures, network partitions, and provider outages.</p>\n<p>This section establishes the error handling foundation that makes payment processing reliable across all system components. Every payment operation - from creating intents with idempotency keys to processing webhooks - depends on these error handling patterns to maintain data consistency and financial accuracy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flowchart.svg\" alt=\"Payment Error Handling Decision Tree\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"failure-mode-analysis\">Failure Mode Analysis</h3>\n<p>Payment systems face a complex landscape of potential failures, each requiring specific detection and recovery strategies. Understanding these failure modes is crucial because payment operations are inherently distributed - they involve coordination between your application, external payment providers, issuing banks, and card networks. Each integration point introduces new failure possibilities.</p>\n<p>The failure taxonomy for payment systems differs fundamentally from typical web applications. While a failed web request might inconvenience a user, a failed payment operation can result in money being charged without goods delivered, refunds being processed twice, or chargebacks going uncontested. This makes comprehensive failure analysis not just good engineering practice, but a business necessity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"network-and-communication-failures\">Network and Communication Failures</h4>\n<p>Network failures represent the most common category of payment processing issues.

payment intent &amp; idempotency (Milestone 1), payment processing &amp; 3DS (Milestone 2), refunds &amp; disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Testing a payment processing system presents unique challenges that go far beyond typical web application testing. Think of testing a payment gateway like testing a bank&#39;s ATM network - you need to verify not just that money moves correctly under normal conditions, but that the system maintains integrity during network partitions, handles fraud attempts gracefully, and never loses track of a single cent even when external systems fail unexpectedly. The stakes are high: a bug that allows duplicate charges could cost thousands in chargebacks, while a vulnerability that exposes card data could trigger PCI compliance violations and regulatory penalties.</p>\n<p>The mental model for payment system testing combines three distinct testing philosophies. First, <strong>state machine verification</strong> ensures payment intents transition through their lifecycle correctly and can never reach invalid states. Second, <strong>external dependency simulation</strong> validates behavior when payment providers are slow, unavailable, or return unexpected responses. Third, <strong>consistency verification</strong> confirms that money tracking remains accurate across all possible failure scenarios, including partial network failures and race conditions.</p>\n<p>Payment systems operate in an eventually consistent distributed environment where webhooks can arrive out of order, network requests can timeout after succeeding on the provider side, and external systems can enter maintenance mode during critical payment flows. Your testing strategy must account for these realities while providing confidence that the core business logic - moving money safely and accurately - remains bulletproof under all conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-test-scenarios\">Core Test Scenarios</h3>\n<p>The foundation of payment system testing rests on comprehensive scenario coverage that spans happy path flows, systematic error injection, and edge case validation. Each test scenario maps to specific business risks and technical failure modes that could compromise payment integrity or user experience.</p>\n<h4 id=\"happy-path-test-categories\">Happy Path Test Categories</h4>\n<p><strong>Payment Intent Creation and Management</strong> testing validates the core payment intent lifecycle from creation through completion.

Think of debugging a payment gateway like being a detective investigating a crime scene - you need to collect evidence from multiple sources, understand the timeline of events, and piece together what happened when things go wrong. Unlike simple web applications where errors are often isolated to a single component, payment systems involve intricate dances between your application, external payment providers, card networks, and issuing banks. A single payment can touch dozens of systems, each with their own failure modes and timing constraints.</p>\n<p>The complexity multiplies when you consider that payment processing is inherently asynchronous - a charge might appear to succeed locally but fail at the network level hours later, or a webhook might arrive out of order, causing your local state to diverge from reality. This section provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving the most common issues encountered when building production payment systems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/payment-gateway/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flowchart.svg\" alt=\"Payment Error Handling Decision Tree\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"common-payment-processing-bugs\">Common Payment Processing Bugs</h3>\n<p>Payment processing bugs typically fall into three categories: idempotency violations, state management inconsistencies, and provider integration failures. Each category has distinct symptoms and requires different debugging approaches.</p>\n<h4 id=\"idempotency-implementation-issues\">Idempotency Implementation Issues</h4>\n<p>Idempotency bugs are among the most dangerous in payment systems because they can lead to duplicate charges - the cardinal sin of payment processing. These issues often manifest subtly and may not be detected until customers report unexpected charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of idempotency like a notary&#39;s seal on a legal document. Once a document is notarized with a specific seal number, using that same seal number again should either return the exact same document or reject the request entirely. You can&#39;t create a different document with the same seal - that would be forgery.</p>\n<p>The most common idempotency pitfall occurs when developers focus only on preventing duplicate database inserts but fail to validate that the new request parameters match the original request.

The key is distinguishing between transient failures that warrant retries and permanent failures that require different handling.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of provider integration like international shipping. Sometimes packages get delayed due to weather (transient failure) - you wait and they eventually arrive. Sometimes packages get lost or damaged (permanent failure) - you need to file insurance claims and send replacements.

Webhook failures often compound over time, creating cascading inconsistencies that become harder to resolve as they age.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of webhook debugging like investigating a postal delivery failure. You need to verify that the sender actually sent the package (check provider logs), that it arrived at your address (check your server logs), that the signature matches the sender (verify HMAC), and that you processed it correctly (check your application state). If any step fails, you need different recovery strategies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"webhook-delivery-verification\">Webhook Delivery Verification</h4>\n<p>The first step in webhook debugging is confirming that webhooks are actually being sent by the provider and received by your system.

The seal uses a special pattern that only the manufacturer knows how to create, but anyone can verify it&#39;s authentic. If the seal is broken, missing, or doesn&#39;t match the expected pattern, you know something&#39;s wrong - but you need to figure out if the problem is with the seal creation, delivery, or your verification process.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Verification Failure</th>\n<th>Likely Cause</th>\n<th>Debugging Steps</th>\n<th>Resolution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>All webhooks fail signature check</td>\n<td>Wrong signing secret</td>\n<td>Compare secret with provider dashboard</td>\n<td>Update webhook signing secret</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermittent signature failures</td>\n<td>Payload modification in transit</td>\n<td>Log raw payload bytes, check middleware</td>\n<td>Disable payload modification middleware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature valid but payload corrupted</td>\n<td>Character encoding issues</td>\n<td>Check Content-Type header, log hex dump</td>\n<td>Ensure UTF-8 handling throughout stack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signature fails only for specific events</td>\n<td>Event-specific payload format</td>\n<td>Compare working vs failing event structures</td>\n<td>Update signature computation for edge cases</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Middleware Modifying Webhook Payloads</strong>\nMany web frameworks include middleware that automatically processes request bodies - decompressing gzip content, normalizing line endings, or parsing JSON.

The key to resolving them is systematic detection, classification, and remediation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of state reconciliation like balancing a checkbook against bank statements. Your local records are like your checkbook register - they reflect what you think happened based on the transactions you recorded.

Extensions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Foundation for future development - architectural patterns established across all milestones enable scaling to multi-provider support, subscription billing, marketplace payments, and advanced fraud detection capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The current payment gateway implementation provides a solid foundation for processing individual transactions, handling refunds, and managing webhook reconciliation. However, real-world payment systems often require additional capabilities that extend far beyond basic transaction processing. This section explores the architectural patterns and design considerations needed to evolve our payment gateway into a comprehensive financial platform capable of supporting complex business models and enterprise-scale operations.</p>\n<p>Think of our current payment system as a well-built bicycle - it handles the core transportation need effectively, but different journeys require different vehicles. A delivery service needs trucks with multiple compartments, a taxi service needs cars with passenger management systems, and a logistics company needs a fleet management system coordinating multiple vehicles. Similarly, our payment gateway needs different architectural extensions for different business requirements: multi-provider support for reliability and cost optimization, subscription billing for recurring revenue models, marketplace payments for multi-party transactions, and fraud detection for risk management.</p>\n<p>The key insight driving these extensions is that each new capability should build upon our existing foundation rather than replacing it. The <code>PaymentIntent</code> state machine, idempotency controls, webhook reconciliation, and error handling patterns we&#39;ve established provide the architectural skeleton onto which we can attach new functionality. This approach ensures consistency across features while allowing each extension to solve its specific domain problems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Principle</strong>: Extensions should enhance the core payment processing engine without fundamentally altering its reliability guarantees or introducing architectural complexity that compromises the basic transaction flow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"multi-provider-architecture\">Multi-Provider Architecture</h3>\n<p>Modern payment processing demands resilience, cost optimization, and geographic coverage that no single payment provider can deliver comprehensively. Think of multi-provider architecture like having multiple internet service providers for a critical data center - each provider has different strengths, coverage areas, cost structures, and reliability characteristics. When processing payments across different regions, currencies, or payment methods, routing transactions to the optimal provider while maintaining consistent behavior requires careful architectural design.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in multi-provider architecture is maintaining our existing <code>PaymentIntent</code> abstraction while introducing provider-specific behaviors, capabilities, and error conditions. Our current system directly integrates with a single provider&#39;s API, making assumptions about response formats, webhook signatures, and transaction lifecycle timing. Extending to multiple providers requires introducing an abstraction layer that normalizes these differences while preserving provider-specific optimizations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"provider-abstraction-layer-design\">Provider Abstraction Layer Design</h4>\n<p>The provider abstraction layer serves as the translation boundary between our domain model and provider-specific implementations. Consider how a universal remote control abstracts different television manufacturers&#39; control protocols - it presents consistent buttons (power, volume, channel) while translating each button press into manufacturer-specific infrared signals. Similarly, our provider abstraction translates standardized payment operations into provider-specific API calls.</p>\n<p>The abstraction centers around a <code>PaymentProvider</code> interface that defines the essential operations every provider must support, regardless of their underlying implementation differences:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>create_payment_intent</code></td>\n<td><code>amount</code>, <code>currency</code>, <code>metadata</code>, <code>idempotency_key</code></td>\n<td><code>ProviderPaymentIntent</code></td>\n<td>Creates payment intent with provider-specific details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>create_charge</code></td>\n<td><code>payment_intent_id</code>, <code>payment_method_token</code>, <code>return_url</code></td>\n<td><code>ProviderChargeResponse</code></td>\n<td>Initiates charge processing with authentication flow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>confirm_payment</code></td>\n<td><code>provider_charge_id</code>, <code>authentication_token</code></td>\n<td><code>ProviderChargeResponse</code></td>\n<td>Completes 3D Secure authentication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>create_refund</code></td>\n<td><code>provider_charge_id</code>, <code>amount</code>, <code>reason</code></td>\n<td><code>ProviderRefundResponse</code></td>\n<td>Processes full or partial refund</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>get_payment_status</code></td>\n<td><code>provider_payment_id</code></td>\n<td><code>ProviderPaymentStatus</code></td>\n<td>Retrieves current payment state for reconciliation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>verify_webhook_signature</code></td>\n<td><code>payload</code>, <code>signature_header</code>, <code>secret</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Validates webhook authenticity using provider&#39;s method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>parse_webhook_event</code></td>\n<td><code>payload</code>, <code>event_type</code></td>\n<td><code>StandardWebhookEvent</code></td>\n<td>Normalizes provider webhook into standard format</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Each provider implementation encapsulates the specific API client, authentication mechanisms, request/response transformations, and error code mappings needed for that provider. This encapsulation allows the core payment processing engine to remain unchanged while supporting dramatically different provider architectures.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Provider Interface Abstraction</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Multiple payment providers have different API designs, authentication methods, and data formats, but our core payment processing logic should remain consistent</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Direct provider switching, adapter pattern, strategy pattern</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Strategy pattern with provider interface abstraction</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Strategy pattern allows runtime provider selection while maintaining type safety and testability; adapter pattern would require creating adapters for each provider combination; direct switching would require conditional logic throughout the payment engine</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clean separation of provider-specific logic, easy testing with mock providers, but requires careful design of the abstraction to avoid lowest-common-denominator limitations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"provider-selection-strategy\">Provider Selection Strategy</h4>\n<p>Selecting the optimal provider for each transaction requires a decision engine that evaluates multiple factors including transaction characteristics, provider capabilities, cost structures, and current system health. Think of this like routing network traffic through different internet service providers - the router considers latency, bandwidth, cost, and current congestion to select the best path for each packet.</p>\n<p>The provider selection strategy operates through a configurable rule engine that evaluates selection criteria in priority order:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Selection Criteria</th>\n<th>Evaluation Logic</th>\n<th>Example Rules</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Geographic Routing</strong></td>\n<td>Match customer billing country to provider coverage</td>\n<td>Route EU customers to European acquirer for lower interchange fees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Currency Support</strong></td>\n<td>Verify provider supports transaction currency with favorable rates</td>\n<td>Use local acquiring for same-currency transactions to minimize conversion costs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Payment Method</strong></td>\n<td>Match payment method capabilities (cards, bank transfers, wallets)</td>\n<td>Route Apple Pay to provider with direct Apple Pay integration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Transaction Amount</strong></td>\n<td>Consider provider fee structures and processing limits</td>\n<td>Route high-value transactions to provider with lower percentage fees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Provider Health</strong></td>\n<td>Evaluate current success rates, latency, and circuit breaker status</td>\n<td>Avoid providers experiencing elevated decline rates or API timeouts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Business Rules</strong></td>\n<td>Apply merchant-specific routing preferences or compliance requirements</td>\n<td>Route transactions from specific MCC codes to compliant processors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The selection engine maintains real-time metrics for each provider, including success rates, average processing times, and current error rates. These metrics feed into the decision algorithm, automatically shifting traffic away from providers experiencing issues while maintaining detailed audit logs for analysis.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Provider Selection Algorithm:\n1. Filter providers by hard requirements (currency support, payment method, geographic licensing)\n2. Apply business rules and compliance constraints to remaining providers\n3. Evaluate each qualifying provider using weighted scoring (cost 40%, reliability 30%, performance 30%)\n4. Select highest-scoring provider unless circuit breaker indicates unavailability\n5. Log selection decision with full scoring breakdown for analysis\n6. Fall back to secondary provider if primary selection fails during transaction processing</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"provider-health-monitoring\">Provider Health Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Maintaining optimal routing decisions requires continuous monitoring of provider performance, reliability, and cost effectiveness. Consider how a traffic management system monitors highway conditions - it tracks congestion levels, accident reports, construction delays, and weather conditions to provide real-time routing recommendations. Similarly, provider health monitoring tracks multiple dimensions of provider performance to inform routing decisions.</p>\n<p>The monitoring system collects metrics across several key dimensions:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Category</th>\n<th>Key Indicators</th>\n<th>Update Frequency</th>\n<th>Decision Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Success Rates</strong></td>\n<td>Authorization success, settlement success, 3DS completion</td>\n<td>Real-time per transaction</td>\n<td>Primary routing factor - avoid providers with declining success</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Performance</strong></td>\n<td>API response times, 3DS redirect latency, settlement timing</td>\n<td>Per API call</td>\n<td>Secondary factor - prefer faster providers for time-sensitive flows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cost Analysis</strong></td>\n<td>Effective interchange rates, provider fees, currency conversion</td>\n<td>Daily batch analysis</td>\n<td>Strategic factor - optimize for total cost of processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Compliance Status</strong></td>\n<td>PCI certification status, regional licensing, fraud monitoring</td>\n<td>Weekly validation</td>\n<td>Hard constraint - disable non-compliant providers immediately</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Provider health monitoring integrates with our existing circuit breaker patterns, automatically removing unhealthy providers from the selection pool while implementing gradual recovery testing. When a provider&#39;s performance degrades below acceptable thresholds, the system reduces traffic allocation progressively rather than immediately blacklisting the provider, allowing for temporary issues to resolve without overreacting to transient problems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-payment-features\">Advanced Payment Features</h3>\n<p>Beyond basic transaction processing, modern payment systems support sophisticated business models that require specialized payment flows, billing cycles, and multi-party transaction management. These advanced features build upon our core payment infrastructure while introducing new domain concepts and state management requirements.</p>\n<h4 id=\"subscription-billing-architecture\">Subscription Billing Architecture</h4>\n<p>Subscription billing transforms one-time payment processing into a recurring revenue management system. Think of subscription billing like a magazine subscription service - instead of purchasing individual issues, customers commit to receiving regular deliveries with automatic payment processing, while the service manages billing cycles, prorated charges, plan changes, and renewal notifications.</p>\n<p>The subscription billing architecture introduces new domain entities that extend our existing payment model:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Entity</th>\n<th>Key Fields</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Subscription</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>customer_id</code>, <code>plan_id</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>current_period_start</code>, <code>current_period_end</code>, <code>payment_method_token</code></td>\n<td>Core subscription configuration with billing cycle timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SubscriptionPlan</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>amount</code>, <code>currency</code>, <code>interval</code>, <code>interval_count</code>, <code>trial_period_days</code></td>\n<td>Billing plan template defining pricing and frequency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>BillingCycle</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>subscription_id</code>, <code>period_start</code>, <code>period_end</code>, <code>amount_due</code>, <code>status</code></td>\n<td>Individual billing period with payment tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Usage</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>subscription_id</code>, <code>metric_name</code>, <code>quantity</code>, <code>billing_cycle_id</code></td>\n<td>Usage-based billing tracking for metered subscriptions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SubscriptionInvoice</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>subscription_id</code>, <code>billing_cycle_id</code>, <code>line_items</code>, <code>total_amount</code>, <code>due_date</code></td>\n<td>Detailed billing statement with itemized charges</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The subscription billing engine orchestrates complex lifecycle management including trial periods, plan upgrades, prorated billing adjustments, and failed payment recovery. Each billing cycle generates a <code>PaymentIntent</code> using our existing infrastructure, ensuring subscription payments benefit from the same idempotency controls, 3D Secure authentication, and webhook reconciliation as one-time transactions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Subscription State Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Subscriptions have complex lifecycle states (trial, active, past_due, canceled) with different billing rules and customer communication requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Extend PaymentIntent states, separate subscription state machine, event-driven state management</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate subscription state machine with event-driven transitions</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Subscription states operate on different timescales than payment states; separating concerns allows subscription logic to evolve independently while maintaining payment processing reliability</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clean separation of billing and payment concerns, easier testing and debugging, but requires careful coordination between subscription and payment state machines</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"marketplace-payment-architecture\">Marketplace Payment Architecture</h4>\n<p>Marketplace payments enable multi-party transactions where funds flow from buyers to sellers through the marketplace platform, with the platform collecting fees and handling compliance obligations. Consider how a real estate transaction involves multiple parties - the buyer, seller, real estate agents, escrow company, and title company - each with different roles, fee structures, and payout timing requirements.</p>\n<p>Marketplace payments introduce the concept of <strong>connected accounts</strong> and <strong>transfer groups</strong> that extend our payment model to support complex fund distribution:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Entity</th>\n<th>Key Fields</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ConnectedAccount</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>marketplace_id</code>, <code>account_holder_id</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>capabilities</code>, <code>verification_status</code></td>\n<td>Seller account with platform verification and capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TransferGroup</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>payment_intent_id</code>, <code>total_amount</code>, <code>platform_fee</code>, <code>status</code></td>\n<td>Group of related transfers from single payment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Transfer</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>transfer_group_id</code>, <code>destination_account_id</code>, <code>amount</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>status</code></td>\n<td>Individual transfer to connected account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>PlatformFee</code></td>\n<td><code>id</code>, <code>transfer_id</code>, <code>fee_type</code>, <code>amount</code>, <code>description</code></td>\n<td>Platform fees collected from transfer</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The marketplace payment flow coordinates multiple operations atomically - authorizing the full payment amount from the buyer, distributing funds to sellers after deducting platform fees, handling tax reporting requirements, and managing payout schedules. This coordination requires careful orchestration to ensure all parties receive correct amounts while maintaining audit trails for financial reconciliation.</p>\n<p>Marketplace payments also introduce complex compliance requirements including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KYC (Know Your Customer) verification</strong> for connected accounts before enabling payouts</li>\n<li><strong>Tax reporting</strong> for seller earnings and platform fees across multiple jurisdictions  </li>\n<li><strong>Funds flow transparency</strong> allowing buyers and sellers to track payment distribution</li>\n<li><strong>Dispute management</strong> handling conflicts between buyers, sellers, and the platform</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong> meeting marketplace-specific regulations like payment service provider licensing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"fraud-detection-integration\">Fraud Detection Integration</h4>\n<p>Advanced payment systems require sophisticated fraud detection capabilities that analyze transaction patterns, customer behavior, and external risk signals to identify potentially fraudulent activity. Think of fraud detection like an airport security system - it uses multiple screening mechanisms (ID verification, X-ray scanning, behavioral observation) to identify potential threats while minimizing disruption to legitimate travelers.</p>\n<p>Fraud detection integration operates through a <strong>risk scoring pipeline</strong> that evaluates each transaction against multiple risk factors:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Category</th>\n<th>Analysis Factors</th>\n<th>Risk Signals</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Transaction Patterns</strong></td>\n<td>Amount relative to customer history, frequency of transactions, time-of-day patterns</td>\n<td>Sudden large transactions, unusual transaction timing, velocity violations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Device Fingerprinting</strong></td>\n<td>Browser characteristics, IP address, device ID persistence</td>\n<td>New device usage, proxy/VPN detection, device spoofing indicators</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Geographic Analysis</strong></td>\n<td>Billing vs shipping address, IP geolocation, known high-risk countries</td>\n<td>Address mismatches, impossible travel patterns, high-risk jurisdictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Payment Method Validation</strong></td>\n<td>Card BIN analysis, payment method age, previous decline history</td>\n<td>New payment method usage, stolen card list matches, repeated decline patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Customer Behavior</strong></td>\n<td>Account age, purchase history, social signals</td>\n<td>New account risk, behavioral anomalies, social media verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The fraud detection system integrates with our payment processing flow by evaluating risk scores during payment intent creation and charge processing. High-risk transactions can be automatically declined, flagged for manual review, or subjected to additional authentication requirements like step-up verification or manual approval workflows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Real-time vs Batch Fraud Analysis</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Fraud detection requires balancing transaction processing speed against analysis thoroughness, with different risk factors having different computational requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: All real-time analysis, hybrid real-time/batch analysis, all batch analysis with post-transaction review</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with real-time basic checks and batch analysis for sophisticated modeling</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Basic checks (velocity, blacklists, device fingerprinting) can be performed quickly during transaction flow; complex machine learning models and cross-account pattern analysis require batch processing</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Fast transaction processing for most payments, comprehensive risk analysis without blocking customer experience, but requires careful coordination between real-time and batch systems</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-aggressive Fraud Detection</strong>\nMany fraud detection implementations err on the side of caution, implementing strict rules that generate high false positive rates. This approach damages customer experience by declining legitimate transactions, especially for international customers or unusual purchase patterns. Design fraud detection systems with gradual response escalation - implement step-up authentication, manual review queues, and customer communication before automatically declining transactions. Monitor false positive rates as carefully as fraud detection rates to maintain optimal customer experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The future extensions described above represent significant architectural expansions that require careful planning and phased implementation.

id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones - understanding payment industry terminology is essential for payment intent &amp; idempotency (Milestone 1), payment processing &amp; 3DS (Milestone 2), refunds &amp; disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a payment industry dictionary and technical reference. Just as financial professionals use precise terminology to avoid costly misunderstandings, payment systems require exact vocabulary to ensure clear communication between developers, payment processors, banks, and regulatory bodies. Every term has specific legal, technical, or business implications that affect how the system behaves.</p>\n<p>This glossary serves multiple audiences: developers implementing payment functionality, QA engineers writing test scenarios, product managers defining requirements, and support teams diagnosing issues. Each definition includes both the conceptual meaning and the practical implementation context within our payment gateway system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"payment-industry-core-concepts\">Payment Industry Core Concepts</h3>\n<p><strong>Payment intent</strong> represents a customer&#39;s commitment to pay before any money actually moves. Think of it like placing an order at a restaurant - you&#39;ve committed to pay for the meal, but the actual charge happens later when you settle the bill. Payment intents allow merchants to capture customer commitment early, handle authentication flows, and ensure the payment amount is reserved while completing additional verification steps.</p>\n<p>In our system, payment intents serve as the central coordination point for all payment-related activities. They maintain state throughout the entire payment lifecycle, from initial creation through final settlement or cancellation. The payment intent tracks not just the monetary amount, but also metadata, authentication requirements, and relationship to downstream charges and refunds.</p>\n<p><strong>Idempotency key</strong> functions as a unique fingerprint for payment operations, ensuring that duplicate requests produce identical results without unwanted side effects. Consider the analogy of a check number - banks use check numbers to detect and prevent duplicate processing of the same check. Similarly, idempotency keys prevent scenarios where network retries or user interface double-clicks result in charging customers multiple times for the same purchase.</p>\n<p>Our idempotency implementation goes beyond simple duplicate detection. The system stores a cryptographic hash of the request parameters along with the idempotency key, ensuring that reusing an idempotency key with different payment parameters correctly triggers an error rather than returning the cached response from the original request.</p>\n<p><strong>3D Secure</strong> (Three Domain Secure) implements Strong Customer Authentication protocol required by European PSD2 regulations and increasingly adopted globally. The three domains are the issuer domain (customer&#39;s bank), acquirer domain (merchant&#39;s bank), and interoperability domain (payment networks like Visa and Mastercard that facilitate communication between the other domains).</p>\n<p>The 3D Secure flow resembles a secure handshake between the customer&#39;s bank and the merchant. When a payment requires authentication, the customer is redirected to their bank&#39;s secure authentication page, completes verification (password, SMS code, biometric), and returns to the merchant with a cryptographic proof of authentication. Our system handles this redirect flow while maintaining payment state and security throughout the authentication journey.</p>\n<p><strong>Tokenization</strong> replaces sensitive payment data with mathematically unrelated tokens that have no intrinsic value. Imagine a coat check system at a restaurant - you receive a numbered ticket (token) that represents your coat, but the ticket itself isn&#39;t your coat and is worthless to anyone who doesn&#39;t have access to the coat check system.</p>\n<p>Payment tokenization works similarly. When customers enter credit card details, the payment processor immediately replaces the card number with a random token. Our system stores and operates on tokens exclusively, never handling actual card numbers. This dramatically reduces PCI compliance scope since we never touch sensitive cardholder data.</p>\n<p><strong>Webhook reconciliation</strong> ensures that our local payment records remain synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by external payment providers. Think of it like balancing a checkbook - periodically comparing your records with the bank&#39;s records to identify and resolve any discrepancies.</p>\n<p>Payment providers send webhook notifications when payment states change, but webhooks can fail, arrive out of order, or be delayed. Our reconciliation process acts as a safety net, regularly comparing our local payment states with the provider&#39;s authoritative records and resolving any inconsistencies through automated correction or manual review workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"payment-processing-terminology\">Payment Processing Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Terminal state</strong> describes payment statuses that allow no further transitions - the payment has reached a final, unchangeable outcome. Like a door that can be opened or closed but not &quot;half-open,&quot; payments eventually reach states like <code>succeeded</code>, <code>failed</code>, or <code>canceled</code> from which no further state changes are possible.</p>\n<p>Understanding terminal states is crucial for payment system design because it determines when resources can be cleaned up, when customers can be charged for goods, and when refunds become the only mechanism for returning money. Our state machine design explicitly prevents illegal transitions from terminal states to maintain data integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Chargeback</strong> represents a forced payment reversal initiated by the customer&#39;s bank, typically when the customer disputes a transaction. Unlike refunds (which merchants control), chargebacks are imposed by the payment network and cannot be prevented - only contested through a formal dispute process.</p>\n<p>Chargebacks carry additional fees and penalties beyond the reversed transaction amount. When a chargeback occurs, the merchant loses both the original payment amount and pays a chargeback fee (typically $15-25). Excessive chargeback rates can result in higher processing fees or account termination by payment processors.</p>\n<p><strong>PCI DSS</strong> (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) establishes security requirements for any organization that handles, stores, or transmits credit card information. Think of PCI DSS as building codes for payment systems - mandatory safety requirements that prevent catastrophic failures (data breaches) that could harm customers and destroy businesses.</p>\n<p>Our system achieves PCI compliance through tokenization, which eliminates the need to store sensitive cardholder data. By delegating card data handling to PCI-compliant payment processors and working exclusively with tokens, we significantly reduce our compliance scope and security risk.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-system-concepts\">Technical System Concepts</h3>\n<p><strong>Request parameter hash</strong> creates a deterministic fingerprint of essential payment operation parameters, enabling detection of duplicate requests with different parameter values. Like a document checksum that changes if even one character is modified, the request parameter hash ensures that reusing an idempotency key with different payment amounts, currencies, or payment methods correctly triggers an error.</p>\n<p>The hash calculation includes all parameters that affect payment outcomes: amount, currency, payment method token, metadata, and return URLs. This prevents malicious or accidental attempts to reuse idempotency keys for different transactions while allowing legitimate retry scenarios to proceed safely.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit breaker</strong> implements failure protection that prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking calls to failing external services. Imagine a electrical circuit breaker in your home - when it detects dangerous conditions (electrical overload), it immediately cuts power to prevent fires, then can be reset once the dangerous condition is resolved.</p>\n<p>Payment circuit breakers monitor error rates and response times for external provider APIs. When failure thresholds are exceeded, the circuit breaker transitions to an &quot;open&quot; state, immediately failing requests without attempting provider calls. After a timeout period, it enters a &quot;half-open&quot; state to test if the provider has recovered.</p>\n<p><strong>Exponential backoff</strong> implements a retry delay strategy where the wait time between retry attempts increases exponentially (1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, etc.). This prevents overwhelming failing services with retry attempts while giving them time to recover.</p>\n<p>Our implementation includes jitter - random variance added to retry delays to prevent the &quot;thundering herd&quot; problem where many clients retry simultaneously. Instead of all clients retrying exactly every 4 seconds, they retry at random intervals between 3-5 seconds, distributing the load more evenly.</p>\n<p><strong>Compensation transaction</strong> executes the inverse operation needed to maintain system consistency after partial failures in distributed operations. Like the &quot;undo&quot; function in a word processor, compensation transactions reverse the effects of operations that cannot be completed successfully.</p>\n<p>For example, if a payment succeeds with the provider but our webhook processing fails, a compensation transaction might involve calling the provider to refund the payment or marking our local records for manual reconciliation. These transactions ensure that partial failures don&#39;t leave the system in inconsistent states.</p>\n<h3 id=\"state-management-and-consistency\">State Management and Consistency</h3>\n<p><strong>Eventual consistency</strong> describes a consistency model where distributed systems converge to a consistent state over time, even though they may be temporarily inconsistent during normal operation. Think of it like a group text conversation where messages arrive in slightly different orders on different phones, but eventually everyone sees the same conversation history.</p>\n<p>Payment systems naturally exhibit eventual consistency because they span multiple external services (payment providers, banks, card networks) that process transactions at different speeds. Our system design embraces this reality by implementing reconciliation processes that detect and resolve temporary inconsistencies automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconciliation</strong> encompasses the process of synchronizing local payment state with external provider state to detect and resolve discrepancies. Like auditors comparing company books with bank statements, reconciliation identifies differences between what we think happened and what actually happened according to authoritative sources.</p>\n<p>Our reconciliation system operates continuously through webhook processing and periodically through batch comparison jobs. It maintains detailed logs of discrepancies, resolution actions taken, and manual review requirements for complex cases that cannot be automatically resolved.</p>\n<p><strong>Jitter</strong> adds random variance to timing operations, particularly retry delays and scheduled job execution, to prevent synchronized behavior that can overwhelm systems. Without jitter, all clients experiencing the same failure might retry at exactly the same intervals, creating traffic spikes that make recovery more difficult.</p>\n<p>Our jitter implementation uses cryptographically secure random number generation to ensure unpredictable variance. For retry delays, we typically add ±25% jitter, so a 4-second delay becomes a random interval between 3-5 seconds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-payment-concepts\">Advanced Payment Concepts</h3>\n<p><strong>Provider abstraction layer</strong> creates a translation boundary between our domain model and provider-specific implementations, enabling support for multiple payment processors through unified interfaces. Think of it like a universal translator that allows our system to communicate with different payment providers despite their varying APIs and data formats.</p>\n<p>The abstraction layer standardizes concepts like payment intents, charges, and refunds across providers while handling provider-specific peculiarities like different authentication methods, webhook formats, and error codes. This design enables switching providers or supporting multiple providers simultaneously without changing core business logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Provider selection strategy</strong> implements the decision engine for routing transactions to optimal providers based on various criteria like cost, success rates, geographic coverage, and capabilities. Similar to GPS routing algorithms that consider traffic, road conditions, and distance to find optimal paths, provider selection algorithms evaluate multiple factors to maximize transaction success while minimizing costs.</p>\n<p>Our selection strategy considers transaction characteristics (amount, currency, payment method), customer attributes (geographic location, risk profile), and real-time provider performance metrics to make intelligent routing decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Connected accounts</strong> represent verified seller accounts in marketplace scenarios where the platform facilitates payments between buyers and sellers. Like verified merchant accounts at a shopping mall where the mall management has vetted each store, connected accounts undergo verification and capability checks before being authorized to receive payments.</p>\n<p>Connected accounts maintain their own verification status, supported capabilities, and compliance requirements. The platform can enable or disable specific capabilities (card payments, bank transfers, instant payouts) based on the account&#39;s verification level and risk assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Transfer groups</strong> organize related money movements from a single marketplace payment into multiple destination accounts, typically including seller payments and platform fees. Think of it like a payroll system that takes one large payment from a company and distributes it to multiple employees while deducting taxes and benefits.</p>\n<p>Transfer groups maintain atomicity - either all transfers in the group succeed, or none do. This prevents scenarios where seller payments succeed but platform fee collection fails, leaving the marketplace unable to collect revenue from completed transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subscription-and-recurring-billing\">Subscription and Recurring Billing</h3>\n<p><strong>Subscription billing engine</strong> orchestrates the complex workflows required for recurring payment processing, including trial periods, plan changes, proration calculations, failed payment recovery, and lifecycle management. Like a sophisticated scheduling system that manages recurring appointments while handling cancellations, rescheduling, and special requirements.</p>\n<p>The billing engine coordinates multiple subsystems: customer management, payment method storage, invoice generation, payment processing, dunning management (handling failed payments), and customer communication. It ensures that subscription charges occur at the correct times with appropriate amounts while gracefully handling edge cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Billing cycle</strong> represents an individual billing period with associated charges, payment attempts, and status tracking. Each cycle maintains its own payment state independent of other cycles, allowing for complex scenarios like partial payments, billing adjustments, and cycle-specific promotions.</p>\n<p>Billing cycles handle proration automatically when customers upgrade, downgrade, or change billing frequency mid-cycle. The system calculates precise amounts based on usage periods and applies appropriate credits or additional charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Proration</strong> calculates proportional billing adjustments when subscription changes occur mid-cycle, ensuring customers pay exactly for the service period they actually use. Like calculating utility bills that account for mid-month service changes, proration ensures fair charging regardless of when changes occur.</p>\n<p>Our proration engine handles complex scenarios including plan upgrades, downgrades, quantity changes, and billing frequency modifications. It generates detailed line items showing original charges, credits for unused time, and additional charges for new services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"risk-management-and-fraud-detection\">Risk Management and Fraud Detection</h3>\n<p><strong>Risk scoring pipeline</strong> analyzes transaction patterns, customer behavior, and contextual factors to identify potentially fraudulent payments before they complete processing. Similar to credit scoring systems that evaluate loan applications, risk scoring examines multiple data points to assign fraud probability scores.</p>\n<p>The pipeline operates in real-time during payment processing, evaluating factors like transaction velocity, geographic inconsistencies, device fingerprinting, and behavioral patterns. High-risk transactions can be automatically declined, flagged for manual review, or subjected to additional authentication requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Provider health monitoring</strong> continuously tracks provider performance metrics including success rates, response times, error patterns, and service availability to inform routing decisions and detect degraded service conditions. Like network monitoring systems that track server health, provider monitoring ensures optimal transaction routing and early problem detection.</p>\n<p>Health monitoring aggregates metrics across different time windows (real-time, hourly, daily) and transaction types (small vs large amounts, different currencies, various payment methods) to provide comprehensive visibility into provider performance characteristics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compliance-and-security-standards\">Compliance and Security Standards</h3>\n<p><strong>SAQ A</strong> (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A) represents the simplest PCI DSS compliance requirement for merchants who have completely outsourced payment processing and never handle cardholder data directly. Think of it like a basic safety checklist for businesses that don&#39;t directly handle dangerous materials but still need to maintain safe practices.</p>\n<p>Merchants qualifying for SAQ A only need to complete a short questionnaire (about 12 questions) rather than undergoing comprehensive security audits. Our tokenization-based approach enables merchants to qualify for SAQ A by ensuring they never touch sensitive cardholder data.</p>\n<p><strong>SAQ A-EP</strong> (SAQ A with E-commerce Payment processing) applies to merchants who use hosted payment forms but maintain some payment-related functions on their systems. This requires additional security controls around network segmentation, access controls, and system monitoring while still avoiding direct cardholder data handling.</p>\n<p><strong>SAQ D</strong> represents the most comprehensive PCI assessment required for merchants who store, process, or transmit cardholder data directly. This involves extensive security audits, penetration testing, and ongoing compliance monitoring - the equivalent of full regulatory oversight for high-risk activities.</p>\n<p><strong>TLS 1.2</strong> specifies the minimum required Transport Layer Security version for protecting payment data in transit. Like requiring reinforced security trucks for valuable cargo transport, TLS 1.2 ensures that payment information cannot be intercepted or modified during network transmission.</p>\n<p>Our system enforces TLS 1.2 for all payment-related communications and rejects connections using older, vulnerable protocols. This includes connections to payment providers, webhook endpoints, and customer-facing payment forms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The payment industry terminology forms the foundation for clear communication throughout system implementation. Understanding these concepts enables precise technical discussions, accurate requirement specifications, and effective debugging when issues arise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"payment-domain-language-usage\">Payment Domain Language Usage</h4>\n<p>When implementing payment systems, consistent terminology usage prevents misunderstandings that could lead to incorrect business logic or security vulnerabilities. Use these preferred terms consistently:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Concept</th>\n<th>Preferred Term</th>\n<th>Avoid</th>\n<th>Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Customer commitment to pay</td>\n<td>payment intent</td>\n<td>payment request, order</td>\n<td>Aligns with industry standards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unique operation identifier</td>\n<td>idempotency key</td>\n<td>transaction id, request id</td>\n<td>Specifies duplicate prevention purpose</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Card authentication protocol</td>\n<td>3D Secure</td>\n<td>3DS, three-d-secure</td>\n<td>Official protocol name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State synchronization</td>\n<td>webhook reconciliation</td>\n<td>webhook processing</td>\n<td>Emphasizes consistency checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sensitive data replacement</td>\n<td>tokenization</td>\n<td>encryption, hashing</td>\n<td>Describes specific security technique</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forced payment reversal</td>\n<td>chargeback</td>\n<td>dispute, reversal</td>\n<td>Distinguishes from merchant-initiated refunds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Security compliance framework</td>\n<td>PCI DSS</td>\n<td>PCI compliance</td>\n<td>Complete standard name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Final payment status</td>\n<td>terminal state</td>\n<td>end state, final status</td>\n<td>Payment industry convention</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"technical-term-application\">Technical Term Application</h4>\n<p>Understanding when and how to apply technical terms correctly prevents implementation errors:</p>\n<p><strong>Idempotency</strong> applies to any operation that can be safely retried without changing the result. In payment systems, this includes payment intent creation, charge processing, refund requests, and webhook event processing. However, not all operations are naturally idempotent - some require explicit design to achieve idempotent behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Eventual consistency</strong> describes the expected behavior for distributed payment systems. Developers should design for temporary inconsistencies and implement reconciliation processes rather than expecting immediate consistency across all system components.</p>\n<p><strong>Circuit breakers</strong> should be applied to all external service calls, including payment provider APIs, database connections, and webhook deliveries. However, circuit breakers must be configured appropriately for each service&#39;s characteristics - payment processing might tolerate longer timeout periods than user-facing API calls.</p>\n<h4 id=\"error-message-and-log-terminology\">Error Message and Log Terminology</h4>\n<p>Use precise terminology in error messages, log entries, and monitoring alerts to facilitate rapid debugging:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Good: &quot;Payment intent pi_abc123 failed 3D Secure authentication - customer abandoned auth flow&quot;\nPoor: &quot;Payment failed - authentication error&quot;\n\nGood: &quot;Webhook reconciliation detected state mismatch: local=processing, provider=succeeded&quot;

builds a secure payment processing gateway that handles credit card transactions, maintains PCI compliance, and ensures reliable payment state management through idempotency controls and webhook reconciliation. The key architectural challenge is maintaining data consistency across multiple external payment providers while handling the complexities of asynchronous payment flows, dispute management, and regulatory compliance.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Foundation for all milestones - understanding the payment processing domain is essential before implementing payment intents (Milestone 1), payment processing (Milestone 2), refunds/disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4).\n\nPayment processing represents one of the most complex and regulated domains in software engineering, where the stakes of implementation errors extend far beyond typical application bugs. A failed payment can mean lost revenue, regulatory violations, or compromised customer trust. Unlike many software systems where eventual consistency and best-effort delivery are acceptable, payment systems demand strict consistency, cryptographic security, and regulatory compliance that can make or break a business.\n\nThe fundamental challenge lies in orchestrating a distributed transaction across multiple parties - the customer's bank, the merchant's bank, payment networks like Visa or Mastercard, and various intermediary processors - while maintaining data integrity and handling the inevitable network partitions, timeouts, and edge cases that occur in real-world financial infrastructure. Each party in this ecosystem has different data models, error handling approaches, and timing requirements, yet the end customer expects a seamless experience where their payment either succeeds completely or fails cleanly with clear error messaging.\n\nModern payment processing must also navigate an increasingly complex regulatory landscape including PCI DSS compliance for handling card data, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements under PSD2 in Europe, and various anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. These requirements aren't optional features that can be added later - they must be designed into the system architecture from the beginning, influencing everything from data storage patterns to API design decisions.\n\n### Payment Processing Mental Model\n\nThink of payment processing like orchestrating a complex banking transaction that involves multiple banks, but instead of happening face-to-face with a teller who can handle unexpected situations, everything must be automated through a series of computer-to-computer messages sent over unreliable networks. In the physical world, if you write a check to pay for groceries, the cashier can immediately see if your signature matches, but they won't know if you have sufficient funds until later when the check clears through the banking system. Similarly, when a customer enters their credit card information on a website, the initial response only tells you whether the card details are valid and the issuing bank initially approves the transaction - the actual movement of money happens later through a settlement process.\n\nThe **payment intent** concept maps to the moment when a customer decides to buy something and provides their payment information, but before any money actually moves. Think of this like signing a contract that says \"I intend to pay $50 for this item\" - it's a commitment, but not yet a completed transaction. The merchant can use this intent to reserve the item for the customer and begin preparing for shipment, but they haven't actually been paid yet. This separation between intent and execution is crucial because many things can still go wrong: the customer's bank might decline the transaction upon further review, the customer might need to complete additional authentication steps, or the merchant might discover the item is out of stock.\n\n**3D Secure authentication** resembles the process of a bank calling you to verify a large or unusual transaction. Just as your bank might call and ask \"Did you really try to spend $2000 at a electronics store in another state?\", 3D Secure redirects the customer to their bank's website where they must prove their identity through a password, SMS code, or biometric verification. The merchant never sees this authentication process - they just know that the customer either passed or failed the verification, similar to how a store clerk doesn't hear your conversation with the bank when they call to verify a large purchase.\n\nThe **webhook reconciliation** process functions like the end-of-day settlement that happens in traditional banking. Throughout the day, banks keep track of all the promises to pay (authorizations) and actual fund transfers (captures), but they don't reconcile their books until later. Similarly, payment processors send webhook notifications to update merchants about status changes that happened after the initial API response. A payment might initially appear successful, but a webhook hours later might indicate it was actually declined due to fraud detection, or a pending payment might transition to completed once it fully settles through the banking networks.\n\n**Idempotency** in payments mirrors the banking principle that you cannot accidentally deposit the same check twice. In the physical world, banks have check numbers and can detect duplicate deposits. In payment processing, idempotency keys serve the same purpose - if a customer accidentally clicks \"Pay Now\" twice due to a slow internet connection, the second request should be safely ignored rather than charging their card twice. This isn't just about preventing duplicate charges; it's about maintaining the fundamental accounting principle that every financial transaction should happen exactly once.\n\nThe **dispute and chargeback** process resembles the consumer protection mechanisms in traditional banking. When a customer calls their bank to report an unauthorized charge or defective merchandise, the bank can forcibly reverse the transaction and require the merchant to prove the charge was legitimate. This happens outside of the normal payment flow - the merchant only learns about it when they receive a chargeback notification, similar to how a check might bounce several days after you deposited it.\n\n### Existing Payment Gateway Approaches\n\nPayment gateway implementation involves several architectural patterns, each representing different trade-offs between security, user experience, development complexity, and regulatory compliance. Understanding these patterns is essential before choosing an implementation approach, as the decision affects everything from PCI compliance requirements to the customer checkout experience.\n\n> **Decision: Payment Gateway Integration Pattern**\n> - **Context**: Applications need to accept payments while minimizing security risks and development complexity. Different integration patterns offer varying levels of control over the payment experience versus security and compliance burden.\n> - **Options Considered**: Hosted payment pages (redirect model), direct API integration (server-to-server), embedded payment forms (client-side tokenization)\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach using embedded forms with server-side completion for optimal balance of security and user experience\n> - **Rationale**: Provides seamless user experience without handling raw card data, reduces PCI scope while maintaining control over checkout flow, enables advanced features like saved payment methods\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful implementation of client-side tokenization and server-side payment completion, but offers maximum flexibility for future enhancements\n\n| Integration Pattern | Security Model | PCI Compliance Scope | User Experience | Development Complexity | Control Level |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Hosted Payment Pages | Provider handles all card data | Minimal (SAQ A) | Redirect disruption | Low | Limited customization |\n| Direct API Integration | Server handles raw card data | Full compliance required (SAQ D) | Seamless | High | Complete control |\n| Embedded Forms | Client-side tokenization | Moderate (SAQ A-EP) | Seamless | Medium | High customization |\n\n**Hosted Payment Pages** represent the most secure but least flexible approach. In this pattern, the merchant's website redirects customers to the payment processor's hosted checkout page, similar to how PayPal checkout works. The customer completes their payment on the processor's domain, then returns to the merchant site with a success or failure result. This approach minimizes the merchant's PCI compliance burden since they never handle card data directly, requiring only the simplest Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ A). However, the redirect disrupts the user experience and provides limited customization options. Many customers abandon purchases during redirects, particularly on mobile devices where the transition feels jarring.\n\nThe security benefit stems from the fact that sensitive card data never touches the merchant's servers or even their web pages. The payment processor bears full responsibility for securing card data, handling PCI compliance, and managing fraud detection. For small businesses or startups with limited security expertise, this approach offers the fastest time to market with minimal ongoing compliance overhead. However, the merchant sacrifices control over the checkout experience and cannot easily implement features like saved payment methods or subscription billing without additional integration work.\n\n**Direct API Integration** provides maximum control and flexibility by allowing the merchant's server to communicate directly with the payment processor's APIs using raw card data. The customer enters their payment information on the merchant's website, which submits it directly to the merchant's server for processing. This approach enables seamless user experiences, complete customization of the payment flow, and easy implementation of advanced features like subscription billing or marketplace payments.\n\nHowever, direct integration comes with significant security and compliance responsibilities. The merchant must achieve full PCI DSS compliance (SAQ D), which requires extensive security controls including network segmentation, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and formal security policies. Any server that processes, stores, or transmits card data must be secured according to PCI standards, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars annually for compliance assessments and security infrastructure.\n\nThe technical complexity extends beyond just API integration to include secure data handling, encryption key management, and comprehensive logging for compliance audits. Many organizations underestimate the ongoing operational burden of maintaining PCI compliance, particularly as their infrastructure evolves and scales. A single security vulnerability or compliance gap can result in fines, increased processing fees, or loss of payment processing privileges.\n\n**Embedded Payment Forms** offer a hybrid approach that balances security with user experience through client-side tokenization. The customer enters their payment information into form fields that appear to be part of the merchant's website but are actually served from the payment processor's domain through iframe embedding or JavaScript widgets. When the customer submits the form, their card data goes directly to the payment processor, which returns a token representing the payment method. The merchant's server then uses this token to complete the payment without ever handling raw card data.\n\nThis approach reduces PCI scope to SAQ A-EP, which is significantly simpler than full compliance but more involved than SAQ A. The merchant must secure their web pages that host the embedded forms and ensure they don't intercept or store card data. The user experience remains seamless since customers never leave the merchant's website, while the security model ensures sensitive data never reaches the merchant's infrastructure.\n\nThe implementation complexity lies in properly integrating the client-side tokenization with server-side payment completion. The merchant must handle the asynchronous nature of client-side tokenization, validate that tokens correspond to actual payment intents, and implement proper error handling when tokenization fails. Additionally, advanced features like saved payment methods require careful coordination between client-side token management and server-side customer records.\n\n> **Design Insight: The Token Security Model**\n> Tokenization represents a fundamental shift in payment security thinking. Instead of treating card data as something to be protected through encryption and access controls, tokenization eliminates the sensitive data entirely from the merchant's environment. The token is cryptographically useless outside the specific merchant-processor relationship, so even if it's compromised, it cannot be used to make unauthorized payments elsewhere.\n\n| Security Consideration | Hosted Pages | Direct Integration | Embedded Forms |\n|----------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Card data handling | Never touches merchant | Raw data on servers | Client-side tokenization |\n| PCI compliance burden | Minimal annual questionnaire | Full compliance program | Moderate questionnaire |\n| Data breach risk | Limited to transaction IDs | Complete card data exposure | Token exposure only |\n| Fraud liability | Shared with processor | Primary merchant responsibility | Shared with processor |\n| Implementation timeline | Days to weeks | Months to years | Weeks to months |\n\n**Cross-cutting Security Considerations** affect all integration patterns and must be carefully evaluated regardless of the chosen approach. Transport layer security requires TLS 1.2 or higher for all payment-related communications, with proper certificate validation and HSTS implementation. Session management must prevent session fixation attacks and ensure payment tokens are properly scoped to authenticated users. Client-side security involves Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent script injection and proper CORS configuration for cross-domain API calls.\n\n**Regulatory Compliance** extends beyond PCI DSS to include regional requirements like Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) under PSD2 in Europe, which mandates two-factor authentication for most online payments. The chosen integration pattern affects how easily these requirements can be implemented. Hosted pages typically include built-in compliance features, while direct integration requires custom implementation of authentication flows and regulatory reporting.\n\n**Scalability and Performance** characteristics vary significantly between patterns. Hosted pages eliminate payment-related load from the merchant's infrastructure but introduce dependency on the processor's availability and performance. Direct integration puts full load on the merchant's servers but provides complete control over performance optimization. Embedded forms balance these concerns by handling the most resource-intensive operations (card validation, fraud checking) on the processor's infrastructure while keeping the merchant in control of the overall checkout flow.\n\nThe choice of integration pattern fundamentally shapes the rest of the payment system architecture. A system designed for hosted pages cannot easily migrate to direct integration due to the different security and compliance requirements. Similarly, a direct integration approach requires substantially different infrastructure and operational procedures compared to embedded forms. This decision should be made early in the design process with careful consideration of long-term business requirements, technical capabilities, and risk tolerance.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section establishes the foundational understanding necessary for implementing a secure payment gateway.

Infrastructure Starter Code**\n\n**Configuration Management (`app/config.py`):**\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom pydantic import BaseSettings, validator\n\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\n    \"\"\"Application configuration with validation and type safety.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Database configuration\n    database_url: str = \"postgresql://localhost:5432/payment_gateway\"\n    database_pool_size: int = 20\n    \n    # Payment provider configuration\n    stripe_secret_key: str\n    stripe_webhook_secret: str\n    stripe_api_version: str = \"2023-10-16\"\n    \n    # Security configuration\n    secret_key: str\n    algorithm: str = \"HS256\"\n    \n    # Application settings\n    environment: str = \"development\"\n    log_level: str = \"INFO\"\n    \n    @validator('stripe_secret_key')\n    def validate_stripe_key(cls, v):\n        if not v.startswith(('sk_test_', 'sk_live_')):\n            raise ValueError('Invalid Stripe secret key format')\n        return v\n    \n    @validator('secret_key')\n    def validate_secret_key(cls, v):\n        if len(v) < 32:\n            raise ValueError('Secret key must be at least 32 characters')\n        return v\n    \n    class Config:\n        env_file = \".env\"\n\nsettings = Settings()\n```\n\n**Database Connection (`app/database.py`):**\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool\nfrom app.config import settings\n\n# Create database engine with connection pooling\nengine = create_engine(\n    settings.database_url,\n    poolclass=QueuePool,\n    pool_size=settings.database_pool_size,\n    max_overflow=30,\n    pool_pre_ping=True,  # Validates connections before use\n    echo=settings.environment == \"development\"\n)\n\n# Session factory for database operations\nSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n\n# Base class for SQLAlchemy models\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n# Metadata for migrations and schema management\nmetadata = MetaData()\n\ndef get_db():\n    \"\"\"Dependency injection for database sessions.\"\"\"\n    db = SessionLocal()\n    try:\n        yield db\n    finally:\n        db.close()\n```\n\n**Payment-Specific Exceptions (`app/exceptions.py`):**\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, Any\n\nclass PaymentGatewayException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base exception for all payment gateway errors.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: Optional[str] = None, \n                 details: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):\n        self.message = message\n        self.error_code = error_code\n        self.details = details or {}\n        super().__init__(self.message)\n\nclass IdempotencyError(PaymentGatewayException):\n    \"\"\"Raised when idempotency key conflicts occur.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass PaymentProcessingError(PaymentGatewayException):\n    \"\"\"Raised when external payment processor returns an error.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, message: str, provider_error_code: Optional[str] = None,\n                 provider_message: Optional[str] = None):\n        self.provider_error_code = provider_error_code\n        self.provider_message = provider_message\n        super().__init__(message, provider_error_code, {\n            'provider_message': provider_message\n        })\n\nclass ValidationError(PaymentGatewayException):\n    \"\"\"Raised when input validation fails.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass WebhookVerificationError(PaymentGatewayException):\n    \"\"\"Raised when webhook signature verification fails.\"\"\"\n    pass\n```\n\n**D. Core Validation Utilities (`app/utils/validators.py`):**\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom decimal import Decimal, InvalidOperation\nfrom typing import Union, Optional\n\ndef validate_amount(amount: Union[int, str, Decimal]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate and convert payment amount to cents (smallest currency unit).\n    \n    Args:\n        amount: Amount in dollars (string/Decimal) or cents (int)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Amount in cents as integer\n        \n    Raises:\n        ValidationError: If amount is invalid\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO 1: Handle integer input (already in cents)\n    # TODO 2: Handle string/Decimal input (convert from dollars to cents)\n    # TODO 3: Validate amount is positive and not zero\n    # TODO 4: Validate amount doesn't exceed maximum (e.g., $1,000,000)\n    # TODO 5: Round to nearest cent to handle floating point precision\n    pass\n\ndef validate_currency(currency: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate ISO 4217 currency code.\n    \n    Args:\n        currency: Three-letter currency code (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR')\n        \n    Returns:\n        Uppercase currency code\n        \n    Raises:\n        ValidationError: If currency code is invalid\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO 1: Convert to uppercase\n    # TODO 2: Validate exactly 3 alphabetic characters\n    # TODO 3: Check against supported currency list\n    pass\n\ndef validate_idempotency_key(key: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate idempotency key format and length.\n    \n    Args:\n        key: Client-provided idempotency key\n        \n    Returns:\n        Validated idempotency key\n        \n    Raises:\n        ValidationError: If key format is invalid\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO 1: Check key is not empty\n    # TODO 2: Validate length (recommended: 22-255 characters)\n    # TODO 3: Ensure key contains only safe characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)\n    # TODO 4: Prevent SQL injection patterns\n    pass\n```\n\n**E. Language-Specific Best Practices**\n\nFor Python payment processing implementations:\n\n- **Decimal Arithmetic**: Always use `decimal.Decimal` for monetary amounts, never `float`. Floating-point arithmetic introduces rounding errors that can cause accounting discrepancies.\n- **Environment Variables**: Store all secrets in environment variables, never in code. Use `python-dotenv` for local development and proper secret management in production.\n- **Database Transactions**: Wrap all payment operations in database transactions using SQLAlchemy's session management. Payment operations must be atomic.\n- **Input Validation**: Use Pydantic models for all API input validation. Payment systems cannot tolerate invalid data reaching business logic.\n- **Error Logging**: Log all payment errors with sufficient detail for debugging, but never log sensitive data like full card numbers or CVV codes.\n- **Time Handling**: Use UTC for all timestamps and convert to local time only for display. Payment reconciliation across time zones requires consistent time handling.\n\n**F. Security Implementation Checklist**\n\n| Security Control | Implementation | Validation Method |\n|------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| TLS Configuration | Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all endpoints | SSL Labs scan |\n| Input Validation | Pydantic models for all inputs | Fuzzing tests |\n| SQL Injection Prevention | SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries | Static analysis |\n| Secret Management | Environment variables with validation | Security audit |\n| CORS Configuration | Strict origin policy for API endpoints | Browser testing |\n| Rate Limiting | Per-IP and per-user rate limits | Load testing |\n\n**G. Development Environment Setup**\n\n1. **Database Setup**: Install PostgreSQL and create development database with proper encoding (UTF-8) and collation for international character support.\n\n2. **Environment Configuration**: Create `.env` file with all required settings. Use strong, randomly generated values for secrets in development.\n\n3. **Dependency Management**: Use `pip-tools` or `poetry` for reproducible dependency management. Payment systems require stable, auditable dependencies.\n\n4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Configure pytest with database fixtures that create/tear down test data for each test. Payment tests must be isolated and repeatable.\n\n5. **Linting and Formatting**: Configure `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` for consistent code style. Financial code requires high readability standards.\n\n**H. Milestone Validation Checkpoints**\n\nAfter completing each milestone, validate progress with these concrete checks:\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint (Payment Intents)**:\n- Create payment intent via API with valid idempotency key\n- Attempt duplicate creation with same key - should return original intent\n- Verify payment intent state transitions are properly validated\n- Check database constraints prevent invalid state changes\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint (Payment Processing)**:\n- Process test payment with valid card details\n- Trigger 3D Secure flow with test card requiring authentication\n- Verify payment method tokenization prevents card data storage\n- Test payment confirmation after successful authentication\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint (Refunds/Disputes)**:\n- Process full refund against completed payment\n- Process partial refund with proper amount validation\n- Simulate chargeback notification and verify dispute creation\n- Test refund state transitions and accounting accuracy\n\n**Milestone 4 Checkpoint (Webhooks)**:\n- Receive webhook with valid signature - should process successfully\n- Send webhook with invalid signature - should reject\n- Test webhook idempotency with duplicate event IDs\n- Verify state reconciliation detects and corrects discrepancies\n\nEach checkpoint should include both automated tests and manual verification steps to ensure the implementation meets production readiness standards.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Foundation for all milestones - clearly scoped requirements guide implementation decisions across payment intents (Milestone 1), payment processing (Milestone 2), refunds and disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4).\n\nSetting clear boundaries for a payment gateway implementation is like drawing a fence around a construction site. Without explicit boundaries, scope creep inevitably leads to an over-engineered system that tries to solve every conceivable payment problem. Payment processing touches on numerous complex domains—fraud detection, regulatory compliance, international banking, subscription management, marketplace settlements, and more. Each of these areas could consume months of development effort on its own. This section establishes what our payment gateway will accomplish within a reasonable implementation timeline, what quality attributes it must satisfy, and crucially, what advanced features we explicitly defer to future iterations.\n\nThe mental model for goal-setting in payment systems is similar to designing a bridge. Functional goals define what the bridge carries (cars, pedestrians, weight limits). Non-functional goals specify how well it carries them (earthquake resistance, expected lifespan, maintenance requirements). Non-goals clarify what the bridge won't support (freight trains, aircraft landings, unlimited weight). Without this clarity, engineers either under-build (bridge collapses) or over-build (bridge costs 10x more than necessary and takes years longer to complete).\n\nOur payment gateway serves as the critical intermediary between merchant applications and external payment providers like Stripe, processing sensitive financial transactions that demand both functional correctness and robust operational characteristics. The scope decisions made here directly impact implementation complexity, security requirements, compliance obligations, and long-term maintainability.\n\n### Functional Goals\n\nThe functional goals define the core payment processing capabilities our system must deliver. Think of these as the fundamental promises our payment gateway makes to merchant applications that integrate with it. Each goal maps directly to one or more implementation milestones and represents functionality that must work reliably in production environments.\n\n**Payment Intent Management** forms the foundation of our transaction processing model. A payment intent represents a customer's commitment to pay a specific amount for goods or services, created before any money actually moves. This abstraction separates the business decision to charge a customer from the technical complexity of processing that charge, enabling better error handling and user experience flows. Our system must create payment intents with client-provided idempotency keys, preventing duplicate charges when network issues cause request retries. The payment intent tracks metadata about the transaction (order number, customer ID, product details) and progresses through a well-defined state machine from creation to completion or cancellation. Intent expiration handling automatically cancels payment intents that remain uncompleted after reasonable time periods, preventing indefinite resource consumption.\n\n| Payment Intent Operation | Input Parameters | Expected Behavior | Error Conditions |\n|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Create Intent | amount, currency, idempotency_key, metadata | Returns intent ID and client secret | Invalid amount/currency, duplicate key with different params |\n| Retrieve Intent | intent_id | Returns current intent state and metadata | Intent not found, unauthorized access |\n| Cancel Intent | intent_id | Transitions to canceled state if possible | Intent already processed, invalid state transition |\n| List Intents | filters, pagination | Returns matching intents with metadata | Invalid filter parameters, pagination limits |\n\n**Payment Processing and Authentication** handles the actual movement of money from customer payment methods to merchant accounts. Our system must tokenize payment method details (credit card numbers, bank account information) to avoid storing sensitive data directly. The charge creation process submits tokenized payment information to external providers and handles both immediate responses and asynchronous processing flows. 3D Secure authentication support ensures compliance with Strong Customer Authentication requirements by redirecting customers to their card issuer for identity verification when required. Payment confirmation completes the charge process after successful authentication, updating local records and triggering downstream business processes.\n\nThe key complexity here lies in handling the state transitions correctly. Unlike simple API calls, payment processing involves multiple round-trips between customer, merchant, payment provider, and card issuer. Our system must maintain consistent state throughout these interactions while gracefully handling failures at any step.\n\n| Payment Processing Stage | Required Actions | Success Criteria | Failure Handling |\n|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Method Tokenization | Securely exchange card details for token | Token stored, card details discarded | Invalid card data, provider rejection |\n| Charge Creation | Submit payment request to provider | Charge ID returned, status tracking initiated | Network failure, provider error response |\n| 3DS Authentication | Handle issuer redirect flow | Customer authenticated, ready to capture | Authentication declined, timeout |\n| Payment Confirmation | Complete authorized payment | Money transferred, local state updated | Capture failure, settlement delay |\n\n**Refund and Dispute Management** provides mechanisms for reversing completed payments and handling customer-initiated chargebacks. Full refund processing returns the entire payment amount to the customer's original payment method, while partial refund support enables returning portions of the original charge (useful for partial order cancellations or shipping adjustments). Refund state tracking monitors the refund lifecycle from initiation through completion, as refunds typically take 5-10 business days to appear on customer statements. Dispute handling manages chargeback notifications received from payment networks, tracking deadlines for evidence submission and automating responses where possible. Chargeback prevention features help identify potentially disputable transactions before they become formal disputes.\n\nThe accounting complexity in refund management requires careful attention to ledger integrity. Our system must track total refunded amounts against original charges to prevent over-refunding, maintain audit trails for compliance purposes, and handle the timing differences between refund initiation and actual fund return.\n\n| Refund Operation | Input Requirements | Processing Logic | State Updates |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| Full Refund | charge_id, reason | Validate refundable amount, submit to provider | Create refund record, update charge |\n| Partial Refund | charge_id, amount, reason | Check remaining refundable balance | Track cumulative refund total |\n| Dispute Response | dispute_id, evidence | Submit evidence within deadline | Update dispute status, set alerts |\n| Chargeback Processing | webhook_data | Parse reason codes, determine response | Create dispute record, notify merchant |\n\n**Webhook Processing and Event Handling** maintains synchronization between our local payment state and the authoritative state held by external payment providers. Webhooks provide near-real-time notifications about payment status changes, refund completions, dispute updates, and other significant events. Our system must receive webhook payloads, verify their cryptographic signatures to prevent spoofing attacks, and update local records based on the event data. Event deduplication ensures that webhook retries don't cause duplicate processing, while event ordering handles cases where webhooks arrive out of chronological sequence.\n\nWebhook reconciliation provides a safety net against webhook delivery failures by periodically comparing local payment state against provider APIs. This background process identifies discrepancies and corrects them, ensuring our local records remain consistent with provider records even when webhooks fail silently.\n\n### Non-Functional Goals\n\nNon-functional goals define how well our payment system performs its functional duties. These quality attributes are just as critical as functional capabilities because payment processing demands high reliability, security, and performance standards. Think of non-functional goals as the operational excellence requirements that enable the system to handle real-world production workloads.\n\n**Security and Compliance Standards** ensure our payment gateway meets industry requirements for handling sensitive financial data. PCI DSS compliance is mandatory for any system that processes, stores, or transmits payment card information. Our implementation targets `SAQ_A` compliance level by avoiding direct handling of card data, instead relying on tokenization to replace sensitive information with non-sensitive tokens. All data transmission must use `TLS_1_2` or higher encryption, and webhook signature verification prevents unauthorized parties from spoofing payment events. Access control mechanisms ensure only authenticated users can access payment information, with proper authorization checks preventing cross-customer data exposure.\n\nSecure coding practices include input validation on all API endpoints, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, and proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information in responses. Audit logging captures all significant payment operations for compliance reporting and security incident investigation.\n\n| Security Requirement | Implementation Approach | Validation Method | Compliance Impact |\n|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| PCI DSS Compliance | Tokenization, no card storage | Self-assessment questionnaire | Reduces compliance scope |\n| Data Encryption | TLS 1.2+ for transport, encrypted storage | Certificate validation, encryption testing | Protects data in transit/rest |\n| Access Control | Authentication + authorization | Security testing, access reviews | Prevents unauthorized access |\n| Audit Logging | Structured logs for all operations | Log analysis, retention compliance | Supports compliance reporting |\n\n**Reliability and Error Handling** characteristics ensure payment processing continues functioning correctly despite various failure scenarios. Idempotency guarantees prevent duplicate charges when clients retry requests due to network issues or timeouts. Database transaction isolation ensures payment state changes are atomic—either all related updates succeed or none do, preventing partial state corruption. Circuit breaker patterns protect against cascading failures when external payment providers experience outages. Graceful degradation allows the system to continue operating with reduced functionality rather than complete failure.\n\nError recovery mechanisms handle both transient failures (network timeouts, temporary provider unavailability) and permanent failures (invalid payment methods, insufficient funds). Retry strategies use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming failing systems while still providing timely recovery when issues resolve.\n\n| Reliability Feature | Failure Scenarios Addressed | Recovery Mechanism | Success Metrics |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Idempotency | Network retries, client errors | Unique constraint on idempotency keys | Zero duplicate charges |\n| Transaction Integrity | Database failures, partial updates | Atomic database transactions | Consistent state recovery |\n| Circuit Breakers | Provider outages, cascading failures | Automatic failover, degraded mode | Maintained availability |\n| Retry Logic | Transient network/provider issues | Exponential backoff with jitter | Successful eventual processing |\n\n**Performance and Scalability** requirements enable the system to handle realistic payment volumes with acceptable response times. Payment intent creation should complete within 200ms for 95% of requests, providing responsive user experience during checkout flows. Payment processing latency depends on external provider performance but should typically complete within 2-3 seconds for card payments not requiring 3D Secure authentication. Webhook processing must handle provider retry patterns without overwhelming the system, typically processing events within 1-2 seconds of receipt.\n\nThroughput requirements scale with merchant transaction volumes. A typical small-to-medium merchant might process 100-1000 payments per day, while larger merchants could handle 10,000+ daily transactions. Our architecture should gracefully scale from development workloads to production volumes without requiring fundamental design changes.\n\nDatabase performance optimization ensures payment queries remain fast as transaction history grows. Proper indexing on frequently-queried fields (payment intent ID, customer ID, creation timestamps) and archive strategies for historical data maintain query performance over time.\n\n| Performance Metric | Target Threshold | Measurement Method | Optimization Strategies |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Intent Creation Latency | 200ms p95 | Application monitoring | Database indexing, caching |\n| Payment Processing Time | 3s p95 (non-3DS) | End-to-end tracing | Provider optimization, parallelization |\n| Webhook Processing | 2s p95 | Queue monitoring | Background job processing |\n| System Throughput | 1000+ payments/day | Load testing | Horizontal scaling, async processing |\n\n**Monitoring and Observability** capabilities provide visibility into system health, performance trends, and business metrics. Application metrics track key performance indicators like payment success rates, average processing times, and error frequencies. Payment-specific dashboards display business-critical information such as daily transaction volumes, refund rates, and dispute trends. Alert systems notify operations teams about system degradation, unusual error patterns, or compliance-related issues.\n\nStructured logging captures detailed information about each payment operation, enabling debugging of specific transaction issues and forensic analysis when problems occur. Distributed tracing follows payment requests across multiple system components and external provider calls, helping identify performance bottlenecks and failure points.\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nExplicitly documenting what our payment gateway will NOT implement is crucial for maintaining reasonable scope and preventing feature creep. These non-goals represent important payment-related functionality that we consciously defer to future development phases or external systems. Think of non-goals as the features that would be nice to have but would significantly increase implementation complexity beyond the core learning objectives.\n\n**Advanced Fraud Detection and Risk Management** represents a sophisticated domain that could easily consume months of development effort. While basic validation (amount limits, currency checks) falls within our scope, we explicitly exclude machine learning-based fraud scoring, velocity checks across customer behaviors, device fingerprinting, and advanced risk assessment algorithms. Payment providers typically offer fraud protection services that merchants can enable, reducing the need for custom fraud detection in many scenarios.\n\nReal-world fraud detection requires extensive historical data, complex rule engines, and specialized expertise in payment fraud patterns. Building effective fraud prevention is a full-time specialty that extends far beyond basic payment processing implementation.\n\n| Fraud Detection Feature | Complexity Level | Why Excluded | Alternative Approach |\n|------------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| ML Fraud Scoring | Very High | Requires data science expertise, training data | Use provider fraud tools |\n| Velocity Checking | High | Complex rules, customer behavior tracking | Implement basic rate limiting only |\n| Device Fingerprinting | High | Browser/device analysis, privacy concerns | Rely on provider capabilities |\n| Risk Assessment Rules | Medium-High | Domain expertise, extensive configuration | Use provider risk management |\n\n**Multi-Currency and International Support** adds significant complexity around exchange rates, local payment methods, regulatory compliance, and tax calculation. While our system supports specifying currency codes for payments, we don't implement currency conversion, localized payment methods (SEPA, Alipay, etc.), country-specific compliance requirements, or multi-currency settlement. International payment processing involves understanding banking regulations, tax obligations, and business practices across multiple jurisdictions.\n\nSupporting international payments properly requires partnerships with local payment providers, understanding of regional customer preferences, and compliance with diverse regulatory frameworks. This expansion would multiply the complexity of every system component.\n\n**Subscription and Recurring Billing** involves complex business logic around billing cycles, proration calculations, dunning management for failed payments, and subscription lifecycle management. While our payment processing engine could theoretically handle recurring charges, we exclude the subscription management layer that would coordinate billing schedules, handle plan changes, manage customer communication for billing issues, and integrate with business systems for usage-based billing.\n\nSubscription billing is essentially a complete business application built on top of payment processing primitives. The complexity lies not in charging cards repeatedly, but in managing all the business rules, customer communication, and operational processes around subscription relationships.\n\n| Subscription Feature | Business Complexity | Technical Complexity | External Dependencies |\n|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Billing Cycles | High - multiple cycle types, proration | Medium - scheduling, date math | Calendar systems, time zones |\n| Dunning Management | High - customer communication, retry logic | Medium - workflow automation | Email systems, notification services |\n| Plan Management | Very High - pricing rules, feature gates | High - configuration management | Product catalog, entitlement systems |\n| Usage Billing | Very High - metering, rating, aggregation | Very High - data processing pipelines | Usage tracking, analytics systems |\n\n**Marketplace and Multi-Party Payments** enable platforms to facilitate payments between multiple parties with split settlements, escrow functionality, and complex fee structures. While conceptually similar to basic payment processing, marketplace payments require additional legal frameworks, compliance considerations, and business logic around fund holding, dispute resolution between multiple parties, and tax reporting for platform transactions.\n\nThe regulatory complexity of marketplace payments varies significantly by jurisdiction, often requiring money transmitter licenses and additional compliance obligations beyond basic payment processing.\n\n**Advanced Reporting and Analytics** beyond basic transaction reporting falls outside our scope. We exclude comprehensive business intelligence dashboards, predictive analytics, customer behavior analysis, and advanced financial reporting. While our system maintains audit logs and basic transaction history, we don't build sophisticated reporting tools, data warehousing capabilities, or integration with business intelligence platforms.\n\nPayment analytics can become extremely sophisticated, involving customer segmentation, cohort analysis, revenue forecasting, and integration with broader business metrics. This represents a separate application domain that consumes payment data rather than processing payments directly.\n\n> **Design Principle: Focused Scope**\n> \n> By explicitly limiting scope to core payment processing functionality, we can implement a robust, well-tested payment gateway within reasonable time constraints. Each excluded feature could easily double the implementation effort and introduce additional failure modes, external dependencies, and compliance requirements. The goal is building a solid foundation that supports future extensions rather than attempting to solve every payment-related problem immediately.\n\n**Legacy System Integration** with existing merchant systems, ERP platforms, accounting software, and custom business applications requires extensive configuration, data transformation, and workflow coordination capabilities. While our payment gateway provides standard REST APIs that can integrate with various systems, we don't build custom connectors, data synchronization tools, or workflow orchestration engines for specific business systems.\n\nIntegration complexity grows exponentially with the number and diversity of systems involved. Each integration often requires understanding the target system's data model, business processes, and technical constraints—work that typically requires business analysis and custom development for each merchant.\n\n**Compliance Beyond PCI DSS** such as SOX financial reporting, GDPR data protection, industry-specific regulations (healthcare, government), and regional payment regulations represents additional complexity that extends beyond basic payment processing. While our system design considers privacy and security principles, we don't implement comprehensive compliance frameworks for specialized industries or jurisdictions.\n\nDifferent compliance requirements often conflict with each other or require extensive documentation, testing, and audit procedures that significantly impact development timelines and system complexity.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nBuilding a payment gateway with clear scope boundaries requires establishing development practices that resist feature creep while ensuring core functionality meets production quality standards.

Just as an airport has distinct terminals (domestic, international, cargo), specialized staff (air traffic control, security, customs), and coordination systems (flight tracking, baggage handling), our payment gateway orchestrates multiple specialized components that must work in perfect harmony to move money safely from customers to merchants.\n\nThe architectural challenge mirrors managing a complex transportation hub: we must handle high-volume traffic (thousands of payments per minute), maintain strict security protocols (PCI compliance), coordinate with external systems (payment providers, banks), and ensure nothing gets lost in transit (payment reconciliation). Each component has specialized responsibilities, but they must communicate seamlessly to deliver a unified payment experience.\n\n### Component Overview\n\nOur payment gateway architecture divides responsibilities among five core components, each designed with a specific purpose in the overall payment processing ecosystem. This separation follows the principle of single responsibility while enabling loose coupling between components for maintainability and scalability.\n\n**Payment Intent Manager** serves as the initial point of contact for all payment requests, functioning like a reservation system at a restaurant. When a customer decides to make a purchase, this component creates a payment intent - essentially a commitment that payment will be attempted with specific terms (amount, currency, metadata). The manager handles idempotency key validation to prevent duplicate charges, manages the payment intent lifecycle through various states, and provides the foundation for all subsequent payment operations.\n\n**Processing Engine** acts as the core transaction processor, similar to how a bank's wire transfer department handles actual money movement. This component takes validated payment intents and orchestrates the complex process of charging payment methods through external providers. It manages payment method tokenization for security, implements 3D Secure authentication flows for regulatory compliance, and handles the intricate dance of authorization and capture that defines modern payment processing.\n\n**Refund and Dispute Handler** manages the post-payment lifecycle, functioning like a customer service department with the authority to reverse transactions. This component processes both merchant-initiated refunds and customer-initiated chargebacks, maintains careful accounting to ensure refund amounts never exceed original charges, and implements the complex workflows required for dispute evidence submission and chargeback management.\n\n**Webhook Processor** serves as the system's nervous system, receiving and processing real-time notifications from external payment providers. Like a financial news ticker that updates traders on market movements, this component ensures our local payment state stays synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by payment providers, handling the complexities of signature verification, event deduplication, and ordered processing.\n\n**State Reconciliation Service** acts as the system's auditing department, periodically comparing our local payment records against the authoritative state maintained by payment providers. This component catches discrepancies that might arise from missed webhooks, network failures, or processing errors, ensuring long-term data consistency even in the face of temporary communication failures.\n\nThe following table details each component's specific responsibilities:\n\n| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Operations | Data Ownership |\n|-----------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Payment Intent Manager | Intent lifecycle management | Create intent, validate idempotency, track expiration | `PaymentIntent` records, idempotency keys |\n| Processing Engine | Payment execution | Tokenize payment methods, process charges, handle 3DS | `Charge` records, payment method tokens |\n| Refund and Dispute Handler | Payment reversals | Process refunds, handle chargebacks, manage disputes | `Refund` records, dispute evidence |\n| Webhook Processor | Real-time state sync | Verify signatures, process events, update records | `WebhookEvent` logs, processing state |\n| State Reconciliation Service | Periodic consistency checks | Compare states, detect discrepancies, trigger corrections | Reconciliation reports, sync status |\n\n> **Decision: Microservice vs Monolithic Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Payment systems require high reliability and clear component boundaries, but also need strong consistency guarantees and transactional integrity\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Microservices with event-driven communication\n>   2. Modular monolith with clear internal boundaries\n>   3. Hybrid approach with core payments as monolith and auxiliary services separate\n> - **Decision**: Modular monolith with clear internal component boundaries\n> - **Rationale**: Payment processing requires ACID transactions across multiple operations (intent creation, charge processing, state updates). Distributed transactions are complex and introduce failure modes. A monolith allows database transactions to span components while still maintaining clear separation of concerns through interfaces and dependency injection.\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler deployment and testing, stronger consistency guarantees, but requires discipline to maintain component boundaries and may require refactoring to microservices if scaling demands exceed single-instance capabilities.\n\n### Data Flow Patterns\n\nPayment data flows through our system following predictable patterns that mirror real-world financial transactions. Understanding these flows is crucial because payment processing is inherently stateful - each step depends on the successful completion of previous steps, and failures at any point require careful rollback or compensation logic.\n\n**Intent Creation Flow** begins when a client application (web frontend, mobile app, or API integration) initiates a payment request. The flow starts with HTTP request validation, ensuring all required fields are present and properly formatted. The system validates the monetary amount using `validate_amount()` to convert dollar amounts to cents and prevent floating-point arithmetic errors. Currency validation through `validate_currency()` ensures compliance with ISO 4217 standards. The idempotency key undergoes validation via `validate_idempotency_key()` to ensure proper format and uniqueness constraints.\n\nThe Payment Intent Manager checks for existing intents with the same idempotency key. If found, it returns the existing intent without creating a duplicate, implementing true idempotent behavior. If no duplicate exists, the manager creates a new `PaymentIntent` record with status `created`, stores it in the database within a transaction, and returns the intent details including a client secret for subsequent operations.\n\n**Payment Processing Flow** activates when a client confirms a payment intent by submitting payment method details. The Processing Engine receives the confirmation request along with the payment method information (credit card details, bank account information, or alternative payment method tokens). The engine immediately tokenizes sensitive payment data, replacing credit card numbers with opaque tokens that cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal the original information.\n\nFor credit card payments requiring 3D Secure authentication, the engine initiates the authentication challenge by redirecting the customer to their issuing bank's authentication page. The customer completes the authentication (entering a password, using biometric verification, or confirming via mobile app), and the bank redirects back to our system with authentication results.\n\nUpon successful authentication (or for payments not requiring 3DS), the engine submits the charge request to the external payment provider. The provider processes the payment through banking networks, applying fraud checks, verifying account balances, and obtaining authorization from the issuing bank. The response updates our local `Charge` record with the final status and transaction identifiers.\n\n**Webhook Reconciliation Flow** operates asynchronously as payment providers send real-time notifications about payment state changes. The Webhook Processor receives HTTP POST requests at our webhook endpoint, immediately verifying the payload signature using HMAC-SHA256 to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing attacks.\n\nValid webhooks undergo event processing where the processor extracts payment identifiers, determines the event type (charge succeeded, payment failed, refund completed), and updates corresponding local records. The processor implements deduplication by checking webhook event IDs against previously processed events, ensuring idempotent handling even when providers retry webhook delivery.\n\n**State Reconciliation Flow** runs periodically (typically every 15-30 minutes) to catch any discrepancies between local payment state and provider authoritative state. The reconciliation service queries recent payment records from our database, fetches corresponding payment status from external providers via API calls, and compares the states. Discrepancies trigger alert notifications and automated correction workflows where possible.\n\nThe following table illustrates the complete data transformation journey:\n\n| Flow Stage | Input Data | Processing Component | Output Data | Persistence Layer |\n|------------|------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Intent Creation | Client payment request | Payment Intent Manager | `PaymentIntent` with status `created` | PostgreSQL payment_intents table |\n| Method Tokenization | Raw payment method data | Processing Engine | Payment method token | Secure token vault (encrypted) |\n| 3DS Authentication | Customer credentials | External issuer bank | Authentication result token | Processing Engine memory (temporary) |\n| Charge Processing | Tokenized payment method | Processing Engine | `Charge` with status `succeeded`/`failed` | PostgreSQL charges table |\n| Webhook Processing | Provider notification | Webhook Processor | Updated payment status | PostgreSQL webhook_events table |\n| State Reconciliation | Local vs provider state | Reconciliation Service | Consistency report | PostgreSQL reconciliation_logs table |\n\n> The critical insight here is that payment data never travels in a straight line - it flows through multiple validation, transformation, and storage steps, with each step designed to be recoverable in case of failures. This pipeline approach ensures we can trace any payment's journey and resume processing from any interruption point.\n\n**Error Recovery Flow** activates when any step in the normal processing flow encounters a failure. The system maintains detailed audit logs at each processing stage, allowing precise identification of failure points. For transient failures (network timeouts, provider rate limiting), the system implements exponential backoff retry logic with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. For permanent failures (invalid payment methods, insufficient funds), the system updates payment status accordingly and triggers customer notification workflows.\n\n### Recommended Project Structure\n\nA well-organized codebase is essential for payment systems because regulatory compliance, security audits, and maintenance require clear separation between different types of functionality. Our project structure reflects the architectural components while providing clear boundaries between business logic, external integrations, and infrastructure concerns.\n\nThe project follows a layered architecture pattern where each directory has a specific purpose and dependency direction flows from outer layers (HTTP handlers) toward inner layers (domain logic) toward infrastructure layers (database, external APIs). This structure enables easy testing by allowing infrastructure dependencies to be mocked or stubbed during unit tests.\n\n**Top-Level Organization** separates executable entry points, internal business logic, external integrations, database schemas, and configuration. The `cmd/` directory contains main functions for different deployment modes (web server, background workers, CLI tools). The `internal/` directory houses all business logic and is not importable by external packages, enforcing encapsulation. The `pkg/` directory contains utilities that could be shared with other projects. The `migrations/` directory contains database schema evolution scripts with version control.\n\n**Component Module Structure** within the `internal/` directory maps directly to our architectural components. Each component gets its own subdirectory with a consistent internal structure: main business logic files, test files, internal interfaces, and component-specific utilities. This organization makes it easy for developers to locate functionality and maintain clear boundaries between components.\n\n**External Integration Structure** isolates all third-party dependencies in dedicated modules. Payment provider integrations live in separate subdirectories under `internal/providers/`, allowing easy swapping between different providers (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen) through common interfaces. Database access layers provide abstraction over SQL queries, enabling database migrations and testing with different database engines.\n\n**Configuration and Deployment Structure** separates environment-specific configuration from code. The `config/` directory contains YAML or JSON files for different deployment environments (development, staging, production). Docker files and Kubernetes manifests live in `deployments/` directory. Documentation and API specifications reside in `docs/` directory.\n\nHere's the complete recommended project structure:\n\n```\npayment-gateway/\n├── cmd/\n│   ├── server/\n│   │   └── main.go                    # HTTP server entry point\n│   ├── worker/\n│   │   └── main.go                    # Background job processor\n│   └── reconciler/\n│       └── main.go                    # State reconciliation service\n├── internal/\n│   ├── intent/\n│   │   ├── manager.go                 # PaymentIntent business logic\n│   │   ├── manager_test.go            # Intent manager tests\n│   │   ├── idempotency.go             # Idempotency key handling\n│   │   └── expiration.go              # Intent expiration logic\n│   ├── processing/\n│   │   ├── engine.go                  # Charge processing logic\n│   │   ├── engine_test.go             # Processing engine tests\n│   │   ├── three_ds.go                # 3D Secure authentication\n│   │   └── tokenization.go            # Payment method tokenization\n│   ├── refunds/\n│   │   ├── handler.go                 # Refund processing logic\n│   │   ├── disputes.go                # Chargeback and dispute handling\n│   │   └── accounting.go              # Payment accounting ledger\n│   ├── webhooks/\n│   │   ├── processor.go               # Webhook event processing\n│   │   ├── verification.go            # Signature verification\n│   │   └── deduplication.go           # Event deduplication\n│   ├── reconciliation/\n│   │   ├── service.go                 # State reconciliation logic\n│   │   └── scheduler.go               # Periodic reconciliation jobs\n│   ├── providers/\n│   │   ├── stripe/\n│   │   │   ├── client.go              # Stripe API integration\n│   │   │   └── webhooks.go            # Stripe webhook handling\n│   │   └── interface.go               # Common provider interface\n│   ├── storage/\n│   │   ├── database.go                # Database connection management\n│   │   ├── payment_intents.go         # PaymentIntent repository\n│   │   ├── charges.go                 # Charge repository\n│   │   ├── refunds.go                 # Refund repository\n│   │   └── webhook_events.go          # WebhookEvent repository\n│   ├── models/\n│   │   ├── payment_intent.go          # PaymentIntent domain model\n│   │   ├── charge.go                  # Charge domain model\n│   │   ├── refund.go                  # Refund domain model\n│   │   └── webhook_event.go           # WebhookEvent domain model\n│   ├── validation/\n│   │   ├── amount.go                  # validate_amount implementation\n│   │   ├── currency.go                # validate_currency implementation\n│   │   └── idempotency.go             # validate_idempotency_key implementation\n│   └── transport/\n│       ├── http/\n│       │   ├── handlers/\n│       │   │   ├── payment_intents.go # Payment intent HTTP handlers\n│       │   │   ├── charges.go         # Charge HTTP handlers\n│       │   │   ├── refunds.go         # Refund HTTP handlers\n│       │   │   └── webhooks.go        # Webhook HTTP handlers\n│       │   ├── middleware/\n│       │   │   ├── auth.go            # Authentication middleware\n│       │   │   ├── rate_limit.go      # Rate limiting middleware\n│       │   │   └── logging.go         # Request logging middleware\n│       │   └── server.go              # HTTP server setup\n│       └── grpc/\n│           ├── server.go              # gRPC server (future extension)\n│           └── proto/                 # Protocol buffer definitions\n├── pkg/\n│   ├── crypto/\n│   │   ├── hmac.go                    # HMAC signature utilities\n│   │   └── tokens.go                  # Token generation utilities\n│   └── money/\n│       ├── currency.go                # Currency handling utilities\n│       └── amounts.go                 # Money amount utilities\n├── migrations/\n│   ├── 001_create_payment_intents.sql # Database schema migration\n│   ├── 002_create_charges.sql         # Charge table creation\n│   ├── 003_create_refunds.sql         # Refund table creation\n│   └── 004_create_webhook_events.sql  # WebhookEvent table creation\n├── config/\n│   ├── development.yaml               # Development environment config\n│   ├── staging.yaml                   # Staging environment config\n│   └── production.yaml                # Production environment config\n├── deployments/\n│   ├── docker/\n│   │   └── Dockerfile                 # Container image definition\n│   └── kubernetes/\n│       ├── deployment.yaml            # Kubernetes deployment\n│       └── service.yaml               # Kubernetes service\n├── docs/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   └── openapi.yaml               # API specification\n│   └── architecture/\n│       └── diagrams/                  # Architecture diagrams\n└── scripts/\n    ├── setup-dev.sh                   # Development environment setup\n    └── run-tests.sh                   # Test execution script\n```\n\n> **Decision: Repository Pattern vs Active Record**\n> - **Context**: Payment data requires complex querying, transaction management, and needs to support multiple database engines for different deployment environments\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Active Record pattern with models containing database logic\n>   2. Repository pattern with separate data access layer\n>   3. Raw SQL with query builders\n> - **Decision**: Repository pattern with dedicated storage layer\n> - **Rationale**: Payment systems require complex transactional integrity across multiple tables. Repository pattern allows easy testing with mock implementations, supports multiple database backends, and keeps business logic separate from data persistence concerns. This is critical for PCI compliance audits which require clear separation of concerns.\n> - **Consequences**: More code to write and maintain, but better testability, cleaner business logic, and easier compliance with security standards.\n\n**Development Workflow Organization** supports both individual developer productivity and team collaboration. Each component has its own test suite that can run independently, enabling fast feedback loops during development. Integration tests that span multiple components live in a separate `tests/` directory with realistic test data and scenarios.\n\nThe configuration structure supports environment-specific overrides while keeping sensitive data (API keys, database passwords) in environment variables rather than committed files. Database migrations are versioned and can be applied automatically during deployment, ensuring schema consistency across environments.\n\nThis structure scales from initial development through production deployment, supporting team growth by providing clear ownership boundaries and enabling parallel development across different components.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe payment gateway architecture requires careful technology choices and a robust development foundation. This guidance provides concrete recommendations for implementing each architectural layer, with working starter code and clear development milestones.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n- **Database Sessions**: Use FastAPI's `Depends(get_db)` for automatic session management. Sessions are automatically closed after request completion.\n- **Async vs Sync**: Start with synchronous SQLAlchemy for simplicity.

Think of the data model as a comprehensive audit trail for a bank - every action, state change, and monetary movement must be precisely recorded with immutable timestamps and references. Unlike typical application data that can be updated in-place, payment data follows append-only patterns where historical states are preserved for regulatory compliance and dispute resolution.\n\nThe core challenge in payment data modeling is handling the inherent asynchrony of financial systems. A single customer payment intent spawns multiple interconnected records across different tables as the transaction flows through various stages: intent creation, authorization, capture, settlement, and potential refunds or disputes. Each stage may occur minutes, hours, or even days apart, requiring careful relationship management and state consistency.\n\n![Payment Data Model Relationships](./diagrams/payment-data-model.svg)\n\n### Core Payment Entities\n\nThe payment system's data model centers around four primary entities that represent different aspects of the payment lifecycle. These entities form a hierarchical relationship where each level adds specificity and operational detail to the layer above.\n\n**Payment Intent** represents the customer's commitment to pay before any money actually moves. Think of a payment intent as a formal IOU that establishes the transaction context, amount, currency, and associated metadata. The intent serves as the immutable anchor point that persists throughout the entire payment lifecycle, providing a stable identifier that remains constant even as the underlying payment methods, amounts, or processing details change.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Globally unique payment intent identifier (pi_xxxx format) |\n| `amount` | `int` | Payment amount in smallest currency unit (cents for USD) |\n| `currency` | `str` | ISO 4217 three-letter currency code (USD, EUR, GBP) |\n| `status` | `PaymentIntentStatus` | Current state in the payment intent lifecycle |\n| `idempotency_key` | `str` | Client-provided unique key for duplicate request prevention |\n| `metadata` | `dict` | Arbitrary key-value data attached by merchant application |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Immutable timestamp when intent was first created |\n| `expires_at` | `datetime` | Automatic cancellation timestamp for stale intents |\n| `client_secret` | `str` | Secret token for client-side payment confirmation |\n| `last_payment_error` | `dict` | Most recent error encountered during payment processing |\n\nThe `amount` field stores monetary values as integers in the smallest currency unit to eliminate floating-point precision errors. For USD, $10.00 becomes 1000 cents. The `idempotency_key` enables safe retry behavior - if a client sends the same key twice, they receive the same response rather than creating duplicate payments.\n\n**Charge** represents the actual movement of money from customer to merchant for a specific payment intent. While a payment intent declares the intention to pay, a charge executes that intention by submitting payment details to the card network or bank. Multiple charges may be associated with a single payment intent if the first charge fails and requires retry with different payment methods.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Globally unique charge identifier (ch_xxxx format) |\n| `payment_intent_id` | `str` | Foreign key reference to associated payment intent |\n| `amount` | `int` | Actual charged amount in smallest currency unit |\n| `status` | `ChargeStatus` | Current processing status of the charge |\n| `payment_method_token` | `str` | Tokenized reference to customer payment method |\n| `failure_code` | `str` | Standardized error code if charge failed |\n| `failure_message` | `str` | Human-readable error description if charge failed |\n| `network_transaction_id` | `str` | Payment network's identifier for this transaction |\n| `authorization_code` | `str` | Bank authorization code for successful charges |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when charge was initiated |\n| `settled_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when funds were actually transferred |\n\nThe `payment_method_token` field contains an opaque reference to the customer's payment details rather than storing sensitive card information directly. This tokenization approach maintains PCI DSS compliance by ensuring sensitive data never touches the merchant's systems.\n\n**Refund** represents the return of previously charged funds back to the customer. Refunds maintain a direct relationship to their originating charge and track the complex state transitions involved in reversing money movement through banking networks. Partial refunds are supported, allowing merchants to return portions of the original charge while retaining the remainder.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Globally unique refund identifier (re_xxxx format) |\n| `charge_id` | `str` | Foreign key reference to the charge being refunded |\n| `amount` | `int` | Refund amount in smallest currency unit |\n| `status` | `RefundStatus` | Current processing status of the refund |\n| `reason` | `str` | Merchant-provided reason for the refund |\n| `network_transaction_id` | `str` | Payment network identifier for refund transaction |\n| `failure_code` | `str` | Error code if refund processing failed |\n| `failure_message` | `str` | Human-readable error description if refund failed |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when refund was initiated |\n| `processed_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when refund completed processing |\n\n**Webhook Event** captures all payment-related notifications received from external payment providers. These events serve as the authoritative source of truth for payment state changes, providing the external perspective on transaction status that must be reconciled with internal records.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Globally unique webhook event identifier |\n| `event_type` | `str` | Standardized event type (payment_intent.succeeded, charge.failed) |\n| `payload` | `dict` | Complete event data received from payment provider |\n| `signature` | `str` | HMAC signature for webhook authenticity verification |\n| `processed_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when webhook was successfully processed |\n| `processing_attempts` | `int` | Number of times processing was attempted |\n| `last_processing_error` | `str` | Most recent error encountered during processing |\n| `source_ip` | `str` | IP address that sent the webhook (for security logging) |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when webhook was first received |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The webhook event entity serves dual purposes - it provides idempotency for webhook processing (preventing duplicate handling of the same event) and creates an audit trail for troubleshooting payment discrepancies. Every webhook is preserved permanently to support regulatory compliance and dispute resolution.\n\n**Dispute** represents customer-initiated chargebacks where the cardholder contests a charge through their issuing bank. Disputes introduce significant complexity because they operate outside the normal payment flow and can occur months after the original transaction. The dispute entity tracks the complex lifecycle of chargeback management including evidence submission deadlines and resolution outcomes.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Globally unique dispute identifier (dp_xxxx format) |\n| `charge_id` | `str` | Foreign key reference to the disputed charge |\n| `amount` | `int` | Disputed amount in smallest currency unit |\n| `status` | `DisputeStatus` | Current stage of dispute processing |\n| `reason` | `str` | Cardholder's stated reason for the dispute |\n| `evidence_due_by` | `datetime` | Deadline for submitting dispute evidence |\n| `evidence_submitted` | `bool` | Whether merchant evidence was submitted |\n| `network_reason_code` | `str` | Payment network's standardized dispute code |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when dispute was first reported |\n| `resolved_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when dispute reached final resolution |\n\n### State Enumerations\n\nPayment processing requires carefully managed state machines to track the progression of financial transactions through their complex lifecycles. Each entity maintains its own state enumeration with strictly defined transition rules that prevent invalid state changes and ensure data consistency.\n\n> **Decision: Explicit State Enumerations vs. Boolean Flags**\n> - **Context**: Payment entities need to track their progression through multi-step processes with complex state transitions\n> - **Options Considered**: Boolean flags (is_pending, is_completed), status strings, enumerated states\n> - **Decision**: Use explicit enumerated states with controlled transitions\n> - **Rationale**: Enumerations prevent invalid state combinations, make state transitions explicit, and provide type safety for state-dependent operations\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more upfront design but eliminates entire classes of state consistency bugs\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Boolean Flags | Simple to implement, flexible combinations | Allows invalid states, no transition control | ❌ |\n| String Status | Easy to extend, human-readable | No type safety, typo-prone, no validation | ❌ |\n| Explicit Enums | Type-safe, controlled transitions, clear semantics | More upfront design, migration complexity | ✅ |\n\n**Payment Intent Status** governs the high-level lifecycle of a customer's commitment to pay. The state machine ensures that payment intents progress logically from creation through completion or cancellation without skipping intermediate states or moving backwards inappropriately.\n\n| State | Description | Valid Transitions | Terminal State |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `created` | Intent established but no payment processing attempted | `requires_action`, `processing`, `canceled` | ❌ |\n| `requires_action` | Customer action needed (3D Secure authentication) | `processing`, `canceled` | ❌ |\n| `processing` | Payment being processed by external provider | `succeeded`, `requires_action`, `canceled` | ❌ |\n| `succeeded` | Payment completed successfully | None | ✅ |\n| `canceled` | Payment intent canceled before completion | None | ✅ |\n\nThe `requires_action` state handles Strong Customer Authentication scenarios where additional customer interaction is required. Payment intents in this state wait for customer completion of 3D Secure challenges or similar authentication flows.\n\n**Charge Status** tracks the execution of money movement for individual payment attempts. Charges have a simpler state machine than payment intents because they represent discrete processing attempts rather than ongoing customer interactions.\n\n| State | Description | Valid Transitions | Terminal State |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `pending` | Charge submitted to payment processor | `succeeded`, `failed` | ❌ |\n| `succeeded` | Funds successfully captured from customer | None | ✅ |\n| `failed` | Charge processing failed permanently | None | ✅ |\n\n**Refund Status** manages the complex process of returning funds through banking networks. Refund processing involves multiple parties (merchant, payment processor, issuing bank, customer bank) and can fail at various stages, requiring careful state tracking.\n\n| State | Description | Valid Transitions | Terminal State |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `pending` | Refund initiated but not yet processed | `succeeded`, `failed` | ❌ |\n| `succeeded` | Refund completed and funds returned to customer | None | ✅ |\n| `failed` | Refund processing failed permanently | None | ✅ |\n\n**Dispute Status** tracks the extended lifecycle of chargeback management, which can span months and involve multiple rounds of evidence submission and review by card networks.\n\n| State | Description | Valid Transitions | Terminal State |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| `warning_needs_response` | Pre-dispute warning requiring merchant response | `under_review`, `charge_refunded` | ❌ |\n| `under_review` | Evidence submitted, awaiting network decision | `won`, `lost` | ❌ |\n| `charge_refunded` | Merchant refunded to avoid formal dispute | None | ✅ |\n| `won` | Merchant successfully defended the dispute | None | ✅ |\n| `lost` | Dispute resolved in favor of cardholder | None | ✅ |\n\n> **Critical Insight**: State transitions must be validated at the database level using check constraints to prevent application bugs from creating invalid state combinations. Invalid states in payment processing can lead to regulatory violations and financial losses.\n\n### Entity Relationships\n\nThe payment data model implements a hierarchical relationship structure where higher-level entities (payment intents) provide context and stability while lower-level entities (charges, refunds) handle operational details and state changes. These relationships must maintain referential integrity even under high concurrency and system failures.\n\n**Payment Intent to Charge Relationship** follows a one-to-many pattern where a single payment intent may generate multiple charges if initial attempts fail or require different payment methods. This relationship enables robust retry logic while maintaining a consistent customer experience.\n\nThe foreign key relationship uses `payment_intent_id` in the charge table referencing `id` in the payment intent table. Database constraints prevent orphaned charges and ensure every charge has a valid parent intent. The relationship includes cascade rules that handle cleanup when payment intents are archived or deleted.\n\n```\nPaymentIntent (1) ←→ (Many) Charge\n  - One intent can have multiple charge attempts\n  - Charge.payment_intent_id → PaymentIntent.id\n  - ON DELETE CASCADE: removing intent removes all associated charges\n  - Unique constraint on (payment_intent_id, sequence_number) orders attempts\n```\n\n**Charge to Refund Relationship** implements one-to-many semantics supporting partial refunds where multiple refund transactions may apply to a single charge. The relationship includes validation constraints ensuring total refund amounts never exceed the original charge amount.\n\n```\nCharge (1) ←→ (Many) Refund  \n  - One charge can have multiple partial refunds\n  - Refund.charge_id → Charge.id\n  - ON DELETE RESTRICT: charges with refunds cannot be deleted\n  - Check constraint: SUM(refunds.amount) ≤ charge.amount\n```\n\n**Charge to Dispute Relationship** follows one-to-one semantics since card networks typically allow only one dispute per charge. However, the relationship uses one-to-many modeling to accommodate edge cases where disputes are reopened or multiple dispute types apply to the same transaction.\n\n```\nCharge (1) ←→ (Many) Dispute\n  - Typically one dispute per charge, but supports multiple for edge cases\n  - Dispute.charge_id → Charge.id  \n  - ON DELETE RESTRICT: disputed charges cannot be deleted\n  - Check constraint: Only one active dispute per charge\n```\n\n**Webhook Event Relationships** use polymorphic references where a single webhook event may relate to any of the core payment entities depending on the event type. The relationship uses a combination of event type and entity ID to establish connections.\n\n```\nWebhookEvent ←→ PaymentIntent/Charge/Refund/Dispute\n  - Event.payload contains entity_id and entity_type\n  - No direct foreign key due to polymorphic nature\n  - Application-level validation ensures referenced entities exist\n  - Index on (entity_type, entity_id, event_type) for efficient lookups\n```\n\n> **Decision: Direct Foreign Keys vs. Polymorphic References for Webhooks**\n> - **Context**: Webhook events can reference any type of payment entity based on the event content\n> - **Options Considered**: Separate webhook tables per entity, polymorphic columns, JSON payload references\n> - **Decision**: Use JSON payload references with application-level validation\n> - **Rationale**: Webhook payloads are inherently polymorphic and change frequently; rigid foreign key constraints would require constant schema migrations\n> - **Consequences**: Enables flexible webhook handling but requires careful application-level referential integrity validation\n\n**Referential Integrity Constraints** ensure data consistency across the entire payment system. These constraints prevent common data corruption scenarios and provide strong guarantees about relationship validity.\n\n| Constraint Type | Implementation | Purpose |\n|----------------|----------------|---------|\n| Foreign Key | `charge.payment_intent_id → payment_intent.id` | Prevent orphaned charges |\n| Foreign Key | `refund.charge_id → charge.id` | Prevent orphaned refunds |\n| Foreign Key | `dispute.charge_id → charge.id` | Prevent orphaned disputes |\n| Check | `SUM(refund.amount WHERE charge_id = X) ≤ charge.amount` | Prevent over-refunding |\n| Check | `payment_intent.amount > 0` | Ensure positive payment amounts |\n| Check | `refund.amount > 0` | Ensure positive refund amounts |\n| Unique | `(payment_intent.idempotency_key)` | Prevent duplicate intents |\n| Unique | `(webhook_event.id, event_type)` | Prevent duplicate webhook processing |\n\n**Cascade Behavior** defines what happens to related entities when parent records are modified or deleted. Payment systems require careful cascade design to balance data integrity with regulatory preservation requirements.\n\n| Parent Entity | Child Entity | Delete Behavior | Update Behavior |\n|---------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| PaymentIntent | Charge | CASCADE | CASCADE |\n| Charge | Refund | RESTRICT | CASCADE |\n| Charge | Dispute | RESTRICT | CASCADE |\n| PaymentIntent | WebhookEvent | NO ACTION | NO ACTION |\n\nThe RESTRICT behavior on charges with refunds or disputes prevents accidental deletion of financially significant records. Webhook events use NO ACTION because they represent historical audit data that must be preserved regardless of entity lifecycle changes.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Entity Relationships:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Allowing Null Foreign Keys in Financial Records**\nFinancial entities should never have orphaned records due to null foreign keys. Every charge must belong to a payment intent, every refund must reference a charge. Null foreign keys in payment processing indicate data corruption and can lead to reconciliation failures. Use NOT NULL constraints on all relationship columns and validate relationships before insertion.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Cascade Rules for Payment Intent Cleanup**\nPayment intents that fail early in the lifecycle may accumulate without proper cleanup, leading to database bloat and performance degradation. Implement time-based cascade rules that automatically remove failed payment intents after appropriate retention periods, ensuring associated charges and events are cleaned up appropriately.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Referential Integrity for Polymorphic Webhook References**\nSince webhooks use JSON payload references rather than foreign keys, application code must validate that referenced entities exist before processing events. Implement validation triggers or application-level checks to ensure webhook events never reference non-existent payment entities, preventing webhook processing failures.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe payment data model requires careful implementation to handle the unique requirements of financial data: immutability, auditability, and strict consistency guarantees. The recommended approach uses a combination of relational database features and application-level validation to ensure data integrity.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Database | PostgreSQL with JSON columns | PostgreSQL with separate audit tables |\n| ORM | SQLAlchemy with declarative models | SQLAlchemy with event listeners for audit trails |\n| Migrations | Alembic with manual schema changes | Alembic with automated rollback testing |\n| Validation | Pydantic models with custom validators | Pydantic with database constraint validation |\n| Testing | In-memory SQLite for unit tests | Docker PostgreSQL for integration tests |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\npayment_gateway/\n├── models/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── base.py              ← Base model with common fields\n│   ├── payment_intent.py    ← PaymentIntent model and status enum\n│   ├── charge.py            ← Charge model and status enum  \n│   ├── refund.py            ← Refund model and status enum\n│   ├── dispute.py           ← Dispute model and status enum\n│   └── webhook_event.py     ← WebhookEvent model\n├── database/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── session.py           ← Database session management\n│   └── constraints.py       ← Custom constraint validators\n├── validators/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── amount.py            ← Amount validation functions\n│   └── currency.py          ← Currency validation functions\n└── migrations/\n    └── alembic/             ← Database migration files\n```\n\n**Base Model Infrastructure (Complete Implementation):**\n\n```python\n# models/base.py\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Optional\nimport uuid\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, String, DateTime, func\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass BaseModel(Base):\n    __abstract__ = True\n    \n    id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))\n    created_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=func.now())\n    updated_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"<{self.__class__.__name__}(id='{self.id}')>\"\n\n# database/session.py\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session\nfrom typing import Generator\n\n# Database configuration\nDATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:password@localhost/payment_gateway\"\nengine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=False, pool_pre_ping=True)\nSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n\n@contextmanager\ndef get_db_session() -> Generator[Session, None, None]:\n    \"\"\"Database session dependency with automatic cleanup.\"\"\"\n    session = SessionLocal()\n    try:\n        yield session\n        session.commit()\n    except Exception:\n        session.rollback()\n        raise\n    finally:\n        session.close()\n\ndef get_db() -> Session:\n    \"\"\"FastAPI dependency for database sessions.\"\"\"\n    return SessionLocal()\n```\n\n**Validation Functions (Complete Implementation):**\n\n```python\n# validators/amount.py\ndef validate_amount(amount: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates payment amount ensuring positive value in smallest currency unit.\n    \n    Args:\n        amount: Amount in cents (or smallest currency unit)\n        \n    Returns:\n        Validated amount as integer\n        \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If amount is negative or zero\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(amount, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Amount must be an integer (cents)\")\n    if amount <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Amount must be positive\")\n    if amount > 99999999:  #

Just as that purchase contract has a lifecycle (signed, inspected, financed, closed), payment intents move through defined states from creation to completion. The critical insight is that creating the intent is separate from processing the payment, which allows us to handle complex scenarios like authentication challenges, network failures, and duplicate requests without accidentally charging customers multiple times.\n\nPayment intent management forms the foundation of reliable payment processing by establishing a clear contract between merchant and customer before attempting to move money. This separation of intent from execution enables sophisticated error handling, prevents duplicate charges through idempotency controls, and provides a clear audit trail for every payment attempt.\n\n### Payment Intent Lifecycle\n\nThe payment intent state machine governs how payment requests progress from initial creation through final resolution. Think of this like a restaurant order workflow - the order starts as \"placed\" (customer committed), moves to \"preparing\" (kitchen working), might require \"customer confirmation\" (special requests), and finally reaches \"completed\" or \"cancelled\". Each transition is controlled and reversible only within certain windows.\n\n![Payment Intent State Machine](./diagrams/payment-intent-states.svg)\n\n**State Definitions and Transitions:**\n\n| Current State | Valid Next States | Trigger Event | Business Logic | Rollback Allowed |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| `created` | `requires_action`, `processing`, `canceled` | Client confirms payment, 3DS required, timeout/cancellation | Initial state after intent creation | Yes - no money movement yet |\n| `requires_action` | `processing`, `canceled` | Customer completes 3DS, timeout/cancellation | Waiting for customer authentication | Yes - authentication not completed |\n| `processing` | `succeeded`, `canceled` | Provider confirms/rejects charge | Payment submitted to provider | Limited - may be too late |\n| `succeeded` | None (terminal) | Provider settles successfully | Money transferred, receipt generated | No - only via separate refund |\n| `canceled` | None (terminal) | Explicit cancellation or timeout | Intent abandoned or expired | No - final state |\n\nThe state machine enforces critical business rules that prevent money movement until all preconditions are met. For example, an intent cannot jump directly from `created` to `succeeded` - it must pass through `processing` to ensure proper provider interaction and audit logging.\n\n> **The Critical Insight**: Terminal states (`succeeded`, `canceled`) are permanent by design. Once money has moved or an intent has been definitively abandoned, the intent becomes immutable. This prevents accidental state corruption and provides clear audit boundaries.\n\n**State Transition Validation Logic:**\n\nEach state transition must satisfy specific preconditions to maintain system integrity. The validation rules ensure that payment intents follow realistic business workflows and prevent impossible state combinations.\n\n| Validation Rule | Check Performed | Failure Action |\n|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Monotonic progression | New state must be \"later\" in lifecycle | Reject transition with error |\n| Terminal state immutability | Cannot modify `succeeded` or `canceled` intents | Return current state unchanged |\n| Required field presence | Intent must have amount, currency, payment method | Block transition until complete |\n| Expiration boundary | Cannot process expired intents | Force transition to `canceled` |\n| Concurrent modification | Only one state change per intent at a time | Use database row locking |\n\n**Intent Metadata and Context:**\n\nPayment intents carry extensive metadata that enriches the payment context and supports advanced features like fraud detection, customer service, and analytics. This metadata remains mutable throughout the intent lifecycle, allowing merchants to add context as the payment progresses.\n\n| Metadata Category | Fields | Purpose | Mutability |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|------------|\n| Customer Context | `customer_id`, `email`, `billing_address` | Identity and fraud checks | Read-only after creation |\n| Order Details | `order_id`, `line_items`, `shipping_address` | Business context and fulfillment | Updateable until `processing` |\n| Payment Context | `payment_method_types`, `setup_future_usage` | Processing preferences | Read-only after creation |\n| Merchant Data | `statement_descriptor`, `receipt_email` | Customer-facing information | Updateable until `succeeded` |\n| System Tracking | `application_fee`, `transfer_data`, `on_behalf_of` | Marketplace and platform data | Read-only after creation |\n\n**Decision: State Machine Implementation Pattern**\n\n- **Context**: Need to enforce valid state transitions while supporting concurrent access and preventing race conditions\n- **Options Considered**: \n  - Enum-based validation with application logic\n  - Database constraints with state transition table\n  - Event sourcing with state reconstruction\n- **Decision**: Database constraints with application-level validation wrapper\n- **Rationale**: Combines database-level integrity guarantees with application flexibility, supports concurrent access through row locking, and provides clear audit trail\n- **Consequences**: Enables safe concurrent processing, requires careful transaction management, adds complexity to deployment (schema migrations)\n\n### Idempotency Key Design\n\nIdempotency keys solve the fundamental challenge of network unreliability in payment processing. Think of them like check numbers on paper checks - each check has a unique number, and if you accidentally submit the same check twice to your bank, the second submission is rejected rather than processed again. Similarly, idempotency keys ensure that network retries, browser refreshes, or accidental double-clicks don't result in multiple charges.\n\nThe idempotency system creates a binding between a client-provided unique identifier and a specific payment operation. Once that binding is established, any future request with the same idempotency key returns the result of the original operation rather than creating a new payment.\n\n**Idempotency Key Lifecycle and Storage:**\n\n| Phase | Key Status | Database State | Client Behavior | System Response |\n|-------|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| First Request | New | Key + request hash stored | Provides key + payment params | Process normally, store result |\n| Duplicate Request (same params) | Exists, params match | Key + request hash + result stored | Same key + same params | Return stored result |\n| Conflicting Request | Exists, params differ | Key + different request hash found | Same key + different params | Return 400 error - key reused incorrectly |\n| Expired Key | Exists but expired | Key marked expired in database | Same key after expiration | Allow new request with same key |\n| Processing Request | Exists, no result yet | Key stored, payment in progress | Same key while processing | Return current payment status |\n\nThe core challenge is distinguishing between legitimate retries (same operation, network hiccup) and incorrect key reuse (same key, different operation). We solve this by hashing the request parameters and storing that hash alongside the idempotency key.\n\n**Request Parameter Hashing Strategy:**\n\nTo detect parameter conflicts, we hash the essential payment parameters that define the operation's intent. The hash must be stable (same inputs always produce same hash) but sensitive to meaningful changes.\n\n| Parameter Category | Included in Hash | Excluded from Hash | Rationale |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Core Payment Data | `amount`, `currency`, `customer_id` | `metadata`, `description` | Financial impact vs. contextual info |\n| Payment Method | `payment_method_id`, `payment_method_types` | `receipt_email`, `statement_descriptor` | Payment execution vs. presentation |\n| System Context | `application_fee_amount`, `transfer_data` | `expand`, `trace_id` | Business logic vs. debugging/display |\n| Timing Data | None | `created_at`, `last_updated` | Parameters shouldn't include server-generated timestamps |\n\n> **Key Insight**: The parameter hash serves as a \"fingerprint\" of the payment intent. If two requests have the same idempotency key but different fingerprints, they represent different business operations and the second should be rejected to prevent accidental misuse.\n\n**Idempotency Key Generation and Validation:**\n\nClients must provide idempotency keys that are truly unique and sufficiently random to prevent accidental collisions. The system validates key format and provides guidance for proper generation.\n\n| Validation Rule | Requirement | Example Valid | Example Invalid | Error Message |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Length | 22-255 characters | `idem_1234567890abcdef` | `abc` (too short) | \"Idempotency key must be 22-255 characters\" |\n| Character Set | Alphanumeric, underscore, dash | `order-123_retry-1` | `key with spaces!` | \"Idempotency key contains invalid characters\" |\n| Uniqueness | No active duplicates in system | First use of any string | Reused key with different params | \"Idempotency key already used with different parameters\" |\n| Client Prefix | Recommended client identifier | `mobile_app_` prefix | Generic `key123` | Warning: \"Consider adding client prefix for easier debugging\" |\n\n**Database Schema for Idempotency Tracking:**\n\nThe idempotency table acts as a distributed lock and result cache, ensuring exactly-once semantics across concurrent requests.\n\n| Field | Type | Constraints | Purpose |\n|-------|------|-------------|---------|\n| `idempotency_key` | `varchar(255)` | Primary key, not null | Client-provided unique identifier |\n| `request_hash` | `varchar(64)` | Not null, index | SHA-256 of essential request parameters |\n| `payment_intent_id` | `varchar(255)` | Foreign key, nullable initially | Links to created payment intent |\n| `response_body` | `jsonb` | Nullable | Cached response for completed requests |\n| `response_status` | `integer` | Nullable | HTTP status of cached response |\n| `created_at` | `timestamp` | Not null, default now() | When idempotency key first used |\n| `completed_at` | `timestamp` | Nullable | When response was cached |\n| `expires_at` | `timestamp` | Not null, index | When key can be reused |\n| `client_ip` | `inet` | Nullable | Request source for debugging |\n\n**Decision: Idempotency Window Duration**\n\n- **Context**: Need to balance preventing duplicate charges with allowing legitimate key reuse after reasonable time\n- **Options Considered**: \n  - 24 hours (Stripe's approach)\n  - 1 hour (aggressive cleanup)\n  - 7 days (conservative approach)\n- **Decision**: 24 hours for most operations, 1 hour for failed operations\n- **Rationale**: 24 hours handles delayed retries and batch processing, 1 hour for failures allows quick recovery from transient issues without blocking legitimate retries\n- **Consequences**: Requires background cleanup process, balances safety with usability, follows industry standard\n\n### Intent Expiration Handling\n\nPayment intents have natural lifespans - customers don't hold shopping carts forever, and payment methods can become invalid over time. Think of intent expiration like restaurant reservations - if you don't show up within a reasonable window, the table gets released to other customers. Intent expiration prevents resource leaks, cleans up abandoned sessions, and ensures payment methods remain valid when processing occurs.\n\nThe expiration system operates on multiple timescales: short-term expiration for active user sessions, medium-term expiration for abandoned intents, and long-term cleanup for historical records. Each expiration tier serves different business and technical requirements.\n\n**Expiration Timing and Business Rules:**\n\n| Intent State | Default Expiration | Business Justification | System Behavior |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| `created` | 60 minutes | User actively in checkout flow | Transition to `canceled`, notify client |\n| `requires_action` | 30 minutes | Waiting for 3DS authentication | Transition to `canceled`, release payment method |\n| `processing` | 10 minutes | Provider should respond quickly | Investigate with provider, potential retry |\n| `succeeded` | Never expires | Permanent record for accounting | Archive to cold storage after 7 years |\n| `canceled` | Archive after 90 days | Fraud analysis and debugging | Move to historical archive |\n\nThe expiration times balance user experience (don't expire too quickly) with resource management (don't hold resources indefinitely). Different states have different urgency levels based on system resource consumption and user expectations.\n\n**Background Expiration Processing:**\n\nThe expiration system runs as a background service that periodically scans for expired intents and performs appropriate cleanup actions. This service must handle high volumes efficiently while maintaining data consistency.\n\n| Processing Stage | Operation | Batch Size | Frequency | Error Handling |\n|------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Scan for Expired | Query intents where `expires_at` < now() | 1000 records | Every 5 minutes | Log failures, continue with rest of batch |\n| State Transition | Update expired intents to `canceled` | 100 per transaction | As needed | Rollback transaction on failure |\n| Cleanup Resources | Release payment method tokens, clear cache | 10 concurrent | As needed | Retry individual failures |\n| Archive Records | Move old canceled intents to archive table | 500 records | Daily at 2 AM | Alert operations team on failure |\n| Update Metrics | Track expiration rates by state and reason | All processed records | Real-time | Non-blocking, best-effort |\n\n**Expiration Event Notification:**\n\nWhen payment intents expire, various system components need notification to clean up related resources and update external systems.\n\n| Notification Target | Event Type | Payload | Delivery Method | Retry Policy |\n|-------------------|------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Client Application | `payment_intent.canceled` | Intent ID, expiration reason | Webhook | 3 retries with exponential backoff |\n| Analytics System | `intent_expired` | Intent data, duration, state | Event stream | At-least-once delivery |\n| Customer Service | High-value intent expired | Customer info, order details | Alert queue | Immediate, with escalation |\n| Fraud Detection | Suspicious expiration pattern | IP, timing, behavior | Real-time API | Synchronous, fast timeout |\n| Cache Layer | `invalidate_intent` | Intent ID | Redis pub/sub | Fire-and-forget |\n\n**Graceful Expiration vs. Hard Timeout:**\n\nThe system implements a two-stage expiration process: graceful expiration that allows completion of in-flight operations, followed by hard timeout that forces cleanup regardless of state.\n\n| Expiration Type | Trigger Condition | Grace Period | Actions Allowed | Force Cleanup |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Graceful | `expires_at` reached | 5 minutes | Complete current operation, no new operations | No - allow natural completion |\n| Hard Timeout | Grace period exceeded | None | No operations allowed | Yes - force state transition |\n| Emergency | System overload or security threat | None | Immediate termination | Yes - aggressive cleanup |\n\nDuring graceful expiration, the intent can still transition to `succeeded` if a payment is actively processing. This prevents race conditions where a successful charge is incorrectly canceled due to timing.\n\n**Intent Extension and Renewal:**\n\nSome business scenarios require extending payment intent lifespans beyond default expiration times. The system supports controlled extension with proper authorization and limits.\n\n| Extension Reason | Max Extensions | Extension Duration | Authorization Required | Audit Trail |\n|------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| User Request | 2 extensions | 30 minutes each | Customer authentication | Full request/response log |\n| System Retry | 5 extensions | 10 minutes each | Automated based on error type | Error details and retry count |\n| Customer Service | No limit | Up to 24 hours | Support agent approval | Agent ID and business justification |\n| Fraud Investigation | No limit | Up to 7 days | Security team approval | Investigation case number |\n\n> **Design Principle**: Expiration is a safety mechanism, not a user-hostile feature. The goal is preventing resource leaks and stale state while maximizing successful payment completion rates.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Intent Expiration:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Condition Between Expiration and Success**\nWhen an intent expires while a payment is processing, the system might cancel the intent just as the payment succeeds, leading to a successful charge with a canceled intent. Fix this by checking payment status before forcing expiration and allowing a brief grace period for in-flight transactions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cascading Expiration Failures**\nIf the expiration background service fails, expired intents accumulate and can overwhelm the system when it recovers. Implement circuit breakers and gradual ramp-up when processing large backlogs of expired intents.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Timezone Confusion in Expiration Logic**\nStoring expiration times in local timezone or mixing timezone-aware and naive timestamps leads to incorrect expiration behavior. Always use UTC for internal expiration tracking and convert to local time only for display purposes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Expiration Monitoring**\nHigh expiration rates might indicate UX problems, system performance issues, or integration bugs, but without proper monitoring, these problems go undetected. Track expiration rates by state, duration, and cause to identify systematic issues.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Database | PostgreSQL with JSONB | PostgreSQL with separate tables for metadata | JSONB provides flexibility while maintaining ACID properties |\n| Caching | Redis for idempotency keys | Redis Cluster for high availability | Fast lookups for duplicate detection |\n| Background Jobs | Celery with Redis broker | Celery with RabbitMQ | Reliable task processing for expiration cleanup |\n| Monitoring | Python logging + Prometheus | Structured logging + DataDog | Essential for payment system observability |\n| API Framework | FastAPI with Pydantic | FastAPI with async PostgreSQL driver | Type safety and excellent OpenAPI documentation |\n\n**File Structure:**\n```\npayment_gateway/\n├── models/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── payment_intent.py      ← PaymentIntent model and state machine\n│   └── idempotency.py         ← IdempotencyKey model and validation\n├── services/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── payment_intent_service.py  ← Core business logic\n│   └── idempotency_service.py     ← Duplicate detection logic\n├── api/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── payment_intents.py     ← REST API endpoints\n├── workers/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── expiration_worker.py   ← Background expiration processing\n├── database/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── migrations/            ← Database schema changes\n└── tests/\n    ├── __init__.py\n    ├── test_payment_intent_service.py\n    └── test_idempotency_service.py\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\nComplete database models with all required fields and relationships:\n\n```python\n# models/payment_intent.py\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer, DateTime, JSON, Text\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID\nimport uuid\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass PaymentIntentStatus(str, Enum):\n    CREATED = \"created\"\n    REQUIRES_ACTION = \"requires_action\"\n    PROCESSING = \"processing\"\n    SUCCEEDED = \"succeeded\"\n    CANCELED = \"canceled\"\n\nclass PaymentIntent(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"payment_intents\"\n    \n    id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: f\"pi_{uuid.uuid4().hex}\")\n    amount = Column(Integer, nullable=False)  #

Think of this component as the execution engine of a stock trading system - while payment intents represent trading orders waiting to be executed, the processing engine actually submits those orders to the market (payment networks) and handles the complex choreography of authentication, authorization, and settlement.\n\nThis engine must orchestrate multiple asynchronous operations: tokenizing sensitive payment data, submitting charges to external providers, handling Strong Customer Authentication (3D Secure) redirects, and managing the various success and failure scenarios that can occur during payment processing. Unlike simple API calls, payment processing involves state machines, external redirects, and reconciliation across multiple systems.\n\nThe core challenge lies in maintaining payment state consistency while handling the inherently asynchronous nature of modern payment flows. When a customer initiates a payment, the system may need to redirect them to their bank for authentication, wait for external webhook confirmations, and handle various failure modes - all while ensuring the customer has a coherent experience and the merchant's accounting remains accurate.\n\n### Charge Processing Flow\n\nThe charge processing flow represents the core algorithm that transforms a payment intent into an actual charge against a customer's payment method. Think of this process like conducting an orchestra - multiple instruments (tokenization, provider APIs, authentication flows) must play their parts in precise coordination to create a harmonious payment experience.\n\n![Webhook Processing Pipeline](./diagrams/webhook-processing-flow.svg)\n\nThe flow begins when a payment intent transitions from the `created` status to active processing. At this point, the system has already validated the payment amount, currency, and idempotency constraints through the payment intent management layer. The processing engine's responsibility is to execute the actual charge while handling the various authentication and authorization steps required by modern payment regulations.\n\n> **Decision: Asynchronous Processing with State Persistence**\n> - **Context**: Payment processing involves multiple external API calls, potential redirects for authentication, and variable response times from payment providers\n> - **Options Considered**: Synchronous blocking processing, asynchronous with callbacks, event-driven state machine\n> - **Decision**: Asynchronous processing with persistent state tracking through database records\n> - **Rationale**: Payment flows can take minutes (3DS authentication) or hours (bank transfers) to complete, making synchronous processing unsuitable for web applications. State persistence ensures resilience against server restarts and provides audit trails for compliance.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables scalable payment processing and better user experience through non-blocking operations, but requires careful state management and introduces complexity in error handling and recovery scenarios.\n\nThe charge processing algorithm follows a predictable sequence of operations designed to maximize success rates while providing clear error reporting for failed transactions:\n\n| Processing Step | Purpose | Success Criteria | Failure Handling |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Payment Method Validation | Verify tokenized payment method is valid and not expired | Token exists in vault, not marked as expired | Return validation error to client |\n| Provider Selection | Choose appropriate payment provider based on currency, amount, risk factors | Provider supports currency and has sufficient capacity | Fallback to secondary provider or return error |\n| Charge Creation | Submit payment request to external provider with tokenized payment data | Provider returns charge ID and initial status | Log provider error, update charge record with failure details |\n| Authentication Check | Determine if Strong Customer Authentication (3DS) is required | Provider indicates no authentication needed or returns auth challenge | Handle authentication flow or return auth-required status |\n| Authorization Processing | Process the actual payment authorization against customer's account | Provider confirms funds are available and reserved | Update charge status to failed with provider error details |\n| Confirmation Handling | Finalize the charge based on provider response and any authentication results | Charge moves to succeeded status with authorization code | Implement retry logic for transient failures |\n\nThe processing engine maintains detailed charge records throughout this flow, creating an immutable audit trail of each processing attempt. This audit trail proves essential for debugging payment failures, handling disputes, and maintaining compliance with financial regulations that require transaction traceability.\n\n**Charge State Management**\n\nEach charge progresses through a well-defined state machine that reflects its current processing status. The `ChargeStatus` enumeration captures three fundamental states that external systems can reliably act upon:\n\n| Charge Status | Description | Terminal State | Next Possible States | Typical Duration |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `pending` | Charge submitted to provider, awaiting response | No | succeeded, failed | 1-30 seconds for cards, minutes for bank transfers |\n| `succeeded` | Payment successfully authorized and will settle | Yes | None (refunds create separate records) | N/A - final state |\n| `failed` | Payment authorization declined or encountered error | Yes | None (retry creates new charge record) | N/A - final state |\n\nThe charge record captures comprehensive metadata about the processing attempt, enabling detailed analysis of success rates, failure patterns, and provider performance:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description | Usage |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `id` | str | Unique identifier for this specific charge attempt | Primary key, used in refund references |\n| `payment_intent_id` | str | Foreign key to the originating payment intent | Links charge to customer intent and idempotency tracking |\n| `amount` | int | Charge amount in smallest currency unit (cents) | Must match or be less than payment intent amount |\n| `status` | ChargeStatus | Current processing state of the charge | Drives client polling and webhook processing logic |\n| `payment_method_token` | str | Tokenized reference to customer payment method | Used for provider API calls, never contains raw card data |\n| `failure_code` | str | Machine-readable error code from provider | Enables automated retry logic and error categorization |\n| `failure_message` | str | Human-readable error description | Displayed to customers and merchant support teams |\n| `network_transaction_id` | str | Provider's unique identifier for this transaction | Required for disputes, refunds, and provider support cases |\n| `authorization_code` | str | Bank authorization code for successful transactions | Proves payment was authorized by issuing bank |\n| `created_at` | datetime | When charge processing began | Used for timeout detection and performance metrics |\n| `settled_at` | datetime | When funds were actually transferred | Important for cash flow tracking and reconciliation |\n\n**Provider Integration Architecture**\n\nThe processing engine abstracts external payment providers through a standardized interface, enabling support for multiple providers without affecting core payment logic. This abstraction proves critical for merchant resilience, cost optimization, and regulatory compliance across different markets.\n\n> The key architectural insight is treating payment providers as interchangeable backends while maintaining consistent internal APIs. This approach mirrors how cloud applications abstract different storage providers - the application logic remains constant while the underlying implementation varies based on operational requirements.\n\n| Provider Interface Method | Parameters | Returns | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `create_charge` | payment_method_token, amount, currency, metadata | charge_id, status, auth_url | Initiates payment processing with provider |\n| `retrieve_charge` | provider_charge_id | charge_status, failure_details, settlement_info | Queries current charge state for reconciliation |\n| `confirm_payment` | provider_charge_id, confirmation_token | final_status, authorization_code | Completes 3DS authentication flow |\n| `cancel_charge` | provider_charge_id, cancellation_reason | cancellation_status, refunded_amount | Cancels pending charges before settlement |\n\nEach provider implementation handles the specific API requirements, authentication schemes, and response formats for their platform while presenting a consistent interface to the processing engine. This design enables A/B testing different providers, implementing failover strategies, and negotiating better rates through competitive provider relationships.\n\n**Error Classification and Recovery**\n\nPayment processing failures fall into distinct categories that require different handling strategies. The processing engine classifies errors to enable appropriate retry logic, customer communication, and operational alerting:\n\n| Error Category | Examples | Retry Strategy | Customer Impact | Operational Response |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Transient Provider Errors | Network timeouts, 503 responses, rate limits | Exponential backoff up to 3 attempts | Payment appears as \"processing\" | Monitor error rates, contact provider if sustained |\n| Permanent Validation Errors | Invalid card number, expired card, insufficient funds | No retry - immediate failure | Clear error message displayed | Update card validation logic if patterns emerge |\n| Authentication Required | 3DS challenge needed, strong authentication mandate | Redirect to authentication flow | Redirect to bank authentication page | Monitor authentication success rates |\n| Provider Configuration Issues | Invalid API credentials, unsupported currency | No retry - requires manual intervention | Generic error message | Immediate operational alert, provider configuration review |\n| Fraud Detection Triggers | Unusual spending pattern, high-risk merchant category | Provider-dependent - may require manual review | Payment held for review message | Review fraud rules, potentially whitelist customer |\n\nThe processing engine implements circuit breaker patterns for provider integrations, temporarily failing fast when provider error rates exceed acceptable thresholds. This prevents cascade failures and provides better user experience during provider outages:\n\n```\nCircuit Breaker States:\n1. Closed (normal operation): All requests sent to provider\n2. Open (failure mode): Requests immediately failed, provider not called  \n3. Half-Open (testing): Limited requests sent to test provider recovery\n```\n\n### 3D Secure Authentication\n\nStrong Customer Authentication through 3D Secure represents one of the most complex aspects of modern payment processing. Think of 3DS as a security checkpoint at an airport - while it adds friction to the payment process, it provides essential fraud protection and regulatory compliance that benefits all parties in the long term.\n\nThe 3D Secure protocol enables card issuers to authenticate their cardholders directly during online transactions, reducing fraud liability for merchants while complying with regulations like PSD2 in Europe. However, implementing 3DS requires careful orchestration of redirects, state management, and fallback scenarios to maintain a acceptable user experience.\n\n![3D Secure Authentication Flow](./diagrams/3ds-flow-sequence.svg)\n\nThe authentication flow involves four primary parties: the customer, merchant (our payment gateway), payment provider, and issuing bank. Each party has specific responsibilities and timing requirements that must be carefully coordinated to prevent authentication failures or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**3DS Flow Orchestration**\n\nThe 3D Secure authentication process follows a well-established sequence that balances security requirements with user experience considerations. The processing engine must handle this flow while maintaining payment state consistency and providing clear status updates to the merchant application:\n\n1. **Authentication Assessment**: When creating a charge, the payment provider analyzes transaction risk factors (amount, merchant category, customer history, issuer requirements) to determine if 3DS authentication is mandatory, recommended, or unnecessary.\n\n2. **Challenge Preparation**: If authentication is required, the provider generates a unique authentication session and returns a secure authentication URL along with session parameters that identify this specific payment attempt.\n\n3. **Customer Redirect**: The merchant application redirects the customer to the authentication URL, typically in a popup window or iframe to maintain context of the original purchase flow.\n\n4. **Issuer Authentication**: The customer's bank presents their authentication interface (SMS codes, mobile app push notifications, biometric verification) and validates the customer's identity according to their internal policies.\n\n5. **Authentication Response**: Upon completing authentication, the issuer redirects the customer back to a merchant-provided return URL with authentication results embedded as URL parameters.\n\n6. **Payment Confirmation**: The merchant backend extracts authentication results and calls the provider's confirmation endpoint to complete the original payment using the authentication proof.\n\n7. **Final Settlement**: With authentication confirmed, the provider processes the payment authorization and returns final charge status to complete the payment flow.\n\nThe processing engine tracks this multi-step flow through careful state management and timeout handling. Each step has specific failure modes and recovery procedures that must be implemented to provide reliable payment processing.\n\n**3DS State Management**\n\nDuring 3D Secure authentication, payment intents transition through specialized states that reflect the current stage of the authentication process. This state tracking enables proper customer communication and prevents duplicate authentication attempts:\n\n| Payment Intent Status | 3DS Context | Customer Experience | System Behavior |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `created` | Initial state before processing | Payment form submitted, waiting for response | System preparing to submit charge to provider |\n| `requires_action` | 3DS authentication challenge issued | Redirected to bank authentication page | Waiting for customer to complete authentication |\n| `processing` | Authentication completed, finalizing payment | \"Please wait\" message while payment completes | Confirming payment with authentication proof |\n| `succeeded` | Payment authorized and authenticated | Success page displayed | Payment complete, funds will settle |\n| `canceled` | Authentication failed or timed out | Error message with retry option | Payment attempt recorded as failed |\n\nThe `requires_action` status proves particularly important for merchant integrations, as it indicates the payment flow requires customer interaction rather than backend processing. Merchant applications must handle this status by presenting the authentication interface rather than polling for completion.\n\n**Authentication Challenge Handling**\n\nModern 3D Secure implementations support multiple authentication methods depending on the customer's bank and device capabilities. The processing engine must handle these variations while providing consistent merchant APIs:\n\n| Authentication Method | User Experience | Technical Implementation | Fallback Strategy |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Frictionless | No customer interaction, authentication happens behind scenes | Provider returns immediate success/failure | None needed - standard processing continues |\n| SMS Challenge | Customer enters code sent to registered phone number | Redirect to issuer page with SMS input form | Allow multiple SMS requests with rate limiting |\n| Mobile App Push | Customer approves transaction in banking mobile app | Redirect shows \"Check your mobile app\" message | Timeout after 5 minutes, offer SMS alternative |\n| Browser Redirect | Full redirect to issuer website for complex authentication | Customer leaves merchant site temporarily | Return URL must restore shopping context |\n| Biometric | Fingerprint or face recognition through mobile browser APIs | WebAuthn API integration with device capabilities | Fallback to traditional authentication methods |\n\nThe processing engine stores authentication context in the charge record to enable proper handling of return flows and timeout scenarios. This context includes the authentication method attempted, timestamps for timeout calculation, and return URL parameters for session restoration.\n\n**Return URL Management**\n\n3D Secure authentication requires merchants to provide return URLs where customers are redirected after completing authentication. The processing engine must generate unique, secure return URLs that restore payment context and prevent authentication replay attacks:\n\n| Return URL Component | Purpose | Security Consideration | Example Value |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Base Domain | Merchant's verified domain for customer return | Must match merchant registration to prevent phishing | `https://shop.example.com` |\n| Return Endpoint | Specific handler for 3DS authentication results | Should be dedicated endpoint, not general payment handler | `/payments/3ds-return` |\n| Session Token | Unique identifier linking return to original payment | Must be cryptographically secure and single-use | `3ds_sess_1a2b3c4d5e6f` |\n| Payment Intent ID | Identifies which payment this authentication completes | Allows state restoration and duplicate detection | `pi_1234567890abcdef` |\n| Timestamp | When authentication session was created | Enables timeout enforcement and replay prevention | `1703123456` |\n| Signature | HMAC proving URL authenticity and preventing tampering | Computed from all other parameters using secret key | `hmac_sha256_abc123def456` |\n\nThe return URL handler must validate all components, check authentication session expiry, and extract authentication results from provider-supplied parameters. Failed validations should be treated as potential security attacks and logged for investigation.\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: Return URLs represent a potential attack vector where malicious actors might attempt to bypass authentication by crafting fake return requests. Always validate HMAC signatures and check authentication session state before completing payments.\n\n### Payment Method Tokenization\n\nPayment method tokenization transforms sensitive card details into secure, opaque tokens that can be safely stored and transmitted without PCI DSS compliance burden. Think of tokenization like a coat check system at a restaurant - customers surrender their valuable items (card details) in exchange for a numbered ticket (token) that can later be used to retrieve the original item when needed.\n\nThe tokenization process removes raw payment card data from our systems while maintaining the ability to process payments, refunds, and recurring charges. This approach dramatically reduces security scope, compliance costs, and the potential impact of data breaches while enabling full payment functionality.\n\n> **Decision: Provider-Managed Tokenization vs Self-Managed Vault**\n> - **Context**: Payment card data requires strict security controls and PCI DSS compliance that significantly increases operational complexity and cost\n> - **Options Considered**: Self-managed encryption vault, third-party tokenization service, provider-managed tokenization\n> - **Decision**: Provider-managed tokenization using payment processor's secure vault services\n> - **Rationale**: Eliminates PCI DSS scope for card storage, reduces security infrastructure requirements, leverages provider's specialized security expertise and compliance certifications\n> - **Consequences**: Enables rapid development with reduced compliance burden and security risk, but creates dependency on provider tokenization APIs and limits ability to switch providers easily\n\n**Tokenization Architecture**\n\nThe payment processing engine integrates tokenization at multiple points in the payment flow, ensuring sensitive data never persists in application databases or appears in application logs. This integration requires careful API design to maintain security boundaries while providing intuitive developer experiences.\n\n| Tokenization Stage | Input Data | Security Boundary | Output Token | Usage Context |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Card Collection | Raw card number, expiry, CVV from customer | Client-side form submission over TLS | Single-use collection token | Temporary token for immediate payment processing |\n| Payment Method Storage | Collection token + customer billing details | Server-to-provider API call | Reusable payment method token | Stored for future payments and subscription billing |\n| Charge Processing | Payment method token + charge details | Internal API with token reference | Provider charge ID | Links token to specific charge attempt |\n| Refund Processing | Original charge ID and refund amount | Provider refund API using charge reference | Refund transaction ID | Enables partial refunds without re-exposing card data |\n\nThe tokenization architecture maintains a clear separation between temporary collection tokens (valid for minutes) and persistent payment method tokens (valid for years). This separation enables different security policies and lifecycle management for each token type.\n\n**Secure Token Collection**\n\nModern tokenization implementations collect card details directly from customer browsers to payment provider systems, ensuring sensitive data never reaches merchant servers. This approach requires careful integration of client-side JavaScript libraries with backend payment processing logic:\n\nThe collection process begins when customers enter card details in the merchant's payment form. Instead of submitting this data to the merchant server, client-side JavaScript intercepts the form submission and securely transmits card details directly to the payment provider's tokenization endpoint over encrypted connections.\n\n| Collection Step | Client-Side Action | Server-Side Response | Security Measure |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Form Initialization | Load provider JavaScript library with merchant API keys | Verify merchant domain against provider whitelist | API keys scoped to domain, no secret credentials in browser |\n| Card Data Entry | Customer types card details in merchant-styled form fields | No server involvement - data stays in browser | Form fields replaced with provider-controlled secure inputs |\n| Tokenization Request | JavaScript sends card data directly to provider tokenization API | Provider validates card format and returns collection token | Card data transmitted over TLS to provider, not merchant |\n| Token Submission | Form submits collection token (not card data) to merchant server | Merchant server receives token for payment processing | Merchant never sees raw card data, only secure token reference |\n\nThis architecture ensures that card details flow directly from customer browsers to payment provider systems without ever existing in merchant application memory, databases, or log files. The merchant application only handles opaque tokens that cannot be used to reconstruct original card data.\n\n**Token Storage and Lifecycle**\n\nPayment method tokens require careful lifecycle management to balance security, usability, and regulatory compliance. The processing engine implements token storage patterns that support various merchant use cases while maintaining strict security controls:\n\n| Storage Pattern | Use Case | Token Validity | Security Controls | Compliance Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Session Tokens | Single checkout process | 30 minutes | Automatic expiry, single-use validation | No PCI scope - tokens expire quickly |\n| Customer Tokens | Saved payment methods for registered users | 1-2 years or until card expiry | Customer authentication required for token usage | Minimal PCI scope - no cardholder data stored |\n| Subscription Tokens | Recurring billing for ongoing services | Until customer cancellation or card expiry | Additional fraud monitoring, velocity limits | Enhanced monitoring required for unattended payments |\n| Merchant Tokens | Customer service operations and refunds | Tied to original transaction lifecycle | Role-based access controls, audit logging | Administrative access controls and compliance reporting |\n\nThe token storage system maintains metadata about each tokenized payment method without storing sensitive card details. This metadata enables risk analysis, duplicate detection, and customer experience optimization while preserving security boundaries.\n\n| Token Metadata Field | Purpose | Example Value | Security Classification |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `token_id` | Unique identifier for this specific token | `pm_1a2b3c4d5e6f` | Non-sensitive identifier |\n| `customer_id` | Links token to specific customer account | `cust_789xyz` | Customer reference (PII considerations) |\n| `last_four_digits` | Display purposes and duplicate detection | `4242` | Non-sensitive for display purposes |\n| `card_brand` | Payment processing and fraud analysis | `visa` | Non-sensitive routing information |\n| `expiry_month` | Token validity and renewal prompting | `12` | Semi-sensitive - used for token lifecycle |\n| `expiry_year` | Token validity and renewal prompting | `2025` | Semi-sensitive - used for token lifecycle |\n| `fingerprint` | Duplicate payment method detection | `fp_abc123def456` | Non-sensitive hash for deduplication |\n| `created_at` | Audit trail and lifecycle management | `2023-12-01T10:00:00Z` | Non-sensitive timestamp |\n| `last_used_at` | Security monitoring and cleanup | `2023-12-15T14:30:00Z` | Non-sensitive usage tracking |\n\n**Token Security Controls**\n\nPayment method tokens, while safer than raw card data, still require robust security controls to prevent unauthorized usage and maintain customer trust. The processing engine implements multiple layers of token protection:\n\nAuthentication controls ensure only authorized parties can use payment method tokens. Customer tokens require customer authentication, while merchant tokens require staff authentication with appropriate role-based permissions. These controls prevent token theft from resulting in unauthorized charges.\n\nAuthorization controls validate each token usage against business rules and risk factors. Unusual spending patterns, geographic inconsistencies, or velocity violations trigger additional verification steps before processing payments. These controls provide defense-in-depth protection against token abuse.\n\n| Security Control | Implementation | Protection Against | Performance Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Customer Authentication | JWT tokens or session validation | Unauthorized customer token usage | Minimal - cached authentication state |\n| Role-Based Access | Permission matrix for staff operations | Internal fraud and unauthorized refunds | Low - permission check per request |\n| Fraud Scoring | Machine learning risk analysis | Stolen token usage and synthetic fraud | Medium - ML inference per transaction |\n| Velocity Limits | Rate limiting based on token usage patterns | Automated attacks and bulk fraud | Low - counter increment per usage |\n| Geographic Controls | IP geolocation vs billing address comparison | Cross-border fraud patterns | Low - geolocation lookup per request |\n| Device Fingerprinting | Browser/device characteristics tracking | Account takeover and device spoofing | Medium - fingerprint generation and comparison |\n\nThe token security system logs all usage attempts, successful authentications, and security violations to provide comprehensive audit trails for compliance reporting and fraud investigation.\n\n**Common Pitfalls**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Storing Collection Tokens Long-Term**\nMany implementations mistakenly treat collection tokens as permanent payment method references and attempt to store them for future use. Collection tokens are designed for immediate usage and typically expire within 30 minutes of creation. Attempting to use expired collection tokens results in cryptic error messages and payment failures. Always convert collection tokens to payment method tokens for storage, or implement proper token refresh logic with clear expiry handling.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mixing Test and Production Tokens**\nToken formats appear identical between test and production environments, making it easy to accidentally submit test tokens to production payment endpoints or vice versa. This mistake causes confusing authorization failures that appear as customer card problems. Always validate token prefixes against expected environment indicators, maintain separate database schemas for test vs production tokens, and implement environment consistency checks in API request validation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Token Metadata Validation**\nRelying solely on tokenization for security while ignoring token metadata validation creates vulnerabilities around duplicate payment methods and customer identity verification. Attackers may create multiple tokens for the same card or use valid tokens with incorrect customer associations. Always validate token fingerprints against existing customer payment methods, verify customer ownership before allowing token usage, and implement duplicate token detection based on card fingerprints rather than token IDs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Token Cleanup**\nUnused payment method tokens accumulate over time, creating security liability and potential compliance issues during audits. Expired tokens, tokens from deleted customer accounts, and tokens that haven't been used for extended periods should be systematically purged. Implement automated token cleanup jobs that respect retention requirements, provide customer notification before removing saved payment methods, and maintain audit logs of token deletion activities for compliance purposes.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe payment processing engine requires careful integration of external provider APIs, secure token handling, and complex state management for 3D Secure authentication flows.

Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the payment processing engine, verify the following functionality:\n\n**Test Commands:**\n```bash\n# Run core processing engine tests\npython -m pytest tests/test_processing_engine.py -v\n\n# Test 3D Secure flow with mock provider\npython -m pytest tests/test_three_ds_flow.py::test_authentication_redirect -v\n\n# Integration test with test provider credentials\npython -m pytest tests/test_provider_integration.py --integration\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n1. **Charge Creation**: Submit a payment intent for processing and verify charge record is created with `pending` status\n2. **3DS Challenge**: For test cards requiring authentication, verify payment intent transitions to `requires_action` with valid authentication URL\n3. **Authentication Return**: Process 3DS return parameters and verify charge transitions to `succeeded` status\n4. **Token Validation**: Attempt to use invalid or expired tokens and verify appropriate error responses\n5. **Circuit Breaker**: Simulate provider failures and verify circuit breaker opens after threshold failures\n\n**Manual Verification:**\n- Start the payment server and create a payment intent through the API\n- Submit a charge using test card `4000000000003220` (requires 3DS) and verify redirect URL is returned\n- Complete authentication in test environment and verify return URL processes correctly\n- Check database records show proper state transitions and provider response data\n- Verify failed payments update charge records with appropriate error codes and messages\n\n**Signs of Problems:**\n- Charges stuck in `pending` status indicate provider communication issues\n- Missing authentication URLs suggest 3DS integration problems\n- Database constraint violations indicate improper transaction handling\n- Signature validation failures on return URLs suggest HMAC implementation issues\n\n\n## Refunds and Dispute Management\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3: Refunds & Disputes - implementing refund processing, partial refunds, and dispute handling with proper state tracking and chargeback workflows.\n\nThink of refunds and disputes as the \"undo\" and \"investigation\" mechanisms of the payment world. When you return an item to a store, the clerk processes a refund by reversing part or all of your original transaction - this happens through the same card network that processed your payment, but in reverse. Disputes are like filing a complaint with your credit card company when something goes wrong - the card issuer investigates and may force the merchant to return your money, often before the merchant even knows there's a problem. Our system needs to handle both scenarios gracefully while maintaining accurate accounting records.\n\nThe complexity comes from the asynchronous nature of these operations. Unlike the immediate feedback you get when making a purchase, refunds can take days to appear on a customer's statement, and disputes can take weeks or months to resolve. Meanwhile, money moves through multiple parties - your business, the payment processor, the card networks, and various banks - each maintaining their own records that must eventually reconcile.\n\n### Refund Processing Logic\n\n**Refunds represent the reversal of value transfer from a completed charge.** Unlike voiding a transaction (which cancels it before settlement), refunds actually move money backward through the payment network. This fundamental difference affects timing, fees, and the customer experience.\n\nThe refund state machine mirrors the charge lifecycle but with important distinctions. Refunds begin in a `pending` status while the payment processor validates the request and initiates the reversal. They transition to `succeeded` when the processor confirms the refund will be sent to the customer's account, or `failed` if validation fails or the refund is rejected. The time between initiation and customer visibility varies significantly - typically 3-10 business days for card refunds.\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------|------------|---------------|\n| `pending` | `processor_confirms` | `succeeded` | Update network transaction ID, set processed_at timestamp |\n| `pending` | `processor_rejects` | `failed` | Record failure code and message, alert operations team |\n| `succeeded` | *none* | *terminal* | No further state changes allowed |\n| `failed` | *none* | *terminal* | No further state changes allowed |\n\n**Partial refunds introduce additional validation complexity.** The system must track the cumulative refunded amount against the original charge to prevent over-refunding. This requires maintaining a running total of successful refunds and comparing it against the original charge amount before approving new refund requests.\n\n> **Decision: Refund Amount Validation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Partial refunds require preventing over-refunding while allowing multiple small refunds against a single charge\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Pre-calculate remaining refundable amount and store it\n>   - Calculate refundable amount dynamically by summing existing refunds\n>   - Rely on payment processor to validate refund amounts\n> - **Decision**: Calculate refundable amount dynamically by summing existing refunds\n> - **Rationale**: Avoids data synchronization issues and provides authoritative validation using the database as single source of truth\n> - **Consequences**: Requires database query on each refund but ensures accuracy and simplifies concurrent refund handling\n\nThe refund validation algorithm follows these steps:\n\n1. **Load the original charge** using the provided charge ID and verify it exists in `succeeded` status\n2. **Query all existing refunds** for this charge that have `succeeded` status\n3. **Calculate the total refunded amount** by summing the amounts from all successful refunds\n4. **Determine the remaining refundable amount** by subtracting total refunded from original charge amount\n5. **Validate the requested refund amount** is positive and does not exceed the remaining refundable amount\n6. **Check charge age constraints** - most processors limit refunds to charges made within 180 days\n7. **Verify charge settlement status** - some processors require charges to be fully settled before allowing refunds\n\n| Refund Field | Type | Description |\n|--------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `str` | Unique refund identifier generated by our system |\n| `charge_id` | `str` | Foreign key reference to the original charge being refunded |\n| `amount` | `int` | Refund amount in smallest currency unit (cents) |\n| `status` | `RefundStatus` | Current refund state: pending, succeeded, failed |\n| `reason` | `str` | Merchant-provided reason for the refund (fraud, return, duplicate, etc.) |\n| `network_transaction_id` | `str` | Payment processor's refund transaction identifier |\n| `failure_code` | `str` | Processor-specific error code if refund failed |\n| `failure_message` | `str` | Human-readable failure description |\n| `created_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when refund was initiated |\n| `processed_at` | `datetime` | Timestamp when processor confirmed refund completion |\n\n**Refund reasons serve both operational and compliance purposes.** Common reason codes include \"duplicate\" for accidentally charged transactions, \"fraudulent\" for confirmed fraud cases, \"requested_by_customer\" for returns and cancellations, and \"expired_uncaptured_charge\" for authorization reversals. These reasons help with reconciliation, dispute prevention, and regulatory reporting.\n\nThe interaction between refunds and the original payment method adds complexity. Card refunds must go back to the original card - you cannot refund a Visa charge to a Mastercard or to a bank account. If the original card has been closed or replaced, the refund may fail, requiring alternative resolution methods like check payments or store credit.\n\n> **Critical Insight: Refund Idempotency**\n> Refund requests must be idempotent to prevent duplicate refunds from UI retries or API client errors. Include an idempotency key parameter in refund creation requests and store it alongside the refund record to detect duplicates.\n\n![Refund and Dispute State Machines](./diagrams/refund-dispute-states.svg)\n\n### Dispute and Chargeback Workflow\n\n**Disputes represent forced payment reversals initiated by the customer's bank rather than the merchant.** Think of this as the difference between voluntarily returning an item versus filing a complaint with customer service that forces a refund. The merchant has limited control over the process and faces strict deadlines for response.\n\nThe dispute lifecycle begins when a cardholder contacts their bank claiming a problem with a transaction. The bank may issue a chargeback immediately (taking money from the merchant account) or send a warning that gives the merchant a chance to resolve the issue first. This early warning system, sometimes called \"pre-arbitration,\" allows merchants to voluntarily refund disputed transactions before facing forced chargebacks.\n\n| Dispute Status | Description | Merchant Action Required | Timeline |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|\n| `warning_needs_response` | Bank inquiry before formal chargeback | Respond with refund or evidence | 7-10 days |\n| `under_review` | Formal chargeback filed, evidence submitted | Wait for network decision | 30-75 days |\n| `charge_refunded` | Merchant voluntarily refunded during warning | None | Terminal |\n| `won` | Evidence accepted, funds returned to merchant | None | Terminal |\n| `lost` | Evidence rejected, chargeback upheld | Accept loss or appeal | May appeal |\n\n**Chargeback reason codes determine the appropriate response strategy.** Fraud-related chargebacks (reason code 10.4 for Visa) require different evidence than authorization disputes (code 11.1) or processing errors (code 12.1). Understanding these codes allows automated evidence collection and response routing.\n\nCommon reason categories include:\n- **Fraud**: Customer claims they didn't make the transaction\n- **Authorization**: Transaction processed without proper authorization\n- **Processing Errors**: Duplicate processing, wrong amount, or currency issues  \n- **Consumer Disputes**: Product not received, defective, or not as described\n\n> **Decision: Automated vs Manual Dispute Response**\n> - **Context**: Disputes require evidence submission within tight deadlines but manual review ensures quality\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Fully automated evidence submission based on reason codes\n>   - Manual review for all disputes with staff assignment\n>   - Hybrid approach with automation for simple cases, manual for complex\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with automation for fraud and authorization disputes, manual review for consumer disputes\n> - **Rationale**: Fraud disputes have standardized evidence requirements while consumer disputes need contextual judgment about product/service delivery\n> - **Consequences**: Reduces response time for high-volume fraud disputes while maintaining quality for complex cases\n\nThe evidence collection system must gather relevant data based on the dispute type. For fraud disputes, this includes customer authentication records, device fingerprinting data, shipping confirmations, and previous successful transactions. For authorization disputes, the focus shifts to AVS (Address Verification Service) responses, CVV matches, and authorization codes.\n\n| Evidence Type | Fraud Disputes | Authorization Disputes | Consumer Disputes |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Customer authentication | Required | Optional | Optional |\n| Shipping/delivery proof | Required | Not applicable | Required |\n| Product description | Optional | Not applicable | Required |\n| Customer communication | Optional | Optional | Required |\n| Authorization codes | Optional | Required | Optional |\n| Device fingerprint | Required | Optional | Not applicable |\n\n**Dispute fees apply regardless of outcome.** Most payment processors charge $15-25 per dispute even if the merchant ultimately wins. This creates a strong incentive for dispute prevention through clear billing descriptors, proactive customer service, and fraud prevention systems.\n\nThe automated evidence submission system follows this workflow:\n\n1. **Receive dispute notification** via webhook from payment processor\n2. **Parse reason code and dispute details** to determine evidence requirements\n3. **Query relevant data sources** including order systems, shipping providers, and authentication logs\n4. **Compile evidence package** according to card network specifications\n5. **Submit evidence** through payment processor API before deadline\n6. **Update dispute status** and schedule follow-up for network decision\n7. **Handle dispute resolution** by updating accounting records and notifying relevant systems\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Evidence Deadlines**\nDispute evidence deadlines are strictly enforced - missing a deadline by even minutes results in automatic loss. Implement alert systems that notify operations teams 48-72 hours before deadlines and automate evidence submission for standard cases. Never rely on manual processes for time-critical compliance requirements.\n\n### Payment Accounting Ledger\n\n**Payment accounting requires double-entry bookkeeping to maintain accurate records across refunds, disputes, and fees.** Think of this as maintaining a detailed bank register that tracks every penny moving in and out of your business, with each transaction affecting multiple accounts simultaneously.\n\nTraditional payment systems often use simple status fields and running balances, but this approach breaks down with complex scenarios like partial refunds, dispute fees, and chargeback reversals. A proper ledger system records each financial event as journal entries affecting multiple accounts, providing an audit trail and ensuring mathematical consistency.\n\nThe core insight is that every financial event affects at least two accounts. When processing a $100 payment, we debit \"Customer Payments Receivable\" for $100 and credit \"Sales Revenue\" for $100. When refunding $30 of that payment, we debit \"Refunds Expense\" for $30 and credit \"Customer Refunds Payable\" for $30. This dual-entry approach makes discrepancies immediately visible and supports complex reconciliation scenarios.\n\n| Account Type | Account Name | Debit Increases | Credit Increases | Example Transactions |\n|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Asset | Customer Payments Receivable | Yes | No | Original payment processing |\n| Liability | Customer Refunds Payable | No | Yes | Refund obligations to customers |\n| Expense | Processing Fees | Yes | No | Payment processor fees |\n| Expense | Dispute Fees | Yes | No | Chargeback and dispute fees |\n| Expense | Refunds Expense | Yes | No | Customer refunds processed |\n| Revenue | Sales Revenue | No | Yes | Completed customer purchases |\n\n**Journal entries capture the complete financial impact of each payment event.** A simple payment involves multiple fees and timing considerations that must be recorded accurately. Consider a $100 payment with a $2.90 processing fee:\n\nPayment Processing Entry:\n- Debit Customer Payments Receivable: $100.00\n- Credit Sales Revenue: $100.00\n- Debit Processing Fees: $2.90\n- Credit Processing Fees Payable: $2.90\n\nLater, when issuing a $30 refund with a $0.50 refund fee:\n\nRefund Processing Entry:\n- Debit Refunds Expense: $30.00\n- Credit Customer Refunds Payable: $30.00\n- Debit Refund Fees: $0.50\n- Credit Refund Fees Payable: $0.50\n\n**Dispute accounting creates additional complexity because chargebacks represent involuntary fund movements.** When a dispute is filed, the payment processor immediately debits the chargeback amount from the merchant account, creating a negative balance that must be tracked separately from voluntary refunds.\n\nChargeback Journal Entry:\n- Debit Chargebacks Expense: $100.00\n- Credit Chargebacks Payable: $100.00\n- Debit Dispute Fees: $15.00\n- Credit Dispute Fees Payable: $15.00\n\nIf the merchant wins the dispute, the chargeback reverses:\n\nChargeback Reversal Entry:\n- Debit Chargebacks Receivable: $100.00\n- Credit Chargebacks Expense: $100.00\n\n> **Decision: Ledger Entry Timing Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Journal entries must be recorded when financial events occur, but payment events are asynchronous\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Record entries when initiating actions (payment requests, refund requests)\n>   - Record entries when receiving confirmations (webhooks, API responses)\n>   - Record provisional entries immediately, then confirm or reverse based on outcomes\n> - **Decision**: Record provisional entries immediately, then confirm or reverse based on outcomes\n> - **Rationale**: Provides immediate financial visibility for operational decisions while maintaining accuracy through reconciliation\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more complex ledger logic but gives real-time financial position and audit trail\n\nThe reconciliation process ensures ledger accuracy by comparing internal records against payment processor settlements. Payment processors provide daily settlement reports showing actual fund movements, which must match the sum of confirmed ledger entries.\n\n| Reconciliation Field | Internal Calculation | External Source | Variance Threshold |\n|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Gross Sales | Sum of confirmed sales revenue entries | Processor gross sales | $0.01 |\n| Total Refunds | Sum of confirmed refund expense entries | Processor total refunds | $0.01 |\n| Processing Fees | Sum of confirmed fee entries | Processor fee report | $0.05 |\n| Net Settlement | Gross - Refunds - Fees | Processor net deposit | $0.10 |\n\n**Settlement timing differences require careful handling.** Payment processors typically settle funds 1-2 business days after transaction processing, but the exact timing varies by transaction type, risk assessment, and processor policies. The ledger must track these timing differences to provide accurate cash flow projections.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Currency Precision Errors**\nStore all monetary amounts as integers in the smallest currency unit (cents for USD) to avoid floating-point precision errors. A $10.00 payment is stored as 1000 cents. This is critical for ledger accuracy - even one-cent discrepancies multiply across thousands of transactions and cause reconciliation failures.\n\nThe ledger query interface provides standard reports for business operations:\n\n| Report Type | Query Logic | Use Case |\n|-------------|-------------|----------|\n| Daily Sales | Sum confirmed sales entries by date | Revenue reporting |\n| Refund Analysis | Sum refunds by reason and date range | Return pattern analysis |\n| Dispute Impact | Sum dispute fees and chargebacks | Loss prevention metrics |\n| Settlement Forecast | Sum pending entries by expected settlement date | Cash flow planning |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Instead of constantly calling the provider asking \"has anything changed?\" (polling), the provider calls you immediately when something important happens to a payment. Think of it as the difference between repeatedly asking a friend \"are you there yet?\" during a road trip versus having them text you when they arrive. Webhooks eliminate the delay and uncertainty of polling while ensuring your system stays synchronized with the provider's authoritative payment state.\n\nHowever, this convenience comes with significant challenges. Unlike API calls that you initiate and control, webhooks arrive asynchronously from external systems over the public internet. This creates a fundamental trust problem: how do you know a webhook claiming to be from your payment provider actually came from them and wasn't forged by an attacker? Additionally, network reliability issues mean webhooks can be delivered multiple times, arrive out of order, or fail to arrive at all. Your system must handle these realities while maintaining accurate payment state.\n\nThe webhook processing architecture addresses three critical concerns: **authenticity** (is this webhook genuine?), **idempotency** (can we safely process it multiple times?), and **completeness** (did we miss any events?). This section explores how to build a robust webhook processing pipeline that maintains payment state consistency even under adverse network conditions and potential security threats.\n\n### Webhook Security and Verification\n\n**Webhook signatures** serve as cryptographic proof that an incoming webhook payload was generated by your payment provider and has not been tampered with during transmission. Think of webhook signatures like the wax seal on official letters from medieval times - they provide both authentication (this came from the claimed sender) and integrity verification (the contents haven't been altered). Without signature verification, your webhook endpoint becomes a vulnerability that attackers can exploit to manipulate your payment state.\n\nThe signature verification process relies on **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)** cryptography. When your payment provider sends a webhook, they combine the webhook payload with a secret key (that only you and they know) and generate a cryptographic hash. This hash is included in the webhook headers. Your system performs the same calculation using the received payload and your copy of the secret key. If the hashes match, you can be confident the webhook is authentic and unmodified.\n\n> **Decision: HMAC-SHA256 for Webhook Signature Verification**\n> - **Context**: Need to verify webhook authenticity and prevent spoofed payment notifications that could manipulate transaction state\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. No signature verification (trust all incoming webhooks)\n>   2. HMAC-SHA256 with timestamp validation  \n>   3. RSA digital signatures with certificate validation\n> - **Decision**: HMAC-SHA256 with timestamp validation\n> - **Rationale**: Provides strong cryptographic verification while remaining simple to implement. HMAC-SHA256 is the industry standard for webhook signatures (used by Stripe, PayPal, etc.). RSA signatures add complexity without meaningful security benefits for this use case. No verification is completely unacceptable for payment systems.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires secure webhook secret management and proper timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks. Enables confident processing of webhook events knowing they're authentic.\n\nThe webhook signature verification process follows a precise algorithm that must be implemented exactly as specified by your payment provider. Most providers include the signature in a header like `Stripe-Signature` or `X-Webhook-Signature`. The header typically contains multiple components: the timestamp when the webhook was sent, and one or more signature values computed using different versions of the signing algorithm.\n\n| Signature Component | Purpose | Example Value |\n|-------------------|---------|---------------|\n| Timestamp | Prevents replay attacks by limiting webhook validity window | `t=1634567890` |\n| Primary Signature | HMAC-SHA256 hash of timestamp + payload using current secret | `v1=3f5b8a7c9d...` |\n| Fallback Signature | Hash using previous secret during key rotation periods | `v0=7a9c3d5f8b...` |\n\nThe signature verification algorithm proceeds through several critical steps that must be executed in the correct order. First, your system extracts the timestamp and signature components from the webhook headers. The timestamp serves dual purposes: it's part of the signed payload (preventing timestamp manipulation) and enables replay attack protection by rejecting webhooks older than a configured threshold (typically 5-10 minutes).\n\nNext, your system reconstructs the signed payload exactly as the provider created it. This typically involves concatenating the timestamp, a delimiter character (usually a period), and the raw webhook payload body. It's crucial to use the raw, unmodified payload bytes - any JSON parsing, whitespace normalization, or character encoding changes will cause signature verification to fail.\n\nYour system then computes the HMAC-SHA256 hash of this reconstructed payload using your webhook secret. The resulting hash must be compared with the signature from the webhook headers using a timing-safe comparison function to prevent timing attacks. Standard string equality comparison can leak information about partial matches through execution time variations.\n\n> **Critical Security Insight**: Never use standard string comparison (`==`) for signature verification. Use a constant-time comparison function that always takes the same amount of time regardless of how many characters match. This prevents timing attacks where attackers could gradually deduce valid signatures by measuring response times.\n\n**Timestamp validation** prevents replay attacks where an attacker captures a legitimate webhook and resends it later to trigger duplicate processing. Your system should reject webhooks with timestamps older than your configured tolerance window. However, be cautious about making this window too narrow - legitimate webhooks can be delayed by network issues, provider retries, or load balancer queuing.\n\n| Validation Check | Acceptance Criteria | Rejection Response |\n|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Timestamp Age | Within last 10 minutes | 400 Bad Request with \"Webhook too old\" |\n| Signature Format | Valid header format with t= and v1= components | 400 Bad Request with \"Invalid signature format\" |\n| Signature Match | HMAC matches computed value | 401 Unauthorized with \"Invalid signature\" |\n| Payload Size | Within reasonable limits (typically 1MB) | 413 Payload Too Large |\n\nThe webhook secret itself requires careful management. It should be stored securely (environment variables, secrets management systems) and never logged or included in error messages. Payment providers typically allow webhook secret rotation, which requires your system to support multiple secrets during transition periods. During rotation, providers may include signatures computed with both old and new secrets, allowing your system to verify using either one.\n\n**Rate limiting and IP allowlisting** provide additional security layers. Payment providers typically send webhooks from specific IP address ranges that you can allowlist. However, these ranges can change, so IP allowlisting should supplement, not replace, signature verification. Rate limiting prevents abuse if your webhook endpoint is discovered by attackers, but be careful not to block legitimate webhook bursts during high-volume periods.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Signature Verification Bypass in Development**\nMany developers disable signature verification in development environments for convenience, then accidentally deploy this configuration to production. This creates a critical security vulnerability where attackers can manipulate payment state by sending fake webhooks. Always enforce signature verification in all environments - use test webhook secrets in development, never skip verification entirely.\n\n### Event Processing Pipeline\n\nThe **event processing pipeline** transforms incoming webhook notifications into reliable updates to your payment system's state. Think of this pipeline like a factory assembly line for processing mail - incoming packages (webhooks) must be inspected for authenticity, sorted by type, checked for duplicates, processed according to their contents, and tracked to ensure nothing gets lost. Each stage has specific responsibilities and failure modes that must be handled gracefully.\n\nThe pipeline operates on a fundamental principle: **at-least-once delivery semantics**. Payment providers will retry failed webhook deliveries, potentially multiple times over several hours or days. This means your system will likely receive duplicate webhooks for the same event. Rather than trying to prevent duplicates (which is impossible to guarantee), your system must be **idempotent** - processing the same webhook multiple times should produce the same final state as processing it once.\n\n> **Decision: Database-First Webhook Processing with Explicit Deduplication**\n> - **Context**: Need to handle duplicate webhook deliveries reliably while ensuring payment state updates are never lost or applied incorrectly\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. In-memory deduplication with immediate event processing\n>   2. Database-first with explicit deduplication table\n>   3. Message queue with exactly-once delivery guarantees\n> - **Decision**: Database-first with explicit deduplication table\n> - **Rationale**: Provides durability guarantees by persisting webhooks before processing. Database transactions ensure atomic deduplication and state updates. Message queues add complexity and external dependencies without solving the core idempotency challenge.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful transaction management and proper indexing for webhook deduplication. Enables reliable processing with clear audit trails of all webhook events.\n\nThe webhook processing flow begins with **webhook receipt and persistence**. When a webhook arrives at your endpoint, the first action is to persist it to your database with a unique identifier, timestamp, and processing status. This creates a permanent audit trail and ensures no webhook can be lost due to process crashes or network failures. The webhook record captures all essential metadata needed for processing and debugging.\n\n| WebhookEvent Field | Purpose | Example Value |\n|-------------------|---------|---------------|\n| `id` | Unique webhook identifier | `wh_1234567890abcdef` |\n| `event_type` | Type of payment event | `payment_intent.succeeded` |\n| `payload` | Complete webhook payload | `{\"id\": \"pi_...\", \"status\": \"succeeded\"}` |\n| `signature` | Webhook signature for verification | `t=1634567890,v1=3f5b8a...` |\n| `processed_at` | When processing completed successfully | `2023-10-15T14:30:00Z` |\n| `processing_attempts` | Number of processing attempts | `2` |\n| `last_processing_error` | Most recent processing error | `\"Payment intent not found\"` |\n| `source_ip` | IP address of webhook sender | `54.187.174.169` |\n| `created_at` | When webhook was received | `2023-10-15T14:29:45Z` |\n\n**Event deduplication** prevents duplicate processing when the same webhook is delivered multiple times. The challenge is determining webhook uniqueness - you cannot rely solely on the webhook ID from the provider because different event types might reuse IDs, and some providers don't include stable IDs. Instead, create a composite deduplication key combining the provider webhook ID, event type, and resource ID (like payment intent ID).\n\nThe deduplication process works by attempting to insert a webhook record with a unique constraint on the deduplication key. If the insert succeeds, this is the first time you've seen this webhook, and processing should continue. If the insert fails due to a duplicate key violation, you've already processed this webhook, and you should return success immediately without further processing.\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: Webhook deduplication must happen at the database level using unique constraints, not application-level checks. Application-level checks are subject to race conditions where concurrent webhook deliveries could both pass the duplicate check before either commits their processing transaction.\n\n**Event ordering and causality** present complex challenges because webhooks can arrive out of order due to network delays, provider retry logic, or load balancer routing. For example, you might receive a `charge.succeeded` webhook before the corresponding `payment_intent.processing` webhook. Your processing logic must handle these ordering issues gracefully.\n\nOne approach is to implement **causal dependency checking** where each webhook processing step verifies that prerequisite events have occurred. For instance, before processing `charge.succeeded`, verify that the payment intent exists and is in a state that allows charge completion. If prerequisites aren't met, defer processing using exponential backoff until dependencies are satisfied or timeout occurs.\n\n| Processing State | Next Action | Retry Schedule |\n|------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| `pending` | Attempt initial processing | Immediate |\n| `retrying` | Retry with exponential backoff | 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s |\n| `failed` | Manual review required | None (alert operations) |\n| `processed` | No further action | None |\n| `deferred` | Wait for dependencies | Check every 30s for 10 minutes |\n\nThe **event processing handler** contains the business logic that applies webhook events to your payment system state. This handler must be implemented as an idempotent transaction that can be safely repeated. The handler pattern typically follows these steps:\n\n1. **Parse and validate** the webhook payload against expected schema for the event type\n2. **Load current state** of the relevant payment entities (payment intent, charge, refund, etc.)\n3. **Validate state transitions** to ensure the webhook event represents a legal state change\n4. **Update entity state** with new information from the webhook\n5. **Persist state changes** and mark webhook as processed within a single database transaction\n6. **Trigger downstream actions** like sending customer notifications or updating analytics\n\n**Concurrent processing** requires careful consideration because multiple webhooks for the same payment might arrive simultaneously. Use database row-level locking or optimistic concurrency control to ensure consistent state updates. Pessimistic locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) guarantees exclusive access but can create deadlocks under high concurrency. Optimistic locking using version numbers allows higher concurrency but requires retry logic when conflicts occur.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Webhook Processing Outside Database Transactions**\nProcessing webhook events outside of database transactions creates race conditions where webhook processing can succeed but state updates fail, or vice versa. This leads to webhook events being marked as processed when they actually weren't, or payment state becoming inconsistent with provider state. Always wrap webhook processing and state updates in a single atomic transaction.\n\n**Error handling and retry logic** must distinguish between transient failures (database connection timeout, external service unavailable) and permanent failures (malformed webhook payload, invalid state transition). Transient failures should trigger exponential backoff retries with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. Permanent failures should be logged, marked for manual review, and not retried automatically.\n\nThe retry mechanism should implement **circuit breaker** patterns to prevent cascading failures when downstream systems are unhealthy. If webhook processing consistently fails for a period, temporarily stop processing webhooks to allow systems to recover, while continuing to accept and store incoming webhooks for later processing.\n\n### State Reconciliation Logic\n\n**State reconciliation** serves as the safety net that ensures your payment system's local state remains consistent with the authoritative state maintained by your payment provider. Think of reconciliation like balancing a checkbook - you periodically compare your records against the bank's official statement to identify and correct any discrepancies. In payment systems, these discrepancies can occur due to missed webhooks, processing failures, network partitions, or provider-side issues.\n\nThe reconciliation process operates on a fundamental assumption: **the payment provider's state is authoritative**. When discrepancies are discovered between your local records and the provider's records, your system should generally defer to the provider's version and update local state accordingly. However, this process requires careful handling to avoid overwriting legitimate local state changes or creating inconsistent audit trails.\n\n> **Decision: Periodic Pull-Based Reconciliation with Event-Driven Triggers**\n> - **Context**: Need to detect and correct payment state inconsistencies that arise from missed webhooks, processing failures, or provider-side issues\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Real-time reconciliation on every payment operation\n>   2. Periodic batch reconciliation with fixed schedules  \n>   3. Event-driven reconciliation triggered by anomalies\n>   4. Hybrid periodic + event-driven approach\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid periodic + event-driven approach\n> - **Rationale**: Periodic reconciliation provides systematic coverage of all payments. Event-driven reconciliation enables rapid correction of detected inconsistencies. Real-time reconciliation is too expensive for every operation. Fixed schedules miss urgent corrections.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires maintaining reconciliation schedules and anomaly detection logic. Provides comprehensive consistency guarantees with efficient resource usage.\n\n**Reconciliation triggers** determine when your system initiates state synchronization with the payment provider. Multiple trigger types work together to provide comprehensive coverage while optimizing for different scenarios and urgency levels.\n\n| Reconciliation Trigger | Frequency | Scope | Use Case |\n|----------------------|-----------|-------|----------|\n| Scheduled Full Scan | Daily at 2 AM | All payments from last 30 days | Systematic consistency checking |\n| Scheduled Incremental | Every 4 hours | Payments updated in last 24 hours | Recent payment verification |\n| Webhook Processing Failure | Immediate | Single payment entity | Rapid error correction |\n| Customer Service Request | On-demand | Customer's payment history | Support case resolution |\n| Payment State Anomaly | Immediate | Related payment entities | Automated inconsistency detection |\n| Provider Status Page Alert | Immediate | All active payments | Provider incident response |\n\nThe **reconciliation algorithm** follows a systematic approach to identify, analyze, and resolve state differences. The process begins by fetching current state from both your local database and the payment provider's API for a specific set of payment entities. The comparison logic must handle the complexities of different data formats, field mappings, and temporal consistency.\n\n**State comparison logic** examines multiple dimensions of payment entity state to identify meaningful differences. Simple field-by-field comparison is insufficient because providers often return additional metadata, different timestamp formats, or normalized values that don't exactly match your stored data. The comparison focuses on semantically significant differences that indicate actual state inconsistencies.\n\n| Comparison Dimension | Local Source | Provider Source | Reconciliation Action |\n|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Payment Status | `payment_intent.status` | `payment_intent.status` | Update if provider differs |\n| Charge Amount | `charge.amount` | `charge.amount_captured` | Flag if mismatch exceeds tolerance |\n| Refund Total | Sum of `refund.amount` | `charge.amount_refunded` | Update local refund records |\n| Settlement Status | `charge.settled_at` | `charge.paid` | Update settlement timestamp |\n| Failure Reason | `charge.failure_code` | `charge.outcome.reason` | Update failure details |\n| Metadata Changes | `payment_intent.metadata` | `payment_intent.metadata` | Merge non-conflicting updates |\n\nThe reconciliation process must handle **temporal consistency challenges** where state differences result from legitimate timing delays rather than actual inconsistencies. For example, a payment that shows as `processing` in your local system but `succeeded` at the provider might simply reflect normal processing delays rather than a missed webhook. The reconciliation logic should account for reasonable timing windows before treating status differences as inconsistencies.\n\n**Conflict resolution strategies** define how to handle different types of state discrepancies. The strategy depends on the nature of the difference, the confidence level in local versus provider data, and the potential business impact of incorrect resolution.\n\n> **Reconciliation Conflict Resolution Principles**:\n> 1. **Provider Authority**: When in doubt, the provider's state takes precedence for payment status and financial amounts\n> 2. **Audit Preservation**: Never overwrite local records - create new records with reconciliation metadata\n> 3. **Business Logic Validation**: Ensure state changes don't violate business rules or create inconsistent customer experience\n> 4. **Human Review Required**: Flag complex conflicts for manual review rather than making potentially incorrect automated decisions\n\n**Batch reconciliation processing** optimizes performance when reconciling large numbers of payment entities. Rather than making individual API calls for each payment, batch operations group multiple payment IDs into single provider API requests. This approach reduces API rate limit consumption and improves overall reconciliation performance.\n\nThe batch processing algorithm chunks payment entities into appropriately sized groups (typically 50-100 entities per batch), makes parallel API requests with appropriate rate limiting, and processes results in transaction batches to maintain consistency. Failed batches are retried with exponential backoff, and individual payment failures within successful batches are handled separately.\n\n| Batch Processing Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Batch Size | 50-100 payment entities | Balances API efficiency with memory usage |\n| Concurrent Batches | 3-5 parallel requests | Respects rate limits while improving throughput |\n| Retry Attempts | 3 attempts with exponential backoff | Handles transient API failures gracefully |\n| Transaction Size | 500 database operations | Balances transaction performance with lock duration |\n| Progress Checkpointing | Every 1000 processed entities | Enables resumption after process interruption |\n\n**Reconciliation result handling** processes the outcomes of state comparison and applies appropriate corrections to local payment state. The handling logic must maintain audit trails, update related entities consistently, and trigger appropriate downstream actions like customer notifications or accounting updates.\n\nWhen reconciliation identifies state differences, the correction process creates detailed audit records documenting the discrepancy, the resolution action taken, and the source of authoritative data. These audit records are essential for debugging webhook processing issues, identifying provider-side problems, and maintaining compliance with financial record-keeping requirements.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Reconciliation Infinite Loops**\nPoorly designed reconciliation logic can create infinite loops where corrections made during reconciliation trigger webhook events that cause the system to revert changes, which then triggers another reconciliation cycle. Prevent this by adding reconciliation metadata to updated records and checking for recent reconciliation activity before making corrections.\n\n**Reconciliation monitoring and alerting** tracks the health of the reconciliation process and identifies trends that might indicate systemic issues. Key metrics include reconciliation success rates, types and frequencies of state discrepancies, and time-to-correction for identified inconsistencies.\n\n| Reconciliation Metric | Alert Threshold | Possible Causes |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Discrepancy Rate | >1% of reconciled payments | Webhook processing issues, provider problems |\n| Failed Reconciliation Rate | >5% of reconciliation attempts | API connectivity, authentication issues |\n| High-Value Discrepancies | Any amount >$1000 | Critical payment processing failures |\n| Reconciliation Duration | >2 hours for daily reconciliation | Performance degradation, rate limiting |\n| Consecutive Failures | 3 failed reconciliation attempts | Persistent system or provider issues |\n\nThe reconciliation system should also provide **manual reconciliation tools** for customer service teams and system operators. These tools allow on-demand reconciliation of specific payments, customer accounts, or time periods when issues are reported or suspected. The manual tools should provide detailed comparison reports showing exactly what differences were found and what corrections were applied.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe webhook processing and reconciliation system requires careful coordination between HTTP handling, cryptographic verification, database transactions, and external API integration.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Use `hmac.compare_digest()` for timing-safe signature comparison to prevent timing attacks\n- **Database Deduplication**: Use `ON CONFLICT` clauses in PostgreSQL or `IntegrityError` handling in SQLAlchemy for atomic deduplication\n- **JSON Handling**: Use `json.loads()` with error handling for webhook payload parsing - malformed JSON should return 400 Bad Request\n- **Async Processing**: Consider `asyncio` and `httpx` for high-volume webhook processing to handle concurrent webhook deliveries\n- **Rate Limiting**: Use `time.sleep()` with exponential backoff for provider API calls during reconciliation\n- **Logging**: Include correlation IDs in all log messages to trace webhook processing across components\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoint\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n1. **Webhook Receipt**: `curl -X POST localhost:8000/webhooks -H \"Stripe-Signature: t=1234567890,v1=invalid\" -d '{\"test\": \"data\"}'` should return 401 Unauthorized\n2. **Signature Verification**: Send webhook with valid HMAC signature should return 200 OK and create `WebhookEvent` record in database\n3. **Deduplication**: Send same webhook twice - second request should return 200 OK but not create duplicate database records\n4. **Event Processing**: Send `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook should update corresponding `PaymentIntent` status to `succeeded`\n5. **Reconciliation**: Run `python -m webhook.reconciliation --payment-intent pi_test123` should compare local vs provider state and report any differences\n\n**Expected Database State:**\n- `webhook_events` table contains received webhooks with `processed_at` timestamps\n- `payment_intents` table reflects status updates from webhook processing  \n- `reconciliation_runs` and `reconciliation_discrepancies` tables track reconciliation execution\n- No duplicate webhook processing (verify using `deduplication_key` uniqueness)\n\n**Warning Signs:**\n- Webhook signature verification passing with invalid signatures (security vulnerability)\n- Duplicate payment status updates from repeated webhook processing (idempotency failure)  \n- Reconciliation finding many discrepancies (indicates webhook processing problems)\n- High webhook processing latency (database transaction or API performance issues)\n\n\n## Component Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones - component interaction patterns support payment intents (Milestone 1), payment processing (Milestone 2), refunds and disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4)\n\nThink of a payment system like a complex orchestra where each musician (component) must play their part in perfect timing and harmony. Just as the conductor coordinates when the violins, trumpets, and drums each contribute to the symphony, our payment gateway coordinates when the payment intent manager, processing engine, webhook handler, and external providers each execute their responsibilities. The difference is that in payments, a missed note or wrong timing can mean lost money or compliance violations - so the coordination must be absolutely precise and recoverable.\n\nThis section details how all system components communicate with each other, the exact message formats they exchange, and the precise sequence of operations for both successful and error scenarios. Understanding these interactions is critical because payment processing involves multiple external services, asynchronous operations, and strict consistency requirements.\n\n![Payment Gateway System Architecture](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\n### Complete Payment Flow Sequence\n\nThe complete payment flow represents the \"happy path\" - when everything works correctly from payment intent creation through final webhook confirmation. This sequence involves coordination between the client application, our payment gateway components, external payment providers, and webhook processing systems.\n\n![Complete Payment Processing Sequence](./diagrams/payment-complete-sequence.svg)\n\n#### Phase 1: Payment Intent Creation with Idempotency\n\nThe payment flow begins when a client creates a payment intent. This phase establishes the payment commitment and handles duplicate request prevention through idempotency keys.\n\n**Step-by-Step Payment Intent Creation:**\n\n1. **Client Request Reception**: The payment gateway receives a `POST /payment-intents` request containing the payment amount, currency, idempotency key, and optional metadata from the client application.\n\n2. **Idempotency Key Validation**: The system validates the idempotency key format and checks the `IdempotencyKey` table for existing entries with the same key. If found, it compares the request hash to ensure parameters match.\n\n3. **Request Parameter Hashing**: The system creates a SHA-256 hash of essential request parameters (amount, currency, metadata) to detect parameter mismatches for the same idempotency key.\n\n4. **Database Transaction Initiation**: A database transaction begins to ensure atomic creation of both the `PaymentIntent` and `IdempotencyKey` records.\n\n5. **Payment Intent Record Creation**: The system creates a new `PaymentIntent` with status `created`, generates a unique client secret, and sets an expiration time (typically 24 hours).\n\n6. **Idempotency Key Storage**: An `IdempotencyKey` record is created linking the key to the payment intent, storing the request hash and response details for future duplicate detection.\n\n7. **Response Generation**: The system returns the payment intent ID, client secret, status, and amount to the client, which can then proceed to collect payment method details.\n\n**Payment Intent Creation Message Formats:**\n\n| Field | Type | Direction | Description |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `amount` | int | Request | Payment amount in cents (e.g., 1000 = $10.00) |\n| `currency` | str | Request | ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., \"USD\", \"EUR\") |\n| `idempotency_key` | str | Request | Client-generated unique identifier for duplicate prevention |\n| `metadata` | dict | Request | Optional key-value pairs for merchant reference |\n| `payment_intent_id` | str | Response | Unique identifier for this payment intent |\n| `client_secret` | str | Response | Secret token for client-side payment confirmation |\n| `status` | str | Response | Current payment intent status (always \"created\" initially) |\n| `created_at` | datetime | Response | Timestamp of payment intent creation |\n| `expires_at` | datetime | Response | Expiration time for uncompleted payment intent |\n\n#### Phase 2: Payment Method Collection and Tokenization\n\nAfter payment intent creation, the client collects payment method details and converts them to secure tokens for processing.\n\n**Payment Method Tokenization Sequence:**\n\n1. **Client Payment Method Collection**: The client application presents a secure payment form to collect card details, using either client-side encryption or hosted payment fields.\n\n2. **Tokenization Request**: The client submits payment method details to the tokenization endpoint, which creates a secure `PaymentMethodToken` without storing raw card data.\n\n3. **PCI Compliance Validation**: The tokenization service validates that card data is properly encrypted and that the request meets PCI DSS requirements for data handling.\n\n4. **Token Generation**: A unique, non-reversible token is generated to represent the payment method, with the actual card details stored securely by the payment provider.\n\n5. **Token Response**: The client receives the payment method token, which can be safely stored and transmitted for payment processing without PCI compliance concerns.\n\n**Tokenization Message Formats:**\n\n| Field | Type | Direction | Description |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `card_number` | str | Request | Encrypted or tokenized card number |\n| `expiry_month` | int | Request | Card expiration month (1-12) |\n| `expiry_year` | int | Request | Card expiration year (e.g., 2025) |\n| `cvc` | str | Request | Card verification code (encrypted) |\n| `cardholder_name` | str | Request | Name on the payment card |\n| `payment_method_token` | str | Response | Secure token representing the payment method |\n| `card_brand` | str | Response | Detected card brand (visa, mastercard, etc.) |\n| `last_four_digits` | str | Response | Last four digits for display purposes |\n| `fingerprint` | str | Response | Unique identifier for duplicate card detection |\n\n#### Phase 3: Payment Processing and 3D Secure Authentication\n\nWith the payment intent created and payment method tokenized, the system processes the actual payment, potentially including 3D Secure authentication.\n\n**Payment Processing Sequence:**\n\n1. **Payment Confirmation Request**: The client submits a `POST /payment-intents/{id}/confirm` request with the payment method token and any required authentication details.\n\n2. **Payment Intent Status Validation**: The system verifies the payment intent is in `created` status and has not expired, rejecting requests for intents in terminal states.\n\n3. **Charge Creation with Provider**: The system calls `create_charge()` to submit the payment to the external payment provider, including amount, payment method token, and return URL for 3D Secure.\n\n4. **3D Secure Challenge Detection**: If the payment provider requires Strong Customer Authentication, it returns a challenge URL and authentication token instead of immediate payment confirmation.\n\n5. **3D Secure Redirect Handling**: For payments requiring authentication, the client redirects the user to the issuer bank's 3D Secure challenge page using the provided authentication URL.\n\n6. **Authentication Completion**: After the user completes authentication, the issuer bank redirects back to our return URL with authentication results and tokens.\n\n7. **Payment Confirmation**: The system calls `confirm_payment()` with the authentication token to complete the payment process and receive the final charge result.\n\n8. **Database State Updates**: The system updates the `PaymentIntent` status and creates a `Charge` record with the provider's transaction details and authorization codes.\n\n**Payment Confirmation Message Formats:**\n\n| Field | Type | Direction | Description |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `payment_method_token` | str | Request | Token representing the payment method to charge |\n| `return_url` | str | Request | URL for 3D Secure authentication redirect |\n| `browser_info` | dict | Request | Browser details required for fraud detection |\n| `payment_intent_status` | str | Response | Updated status (processing, requires_action, succeeded) |\n| `charge_id` | str | Response | Unique identifier for the charge record |\n| `network_transaction_id` | str | Response | Payment network transaction identifier |\n| `authorization_code` | str | Response | Bank authorization code for successful payments |\n| `authentication_url` | str | Response | 3D Secure challenge URL (if authentication required) |\n| `authentication_token` | str | Response | Token for completing 3D Secure flow |\n\n![3D Secure Authentication Flow](./diagrams/3ds-flow-sequence.svg)\n\n#### Phase 4: Webhook Processing and State Reconciliation\n\nAfter payment processing, the external payment provider sends webhook notifications to confirm the final payment status and provide settlement details.\n\n**Webhook Processing Sequence:**\n\n1. **Webhook Receipt**: The payment provider sends an HTTP POST to our webhook endpoint containing event data and HMAC signature for verification.\n\n2. **Signature Verification**: The system calls `verify_signature()` to validate the webhook payload against the HMAC signature using our shared webhook secret.\n\n3. **Event Deduplication**: The webhook handler checks for duplicate events using the provider's event ID and our internal deduplication key to prevent double processing.\n\n4. **Event Storage**: A `WebhookEvent` record is created with the raw payload, signature, source IP, and processing status for audit and retry purposes.\n\n5. **Event Type Routing**: The system examines the event type and routes to the appropriate handler (`_handle_payment_intent_event`, `_handle_charge_event`, etc.).\n\n6. **Database State Updates**: Event handlers update the corresponding `PaymentIntent`, `Charge`, or `Refund` records with the latest status information from the provider.\n\n7. **Reconciliation Validation**: The system compares the webhook event data against our local records to detect and resolve any state discrepancies.\n\n8. **Processing Completion**: The webhook handler returns a 200 status to acknowledge successful processing, preventing provider retry attempts.\n\n**Webhook Event Message Formats:**\n\n| Field | Type | Direction | Description |\n|-------|------|-----------|-------------|\n| `event_id` | str | Webhook | Unique identifier for this webhook event |\n| `event_type` | str | Webhook | Type of event (payment_intent.succeeded, charge.failed, etc.) |\n| `created_timestamp` | int | Webhook | Unix timestamp when the event occurred |\n| `payment_intent_id` | str | Webhook | Reference to the payment intent this event concerns |\n| `charge_id` | str | Webhook | Reference to the charge record (if applicable) |\n| `status` | str | Webhook | Updated status for the payment entity |\n| `failure_code` | str | Webhook | Standardized failure code (if payment failed) |\n| `failure_message` | str | Webhook | Human-readable failure description |\n| `network_transaction_id` | str | Webhook | Final network transaction identifier |\n| `settled_at` | datetime | Webhook | Timestamp when funds were settled (if applicable) |\n\n### Error Handling Flow Sequence\n\nPayment processing involves numerous potential failure points, from network issues to provider errors to authentication failures. The error handling flow ensures system reliability and data consistency even when things go wrong.\n\nThink of error handling in payments like emergency procedures in aviation - every possible failure mode has been analyzed, documented, and practiced. Pilots train extensively on what to do when engines fail, instruments malfunction, or weather turns dangerous. Similarly, our payment system must have predetermined responses to network timeouts, provider errors, authentication failures, and data inconsistencies.\n\n#### Network and Connectivity Failures\n\nNetwork failures are among the most common issues in payment processing, occurring when communication with external payment providers is interrupted or delayed.\n\n**Network Failure Handling Sequence:**\n\n1. **Timeout Detection**: When a call to the payment provider exceeds the configured timeout (typically 30 seconds), the system detects a potential network failure.\n\n2. **Connection Status Classification**: The system determines whether the failure is a connection timeout (request never sent), read timeout (request sent but no response), or connection reset.\n\n3. **Circuit Breaker Evaluation**: If multiple consecutive failures occur, the circuit breaker pattern prevents additional requests to protect both our system and the provider.\n\n4. **Retry Strategy Implementation**: For transient failures, the system applies exponential backoff retry logic with jitter to avoid thundering herd problems.\n\n5. **Payment Status Uncertainty Resolution**: When network failures occur during critical operations, the system marks the payment intent status as `processing` and initiates reconciliation.\n\n6. **Provider Status Query**: After network recovery, the system queries the provider's API directly to determine the actual status of uncertain payments.\n\n7. **State Correction and Notification**: Based on provider response, the system updates local records and notifies the client of the final payment outcome.\n\n**Network Failure Response Patterns:**\n\n| Failure Type | Detection Method | Immediate Action | Recovery Strategy |\n|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Connection Timeout | Socket connection fails within 10s | Return temporary error to client | Retry with exponential backoff |\n| Read Timeout | Request sent but no response in 30s | Mark payment as uncertain | Query provider status after delay |\n| Connection Reset | TCP RST received during request | Log error and mark uncertain | Immediate retry once, then backoff |\n| DNS Resolution | Cannot resolve provider hostname | Circuit breaker activation | Check network connectivity and DNS |\n| SSL Handshake | TLS negotiation fails | Security alert and abort | Verify certificates and TLS configuration |\n\n#### Payment Provider Errors\n\nPayment providers return various error types that require different handling strategies, from temporary rate limits to permanent card declines.\n\n**Provider Error Classification and Handling:**\n\n1. **Error Code Analysis**: The system examines the provider's error response to determine the error category (temporary, permanent, authentication, rate limit).\n\n2. **Retriable Error Detection**: Errors like rate limits (429), temporary server errors (502, 503), and network issues are marked for retry with appropriate delays.\n\n3. **Permanent Error Handling**: Card declines, insufficient funds, and authentication failures are immediately returned to the client without retry attempts.\n\n4. **Rate Limit Backoff**: When providers return 429 (Too Many Requests), the system implements exponential backoff with respect for any Retry-After headers.\n\n5. **Authentication Error Recovery**: For authentication failures with the provider, the system refreshes API credentials and retries the request once.\n\n6. **Provider Downtime Response**: During provider outages, payments are queued for retry while clients receive graceful error messages about temporary unavailability.\n\n**Provider Error Response Handling:**\n\n| Provider Response | Error Category | Client Response | Retry Strategy |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| `card_declined` | Permanent | Return decline reason | No retry - inform customer |\n| `insufficient_funds` | Permanent | Return balance error | No retry - suggest different card |\n| `expired_card` | Permanent | Request updated card details | No retry - collect new payment method |\n| `processing_error` | Temporary | Return try again message | Exponential backoff up to 3 attempts |\n| `rate_limited` | Temporary | Queue request for retry | Respect Retry-After header timing |\n| `authentication_failed` | Configuration | Return system error | Refresh credentials and retry once |\n| `invalid_request` | Permanent | Return validation error | No retry - fix request parameters |\n\n#### 3D Secure Authentication Failures\n\n3D Secure authentication introduces additional complexity with redirects, timeouts, and authentication challenges that can fail in various ways.\n\n**3D Secure Error Handling Sequence:**\n\n1. **Authentication Challenge Timeout**: If the user doesn't complete 3D Secure authentication within the timeout period (typically 5 minutes), the system cancels the payment attempt.\n\n2. **Authentication Failure Processing**: When users fail 3D Secure challenges (wrong password, canceled authentication), the system processes the failure without retry.\n\n3. **Redirect Parameter Validation**: Return URLs from 3D Secure flows are validated using `validate_return_params()` to detect tampering or corruption.\n\n4. **Authentication Token Verification**: The authentication token received after 3D Secure completion is verified with the provider before completing the payment.\n\n5. **Incomplete Authentication Handling**: If users abandon the 3D Secure flow without completion, the payment intent remains in `requires_action` status until expiration.\n\n**3D Secure Failure Scenarios:**\n\n| Failure Type | Detection | Handling | Client Impact |\n|--------------|-----------|----------|---------------|\n| User abandons 3DS | No return to callback URL | Payment intent expires after timeout | Client receives payment_intent.canceled webhook |\n| Authentication fails | Provider returns auth failure | Mark charge as failed with reason | Client can retry with different payment method |\n| Invalid return params | Parameter validation fails | Log security alert and reject | Client receives error and can restart payment |\n| Authentication timeout | 5 minute limit exceeded | Cancel payment and clean up state | Client receives timeout error |\n| Network error during 3DS | Connection fails to issuer | Mark authentication as uncertain | Query provider for actual authentication status |\n\n#### Data Consistency and Reconciliation Failures\n\nData consistency failures occur when local payment state diverges from the provider's records, requiring reconciliation and correction.\n\n**Consistency Failure Detection and Resolution:**\n\n1. **Webhook Delivery Failure**: When webhooks fail to deliver or process correctly, local payment status may become stale or incorrect.\n\n2. **State Divergence Detection**: Periodic reconciliation jobs compare local payment records against provider APIs to identify discrepancies.\n\n3. **Discrepancy Classification**: Differences are classified as timing issues (acceptable delays), data errors (requiring correction), or system bugs (requiring investigation).\n\n4. **Automated Resolution**: Simple discrepancies like status updates are automatically corrected using provider data as the authoritative source.\n\n5. **Manual Review Triggers**: Complex discrepancies involving amounts, refunds, or disputes are flagged for manual review by operations teams.\n\n6. **Correction Audit Trail**: All reconciliation corrections are logged with timestamps, reasons, and approval records for compliance auditing.\n\n**Data Consistency Resolution Matrix:**\n\n| Discrepancy Type | Automatic Resolution | Manual Review Required | Alert Priority |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Status behind provider | Update local status | No | Low |\n| Amount mismatch | No - flag for review | Yes - financial impact | High |\n| Missing charge record | Create from provider data | Yes - data integrity issue | Medium |\n| Extra refund record | No - potential duplicate | Yes - money movement | High |\n| Settlement date difference | Update to provider value | No - timing issue | Low |\n| Dispute status mismatch | Update local status | Yes - review deadline impact | Medium |\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: Error handling in payments requires distinguishing between recoverable and non-recoverable failures. Recoverable failures (network timeouts, rate limits) should trigger retry logic with proper backoff. Non-recoverable failures (card declines, authentication failures) should fail fast and provide clear feedback to help users resolve the issue.\n\n### API Contracts and Message Formats\n\nAPI contracts define the exact structure of messages exchanged between system components, external providers, and client applications. These contracts must be precisely defined because payment systems require strict data validation and error handling.\n\nThink of API contracts in payments like international banking protocols - every field, format, and response code must be standardized and understood by all parties. Just as SWIFT messages for international wire transfers follow exact formatting rules that banks worldwide understand, our payment APIs must follow consistent patterns that clients, providers, and internal components can rely on.\n\n#### Internal Component API Contracts\n\nInternal APIs facilitate communication between payment gateway components, ensuring consistent data flow and proper error propagation.\n\n**Payment Intent Manager API:**\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `create_payment_intent()` | `amount: int, currency: str, idempotency_key: str, metadata: dict` | `PaymentIntent` | Creates new payment intent with idempotency checking |\n| `get_payment_intent()` | `payment_intent_id: str` | `PaymentIntent` | Retrieves payment intent by ID |\n| `update_payment_intent_status()` | `payment_intent_id: str, new_status: PaymentIntentStatus, error_info: dict` | `bool` | Updates payment intent status with validation |\n| `expire_payment_intents()` | `cutoff_time: datetime` | `List[str]` | Cancels expired payment intents, returns canceled IDs |\n| `validate_payment_intent_transition()` | `current_status: PaymentIntentStatus, new_status: PaymentIntentStatus` | `bool` | Validates status transition is allowed |\n\n**Payment Processing Engine API:**\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `process_payment_intent()` | `payment_intent_id: str, payment_method_token: PaymentMethodToken, db: Session` | `Charge` | Main entry point for payment processing |\n| `handle_three_ds_return()` | `query_params: dict, db: Session` | `Charge` | Processes 3D Secure authentication return |\n| `create_charge()` | `payment_method_token: PaymentMethodToken, amount: int, currency: str, return_url: str, metadata: dict` | `ChargeResponse` | Submits payment to external provider |\n| `confirm_payment()` | `provider_charge_id: str, authentication_token: str` | `ChargeResponse` | Completes 3D Secure authentication flow |\n| `generate_return_url()` | `payment_intent_id: str, session_id: str` | `str` | Creates secure 3D Secure return URL |\n\n**Refund and Dispute API:**\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `create_refund()` | `charge_id: str, amount: int, reason: str, idempotency_key: str` | `Refund` | Creates full or partial refund |\n| `get_refund_status()` | `refund_id: str` | `Refund` | Retrieves current refund status |\n| `handle_chargeback_notification()` | `chargeback_data: dict, webhook_signature: str` | `bool` | Processes chargeback webhook |\n| `submit_dispute_evidence()` | `dispute_id: str, evidence: dict, deadline: datetime` | `bool` | Submits evidence for dispute |\n| `validate_refund_amount()` | `charge_id: str, refund_amount: int` | `bool` | Validates refund amount against charge and existing refunds |\n\n#### External Provider API Integration\n\nExternal provider APIs handle actual payment processing, requiring careful request formatting and response handling.\n\n> **Decision: Provider API Abstraction Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Different payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Adyen) have varying API structures and response formats\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Direct provider integration with provider-specific code\n>   2. Abstract provider interface with concrete implementations\n>   3. Universal payment protocol translation layer\n> - **Decision**: Abstract provider interface with concrete implementations\n> - **Rationale**: Enables multi-provider support while maintaining type safety and clear error handling patterns\n> - **Consequences**: Requires mapping provider-specific responses to common formats, but enables provider switching and redundancy\n\n**Payment Provider Interface:**\n\n| Method | Request Format | Response Format | Description |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| `create_charge()` | `{\"amount\": int, \"currency\": str, \"payment_method\": str, \"return_url\": str, \"metadata\": dict}` | `{\"id\": str, \"status\": str, \"client_secret\": str, \"next_action\": dict}` | Initiates payment with provider |\n| `retrieve_charge()` | `{\"charge_id\": str}` | `{\"id\": str, \"status\": str, \"amount\": int, \"failure_code\": str, \"network_txn_id\": str}` | Gets current charge status |\n| `confirm_payment()` | `{\"charge_id\": str, \"payment_method\": str, \"return_url\": str}` | `{\"id\": str, \"status\": str, \"authorization_code\": str}` | Confirms payment after 3DS |\n| `create_refund()` | `{\"charge_id\": str, \"amount\": int, \"reason\": str}` | `{\"id\": str, \"status\": str, \"refund_amount\": int}` | Creates refund against charge |\n| `list_events()` | `{\"created_after\": datetime, \"limit\": int, \"starting_after\": str}` | `{\"events\": [event], \"has_more\": bool}` | Lists recent events for reconciliation |\n\n**Provider Response Mapping:**\n\n| Provider Field | Standard Field | Data Type | Transformation |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|\n| `id` | `provider_charge_id` | str | Direct mapping |\n| `status` | `charge_status` | ChargeStatus | Map to enum values |\n| `amount` | `amount` | int | Ensure cents conversion |\n| `currency` | `currency` | str | Validate against supported currencies |\n| `failure_code` | `failure_code` | str | Map to standard failure codes |\n| `failure_message` | `failure_message` | str | Direct mapping with length limits |\n| `created` | `created_at` | datetime | Convert from Unix timestamp |\n| `source.last4` | `last_four_digits` | str | Extract from nested payment method |\n\n#### Client-Facing REST API Contracts\n\nClient-facing APIs provide the interface for merchant applications to integrate payment processing into their checkout flows.\n\n**Payment Intent Endpoints:**\n\n```http\nPOST /v1/payment-intents\nContent-Type: application/json\nIdempotency-Key: unique_key_12345\n\n{\n  \"amount\": 1000,\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"order_id\": \"order_12345\",\n    \"customer_email\": \"user@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"pi_1234567890\",\n  \"client_secret\": \"pi_1234567890_secret_abcdef\",\n  \"amount\": 1000,\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"status\": \"created\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2023-10-15T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"expires_at\": \"2023-10-16T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"order_id\": \"order_12345\",\n    \"customer_email\": \"user@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Payment Confirmation Endpoint:**\n\n```http\nPOST /v1/payment-intents/{id}/confirm\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"payment_method_token\": \"pm_card_visa_4242\",\n  \"return_url\": \"https://merchant.com/payment-return\",\n  \"browser_info\": {\n    \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0...\",\n    \"accept_header\": \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"color_depth\": 24,\n    \"screen_height\": 1080,\n    \"screen_width\": 1920,\n    \"timezone\": -300\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Webhook Event Message Contracts\n\nWebhook events provide asynchronous notifications about payment status changes, requiring standardized message formats for reliable processing.\n\n**Webhook Event Structure:**\n\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| `id` | str | Yes | Unique event identifier |\n| `type` | str | Yes | Event type (payment_intent.succeeded, charge.failed) |\n| `created` | int | Yes | Unix timestamp when event occurred |\n| `data` | object | Yes | Event-specific payload data |\n| `request` | object | No | Details about the API request that triggered the event |\n| `pending_webhooks` | int | Yes | Number of pending webhook deliveries |\n\n**Payment Intent Webhook Events:**\n\n| Event Type | Trigger | Data Payload Fields |\n|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| `payment_intent.created` | New payment intent created | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent` |\n| `payment_intent.requires_action` | 3D Secure authentication needed | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent, next_action: dict` |\n| `payment_intent.processing` | Payment submitted to provider | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent, charge: Charge` |\n| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Payment completed successfully | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent, charge: Charge` |\n| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Payment failed permanently | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent, last_payment_error: dict` |\n| `payment_intent.canceled` | Intent expired or manually canceled | `payment_intent: PaymentIntent, cancellation_reason: str` |\n\n**Error Response Standardization:**\n\nAll API endpoints return consistent error response formats to enable proper error handling by client applications.\n\n**Standard Error Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"card_error\",\n    \"code\": \"card_declined\",\n    \"message\": \"Your card was declined.\",\n    \"decline_code\": \"insufficient_funds\",\n    \"payment_intent\": {\n      \"id\": \"pi_1234567890\",\n      \"status\": \"requires_payment_method\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Error Type Classification:**\n\n| Error Type | HTTP Status | Description | Client Action |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|\n| `api_error` | 500 | Internal server error | Retry after delay |\n| `authentication_error` | 401 | Invalid API credentials | Check API keys |\n| `card_error` | 402 | Payment method declined | Request different payment method |\n| `idempotency_error` | 400 | Idempotency key reused with different params | Use new idempotency key |\n| `invalid_request_error` | 400 | Invalid parameters | Fix request parameters |\n| `rate_limit_error` | 429 | Too many requests | Implement request throttling |\n\n> **Critical Implementation Note**: All monetary amounts in API contracts MUST be represented as integers in the smallest currency unit (cents for USD, pence for GBP) to avoid floating-point precision errors. A $10.00 payment is represented as `\"amount\": 1000`, never as `\"amount\": 10.0`.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe component interaction patterns require careful coordination between multiple services, proper error handling, and reliable message processing. This guidance provides practical implementation approaches for building these interaction patterns.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| HTTP Client | `requests` library with retry logic | `aiohttp` for async processing |\n| Message Serialization | `json` standard library | `pydantic` for validation |\n| Webhook Verification | `hmac` standard library | `cryptography` library |\n| Database Sessions | `SQLAlchemy` with context managers | Connection pooling with `asyncpg` |\n| API Documentation | Manual OpenAPI spec | `FastAPI` auto-generated docs |\n| Request Validation | Manual parameter checking | `marshmallow` schemas |\n\n**Recommended Project Structure:**\n\n```\npayment-gateway/\n├── src/\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── payment_intents.py     ← Client-facing REST endpoints\n│   │   ├── webhooks.py           ← Webhook processing endpoints\n│   │   └── middleware.py         ← Request logging and validation\n│   ├── services/\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── payment_processor.py  ← Core payment processing logic\n│   │   ├── provider_client.py    ← External provider integration\n│   │   └── reconciliation.py     ← State reconciliation service\n│   ├── models/\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── payment_intent.py     ← Data model definitions\n│   │   └── webhook_event.py      ← Webhook event models\n│   ├── utils/\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\n│   │   ├── crypto.py            ← Signature verification utilities\n│   │   └── retry.py             ← Retry logic helpers\n│   └── main.py                  ← Application entry point\n├── tests/\n│   ├── test_api.py              ← API endpoint tests\n│   ├── test_services.py         ← Service layer tests\n│   └── test_integration.py      ← End-to-end tests\n└── requirements.txt\n```\n\n**HTTP Client Infrastructure (Complete Implementation):**\n\n```python\n# utils/http_client.py\nimport time\nimport logging\nimport requests\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, Any\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass RetryStrategy(Enum):\n    EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF = \"exponential\"\n    FIXED_DELAY = \"fixed\"\n    NO_RETRY = \"none\"\n\n@dataclass\nclass RetryConfig:\n    max_attempts: int = 3\n    initial_delay: float = 1.0\n    max_delay: float = 60.0\n    backoff_multiplier: float = 2.0\n    strategy: RetryStrategy = RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF\n\nclass PaymentProviderClient:\n    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_key: str, retry_config: RetryConfig):\n        self.base_url = base_url\n        self.api_key = api_key\n        self.retry_config = retry_config\n        self.session = requests.Session()\n        self.session.headers.update({\n            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n            'User-Agent': 'PaymentGateway/1.0'\n        })\n    \n    def make_request(self, method: str, endpoint: str, data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n        url = f\"{self.base_url}/{endpoint.lstrip('/')}\"\n        \n        for attempt in range(self.retry_config.max_attempts):\n            try:\n                response = self.session.request(method, url, json=data, timeout=30)\n                \n                if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited\n                    retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', '60'))\n                    if attempt < self.retry_config.max_attempts -

Unlike typical web applications where a failed request can simply return an error, payment systems deal with real money where failures have financial consequences. A network timeout during payment processing doesn't just mean \"try again later\" - it creates uncertainty about whether money actually moved, requiring sophisticated reconciliation to resolve.\n\nThe mental model for payment error handling resembles air traffic control systems: multiple redundant safety mechanisms, clear protocols for every failure scenario, and the ability to maintain safe operations even when individual components fail. Just as air traffic controllers have backup communication systems and predetermined procedures for radio failures, payment systems need comprehensive error handling strategies that account for partial failures, network partitions, and provider outages.\n\nThis section establishes the error handling foundation that makes payment processing reliable across all system components. Every payment operation - from creating intents with idempotency keys to processing webhooks - depends on these error handling patterns to maintain data consistency and financial accuracy.\n\n![Payment Error Handling Decision Tree](./diagrams/error-handling-flowchart.svg)\n\n### Failure Mode Analysis\n\nPayment systems face a complex landscape of potential failures, each requiring specific detection and recovery strategies. Understanding these failure modes is crucial because payment operations are inherently distributed - they involve coordination between your application, external payment providers, issuing banks, and card networks. Each integration point introduces new failure possibilities.\n\nThe failure taxonomy for payment systems differs fundamentally from typical web applications. While a failed web request might inconvenience a user, a failed payment operation can result in money being charged without goods delivered, refunds being processed twice, or chargebacks going uncontested. This makes comprehensive failure analysis not just good engineering practice, but a business necessity.\n\n#### Network and Communication Failures\n\nNetwork failures represent the most common category of payment processing issues. These failures are particularly challenging because they create uncertainty - when a network request times out during payment processing, the system cannot determine whether the payment succeeded at the provider level.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Business Impact | Recovery Strategy |\n|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Provider API timeout during charge creation | HTTP request timeout (30-60 seconds) | Payment may have succeeded but status unknown | Query provider API with original idempotency key |\n| Provider API timeout during 3DS confirmation | Webhook timeout or status polling | Customer completed authentication but charge uncertain | Reconcile charge status via provider API |\n| Network partition during webhook delivery | Missing webhook events for known payments | Local payment state becomes stale | Run immediate reconciliation scan |\n| DNS resolution failure for provider API | Connection establishment error | All new payments blocked | Circuit breaker pattern with cached IP fallback |\n| SSL/TLS handshake failure | Certificate validation error | Payment processing completely blocked | Retry with exponential backoff, alert operations team |\n| Intermittent 5xx errors from provider | HTTP 502, 503, 504 status codes | Individual payments failing randomly | Exponential backoff with jitter, track error rates |\n\nNetwork failures require careful timeout configuration. Provider API calls should use timeouts shorter than your own API response requirements - if your payment API promises 30-second response times, provider calls must timeout in 20-25 seconds to allow time for error handling and response formatting.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Network timeouts during payment operations create the \"money in flight\" problem - you cannot assume the payment failed just because you didn't receive a response. Always implement status reconciliation for timeout scenarios.\n\n#### Provider-Specific Failures\n\nExternal payment providers introduce their own failure modes based on their internal systems, rate limiting, and business rules. These failures often carry specific error codes that require different handling strategies.\n\n| Provider Error Type | Common Error Codes | Retry Strategy | Required Action |\n|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Rate limiting | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Exponential backoff with provider-specific limits | Honor retry-after headers, implement token bucket |\n| Insufficient funds | `insufficient_funds`, `declined` | No retry - terminal failure | Mark charge as failed, update payment intent status |\n| Invalid payment method | `invalid_card_number`, `expired_card` | No retry - user error | Return validation error to client |\n| Provider maintenance | `temporarily_unavailable` | Exponential backoff up to 15 minutes | Circuit breaker, consider backup provider |\n| Authentication errors | `invalid_api_key`, `permission_denied` | No retry - configuration issue | Alert operations, check credential rotation |\n| Idempotency key conflicts | `idempotency_key_reused` | Check if previous request succeeded | Query existing payment status, return if successful |\n\nProvider failures require understanding the semantics of different error codes. Some errors indicate permanent failures that should never be retried (invalid card numbers), while others suggest temporary issues that may resolve with time (rate limiting).\n\n**Decision: Provider Error Code Mapping**\n- **Context**: Different providers use different error code formats and semantics, making unified error handling difficult\n- **Options Considered**: \n  1. Pass through provider error codes directly\n  2. Map all provider errors to internal error taxonomy\n  3. Hybrid approach with provider passthrough plus internal classification\n- **Decision**: Map provider errors to internal taxonomy with original code preserved\n- **Rationale**: Internal taxonomy enables consistent retry logic and client error handling while preserving provider-specific details for debugging\n- **Consequences**: Requires maintaining mapping tables for each provider but enables provider-agnostic error handling logic\n\n#### Data Consistency Failures\n\nPayment systems must maintain strict data consistency across multiple operations - creating payment intents, processing charges, handling webhooks, and reconciling state. Failures can leave the system in partially updated states that compromise financial accuracy.\n\n| Consistency Issue | Symptoms | Detection Method | Resolution Strategy |\n|-------------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Payment intent created but charge processing failed | Intent exists in `created` status indefinitely | Check for old intents without corresponding charges | Cancel expired intents, refund any orphaned charges |\n| Charge succeeded at provider but webhook missed | Local charge stuck in `pending`, provider shows `succeeded` | Reconciliation discovers status mismatch | Update local charge status, trigger downstream notifications |\n| Webhook processed but database update failed | Webhook marked processed, payment status not updated | Transaction rollback detection | Retry webhook processing with idempotency protection |\n| Partial refund amounts don't sum correctly | Total refunds exceed original charge amount | Validation during refund creation | Reject refund, audit existing refund records |\n| Duplicate webhook processing | Same event processed multiple times | Multiple database records for single event | Implement webhook deduplication using event IDs |\n| 3DS authentication completed but charge confirmation failed | Customer completed authentication, charge not finalized | Status polling after authentication timeout | Query provider for charge status, manual reconciliation if needed |\n\nData consistency issues require careful transaction boundary design. Related database updates should occur within single transactions where possible, with compensation logic for operations that cannot be atomic.\n\n#### State Machine Violations\n\nPayment entities follow strict state machines - payment intents, charges, refunds, and disputes each have defined valid transitions. Violations of these state machines indicate bugs or external manipulation.\n\n| State Violation | Valid Prevention | Error Handling |\n|-----------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Payment intent transitions from `succeeded` to `processing` | Check `can_transition_to()` before updates | Log error, reject transition, alert monitoring |\n| Charge moves from `failed` to `succeeded` | Database constraints on status transitions | Treat as provider data correction, audit carefully |\n| Refund created against non-existent charge | Foreign key constraints | Return 404 error, log potential fraud attempt |\n| Dispute created for already-refunded payment | Business logic validation | May be valid - partial refunds can still be disputed |\n| Multiple charges against single payment intent | Unique constraint on payment_intent_id + charge status | Second charge should reuse existing successful charge |\n| Webhook updates payment to invalid state | Webhook validation before processing | Quarantine webhook, manual review required |\n\nState machine violations often indicate either bugs in business logic or attempts at system manipulation. All violations should be logged with high severity and trigger alerting.\n\n### Retry and Backoff Strategies\n\nRetry strategies for payment systems require balancing responsiveness against system stability. Unlike simple web requests, payment operations have time-sensitive characteristics - customers expect quick responses, authentication flows have timeouts, and providers may interpret repeated requests as potential fraud.\n\nThe mental model for payment retry strategies resembles emergency response protocols: immediate action for life-threatening situations, measured escalation for serious problems, and careful evaluation before dramatic interventions. Payment retries must be similarly calibrated - aggressive retries for transient network issues but conservative approaches for provider errors that might indicate deeper problems.\n\n#### Exponential Backoff Implementation\n\nExponential backoff with jitter provides the foundation for retry strategies, preventing thundering herd problems while giving temporary issues time to resolve. Payment-specific backoff must account for customer experience - users will abandon checkout flows that take too long.\n\n| Operation Type | Initial Delay | Max Delay | Max Attempts | Jitter Strategy |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|\n| Payment intent creation | 100ms | 5s | 3 attempts | ±25% random jitter |\n| Charge processing | 200ms | 10s | 4 attempts | ±50% random jitter |\n| 3DS confirmation | 500ms | 30s | 6 attempts | ±25% random jitter (user waiting) |\n| Webhook processing | 1s | 5 minutes | 8 attempts | Exponential jitter (background task) |\n| Refund processing | 1s | 1 minute | 5 attempts | ±25% random jitter |\n| Reconciliation queries | 5s | 10 minutes | 12 attempts | Full jitter (low priority) |\n\nThe retry schedule must consider cumulative delay - if initial payment processing allows 30 seconds total, the retry schedule cannot exceed this budget even for multiple failed attempts.\n\n**Jitter calculation prevents synchronized retries:**\n- **Random jitter**: delay ± (percentage * delay)\n- **Exponential jitter**: random value between 0 and calculated exponential delay\n- **Full jitter**: completely random delay between minimum and maximum bounds\n\n#### Circuit Breaker Pattern\n\nCircuit breakers protect payment systems from cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to failing downstream services. Payment circuit breakers must be carefully tuned to avoid disrupting legitimate transactions while protecting system stability.\n\n| Circuit Breaker Configuration | Failure Threshold | Recovery Time | Half-Open Test Requests |\n|------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Payment provider API calls | 10 failures in 1 minute | 30 seconds | 3 requests |\n| Webhook signature verification | 20 failures in 5 minutes | 60 seconds | 5 requests |\n| Database connections | 5 failures in 30 seconds | 10 seconds | 2 requests |\n| 3DS authentication service | 15 failures in 2 minutes | 45 seconds | 2 requests |\n| Reconciliation API calls | 25 failures in 10 minutes | 5 minutes | 10 requests |\n\nCircuit breaker states require careful monitoring and alerting:\n\n1. **Closed State**: Normal operation, requests flow through normally, failure counting active\n2. **Open State**: All requests immediately fail without calling downstream service, preventing cascade failures\n3. **Half-Open State**: Limited test requests allowed to check if downstream service has recovered\n\n> **Design Principle**: Circuit breakers should fail fast and fail visibly - when payments cannot be processed due to circuit breaker activation, users should receive clear messaging about temporary unavailability rather than generic errors.\n\n#### Retry Decision Matrix\n\nDifferent error types require different retry strategies based on their likelihood of resolution and potential for success. The retry decision matrix codifies these strategies for consistent application across the payment system.\n\n| Error Category | Retry Immediately | Retry with Backoff | No Retry | Special Handling |\n|----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|\n| Network timeout | ✓ (1 immediate) | ✓ (exponential) | After max attempts | Query provider status |\n| HTTP 5xx errors | ✓ (1 immediate) | ✓ (exponential) | After max attempts | Circuit breaker activation |\n| Rate limiting (HTTP 429) | ✗ | ✓ (honor retry-after) | If rate limit exceeded | Token bucket implementation |\n| Authentication errors | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (permanent failure) | Alert operations team |\n| Invalid request data | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (client error) | Return validation errors |\n| Insufficient funds | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (business rule) | Update payment method |\n| Provider maintenance | ✗ | ✓ (longer delays) | After extended period | Consider backup provider |\n| Database deadlock | ✓ (1 immediate) | ✓ (short backoff) | After 3 attempts | Different retry pattern |\n\nThe retry decision must be made quickly to maintain acceptable response times. Pre-calculated retry matrices enable immediate classification without complex decision logic in the hot path.\n\n#### Background Retry Processing\n\nSome payment operations benefit from background retry processing, particularly webhook handling and reconciliation tasks that don't require immediate user feedback. Background retries can use more aggressive strategies and longer timeframes.\n\nBackground retry processing follows a job queue pattern with the following characteristics:\n\n1. **Immediate Queue**: Failed operations retried within seconds for transient issues\n2. **Delayed Queue**: Operations retried after minutes or hours for provider outages\n3. **Manual Queue**: Operations requiring human intervention or investigation\n\n| Queue Type | Retry Schedule | Max Age | Success Criteria |\n|------------|---------------|---------|------------------|\n| Immediate webhook retry | 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s | 5 minutes | HTTP 200 + valid response |\n| Delayed webhook retry | 1min, 5min, 15min, 1hr | 24 hours | Successful processing |\n| Reconciliation retry | 5min, 15min, 1hr, 4hr | 7 days | Status matches provider |\n| Refund retry | 30s, 2min, 10min, 1hr | 6 hours | Refund confirmed |\n| Manual investigation | No automatic retry | 30 days | Human resolution |\n\nBackground retry queues require dead letter handling for operations that exhaust retry attempts. Dead letter queues should trigger alerting and provide audit trails for manual investigation.\n\n### Data Consistency Guarantees\n\nPayment systems require stronger consistency guarantees than typical web applications because financial data must be accurate and auditable. The challenge lies in maintaining consistency across multiple external systems while providing acceptable performance for real-time payment processing.\n\nThink of payment data consistency like maintaining accurate bank ledgers before computerization - every transaction must be recorded completely and correctly, with clear audit trails and reconciliation processes to catch and correct any discrepancies. Modern payment systems face the additional challenge of coordinating these \"ledger entries\" across multiple distributed systems that may fail independently.\n\n#### ACID Compliance for Payment Operations\n\nPayment operations must maintain ACID properties within database boundaries while implementing compensation patterns for operations that span multiple systems. The key insight is identifying which operations can be truly atomic versus those requiring eventual consistency with reconciliation.\n\n**Atomic Operations (Single Database Transaction):**\n\n| Operation | ACID Guarantees | Transaction Scope |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Payment intent creation with idempotency | Full ACID within single DB transaction | Intent record + idempotency key record |\n| Charge status updates from webhooks | Full ACID for status transitions | Charge record + webhook event record |\n| Refund record creation | Full ACID for refund tracking | Refund record + charge balance updates |\n| Payment method tokenization | Full ACID for token storage | Token record + customer association |\n\n**Eventually Consistent Operations (Cross-System Coordination):**\n\n| Operation | Consistency Strategy | Reconciliation Method |\n|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Charge creation at payment provider | Compensating transaction on failure | Status polling + webhook confirmation |\n| 3DS authentication completion | Status reconciliation after timeout | Provider query + local state update |\n| Webhook event processing | Idempotent processing with deduplication | Replay missed events from provider |\n| Multi-provider payment routing | Distributed saga pattern | Cancel backup providers on primary success |\n\n> **Decision: Database Transaction Boundaries**\n> - **Context**: Payment operations often require coordination between local database updates and external provider API calls\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Large transactions encompassing external API calls\n>   2. Local database transactions only with external compensation\n>   3. Two-phase commit with payment providers\n> - **Decision**: Local database transactions with external compensation and reconciliation\n> - **Rationale**: Payment providers don't support 2PC, and large transactions risk timeouts and deadlocks during network calls\n> - **Consequences**: Requires robust reconciliation but provides better availability and clearer failure modes\n\n#### Idempotency as Consistency Foundation\n\nIdempotency serves as the foundational consistency mechanism for payment systems, ensuring that duplicate operations produce identical results rather than corrupting financial data. Every operation that moves money or changes payment state must be idempotent.\n\nThe idempotency implementation extends beyond simple duplicate prevention to encompass complete operation replay capability. When network failures create uncertainty about operation completion, idempotency allows safe replay of the entire operation sequence.\n\n| Operation Type | Idempotency Key Source | Duplicate Behavior |\n|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Payment intent creation | Client-provided idempotency key | Return existing intent if parameters match |\n| Charge processing | Payment intent ID + payment method hash | Return existing charge if successful |\n| Refund creation | Client-provided idempotency key + charge ID | Return existing refund for same key |\n| Webhook processing | Provider event ID + event type | Skip processing if already handled |\n| 3DS confirmation | Provider payment intent ID | Return current authentication status |\n| Reconciliation run | Date range + run type hash | Return previous run results |\n\nIdempotency key validation must prevent parameter tampering - using the same idempotency key with different payment parameters should result in an error, not returning the previous result with different parameters.\n\n**Idempotency Key Lifecycle Management:**\n\n1. **Key Generation**: Client generates UUID v4 or similar high-entropy identifier\n2. **Parameter Hashing**: System creates hash of essential operation parameters\n3. **Conflict Detection**: Same key with different parameters triggers validation error\n4. **Response Caching**: Successful operation response cached for key lifetime\n5. **Expiration**: Keys expire after 24 hours to prevent indefinite storage growth\n\n#### Reconciliation as Consistency Safety Net\n\nReconciliation provides the ultimate consistency guarantee by periodically comparing local payment state against authoritative provider records. This catches issues that escape other consistency mechanisms and provides audit trails for financial reporting.\n\nThe reconciliation strategy operates on multiple timescales to balance consistency with system load:\n\n**Real-Time Reconciliation (Immediate):**\n- Triggered by webhook processing failures\n- Validates critical state transitions (payment success/failure)\n- Limited to individual payment intent scope\n- Must complete within seconds to support user experience\n\n**Scheduled Reconciliation (Periodic):**\n\n| Reconciliation Type | Frequency | Scope | Discrepancy Handling |\n|-------------------|-----------|-------|---------------------|\n| Recent payments | Every 15 minutes | Last 4 hours of payments | Immediate correction + alerting |\n| Daily settlement | Every 24 hours | Previous day's completed payments | Batch correction + audit log |\n| Weekly audit | Every 7 days | All payments from previous week | Full investigation required |\n| Monthly compliance | Every 30 days | Complete payment history | Regulatory reporting + correction |\n\nReconciliation algorithms must handle the complexity of timing differences between local and provider systems. Providers may process refunds or chargebacks that haven't been communicated via webhooks yet, requiring sophisticated discrepancy analysis.\n\n**Discrepancy Resolution Workflow:**\n\n1. **Detection**: Automated comparison identifies state differences\n2. **Classification**: Discrepancy categorized by type and severity\n3. **Investigation**: Automated analysis determines probable cause\n4. **Resolution**: Appropriate correction applied based on discrepancy type\n5. **Verification**: Correction verified through subsequent reconciliation\n6. **Audit**: All discrepancies and resolutions logged for compliance\n\n| Discrepancy Type | Auto-Resolution | Manual Review Required |\n|------------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Missing webhook events | ✓ | Log for pattern analysis |\n| Amount mismatches | ✗ | Always require human review |\n| Status transitions | ✓ | Only for expected transitions |\n| Refund timing differences | ✓ | If within expected settlement window |\n| Unknown charges at provider | ✗ | Potential fraud investigation |\n| Extra local charges | ✗ | Data corruption investigation |\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Reconciliation is not just error correction - it's also fraud detection. Unexpected discrepancies between local and provider state can indicate security breaches or system compromise.\n\n#### Compensation Transaction Patterns\n\nWhen operations span multiple systems and atomic transactions are impossible, compensation transactions provide consistency by implementing logical rollback through inverse operations. Payment systems require sophisticated compensation because financial operations often cannot be simply undone.\n\n**Compensation Strategies by Operation Type:**\n\n| Failed Operation | Compensation Action | Timing Constraints |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Provider charge succeeded, local DB update failed | Update local charge status to match provider | Must complete before user notification |\n| Provider charge failed, local charge marked succeeded | Mark local charge as failed, update intent status | Immediate - prevent double charging |\n| Refund created locally but provider call failed | Cancel local refund, restore charge balance | Before user notification of refund |\n| 3DS authentication completed but confirmation failed | Query provider status, update local accordingly | Within authentication window (10-15 minutes) |\n| Webhook processing partially completed | Replay webhook with idempotency protection | Background processing acceptable |\n\nCompensation transactions must be idempotent themselves, as they may be replayed during recovery scenarios. The compensation logic should also be reversible in case the compensation itself needs to be undone based on new information.\n\n**Compensation Transaction Ordering:**\n\n1. **Immediate Compensation**: Fix issues that could cause immediate user impact or double charging\n2. **Background Compensation**: Handle provider synchronization and reconciliation\n3. **Audit Compensation**: Log all compensation actions for regulatory compliance and debugging\n\nThe compensation system requires comprehensive logging to track the sequence of operations and compensations, enabling debugging of complex failure scenarios and providing audit trails for financial compliance.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling implementation transforms the theoretical failure analysis into concrete Python code that provides robust payment processing even under adverse conditions. This implementation provides complete error handling infrastructure that spans all payment system components.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|\n| Retry Library | `tenacity` with exponential backoff | Custom retry framework with circuit breakers |\n| Circuit Breaker | `pybreaker` library | `circuitbreaker` with custom metrics |\n| Background Jobs | `celery` with Redis broker | `RQ` with Redis or database broker |\n| Monitoring | `structlog` + `prometheus_client` | `OpenTelemetry` with distributed tracing |\n| Error Tracking | `sentry-sdk` for error aggregation | Custom error dashboard with `Grafana` |\n| Database Retries | `SQLAlchemy` with connection pooling | `asyncpg` with custom retry logic |\n\n#### Project Structure Integration\n\n```\npayment-gateway/\n  src/\n    payment_gateway/\n      error_handling/\n        __init__.py              ← Error handling public interface\n        retry_strategies.py      ← Exponential backoff and retry logic\n        circuit_breakers.py      ← Circuit breaker implementations\n        consistency.py           ← Data consistency helpers\n        reconciliation.py        ← State reconciliation logic\n        compensation.py          ← Compensation transaction handlers\n        exceptions.py            ← Custom exception hierarchy\n      core/\n        payment_intents.py       ← Uses retry strategies for provider calls\n        charges.py              ← Uses circuit breakers for external APIs\n        webhooks.py             ← Uses reconciliation for state sync\n      infrastructure/\n        providers.py            ← Provider API clients with error handling\n        database.py             ← Database connection with retry logic\n        monitoring.py           ← Error metrics and alerting\n  tests/\n    error_handling/\n      test_retry_strategies.py  ← Retry behavior validation\n      test_circuit_breakers.py  ← Circuit breaker state transitions\n      test_reconciliation.py    ← Reconciliation accuracy tests\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Code: Retry Strategy Framework\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nComplete retry strategy implementation with exponential backoff and jitter.\nThis provides the foundation for all payment operation retries.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nimport random\nimport time\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Optional, Type, Union\nfrom functools import wraps\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nclass RetryStrategy(Enum):\n    EXPONENTIAL = \"exponential\"\n    FIXED = \"fixed\"\n    LINEAR = \"linear\"\n\n@dataclass\nclass RetryConfig:\n    max_attempts: int\n    initial_delay: float\n    max_delay: float\n    strategy: RetryStrategy\n    jitter: bool = True\n    exponential_base: float = 2.0\n    retryable_exceptions: tuple = (Exception,)\n    \nclass RetryExhaustedException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Raised when all retry attempts are exhausted.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, attempts: int, last_exception: Exception):\n        self.attempts = attempts\n        self.last_exception = last_exception\n        super().__init__(f\"Retry exhausted after {attempts} attempts: {last_exception}\")\n\ndef calculate_delay(attempt: int, config: RetryConfig) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate delay for given attempt number using configured strategy.\"\"\"\n    if config.strategy == RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL:\n        delay = config.initial_delay * (config.exponential_base ** (attempt - 1))\n    elif config.strategy == RetryStrategy.LINEAR:\n        delay = config.initial_delay * attempt\n    else:  #

Milestone Checkpoint: Error Handling Validation\n\nAfter implementing the error handling infrastructure, validate functionality with these checkpoints:\n\n**Retry Strategy Validation:**\n```bash\n# Test exponential backoff behavior\npython -m pytest tests/error_handling/test_retry_strategies.py -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# - Retry attempts with increasing delays\n# - Jitter preventing synchronized retries  \n# - Proper exception handling for terminal vs retryable errors\n# - Configuration validation for different retry strategies\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Validation:**\n```bash\n# Test circuit breaker state transitions\npython -m pytest tests/error_handling/test_circuit_breakers.py -v\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# - Closed -> Open transition after failure threshold\n# - Half-open state allowing limited test calls\n# - Open -> Half-open transition after recovery timeout\n# - Proper exception handling when circuit is open\n```\n\n**Integration Test:**\n```bash\n# Test full payment flow with error injection\npython scripts/test_error_scenarios.py --scenario network_timeout\n\n# Should demonstrate:\n# - Payment processing continues despite network issues\n# - Retry strategies prevent permanent failures for transient issues\n# - Circuit breakers protect system during provider outages\n# - Reconciliation catches and corrects state inconsistencies\n```\n\n**Manual Validation Steps:**\n\n1. **Simulate provider timeout**: Configure test environment with delayed responses, verify retry behavior\n2. **Test circuit breaker activation**: Send requests that consistently fail, verify circuit opens and prevents cascading failures\n3. **Validate reconciliation**: Create state discrepancies in test database, run reconciliation, verify corrections\n4. **Check compensation logic**: Simulate partial failures, verify compensation transactions restore consistency\n\n#### Debugging Tips for Error Handling\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis Steps | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|----------------|-----|\n| Payments timing out frequently | Retry configuration too aggressive | Check retry delay calculations, monitor total processing time | Reduce max attempts or increase delay bounds |\n| Circuit breaker opens unnecessarily | Failure threshold too low | Review error logs for actual vs expected failure rate | Increase failure threshold or improve error classification |\n| Duplicate payment processing | Idempotency key conflicts | Check idempotency key generation and storage | Fix key generation algorithm, add parameter validation |\n| Reconciliation shows persistent discrepancies | Webhook processing failures | Review webhook logs for signature validation and processing errors | Fix webhook signature validation, replay missed events |\n| Memory usage growing over time | Retry state not being cleaned up | Monitor retry attempt tracking and circuit breaker state | Add cleanup for expired retry attempts and old circuit breaker state |\n| Database deadlocks during error recovery | Compensation transactions conflicting | Check transaction isolation levels and lock ordering | Implement consistent lock ordering, use shorter transactions |\n\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones - comprehensive testing strategy covers payment intent & idempotency (Milestone 1), payment processing & 3DS (Milestone 2), refunds & disputes (Milestone 3), and webhook reconciliation (Milestone 4)\n\nTesting a payment processing system presents unique challenges that go far beyond typical web application testing. Think of testing a payment gateway like testing a bank's ATM network - you need to verify not just that money moves correctly under normal conditions, but that the system maintains integrity during network partitions, handles fraud attempts gracefully, and never loses track of a single cent even when external systems fail unexpectedly. The stakes are high: a bug that allows duplicate charges could cost thousands in chargebacks, while a vulnerability that exposes card data could trigger PCI compliance violations and regulatory penalties.\n\nThe mental model for payment system testing combines three distinct testing philosophies. First, **state machine verification** ensures payment intents transition through their lifecycle correctly and can never reach invalid states. Second, **external dependency simulation** validates behavior when payment providers are slow, unavailable, or return unexpected responses. Third, **consistency verification** confirms that money tracking remains accurate across all possible failure scenarios, including partial network failures and race conditions.\n\nPayment systems operate in an eventually consistent distributed environment where webhooks can arrive out of order, network requests can timeout after succeeding on the provider side, and external systems can enter maintenance mode during critical payment flows. Your testing strategy must account for these realities while providing confidence that the core business logic - moving money safely and accurately - remains bulletproof under all conditions.\n\n### Core Test Scenarios\n\nThe foundation of payment system testing rests on comprehensive scenario coverage that spans happy path flows, systematic error injection, and edge case validation. Each test scenario maps to specific business risks and technical failure modes that could compromise payment integrity or user experience.\n\n#### Happy Path Test Categories\n\n**Payment Intent Creation and Management** testing validates the core payment intent lifecycle from creation through completion. These tests verify that payment intents progress through their state machine correctly, that idempotency keys prevent duplicate processing, and that intent expiration cleans up stale records appropriately.\n\n| Test Scenario | Validation Points | Expected Behavior | Risk Mitigated |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Create payment intent with valid parameters | Intent created with correct status, metadata stored, client secret generated | `PaymentIntent` record with status `created`, unique `client_secret`, stored `metadata` | Invalid payment intent creation |\n| Create intent with existing idempotency key | Same response returned, no duplicate intent created | Existing `PaymentIntent` returned, same `client_secret` | Duplicate charge processing |\n| Create intent with reused key but different params | Error response indicating parameter mismatch | HTTP 400 with specific error about idempotency key conflict | Idempotency key abuse |\n| Process payment intent expiration | Expired intents marked as canceled, cleanup completed | Status transitions to `canceled`, database cleanup executed | Resource leaks from stale intents |\n\n**Payment Processing Flow** testing ensures that charge creation, 3D Secure authentication, and payment confirmation work correctly across different payment methods and issuer requirements. These scenarios validate the complete payment journey from payment method tokenization through final settlement.\n\n| Test Scenario | Validation Points | Expected Behavior | Risk Mitigated |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Process card payment without 3DS | Charge created and immediately succeeds | `Charge` with status `succeeded`, settlement details recorded | Basic payment processing failure |\n| Process card payment requiring 3DS | Authentication challenge initiated correctly | `Charge` status `pending`, 3DS redirect URL provided | 3DS flow misconfiguration |\n| Complete 3DS authentication successfully | Payment confirmed after authentication | `Charge` status `succeeded`, authentication details stored | 3DS completion failure |\n| Handle 3DS authentication timeout | Payment fails gracefully with timeout error | `Charge` status `failed`, appropriate error message | 3DS timeout handling |\n| Process payment with invalid card | Validation errors returned appropriately | `Charge` status `failed`, specific decline reason provided | Invalid payment method handling |\n\n#### Error Condition Test Categories\n\n**Network and Provider Failure** testing simulates various failure modes that occur when communicating with external payment providers. These tests ensure the system handles timeouts, service unavailability, and malformed responses without losing payment state or creating inconsistencies.\n\n| Failure Scenario | Injection Method | Expected System Behavior | Recovery Validation |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Provider API timeout during charge creation | Mock provider returns timeout after delay | `Charge` remains in `pending` status, retry scheduled | Retry logic executes with exponential backoff |\n| Provider returns 5xx error | Mock returns HTTP 500 for charge requests | Charge creation fails with retriable error | Circuit breaker triggers after threshold |\n| Network partition during 3DS confirmation | Connection drop simulation during confirm call | Payment state preserved, retry attempted | Reconciliation detects and resolves state mismatch |\n| Malformed webhook payload received | Send invalid JSON to webhook endpoint | Webhook rejected, no state changes made | Signature verification prevents processing |\n| Provider webhook signature mismatch | Send webhook with incorrect HMAC signature | Webhook rejected, security event logged | Prevents webhook spoofing attacks |\n\n**Database and Persistence Failure** testing validates behavior when the underlying data store experiences issues. These scenarios ensure that payment operations maintain ACID properties and that the system can recover gracefully from storage failures.\n\n| Database Failure Mode | Test Setup | Expected Behavior | Consistency Check |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Transaction rollback during payment creation | Force database constraint violation | Payment intent creation fails cleanly | No partial records created |\n| Connection loss during charge processing | Disconnect database mid-transaction | Operation fails, no state corruption | Idempotency allows safe retry |\n| Deadlock during concurrent payment processing | Submit simultaneous payments for same intent | One succeeds, others receive conflict error | Payment intent processed exactly once |\n| Storage full during webhook processing | Fill disk space during event storage | Webhook processing deferred, not lost | Events reprocessed after space recovery |\n\n#### Edge Case Test Categories\n\n**Race Condition and Concurrency** testing exposes timing-dependent bugs that occur when multiple operations interact with the same payment resources simultaneously. These scenarios are critical for ensuring payment integrity under load.\n\n| Race Condition Scenario | Test Implementation | Expected Resolution | Data Integrity Check |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Concurrent payment processing attempts | Submit multiple process requests simultaneously | First request succeeds, others return conflict | Payment intent processed exactly once |\n| Webhook arrival before payment completion | Send success webhook before local charge completes | Webhook processed, local state synchronized | Final state consistent across systems |\n| Simultaneous refund requests | Submit multiple refund requests for same charge | First refund succeeds, others return insufficient funds | Refund amount never exceeds original charge |\n| Payment cancellation during processing | Cancel payment intent while charge is processing | Cancellation queued, processing completes first | Terminal state determined correctly |\n\n**Data Validation and Security** testing ensures that the system properly validates all inputs and maintains security boundaries throughout the payment flow. These tests prevent injection attacks, data corruption, and unauthorized access to sensitive payment information.\n\n| Security Test Category | Attack Vector | Validation Method | Protection Verified |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| SQL injection in payment parameters | Malicious SQL in payment metadata | Parameters properly escaped/parameterized | Database integrity maintained |\n| XSS in webhook payload processing | JavaScript injection in webhook events | Content properly sanitized | No script execution |\n| Payment amount manipulation | Negative amounts, overflow values | Amount validation prevents processing | Invalid amounts rejected |\n| Idempotency key exhaustion | Generate excessive unique keys | Rate limiting and key expiration | Resource exhaustion prevented |\n| Webhook signature bypass | Various signature manipulation attempts | All invalid signatures rejected | Webhook authenticity guaranteed |\n\n> **Testing Philosophy: Fail-Safe Defaults**\n> \n> Every test scenario should validate that failures result in safe default behavior. When in doubt, the system should reject transactions rather than process them incorrectly. A false negative (declining a valid payment) is always preferable to a false positive (accepting an invalid payment) in financial systems.\n\n### Milestone Validation Checkpoints\n\nEach milestone introduces specific capabilities that require targeted validation to ensure proper implementation before proceeding to dependent functionality. These checkpoints provide concrete verification steps that confirm not just functional correctness, but also non-functional requirements like performance, security, and reliability.\n\n#### Milestone 1: Payment Intent & Idempotency Validation\n\nThe first milestone establishes the foundation for all payment processing by implementing payment intent creation with robust idempotency controls. Validation focuses on state management correctness and duplicate prevention mechanisms.\n\n**Functional Validation Checkpoints:**\n\n| Checkpoint | Test Command | Expected Output | Failure Investigation |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Payment intent creation | `curl -X POST /payment-intents -d '{\"amount\": 1000, \"currency\": \"usd\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"` | HTTP 200, JSON response with `id`, `client_secret`, status `created` | Check database constraints, validate amount conversion |\n| Idempotency key handling | Same request with `Idempotency-Key: test-key-123` header twice | First returns 200 with new intent, second returns same response | Verify idempotency key storage, check for duplicate records |\n| Parameter validation | `curl` with invalid currency code \"INVALID\" | HTTP 400 with specific validation error message | Check validation logic, error message formatting |\n| Intent expiration | Create intent, wait past expiration time, run cleanup job | Intent status changes to `canceled`, expired intents removed | Verify cleanup job scheduling, status transition logic |\n\n**State Machine Validation:**\n\nThe payment intent state machine must enforce valid transitions and prevent invalid state changes. This validation ensures that intents cannot reach corrupted states that would break downstream processing.\n\n| Current State | Valid Transitions | Test Method | Expected Behavior |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `created` | → `processing`, `canceled`, `requires_action` | Direct database state updates | Transitions succeed, invalid transitions rejected |\n| `processing` | → `succeeded`, `failed`, `requires_action` | Mock payment processing outcomes | State updates correctly based on processing result |\n| `requires_action` | → `processing`, `canceled` | Simulate 3DS completion or timeout | Authentication flow updates state appropriately |\n| `succeeded` | No transitions allowed (terminal) | Attempt to modify succeeded intent | All modification attempts rejected |\n| `canceled` | No transitions allowed (terminal) | Attempt to process canceled intent | Processing requests return appropriate error |\n\n**Data Consistency Validation:**\n\nPayment intent data must remain consistent across all system components, with proper referential integrity and audit trail maintenance.\n\n```bash\n# Database consistency check script\npython scripts/validate_milestone1.py --check-consistency\n\n# Expected output:\n# ✓ All payment intents have valid status values\n# ✓ All idempotency keys have corresponding intents\n# ✓ No orphaned idempotency records found\n# ✓ All client secrets are properly formatted UUIDs\n# ✓ Intent metadata validates against schema\n```\n\n#### Milestone 2: Payment Processing & 3DS Validation\n\nThe second milestone adds payment execution capabilities with 3D Secure authentication support. Validation emphasizes provider integration correctness and authentication flow reliability.\n\n**Payment Processing Flow Validation:**\n\n| Processing Stage | Validation Command | Success Criteria | Debugging Steps |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Payment method tokenization | `POST /payment-intents/{id}/process` with card details | Returns payment method token, no raw card data stored | Check tokenization API calls, verify PCI compliance |\n| Charge creation | Process payment with valid tokenized method | `Charge` record created with `pending` status | Review provider API logs, check request formatting |\n| 3DS authentication | Submit payment requiring Strong Customer Authentication | Returns authentication challenge URL | Validate 3DS detection logic, check issuer requirements |\n| Authentication completion | Complete 3DS flow with valid authentication | `Charge` status updates to `succeeded` | Verify authentication validation, check provider callbacks |\n\n**3D Secure Flow Integration:**\n\nThe 3D Secure authentication flow involves multiple redirects and callbacks that must be validated end-to-end to ensure users can complete authentication successfully.\n\n| 3DS Flow Stage | Test Scenario | Expected Behavior | Error Handling |\n|----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Challenge detection | Process payment requiring 3DS | Returns `requires_action` with challenge parameters | Non-3DS payments proceed directly |\n| Authentication redirect | User redirects to issuer authentication page | Valid authentication URL with proper parameters | Invalid URLs cause graceful failure |\n| Return URL handling | User completes authentication and returns | Payment processing resumes with authentication token | Malformed returns rejected safely |\n| Authentication timeout | User abandons authentication flow | Payment fails with timeout after configured period | Timeout handling prevents resource leaks |\n\n**Provider Integration Validation:**\n\nExternal payment provider integration must handle various response scenarios correctly while maintaining local state consistency.\n\n```python\n# Provider integration test runner\npython -m pytest tests/integration/payment_processing/ -v\n\n# Expected test results:\n# test_successful_payment_processing PASSED\n# test_payment_requires_3ds_authentication PASSED  \n# test_payment_declined_by_issuer PASSED\n# test_provider_timeout_handling PASSED\n# test_network_error_retry_logic PASSED\n# test_malformed_provider_response PASSED\n```\n\n#### Milestone 3: Refunds & Disputes Validation\n\nThe third milestone implements payment reversals through refunds and dispute handling mechanisms. Validation focuses on money movement accuracy and chargeback processing correctness.\n\n**Refund Processing Validation:**\n\n| Refund Type | Test Scenario | Validation Points | Edge Case Handling |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Full refund | Refund entire charge amount | `Refund` created with correct amount, charge marked as refunded | Cannot refund more than original amount |\n| Partial refund | Refund portion of charge amount | Remaining balance tracked correctly, multiple partials allowed | Total refunds cannot exceed charge |\n| Duplicate refund | Submit same refund request twice with idempotency | Second request returns existing refund, no double processing | Idempotency prevents over-refunding |\n| Refund timing | Refund immediately vs. after settlement | Both scenarios processed correctly with appropriate provider calls | Settlement status affects refund type |\n\n**Dispute and Chargeback Workflow:**\n\nDispute handling requires integration with payment network notifications and evidence submission processes that must be validated against realistic chargeback scenarios.\n\n| Dispute Stage | Validation Method | Expected System Response | Manual Verification |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| Chargeback notification | Simulate webhook from payment provider | Dispute record created, status set to `warning_needs_response` | Check dispute reason code processing |\n| Evidence submission | Submit dispute evidence through API | Evidence attached to dispute, status updated appropriately | Verify evidence formatting requirements |\n| Dispute resolution | Process final dispute outcome webhook | Final status recorded, accounting entries balanced | Confirm win/loss handling accuracy |\n\n**Money Movement Accuracy:**\n\nAll refund and dispute operations must maintain accurate accounting with proper audit trails and balance reconciliation.\n\n```bash\n# Financial accuracy validation\npython scripts/validate_milestone3.py --verify-accounting\n\n# Expected accounting validation:\n# ✓ All refunds sum to <= original charge amount\n# ✓ Dispute fees properly recorded and tracked  \n# ✓ No orphaned refund records without parent charges\n# ✓ All money movements have corresponding audit entries\n# ✓ Balance calculations match provider records\n```\n\n#### Milestone 4: Webhook Reconciliation Validation\n\nThe final milestone implements reliable webhook processing with signature verification and state reconciliation. Validation emphasizes security, reliability, and eventual consistency guarantees.\n\n**Webhook Security Validation:**\n\n| Security Aspect | Test Method | Pass Criteria | Security Implication |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| HMAC signature verification | Send webhooks with various signature values | Only valid signatures processed | Prevents webhook spoofing |\n| Payload tampering detection | Modify webhook payload after signing | Modified payloads rejected | Ensures data integrity |\n| Replay attack prevention | Resend old webhook with valid signature | Old webhooks rejected based on timestamp | Prevents replay attacks |\n| Source IP validation | Send webhooks from unauthorized IP addresses | Unauthorized sources blocked | Additional security layer |\n\n**Event Processing Reliability:**\n\nWebhook processing must handle various delivery scenarios including duplicates, out-of-order events, and processing failures while maintaining exactly-once processing semantics.\n\n| Processing Scenario | Test Implementation | Expected Behavior | Reliability Guarantee |\n|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Duplicate webhook delivery | Send identical webhook multiple times | First processes successfully, duplicates ignored | Exactly-once processing |\n| Out-of-order event arrival | Send events with non-sequential timestamps | Events processed correctly regardless of arrival order | Temporal consistency maintained |\n| Processing failure retry | Simulate processing failure during event handling | Failed events retry with exponential backoff | No events lost to transient failures |\n| Webhook endpoint downtime | Disable webhook endpoint temporarily | Provider retries delivery, events processed after recovery | High availability maintained |\n\n**State Reconciliation Accuracy:**\n\nReconciliation processes must detect and resolve discrepancies between local payment state and external provider records while maintaining audit trails of all corrections.\n\n```python\n# Reconciliation validation suite\npython -m pytest tests/integration/reconciliation/ --verbose\n\n# Key reconciliation test results:\n# test_detect_local_vs_provider_discrepancies PASSED\n# test_resolve_status_mismatches PASSED  \n# test_handle_missing_local_records PASSED\n# test_process_provider_only_events PASSED\n# test_reconciliation_audit_trail PASSED\n# test_batch_reconciliation_performance PASSED\n```\n\n**End-to-End Payment Journey Validation:**\n\nThe complete payment flow from intent creation through webhook confirmation must work seamlessly across all implemented milestones.\n\n| E2E Test Scenario | Journey Steps | Success Metrics | Integration Points |\n|-------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Successful payment with 3DS | Create intent → Process payment → Complete 3DS → Receive webhook | Payment succeeds, all states consistent | All 4 milestones integrated |\n| Failed payment with refund | Create intent → Process payment → Payment fails → Issue refund | Proper error handling, refund processed | Milestones 1, 2, 3 integrated |\n| Disputed payment resolution | Successful payment → Chargeback webhook → Evidence submission → Resolution | Dispute handled correctly, accounting accurate | Milestones 1, 2, 3, 4 integrated |\n\n> **Validation Philosophy: Trust but Verify**\n> \n> While automated tests validate functional correctness, manual verification of critical flows ensures that the system behaves correctly from a user perspective. Each milestone should include manual testing scripts that simulate realistic user journeys and business scenarios.\n\n### Mock Payment Provider Setup\n\nTesting payment systems requires sophisticated mock implementations that simulate external payment providers with realistic behaviors, error conditions, and timing characteristics. The mock provider must balance simplicity for development with fidelity to real provider behaviors for meaningful testing.\n\n#### Mock Provider Architecture Decision\n\n> **Decision: Configurable Mock Provider with Scenario Support**\n> - **Context**: Payment testing requires simulating various provider responses, error conditions, and timing behaviors without depending on external services or incurring transaction costs.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Simple static responses for all requests\n>   2. Configurable mock with scenario-based responses  \n>   3. Record-and-replay proxy to real provider\n> - **Decision**: Configurable mock provider with scenario-based response control\n> - **Rationale**: Provides deterministic testing while supporting complex scenarios like 3DS flows, timeouts, and error conditions. More reliable than proxy approach and more flexible than static responses.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires maintenance to keep mock behavior aligned with real provider changes, but enables comprehensive testing without external dependencies.\n\nThe mock provider implementation follows a scenario-driven architecture where test cases configure expected behaviors before execution. This approach enables testing complex multi-step flows like 3D Secure authentication while maintaining predictable test outcomes.\n\n#### Mock Provider Implementation Strategy\n\n**Core Mock Provider Components:**\n\n| Component | Responsibility | Configuration Method | Behavioral Scope |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Scenario Manager | Maintains test scenario configurations | JSON configuration files or API calls | Defines expected request/response patterns |\n| Response Generator | Creates realistic provider responses | Template-based with parameter substitution | Generates valid payment provider responses |\n| Timing Simulator | Introduces realistic delays and timeouts | Configurable delay ranges and timeout probabilities | Simulates network latency and provider processing time |\n| State Tracker | Maintains mock payment state across requests | In-memory state store with persistence option | Tracks payment lifecycle for multi-step flows |\n| Error Injector | Simulates various failure modes | Probability-based error injection rules | Creates realistic failure scenarios |\n\n**Mock Provider Interface Design:**\n\nThe mock provider implements the same interface as real payment providers, ensuring that production code remains unchanged during testing while providing extensive configurability for test scenarios.\n\n| Mock API Endpoint | Real Provider Equivalent | Configurable Behaviors | Test Scenario Support |\n|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| `POST /v1/payment_intents` | Payment intent creation | Success/failure rates, response delays | Intent creation testing |\n| `POST /v1/payment_intents/{id}/confirm` | Payment confirmation | 3DS requirements, decline reasons | Payment processing testing |\n| `GET /v1/payment_intents/{id}` | Payment status retrieval | State transitions, timing variations | Status polling testing |\n| `POST /v1/refunds` | Refund processing | Refund approval/decline logic | Refund workflow testing |\n| `POST /v1/webhooks/test` | Webhook delivery simulation | Event types, delivery timing, failures | Webhook handling testing |\n\n#### Test Scenario Configuration\n\n**Scenario Definition Structure:**\n\nMock provider scenarios define expected request patterns and corresponding response behaviors using a structured configuration format that supports complex multi-step payment flows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scenario_name\": \"successful_payment_with_3ds\",\n  \"description\": \"Payment requiring 3D Secure authentication that completes successfully\",\n  \"request_patterns\": [\n    {\n      \"method\": \"POST\",\n      \"endpoint\": \"/v1/payment_intents/{id}/confirm\", \n      \"expected_params\": {\"payment_method\": \"card_*\"},\n      \"response\": {\n        \"status\": \"requires_action\",\n        \"next_action\": {\n          \"type\": \"use_stripe_sdk\",\n          \"use_stripe_sdk\": {\n            \"type\": \"three_d_secure_redirect\",\n            \"stripe_js\": \"https://js.stripe.com/v3/\"\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"delay_ms\": [100, 500]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"webhook_events\": [\n    {\n      \"event_type\": \"payment_intent.succeeded\",\n      \"delay_after_request\": 2000,\n      \"payload_template\": \"payment_success_webhook.json\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Dynamic Scenario Management:**\n\nTest cases can modify scenario configurations during execution to simulate changing conditions or multi-phase payment flows that require different behaviors at different stages.\n\n| Configuration Method | Use Case | Implementation | Flexibility Level |\n|---------------------|----------|---------------|------------------|\n| Static JSON files | Standard test scenarios | Load configuration at test startup | Medium - requires file changes |\n| Runtime API calls | Dynamic test scenarios | HTTP API to modify mock behavior | High - programmatic control |\n| Test framework integration | Framework-driven scenarios | Pytest fixtures and parameterization | High - declarative test definition |\n| Environment variables | Simple behavior toggles | Environment-based configuration | Low - basic on/off switches |\n\n#### Realistic Error Simulation\n\n**Error Injection Patterns:**\n\nThe mock provider must simulate realistic error conditions that occur in production payment processing, including network issues, provider-side failures, and edge cases that are difficult to reproduce with real providers.\n\n| Error Category | Simulation Method | Realistic Triggers | Test Coverage |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| Network timeouts | Configurable response delays exceeding client timeouts | Random delays, connection drops | Timeout handling, retry logic |\n| Provider errors | HTTP 5xx responses with realistic error messages | Rate limiting, maintenance windows | Error handling, circuit breaker logic |\n| Authentication failures | Invalid signature or credential errors | Expired keys, malformed requests | Security validation, error reporting |\n| Rate limiting | HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers | Request frequency thresholds | Backoff logic, request throttling |\n| Malformed responses | Invalid JSON or missing required fields | Schema violations, partial responses | Response validation, error recovery |\n\n**Probabilistic Error Injection:**\n\nRather than deterministic errors, the mock provider supports probability-based error injection that creates realistic failure patterns similar to production environments.\n\n```yaml\nerror_injection:\n  network_timeouts:\n    probability: 0.02  # 2% of requests timeout\n    min_delay_ms: 30000\n    max_delay_ms: 60000\n  \n  provider_errors:\n    probability: 0.01  # 1% of requests return 500 errors\n    error_codes: [500, 502, 503, 504]\n    retry_after_seconds: [30, 60, 120]\n  \n  rate_limiting:\n    requests_per_minute: 100\n    burst_limit: 10\n    reset_window_seconds: 60\n```\n\n#### 3D Secure Flow Simulation\n\n**Multi-Step Authentication Mock:**\n\n3D Secure authentication requires a complex multi-step flow involving redirects, authentication challenges, and callback handling that must be accurately simulated for comprehensive testing.\n\n| 3DS Flow Stage | Mock Implementation | Test Validation | User Experience Simulation |\n|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| Authentication detection | Return `requires_action` for configured card patterns | Verify challenge detection logic | Realistic issuer requirements |\n| Challenge presentation | Generate mock authentication URLs | Test redirect URL generation | Simulated issuer authentication page |\n| User authentication | Mock user completing authentication challenge | Validate return URL handling | Various authentication outcomes |\n| Flow completion | Process authentication result and complete payment | Test final payment confirmation | Success/failure result handling |\n\n**3DS Test Scenario Configuration:**\n\nThe mock provider supports various 3D Secure scenarios including successful authentication, user abandonment, issuer errors, and network failures during the authentication flow.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"3ds_scenarios\": {\n    \"successful_authentication\": {\n      \"challenge_required\": true,\n      \"authentication_delay_ms\": 1500,\n      \"authentication_result\": \"authenticated\",\n      \"final_payment_status\": \"succeeded\"\n    },\n    \"user_abandonment\": {\n      \"challenge_required\": true,\n      \"authentication_timeout_ms\": 300000,\n      \"authentication_result\": \"abandoned\", \n      \"final_payment_status\": \"failed\"\n    },\n    \"issuer_error\": {\n      \"challenge_required\": true,\n      \"authentication_delay_ms\": 800,\n      \"authentication_result\": \"error\",\n      \"error_code\": \"authentication_failed\",\n      \"final_payment_status\": \"failed\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Webhook Delivery Simulation\n\n**Asynchronous Event Delivery:**\n\nWebhook simulation must accurately model the asynchronous nature of real payment provider webhooks, including delivery timing, retry behavior, and out-of-order event arrival.\n\n| Webhook Aspect | Simulation Approach | Configuration Options | Testing Benefit |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Delivery timing | Configurable delays after triggering events | Random delays, fixed delays, sequential timing | Tests asynchronous processing |\n| Retry behavior | Exponential backoff on endpoint failures | Retry counts, backoff multipliers, max delays | Validates retry handling |\n| Event ordering | Intentional out-of-order delivery | Timestamp manipulation, delivery reordering | Tests event ordering logic |\n| Signature generation | HMAC signing with configurable keys | Multiple signing keys, invalid signatures | Validates signature verification |\n| Payload variations | Different payload formats for same events | Schema versions, optional field variations | Tests payload parsing robustness |\n\n**Webhook Test Orchestration:**\n\nTest cases can orchestrate complex webhook delivery scenarios that simulate real-world conditions including network issues, endpoint downtime, and provider-side delivery problems.\n\n```python\n# Webhook test orchestration example\nwebhook_simulator = MockWebhookDelivery()\n\n# Configure delivery behavior for test\nwebhook_simulator.configure_scenario({\n    \"event_type\": \"payment_intent.succeeded\",\n    \"delivery_attempts\": 3,\n    \"backoff_strategy\": \"exponential\",\n    \"initial_delay_ms\": 1000,\n    \"max_delay_ms\": 30000,\n    \"out_of_order_probability\": 0.1\n})\n\n# Trigger webhook delivery\nwebhook_simulator.deliver_event(payment_intent_id, event_data)\n\n# Verify eventual delivery and processing\nassert webhook_simulator.verify_delivery_success(timeout_seconds=60)\n```\n\n> **Mock Provider Fidelity Principle**\n> \n> The mock provider should be sophisticated enough to catch real integration bugs while remaining simple enough to maintain reliably. Focus on simulating the behaviors that matter most for your system's correctness rather than perfect provider fidelity.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nTesting payment systems requires a multi-layered approach combining unit tests for individual components, integration tests for external dependencies, and end-to-end tests for complete payment flows.

Think of debugging a payment gateway like being a detective investigating a crime scene - you need to collect evidence from multiple sources, understand the timeline of events, and piece together what happened when things go wrong. Unlike simple web applications where errors are often isolated to a single component, payment systems involve intricate dances between your application, external payment providers, card networks, and issuing banks. A single payment can touch dozens of systems, each with their own failure modes and timing constraints.\n\nThe complexity multiplies when you consider that payment processing is inherently asynchronous - a charge might appear to succeed locally but fail at the network level hours later, or a webhook might arrive out of order, causing your local state to diverge from reality. This section provides a systematic approach to diagnosing and resolving the most common issues encountered when building production payment systems.\n\n![Payment Error Handling Decision Tree](./diagrams/error-handling-flowchart.svg)\n\n### Common Payment Processing Bugs\n\nPayment processing bugs typically fall into three categories: idempotency violations, state management inconsistencies, and provider integration failures. Each category has distinct symptoms and requires different debugging approaches.\n\n#### Idempotency Implementation Issues\n\nIdempotency bugs are among the most dangerous in payment systems because they can lead to duplicate charges - the cardinal sin of payment processing. These issues often manifest subtly and may not be detected until customers report unexpected charges.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of idempotency like a notary's seal on a legal document. Once a document is notarized with a specific seal number, using that same seal number again should either return the exact same document or reject the request entirely. You can't create a different document with the same seal - that would be forgery.\n\nThe most common idempotency pitfall occurs when developers focus only on preventing duplicate database inserts but fail to validate that the new request parameters match the original request. This creates a dangerous scenario where a client can reuse an idempotency key with different payment parameters and receive the response from the original request, leading to confusion about which payment was actually processed.\n\n| Symptom | Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Resolution |\n|---------|------------|------------------|------------|\n| Same idempotency key returns success but amount differs | Request parameter validation missing | Check `IdempotencyKey.request_hash` against current request | Add parameter hash validation before returning cached response |\n| Duplicate charges appearing in provider dashboard | Race condition in idempotency check | Search logs for concurrent requests with same key | Add unique constraint on idempotency_key field |\n| Client receives 500 error but payment succeeds | Exception after payment creation but before response | Check if `PaymentIntent` exists for the idempotency key | Return existing payment intent instead of creating new one |\n| Idempotency key reuse fails after 24 hours | Idempotency record cleanup too aggressive | Verify `IdempotencyKey.expires_at` timestamp | Extend expiration or add grace period for completed payments |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Request Fingerprinting**\nMany developers hash only the amount and currency when creating the request fingerprint, but miss crucial parameters like `payment_method_token` or `return_url`. If a client reuses an idempotency key with a different payment method, they'll receive the response from the original payment but the actual charge will use the original payment method, not the one in the current request.\n\nThe request hash should include all parameters that affect payment processing outcome:\n\n```python\ndef generate_request_hash(amount, currency, payment_method_token, metadata, return_url):\n    \"\"\"Generate deterministic hash of all parameters affecting payment outcome\"\"\"\n    # Include ALL parameters that change payment behavior\n    hash_input = f\"{amount}:{currency}:{payment_method_token}:{json.dumps(metadata, sort_keys=True)}:{return_url}\"\n    return hashlib.sha256(hash_input.encode()).hexdigest()\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions During High Traffic**\nUnder concurrent load, multiple threads might simultaneously check for an existing idempotency key, find none, and proceed to create duplicate payment intents. This happens when the idempotency check and payment creation are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction.\n\nThe solution requires using database-level uniqueness constraints combined with proper exception handling:\n\n```sql\n-- Add unique constraint to prevent race conditions\nALTER TABLE idempotency_keys ADD CONSTRAINT uk_idempotency_key UNIQUE (idempotency_key);\n```\n\n#### State Management Consistency Bugs\n\nPayment state management bugs arise from the complex lifecycle of payment processing, where multiple entities (`PaymentIntent`, `Charge`, `Refund`) transition through various states in response to external events. These bugs often manifest as payments stuck in intermediate states or illegal state transitions.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of payment state management like air traffic control. Each payment is like an aircraft that must move through specific waypoints (states) in a predetermined sequence. Air traffic controllers (your state machine) must ensure planes don't skip waypoints or attempt impossible maneuvers. Just as two planes can't occupy the same airspace, a payment can't be in multiple contradictory states simultaneously.\n\n| Current State | Invalid Transition | Symptom | Diagnostic Query |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------|------------------|\n| `succeeded` | → `processing` | Payment appears to restart after completion | `SELECT * FROM charges WHERE status = 'processing' AND updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'` |\n| `requires_action` | → `succeeded` | Payment bypasses 3DS authentication | `SELECT * FROM payment_intents WHERE status = 'succeeded' AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM charges WHERE payment_intent_id = payment_intents.id)` |\n| `canceled` | → any active state | Canceled payment becomes active | `SELECT * FROM payment_intents WHERE status != 'canceled' AND expires_at < NOW()` |\n| `pending` | → `succeeded` without provider confirmation | Charge marked successful before provider webhook | `SELECT * FROM charges WHERE status = 'succeeded' AND network_transaction_id IS NULL` |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Webhook-Driven State Transitions Without Validation**\nA common mistake is allowing webhooks to transition payment states without validating that the transition is legal. For example, receiving a `charge.succeeded` webhook for a payment that's still in `created` status should raise an alert - successful charges must pass through `processing` status first.\n\nImplement state transition validation in webhook handlers:\n\n```python\ndef can_transition_to(current_status: PaymentIntentStatus, new_status: PaymentIntentStatus) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Validate legal state transitions for payment intents\"\"\"\n    valid_transitions = {\n        PaymentIntentStatus.CREATED: [PaymentIntentStatus.REQUIRES_ACTION, PaymentIntentStatus.PROCESSING, PaymentIntentStatus.CANCELED],\n        PaymentIntentStatus.REQUIRES_ACTION: [PaymentIntentStatus.PROCESSING, PaymentIntentStatus.CANCELED],\n        PaymentIntentStatus.PROCESSING: [PaymentIntentStatus.SUCCEEDED, PaymentIntentStatus.CANCELED],\n        PaymentIntentStatus.SUCCEEDED: [],  # Terminal state\n        PaymentIntentStatus.CANCELED: []    # Terminal state\n    }\n    return new_status in valid_transitions.get(current_status, [])\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Payment Intent Expiration**\nPayment intents have limited lifespans (typically 24 hours), but many implementations forget to handle expiration properly. Expired payment intents should automatically transition to `canceled` status, but if this cleanup doesn't happen, you'll accumulate stale payments that confuse reconciliation processes.\n\n#### Provider Integration Failures\n\nIntegration failures with external payment providers are inevitable in production systems. Networks fail, providers experience outages, and API rate limits are exceeded. The key is distinguishing between transient failures that warrant retries and permanent failures that require different handling.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of provider integration like international shipping. Sometimes packages get delayed due to weather (transient failure) - you wait and they eventually arrive. Sometimes packages get lost or damaged (permanent failure) - you need to file insurance claims and send replacements. The trick is knowing which situation you're in without opening every package to check.\n\n| Error Code Pattern | Failure Type | Retry Strategy | Resolution Actions |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| `502`, `503`, `504` HTTP errors | Provider infrastructure issue | Exponential backoff up to 5 attempts | Check provider status page, enable circuit breaker |\n| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limiting | Linear backoff with jitter | Implement request queuing, review rate limits |\n| `400 Invalid Request` | Client integration bug | No retry | Log full request/response, fix parameter validation |\n| `401 Unauthorized` | API credential issue | No retry | Rotate API keys, check credential expiration |\n| Network timeout | Connectivity issue | Exponential backoff up to 3 attempts | Check network connectivity, verify DNS resolution |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Retrying Non-Idempotent Operations**\nNot all payment provider operations are safe to retry. Creating a new charge is typically idempotent (using provider-level idempotency keys), but operations like refund creation might not be. Retrying a refund request could result in duplicate refunds if the original request succeeded but the response was lost due to network issues.\n\nAlways check provider documentation for idempotency guarantees:\n\n```python\n# Safe to retry - includes idempotency key\nstripe.PaymentIntent.create(\n    amount=1000,\n    currency='usd',\n    idempotency_key=f\"pi_{payment_intent.id}\"  # Provider-level idempotency\n)\n\n# Potentially unsafe to retry without additional checks\nstripe.Refund.create(charge=charge_id, amount=500)  # Check if refund already exists\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Error Context Logging**\nWhen provider API calls fail, logging only the error code and message isn't sufficient for debugging. You need the complete context: request parameters, response headers, timing information, and correlation IDs.\n\n### Webhook Debugging Techniques\n\nWebhook debugging requires a different mindset than traditional API debugging because you're dealing with asynchronous, push-based communication where you have limited control over timing and delivery guarantees. Webhook failures often compound over time, creating cascading inconsistencies that become harder to resolve as they age.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of webhook debugging like investigating a postal delivery failure. You need to verify that the sender actually sent the package (check provider logs), that it arrived at your address (check your server logs), that the signature matches the sender (verify HMAC), and that you processed it correctly (check your application state). If any step fails, you need different recovery strategies.\n\n#### Webhook Delivery Verification\n\nThe first step in webhook debugging is confirming that webhooks are actually being sent by the provider and received by your system. Many apparent webhook failures are actually network or infrastructure issues.\n\n| Verification Step | Where to Check | What to Look For | Common Issues |\n|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|\n| Provider sent webhook | Provider dashboard/logs | Webhook delivery attempts, HTTP response codes | Provider not configured for your endpoint |\n| Webhook reached your server | Load balancer/proxy logs | HTTP POST requests to webhook endpoint | Firewall blocking, DNS misconfiguration |\n| Application received webhook | Application access logs | Requests with proper User-Agent, content-type | Application crashed, endpoint not mounted |\n| Signature verification passed | Application error logs | HMAC validation errors | Wrong signing secret, clock skew issues |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Clock Skew Affecting Signature Verification**\nWebhook signatures often include timestamps to prevent replay attacks, but clock skew between your server and the provider's servers can cause valid webhooks to be rejected. Most providers allow a tolerance window (typically 5-10 minutes), but this can be problematic in containerized environments where system clocks drift.\n\n```python\ndef verify_signature(payload, signature_header, tolerance_seconds=300):\n    \"\"\"Verify webhook signature with clock skew tolerance\"\"\"\n    current_time = int(time.time())\n    \n    # Parse timestamp from signature header\n    timestamp = extract_timestamp_from_signature(signature_header)\n    \n    # Check if timestamp is within tolerance window\n    if abs(current_time - timestamp) > tolerance_seconds:\n        logger.warning(f\"Webhook timestamp {timestamp} outside tolerance window\")\n        # Don't immediately reject - log for monitoring but allow processing\n    \n    # Continue with HMAC verification...\n```\n\n#### Signature Verification Issues\n\nHMAC signature verification is critical for webhook security, but it's also a common source of integration bugs. These issues often appear intermittently, making them particularly challenging to debug.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of HMAC verification like checking a tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle. The seal uses a special pattern that only the manufacturer knows how to create, but anyone can verify it's authentic. If the seal is broken, missing, or doesn't match the expected pattern, you know something's wrong - but you need to figure out if the problem is with the seal creation, delivery, or your verification process.\n\n| Verification Failure | Likely Cause | Debugging Steps | Resolution |\n|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| All webhooks fail signature check | Wrong signing secret | Compare secret with provider dashboard | Update webhook signing secret |\n| Intermittent signature failures | Payload modification in transit | Log raw payload bytes, check middleware | Disable payload modification middleware |\n| Signature valid but payload corrupted | Character encoding issues | Check Content-Type header, log hex dump | Ensure UTF-8 handling throughout stack |\n| Signature fails only for specific events | Event-specific payload format | Compare working vs failing event structures | Update signature computation for edge cases |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Middleware Modifying Webhook Payloads**\nMany web frameworks include middleware that automatically processes request bodies - decompressing gzip content, normalizing line endings, or parsing JSON. This processing can alter the raw bytes used for signature computation, causing verification failures even when the webhook is legitimate.\n\nThe solution is to capture the raw request body before any middleware processing:\n\n```python\n@app.before_request\ndef capture_raw_webhook_body():\n    \"\"\"Capture raw request body for signature verification\"\"\"\n    if request.path == '/webhooks/payment':\n        # Store raw bytes before any framework processing\n        g.raw_body = request.get_data()\n\ndef verify_webhook_signature(signature_header):\n    \"\"\"Verify signature using unmodified request body\"\"\"\n    raw_payload = g.raw_body  # Use captured raw bytes, not request.json\n    return hmac.compare_digest(\n        expected_signature,\n        compute_signature(raw_payload, webhook_secret)\n    )\n```\n\n#### Event Processing Failures\n\nEven after successful delivery and signature verification, webhook event processing can fail due to application logic errors, database constraints, or race conditions between multiple events.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of event processing like a factory assembly line. Raw materials (webhook events) arrive at your facility and must be processed through various stations (validation, deduplication, state updates) to produce finished goods (updated payment state). If any station breaks down or processes materials in the wrong order, the entire production line backs up.\n\n| Processing Stage | Failure Symptoms | Diagnostic Queries | Recovery Actions |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Event deduplication | Duplicate processing effects | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM webhook_events WHERE deduplication_key = ?` | Strengthen deduplication logic, check for race conditions |\n| Event ordering | State inconsistencies | `SELECT * FROM webhook_events WHERE payment_intent_id = ? ORDER BY created_at` | Implement event sequencing, reject out-of-order events |\n| Database constraints | Constraint violation errors | Check foreign key and unique constraint violations | Implement proper error handling, add missing validation |\n| Concurrent processing | Lost updates, race conditions | Look for simultaneous webhook processing attempts | Add row-level locking, implement event serialization |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Processing Events Out of Order**\nPayment providers don't guarantee webhook delivery order, so events can arrive out of sequence. For example, you might receive a `charge.succeeded` event before the corresponding `payment_intent.processing` event. Processing these out of order can leave your system in an inconsistent state.\n\nImplement event sequencing based on timestamps:\n\n```python\ndef process_webhook_event(webhook_event):\n    \"\"\"Process webhook events in chronological order\"\"\"\n    payment_intent_id = webhook_event.payload['data']['object']['id']\n    \n    # Check for newer events already processed\n    latest_processed_event = db.query(WebhookEvent).filter(\n        WebhookEvent.payment_intent_id == payment_intent_id,\n        WebhookEvent.processed_at.is_not(None)\n    ).order_by(WebhookEvent.created_at.desc()).first()\n    \n    if latest_processed_event and latest_processed_event.created_at > webhook_event.created_at:\n        logger.info(f\"Skipping out-of-order event {webhook_event.id}\")\n        return\n    \n    # Process event...\n```\n\n### State Inconsistency Diagnosis\n\nState inconsistencies between your local payment records and the payment provider's records are among the most serious issues in payment processing. These discrepancies can lead to accounting errors, compliance violations, and customer disputes. The key to resolving them is systematic detection, classification, and remediation.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of state reconciliation like balancing a checkbook against bank statements. Your local records are like your checkbook register - they reflect what you think happened based on the transactions you recorded. The provider's records are like the bank statement - the authoritative source of truth about what actually occurred. When they don't match, you need to investigate each discrepancy to understand why and correct your records.\n\n#### Systematic State Comparison\n\nEffective reconciliation requires comparing multiple dimensions of payment state: amounts, status values, timestamps, and reference identifiers. Each type of discrepancy indicates different root causes and requires different resolution strategies.\n\n| Discrepancy Type | Detection Method | Common Causes | Resolution Priority |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Status mismatch | Compare `PaymentIntent.status` with provider status | Missed webhooks, processing delays | High - affects customer experience |\n| Amount discrepancy | Compare `Charge.amount` with provider charge amount | Currency conversion, fee handling | Critical - affects financial reconciliation |\n| Missing local record | Provider charge exists but no local `Charge` record | Webhook processing failure, system downtime | High - revenue recognition impact |\n| Missing provider record | Local `Charge` exists but provider has no record | Failed API call, test vs production mixup | Critical - potential duplicate processing |\n| Timestamp drift | Compare processing timestamps | Clock skew, timezone differences | Medium - affects reporting accuracy |\n\nThe reconciliation process should run at multiple intervals: real-time validation during webhook processing, hourly checks for recent transactions, and comprehensive daily reconciliation for the previous 7 days.\n\n```python\nclass ReconciliationRun:\n    \"\"\"Represents a reconciliation execution with its results\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, run_type: str, lookback_days: int):\n        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        self.run_type = run_type  # 'realtime', 'hourly', 'daily'\n        self.lookback_days = lookback_days\n        self.started_at = datetime.utcnow()\n        self.processed_count = 0\n        self.discrepancy_count = 0\n        self.error_count = 0\n        self.status = 'running'\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Reconciliation During Provider Maintenance Windows**\nPayment providers occasionally experience service disruptions or perform maintenance that affects their API responses. Running reconciliation during these windows can generate false discrepancies and trigger unnecessary alerts. Always check provider status pages and implement exponential backoff when API calls fail.\n\n#### Discrepancy Classification and Auto-Resolution\n\nNot all discrepancies require manual intervention. Many can be automatically resolved based on the type of mismatch and the age of the records involved. However, automatic resolution must be conservative - it's better to flag a discrepancy for manual review than to automatically apply an incorrect fix.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of discrepancy resolution like medical triage. Some issues (like a missing webhook that just arrived late) are minor and can be treated immediately. Others (like a significant amount discrepancy) are serious and need specialist attention. The triage system routes each case to the appropriate treatment path based on severity and confidence in the diagnosis.\n\n| Discrepancy Pattern | Auto-Resolution Conditions | Resolution Action | Manual Review Required |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Local status behind provider | Age < 1 hour, valid state transition | Update local status to match provider | No |\n| Missing webhook event | Provider event exists, local record missing | Replay event processing | No |\n| Amount mismatch < 1% | Likely currency conversion/rounding | Update local amount, log adjustment | Yes - for audit trail |\n| Provider refund not in local DB | Refund amount ≤ original charge | Create local refund record | Yes - verify legitimacy |\n| Status conflict (both non-terminal) | Provider timestamp > local timestamp | Defer to provider state | Yes - investigate cause |\n\n```python\ndef _resolve_discrepancy(discrepancy: ReconciliationDiscrepancy, db: Session):\n    \"\"\"Automatically resolve discrepancies when safe to do so\"\"\"\n    if discrepancy.field_name == 'status':\n        local_status = discrepancy.local_value['status']\n        provider_status = discrepancy.provider_value['status']\n        \n        # Safe to auto-resolve if it's a valid forward transition\n        if can_transition_to(local_status, provider_status):\n            payment_intent = db.query(PaymentIntent).get(discrepancy.payment_intent_id)\n            payment_intent.status = provider_status\n            payment_intent.updated_at = datetime.utcnow()\n            \n            discrepancy.resolution_action = f\"Updated status from {local_status} to {provider_status}\"\n            discrepancy.resolved_at = datetime.utcnow()\n        else:\n            # Backward or invalid transition requires manual review\n            discrepancy.resolution_action = \"Manual review required - invalid state transition\"\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-Aggressive Auto-Resolution**\nWhile automation speeds up reconciliation, being too aggressive can mask serious integration issues. For example, automatically updating local charge amounts to match provider values might hide a bug in your payment processing logic that's causing systematic amount calculation errors.\n\nAlways implement conservative thresholds and comprehensive logging for auto-resolution actions:\n\n```python\n# Conservative auto-resolution thresholds\nAUTO_RESOLVE_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD = 0.01  # 1% or less\nAUTO_RESOLVE_AGE_LIMIT_HOURS = 2      # Only recent discrepancies\nAUTO_RESOLVE_MAX_DAILY = 100          # Circuit breaker for mass discrepancies\n```\n\n#### Root Cause Analysis for Persistent Issues\n\nWhen discrepancies occur repeatedly or in patterns, they often indicate systematic issues that require deeper investigation. Root cause analysis for payment discrepancies involves examining trends, correlating with external events, and identifying common factors across failures.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of root cause analysis like epidemiological investigation during a disease outbreak. Individual cases (discrepancies) might seem random, but patterns emerge when you look at timing, affected populations (payment methods, amounts, geographic regions), and environmental factors (system deployments, provider changes, network issues).\n\nCommon root cause patterns include:\n\n1. **Webhook Delivery Failures**: Systematic issues with webhook processing often manifest as status discrepancies that follow patterns - perhaps all payments using a specific payment method, or all payments during specific time windows when your webhook processing was experiencing issues.\n\n2. **Integration Configuration Drift**: Changes to provider API configurations, webhook endpoints, or API credentials can cause subtle discrepancies that accumulate over time. These often correlate with deployment timestamps or configuration changes.\n\n3. **Race Condition Windows**: Discrepancies that occur primarily during high-traffic periods might indicate race conditions in your payment processing logic, where concurrent operations interfere with each other.\n\n4. **Provider-Side Issues**: Sometimes discrepancies cluster around provider maintenance windows, API version updates, or regional outages that affected only certain types of transactions.\n\n| Investigation Dimension | Query Pattern | What to Look For |\n|------------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Temporal clustering | Group discrepancies by hour/day | Spikes correlating with deployments or incidents |\n| Payment method patterns | Group by payment method type | Specific card types or payment methods over-represented |\n| Amount-based patterns | Group by amount ranges | Certain amounts ranges affected disproportionately |\n| Geographic clustering | Group by customer region | Regional payment processing differences |\n| Status transition patterns | Group by status transition type | Specific state transitions frequently inconsistent |\n\nThe root cause analysis should feed back into system improvements - updating monitoring alerts, strengthening validation logic, or implementing additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nBuilding effective debugging capabilities requires proactive instrumentation, structured logging, and automated monitoring that can detect issues before they impact customers.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Logging Framework | Python `logging` with JSON formatter | Structured logging with `structlog` |\n| Error Tracking | File-based error logs | Sentry or Rollbar for error aggregation |\n| Metrics Collection | Prometheus with custom counters | DataDog or New Relic APM |\n| Webhook Testing | `ngrok` for local development | Webhook.site for payload inspection |\n| State Comparison | Manual SQL queries | Custom reconciliation dashboard |\n| Log Analysis | `grep` and command-line tools | ELK stack or Splunk for log search |\n\n#### Debugging Infrastructure Setup\n\nCreate comprehensive debugging infrastructure that captures all necessary context for payment processing issues:\n\n```python\n# debug_infrastructure.py\nimport logging\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\nfrom functools import wraps\n\nclass PaymentDebugLogger:\n    \"\"\"Centralized logging for payment processing with structured context\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger('payment_gateway')\n        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n        \n        # JSON formatter for structured logging\n        handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n        formatter = logging.Formatter(\n            '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s'\n        )\n        handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n        self.logger.addHandler(handler)\n    \n    def log_payment_event(self, event_type: str, payment_intent_id: str, \n                         context: Dict[str, Any], level: str = 'info'):\n        \"\"\"Log payment events with standardized context\"\"\"\n        log_data = {\n            'event_type': event_type,\n            'payment_intent_id': payment_intent_id,\n            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),\n            'context': context\n        }\n        \n        getattr(self.logger, level)(json.dumps(log_data))\n    \n    @contextmanager\n    def payment_operation_context(self, operation: str, payment_intent_id: str):\n        \"\"\"Context manager for tracking payment operations\"\"\"\n        start_time = time.time()\n        operation_id = f\"{operation}_{int(start_time)}\"\n        \n        self.log_payment_event('operation_started', payment_intent_id, {\n            'operation': operation,\n            'operation_id': operation_id\n        })\n        \n        try:\n            yield operation_id\n            duration = time.time() -

architectural patterns established across all milestones enable scaling to multi-provider support, subscription billing, marketplace payments, and advanced fraud detection capabilities.\n\nThe current payment gateway implementation provides a solid foundation for processing individual transactions, handling refunds, and managing webhook reconciliation. However, real-world payment systems often require additional capabilities that extend far beyond basic transaction processing. This section explores the architectural patterns and design considerations needed to evolve our payment gateway into a comprehensive financial platform capable of supporting complex business models and enterprise-scale operations.\n\nThink of our current payment system as a well-built bicycle - it handles the core transportation need effectively, but different journeys require different vehicles. A delivery service needs trucks with multiple compartments, a taxi service needs cars with passenger management systems, and a logistics company needs a fleet management system coordinating multiple vehicles. Similarly, our payment gateway needs different architectural extensions for different business requirements: multi-provider support for reliability and cost optimization, subscription billing for recurring revenue models, marketplace payments for multi-party transactions, and fraud detection for risk management.\n\nThe key insight driving these extensions is that each new capability should build upon our existing foundation rather than replacing it. The `PaymentIntent` state machine, idempotency controls, webhook reconciliation, and error handling patterns we've established provide the architectural skeleton onto which we can attach new functionality. This approach ensures consistency across features while allowing each extension to solve its specific domain problems.\n\n> **Key Design Principle**: Extensions should enhance the core payment processing engine without fundamentally altering its reliability guarantees or introducing architectural complexity that compromises the basic transaction flow.\n\n### Multi-Provider Architecture\n\nModern payment processing demands resilience, cost optimization, and geographic coverage that no single payment provider can deliver comprehensively. Think of multi-provider architecture like having multiple internet service providers for a critical data center - each provider has different strengths, coverage areas, cost structures, and reliability characteristics. When processing payments across different regions, currencies, or payment methods, routing transactions to the optimal provider while maintaining consistent behavior requires careful architectural design.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in multi-provider architecture is maintaining our existing `PaymentIntent` abstraction while introducing provider-specific behaviors, capabilities, and error conditions. Our current system directly integrates with a single provider's API, making assumptions about response formats, webhook signatures, and transaction lifecycle timing. Extending to multiple providers requires introducing an abstraction layer that normalizes these differences while preserving provider-specific optimizations.\n\n#### Provider Abstraction Layer Design\n\nThe provider abstraction layer serves as the translation boundary between our domain model and provider-specific implementations. Consider how a universal remote control abstracts different television manufacturers' control protocols - it presents consistent buttons (power, volume, channel) while translating each button press into manufacturer-specific infrared signals. Similarly, our provider abstraction translates standardized payment operations into provider-specific API calls.\n\nThe abstraction centers around a `PaymentProvider` interface that defines the essential operations every provider must support, regardless of their underlying implementation differences:\n\n| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|--------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `create_payment_intent` | `amount`, `currency`, `metadata`, `idempotency_key` | `ProviderPaymentIntent` | Creates payment intent with provider-specific details |\n| `create_charge` | `payment_intent_id`, `payment_method_token`, `return_url` | `ProviderChargeResponse` | Initiates charge processing with authentication flow |\n| `confirm_payment` | `provider_charge_id`, `authentication_token` | `ProviderChargeResponse` | Completes 3D Secure authentication |\n| `create_refund` | `provider_charge_id`, `amount`, `reason` | `ProviderRefundResponse` | Processes full or partial refund |\n| `get_payment_status` | `provider_payment_id` | `ProviderPaymentStatus` | Retrieves current payment state for reconciliation |\n| `verify_webhook_signature` | `payload`, `signature_header`, `secret` | `bool` | Validates webhook authenticity using provider's method |\n| `parse_webhook_event` | `payload`, `event_type` | `StandardWebhookEvent` | Normalizes provider webhook into standard format |\n\nEach provider implementation encapsulates the specific API client, authentication mechanisms, request/response transformations, and error code mappings needed for that provider. This encapsulation allows the core payment processing engine to remain unchanged while supporting dramatically different provider architectures.\n\n> **Decision: Provider Interface Abstraction**\n> - **Context**: Multiple payment providers have different API designs, authentication methods, and data formats, but our core payment processing logic should remain consistent\n> - **Options Considered**: Direct provider switching, adapter pattern, strategy pattern\n> - **Decision**: Strategy pattern with provider interface abstraction\n> - **Rationale**: Strategy pattern allows runtime provider selection while maintaining type safety and testability; adapter pattern would require creating adapters for each provider combination; direct switching would require conditional logic throughout the payment engine\n> - **Consequences**: Clean separation of provider-specific logic, easy testing with mock providers, but requires careful design of the abstraction to avoid lowest-common-denominator limitations\n\n#### Provider Selection Strategy\n\nSelecting the optimal provider for each transaction requires a decision engine that evaluates multiple factors including transaction characteristics, provider capabilities, cost structures, and current system health. Think of this like routing network traffic through different internet service providers - the router considers latency, bandwidth, cost, and current congestion to select the best path for each packet.\n\nThe provider selection strategy operates through a configurable rule engine that evaluates selection criteria in priority order:\n\n| Selection Criteria | Evaluation Logic | Example Rules |\n|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Geographic Routing** | Match customer billing country to provider coverage | Route EU customers to European acquirer for lower interchange fees |\n| **Currency Support** | Verify provider supports transaction currency with favorable rates | Use local acquiring for same-currency transactions to minimize conversion costs |\n| **Payment Method** | Match payment method capabilities (cards, bank transfers, wallets) | Route Apple Pay to provider with direct Apple Pay integration |\n| **Transaction Amount** | Consider provider fee structures and processing limits | Route high-value transactions to provider with lower percentage fees |\n| **Provider Health** | Evaluate current success rates, latency, and circuit breaker status | Avoid providers experiencing elevated decline rates or API timeouts |\n| **Business Rules** | Apply merchant-specific routing preferences or compliance requirements | Route transactions from specific MCC codes to compliant processors |\n\nThe selection engine maintains real-time metrics for each provider, including success rates, average processing times, and current error rates. These metrics feed into the decision algorithm, automatically shifting traffic away from providers experiencing issues while maintaining detailed audit logs for analysis.\n\n```\nProvider Selection Algorithm:\n1. Filter providers by hard requirements (currency support, payment method, geographic licensing)\n2. Apply business rules and compliance constraints to remaining providers\n3. Evaluate each qualifying provider using weighted scoring (cost 40%, reliability 30%, performance 30%)\n4. Select highest-scoring provider unless circuit breaker indicates unavailability\n5. Log selection decision with full scoring breakdown for analysis\n6. Fall back to secondary provider if primary selection fails during transaction processing\n```\n\n#### Provider Health Monitoring\n\nMaintaining optimal routing decisions requires continuous monitoring of provider performance, reliability, and cost effectiveness. Consider how a traffic management system monitors highway conditions - it tracks congestion levels, accident reports, construction delays, and weather conditions to provide real-time routing recommendations. Similarly, provider health monitoring tracks multiple dimensions of provider performance to inform routing decisions.\n\nThe monitoring system collects metrics across several key dimensions:\n\n| Metric Category | Key Indicators | Update Frequency | Decision Impact |\n|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| **Success Rates** | Authorization success, settlement success, 3DS completion | Real-time per transaction | Primary routing factor - avoid providers with declining success |\n| **Performance** | API response times, 3DS redirect latency, settlement timing | Per API call | Secondary factor - prefer faster providers for time-sensitive flows |\n| **Cost Analysis** | Effective interchange rates, provider fees, currency conversion | Daily batch analysis | Strategic factor - optimize for total cost of processing |\n| **Compliance Status** | PCI certification status, regional licensing, fraud monitoring | Weekly validation | Hard constraint - disable non-compliant providers immediately |\n\nProvider health monitoring integrates with our existing circuit breaker patterns, automatically removing unhealthy providers from the selection pool while implementing gradual recovery testing. When a provider's performance degrades below acceptable thresholds, the system reduces traffic allocation progressively rather than immediately blacklisting the provider, allowing for temporary issues to resolve without overreacting to transient problems.\n\n### Advanced Payment Features\n\nBeyond basic transaction processing, modern payment systems support sophisticated business models that require specialized payment flows, billing cycles, and multi-party transaction management. These advanced features build upon our core payment infrastructure while introducing new domain concepts and state management requirements.\n\n#### Subscription Billing Architecture\n\nSubscription billing transforms one-time payment processing into a recurring revenue management system. Think of subscription billing like a magazine subscription service - instead of purchasing individual issues, customers commit to receiving regular deliveries with automatic payment processing, while the service manages billing cycles, prorated charges, plan changes, and renewal notifications.\n\nThe subscription billing architecture introduces new domain entities that extend our existing payment model:\n\n| Entity | Key Fields | Description |\n|--------|------------|-------------|\n| `Subscription` | `id`, `customer_id`, `plan_id`, `status`, `current_period_start`, `current_period_end`, `payment_method_token` | Core subscription configuration with billing cycle timing |\n| `SubscriptionPlan` | `id`, `amount`, `currency`, `interval`, `interval_count`, `trial_period_days` | Billing plan template defining pricing and frequency |\n| `BillingCycle` | `id`, `subscription_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `amount_due`, `status` | Individual billing period with payment tracking |\n| `Usage` | `id`, `subscription_id`, `metric_name`, `quantity`, `billing_cycle_id` | Usage-based billing tracking for metered subscriptions |\n| `SubscriptionInvoice` | `id`, `subscription_id`, `billing_cycle_id`, `line_items`, `total_amount`, `due_date` | Detailed billing statement with itemized charges |\n\nThe subscription billing engine orchestrates complex lifecycle management including trial periods, plan upgrades, prorated billing adjustments, and failed payment recovery. Each billing cycle generates a `PaymentIntent` using our existing infrastructure, ensuring subscription payments benefit from the same idempotency controls, 3D Secure authentication, and webhook reconciliation as one-time transactions.\n\n> **Decision: Subscription State Management**\n> - **Context**: Subscriptions have complex lifecycle states (trial, active, past_due, canceled) with different billing rules and customer communication requirements\n> - **Options Considered**: Extend PaymentIntent states, separate subscription state machine, event-driven state management\n> - **Decision**: Separate subscription state machine with event-driven transitions\n> - **Rationale**: Subscription states operate on different timescales than payment states; separating concerns allows subscription logic to evolve independently while maintaining payment processing reliability\n> - **Consequences**: Clean separation of billing and payment concerns, easier testing and debugging, but requires careful coordination between subscription and payment state machines\n\n#### Marketplace Payment Architecture\n\nMarketplace payments enable multi-party transactions where funds flow from buyers to sellers through the marketplace platform, with the platform collecting fees and handling compliance obligations. Consider how a real estate transaction involves multiple parties - the buyer, seller, real estate agents, escrow company, and title company - each with different roles, fee structures, and payout timing requirements.\n\nMarketplace payments introduce the concept of **connected accounts** and **transfer groups** that extend our payment model to support complex fund distribution:\n\n| Entity | Key Fields | Description |\n|--------|------------|-------------|\n| `ConnectedAccount` | `id`, `marketplace_id`, `account_holder_id`, `status`, `capabilities`, `verification_status` | Seller account with platform verification and capabilities |\n| `TransferGroup` | `id`, `payment_intent_id`, `total_amount`, `platform_fee`, `status` | Group of related transfers from single payment |\n| `Transfer` | `id`, `transfer_group_id`, `destination_account_id`, `amount`, `description`, `status` | Individual transfer to connected account |\n| `PlatformFee` | `id`, `transfer_id`, `fee_type`, `amount`, `description` | Platform fees collected from transfer |\n\nThe marketplace payment flow coordinates multiple operations atomically - authorizing the full payment amount from the buyer, distributing funds to sellers after deducting platform fees, handling tax reporting requirements, and managing payout schedules. This coordination requires careful orchestration to ensure all parties receive correct amounts while maintaining audit trails for financial reconciliation.\n\nMarketplace payments also introduce complex compliance requirements including:\n\n- **KYC (Know Your Customer) verification** for connected accounts before enabling payouts\n- **Tax reporting** for seller earnings and platform fees across multiple jurisdictions  \n- **Funds flow transparency** allowing buyers and sellers to track payment distribution\n- **Dispute management** handling conflicts between buyers, sellers, and the platform\n- **Regulatory compliance** meeting marketplace-specific regulations like payment service provider licensing\n\n#### Fraud Detection Integration\n\nAdvanced payment systems require sophisticated fraud detection capabilities that analyze transaction patterns, customer behavior, and external risk signals to identify potentially fraudulent activity. Think of fraud detection like an airport security system - it uses multiple screening mechanisms (ID verification, X-ray scanning, behavioral observation) to identify potential threats while minimizing disruption to legitimate travelers.\n\nFraud detection integration operates through a **risk scoring pipeline** that evaluates each transaction against multiple risk factors:\n\n| Risk Category | Analysis Factors | Risk Signals |\n|---------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **Transaction Patterns** | Amount relative to customer history, frequency of transactions, time-of-day patterns | Sudden large transactions, unusual transaction timing, velocity violations |\n| **Device Fingerprinting** | Browser characteristics, IP address, device ID persistence | New device usage, proxy/VPN detection, device spoofing indicators |\n| **Geographic Analysis** | Billing vs shipping address, IP geolocation, known high-risk countries | Address mismatches, impossible travel patterns, high-risk jurisdictions |\n| **Payment Method Validation** | Card BIN analysis, payment method age, previous decline history | New payment method usage, stolen card list matches, repeated decline patterns |\n| **Customer Behavior** | Account age, purchase history, social signals | New account risk, behavioral anomalies, social media verification |\n\nThe fraud detection system integrates with our payment processing flow by evaluating risk scores during payment intent creation and charge processing. High-risk transactions can be automatically declined, flagged for manual review, or subjected to additional authentication requirements like step-up verification or manual approval workflows.\n\n> **Decision: Real-time vs Batch Fraud Analysis**\n> - **Context**: Fraud detection requires balancing transaction processing speed against analysis thoroughness, with different risk factors having different computational requirements\n> - **Options Considered**: All real-time analysis, hybrid real-time/batch analysis, all batch analysis with post-transaction review\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with real-time basic checks and batch analysis for sophisticated modeling\n> - **Rationale**: Basic checks (velocity, blacklists, device fingerprinting) can be performed quickly during transaction flow; complex machine learning models and cross-account pattern analysis require batch processing\n> - **Consequences**: Fast transaction processing for most payments, comprehensive risk analysis without blocking customer experience, but requires careful coordination between real-time and batch systems\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-aggressive Fraud Detection**\nMany fraud detection implementations err on the side of caution, implementing strict rules that generate high false positive rates. This approach damages customer experience by declining legitimate transactions, especially for international customers or unusual purchase patterns. Design fraud detection systems with gradual response escalation - implement step-up authentication, manual review queues, and customer communication before automatically declining transactions. Monitor false positive rates as carefully as fraud detection rates to maintain optimal customer experience.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe future extensions described above represent significant architectural expansions that require careful planning and phased implementation. Each extension builds upon our existing payment infrastructure while introducing new technical challenges around data consistency, transaction coordination, and system integration.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|\n| **Provider Abstraction** | Strategy pattern with direct API clients | Abstract factory with provider plugins and configuration management |\n| **Subscription Management** | Cron-based billing cycle processing | Event-driven billing with distributed job queue |\n| **Marketplace Transfers** | Synchronous transfer creation during payment | Asynchronous transfer processing with eventual consistency |\n| **Fraud Detection** | Rule-based scoring with external API integration | Real-time ML pipeline with feature store and model serving |\n| **Multi-tenant Architecture** | Database-per-tenant with connection pooling | Shared database with row-level security and query optimization |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThese extensions require significant additional code organization to maintain the clean architecture established in our core payment processing

Just as financial professionals use precise terminology to avoid costly misunderstandings, payment systems require exact vocabulary to ensure clear communication between developers, payment processors, banks, and regulatory bodies. Every term has specific legal, technical, or business implications that affect how the system behaves.\n\nThis glossary serves multiple audiences: developers implementing payment functionality, QA engineers writing test scenarios, product managers defining requirements, and support teams diagnosing issues. Each definition includes both the conceptual meaning and the practical implementation context within our payment gateway system.\n\n### Payment Industry Core Concepts\n\n**Payment intent** represents a customer's commitment to pay before any money actually moves. Think of it like placing an order at a restaurant - you've committed to pay for the meal, but the actual charge happens later when you settle the bill. Payment intents allow merchants to capture customer commitment early, handle authentication flows, and ensure the payment amount is reserved while completing additional verification steps.\n\nIn our system, payment intents serve as the central coordination point for all payment-related activities. They maintain state throughout the entire payment lifecycle, from initial creation through final settlement or cancellation. The payment intent tracks not just the monetary amount, but also metadata, authentication requirements, and relationship to downstream charges and refunds.\n\n**Idempotency key** functions as a unique fingerprint for payment operations, ensuring that duplicate requests produce identical results without unwanted side effects. Consider the analogy of a check number - banks use check numbers to detect and prevent duplicate processing of the same check. Similarly, idempotency keys prevent scenarios where network retries or user interface double-clicks result in charging customers multiple times for the same purchase.\n\nOur idempotency implementation goes beyond simple duplicate detection. The system stores a cryptographic hash of the request parameters along with the idempotency key, ensuring that reusing an idempotency key with different payment parameters correctly triggers an error rather than returning the cached response from the original request.\n\n**3D Secure** (Three Domain Secure) implements Strong Customer Authentication protocol required by European PSD2 regulations and increasingly adopted globally. The three domains are the issuer domain (customer's bank), acquirer domain (merchant's bank), and interoperability domain (payment networks like Visa and Mastercard that facilitate communication between the other domains).\n\nThe 3D Secure flow resembles a secure handshake between the customer's bank and the merchant. When a payment requires authentication, the customer is redirected to their bank's secure authentication page, completes verification (password, SMS code, biometric), and returns to the merchant with a cryptographic proof of authentication. Our system handles this redirect flow while maintaining payment state and security throughout the authentication journey.\n\n**Tokenization** replaces sensitive payment data with mathematically unrelated tokens that have no intrinsic value. Imagine a coat check system at a restaurant - you receive a numbered ticket (token) that represents your coat, but the ticket itself isn't your coat and is worthless to anyone who doesn't have access to the coat check system.\n\nPayment tokenization works similarly. When customers enter credit card details, the payment processor immediately replaces the card number with a random token. Our system stores and operates on tokens exclusively, never handling actual card numbers. This dramatically reduces PCI compliance scope since we never touch sensitive cardholder data.\n\n**Webhook reconciliation** ensures that our local payment records remain synchronized with the authoritative state maintained by external payment providers. Think of it like balancing a checkbook - periodically comparing your records with the bank's records to identify and resolve any discrepancies.\n\nPayment providers send webhook notifications when payment states change, but webhooks can fail, arrive out of order, or be delayed. Our reconciliation process acts as a safety net, regularly comparing our local payment states with the provider's authoritative records and resolving any inconsistencies through automated correction or manual review workflows.\n\n### Payment Processing Terminology\n\n**Terminal state** describes payment statuses that allow no further transitions - the payment has reached a final, unchangeable outcome. Like a door that can be opened or closed but not \"half-open,\" payments eventually reach states like `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled` from which no further state changes are possible.\n\nUnderstanding terminal states is crucial for payment system design because it determines when resources can be cleaned up, when customers can be charged for goods, and when refunds become the only mechanism for returning money. Our state machine design explicitly prevents illegal transitions from terminal states to maintain data integrity.\n\n**Chargeback** represents a forced payment reversal initiated by the customer's bank, typically when the customer disputes a transaction. Unlike refunds (which merchants control), chargebacks are imposed by the payment network and cannot be prevented - only contested through a formal dispute process.\n\nChargebacks carry additional fees and penalties beyond the reversed transaction amount. When a chargeback occurs, the merchant loses both the original payment amount and pays a chargeback fee (typically $15-25). Excessive chargeback rates can result in higher processing fees or account termination by payment processors.\n\n**PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) establishes security requirements for any organization that handles, stores, or transmits credit card information. Think of PCI DSS as building codes for payment systems - mandatory safety requirements that prevent catastrophic failures (data breaches) that could harm customers and destroy businesses.\n\nOur system achieves PCI compliance through tokenization, which eliminates the need to store sensitive cardholder data. By delegating card data handling to PCI-compliant payment processors and working exclusively with tokens, we significantly reduce our compliance scope and security risk.\n\n### Technical System Concepts\n\n**Request parameter hash** creates a deterministic fingerprint of essential payment operation parameters, enabling detection of duplicate requests with different parameter values. Like a document checksum that changes if even one character is modified, the request parameter hash ensures that reusing an idempotency key with different payment amounts, currencies, or payment methods correctly triggers an error.\n\nThe hash calculation includes all parameters that affect payment outcomes: amount, currency, payment method token, metadata, and return URLs. This prevents malicious or accidental attempts to reuse idempotency keys for different transactions while allowing legitimate retry scenarios to proceed safely.\n\n**Circuit breaker** implements failure protection that prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking calls to failing external services. Imagine a electrical circuit breaker in your home - when it detects dangerous conditions (electrical overload), it immediately cuts power to prevent fires, then can be reset once the dangerous condition is resolved.\n\nPayment circuit breakers monitor error rates and response times for external provider APIs. When failure thresholds are exceeded, the circuit breaker transitions to an \"open\" state, immediately failing requests without attempting provider calls. After a timeout period, it enters a \"half-open\" state to test if the provider has recovered.\n\n**Exponential backoff** implements a retry delay strategy where the wait time between retry attempts increases exponentially (1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 8 seconds, etc.). This prevents overwhelming failing services with retry attempts while giving them time to recover.\n\nOur implementation includes jitter - random variance added to retry delays to prevent the \"thundering herd\" problem where many clients retry simultaneously. Instead of all clients retrying exactly every 4 seconds, they retry at random intervals between 3-5 seconds, distributing the load more evenly.\n\n**Compensation transaction** executes the inverse operation needed to maintain system consistency after partial failures in distributed operations. Like the \"undo\" function in a word processor, compensation transactions reverse the effects of operations that cannot be completed successfully.\n\nFor example, if a payment succeeds with the provider but our webhook processing fails, a compensation transaction might involve calling the provider to refund the payment or marking our local records for manual reconciliation. These transactions ensure that partial failures don't leave the system in inconsistent states.\n\n### State Management and Consistency\n\n**Eventual consistency** describes a consistency model where distributed systems converge to a consistent state over time, even though they may be temporarily inconsistent during normal operation. Think of it like a group text conversation where messages arrive in slightly different orders on different phones, but eventually everyone sees the same conversation history.\n\nPayment systems naturally exhibit eventual consistency because they span multiple external services (payment providers, banks, card networks) that process transactions at different speeds. Our system design embraces this reality by implementing reconciliation processes that detect and resolve temporary inconsistencies automatically.\n\n**Reconciliation** encompasses the process of synchronizing local payment state with external provider state to detect and resolve discrepancies. Like auditors comparing company books with bank statements, reconciliation identifies differences between what we think happened and what actually happened according to authoritative sources.\n\nOur reconciliation system operates continuously through webhook processing and periodically through batch comparison jobs. It maintains detailed logs of discrepancies, resolution actions taken, and manual review requirements for complex cases that cannot be automatically resolved.\n\n**Jitter** adds random variance to timing operations, particularly retry delays and scheduled job execution, to prevent synchronized behavior that can overwhelm systems. Without jitter, all clients experiencing the same failure might retry at exactly the same intervals, creating traffic spikes that make recovery more difficult.\n\nOur jitter implementation uses cryptographically secure random number generation to ensure unpredictable variance. For retry delays, we typically add ±25% jitter, so a 4-second delay becomes a random interval between 3-5 seconds.\n\n### Advanced Payment Concepts\n\n**Provider abstraction layer** creates a translation boundary between our domain model and provider-specific implementations, enabling support for multiple payment processors through unified interfaces. Think of it like a universal translator that allows our system to communicate with different payment providers despite their varying APIs and data formats.\n\nThe abstraction layer standardizes concepts like payment intents, charges, and refunds across providers while handling provider-specific peculiarities like different authentication methods, webhook formats, and error codes. This design enables switching providers or supporting multiple providers simultaneously without changing core business logic.\n\n**Provider selection strategy** implements the decision engine for routing transactions to optimal providers based on various criteria like cost, success rates, geographic coverage, and capabilities. Similar to GPS routing algorithms that consider traffic, road conditions, and distance to find optimal paths, provider selection algorithms evaluate multiple factors to maximize transaction success while minimizing costs.\n\nOur selection strategy considers transaction characteristics (amount, currency, payment method), customer attributes (geographic location, risk profile), and real-time provider performance metrics to make intelligent routing decisions.\n\n**Connected accounts** represent verified seller accounts in marketplace scenarios where the platform facilitates payments between buyers and sellers. Like verified merchant accounts at a shopping mall where the mall management has vetted each store, connected accounts undergo verification and capability checks before being authorized to receive payments.\n\nConnected accounts maintain their own verification status, supported capabilities, and compliance requirements. The platform can enable or disable specific capabilities (card payments, bank transfers, instant payouts) based on the account's verification level and risk assessment.\n\n**Transfer groups** organize related money movements from a single marketplace payment into multiple destination accounts, typically including seller payments and platform fees. Think of it like a payroll system that takes one large payment from a company and distributes it to multiple employees while deducting taxes and benefits.\n\nTransfer groups maintain atomicity - either all transfers in the group succeed, or none do. This prevents scenarios where seller payments succeed but platform fee collection fails, leaving the marketplace unable to collect revenue from completed transactions.\n\n### Subscription and Recurring Billing\n\n**Subscription billing engine** orchestrates the complex workflows required for recurring payment processing, including trial periods, plan changes, proration calculations, failed payment recovery, and lifecycle management. Like a sophisticated scheduling system that manages recurring appointments while handling cancellations, rescheduling, and special requirements.\n\nThe billing engine coordinates multiple subsystems: customer management, payment method storage, invoice generation, payment processing, dunning management (handling failed payments), and customer communication. It ensures that subscription charges occur at the correct times with appropriate amounts while gracefully handling edge cases.\n\n**Billing cycle** represents an individual billing period with associated charges, payment attempts, and status tracking. Each cycle maintains its own payment state independent of other cycles, allowing for complex scenarios like partial payments, billing adjustments, and cycle-specific promotions.\n\nBilling cycles handle proration automatically when customers upgrade, downgrade, or change billing frequency mid-cycle. The system calculates precise amounts based on usage periods and applies appropriate credits or additional charges.\n\n**Proration** calculates proportional billing adjustments when subscription changes occur mid-cycle, ensuring customers pay exactly for the service period they actually use. Like calculating utility bills that account for mid-month service changes, proration ensures fair charging regardless of when changes occur.\n\nOur proration engine handles complex scenarios including plan upgrades, downgrades, quantity changes, and billing frequency modifications. It generates detailed line items showing original charges, credits for unused time, and additional charges for new services.\n\n### Risk Management and Fraud Detection\n\n**Risk scoring pipeline** analyzes transaction patterns, customer behavior, and contextual factors to identify potentially fraudulent payments before they complete processing. Similar to credit scoring systems that evaluate loan applications, risk scoring examines multiple data points to assign fraud probability scores.\n\nThe pipeline operates in real-time during payment processing, evaluating factors like transaction velocity, geographic inconsistencies, device fingerprinting, and behavioral patterns. High-risk transactions can be automatically declined, flagged for manual review, or subjected to additional authentication requirements.\n\n**Provider health monitoring** continuously tracks provider performance metrics including success rates, response times, error patterns, and service availability to inform routing decisions and detect degraded service conditions. Like network monitoring systems that track server health, provider monitoring ensures optimal transaction routing and early problem detection.\n\nHealth monitoring aggregates metrics across different time windows (real-time, hourly, daily) and transaction types (small vs large amounts, different currencies, various payment methods) to provide comprehensive visibility into provider performance characteristics.\n\n### Compliance and Security Standards\n\n**SAQ A** (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A) represents the simplest PCI DSS compliance requirement for merchants who have completely outsourced payment processing and never handle cardholder data directly. Think of it like a basic safety checklist for businesses that don't directly handle dangerous materials but still need to maintain safe practices.\n\nMerchants qualifying for SAQ A only need to complete a short questionnaire (about 12 questions) rather than undergoing comprehensive security audits. Our tokenization-based approach enables merchants to qualify for SAQ A by ensuring they never touch sensitive cardholder data.\n\n**SAQ A-EP** (SAQ A with E-commerce Payment processing) applies to merchants who use hosted payment forms but maintain some payment-related functions on their systems. This requires additional security controls around network segmentation, access controls, and system monitoring while still avoiding direct cardholder data handling.\n\n**SAQ D** represents the most comprehensive PCI assessment required for merchants who store, process, or transmit cardholder data directly. This involves extensive security audits, penetration testing, and ongoing compliance monitoring - the equivalent of full regulatory oversight for high-risk activities.\n\n**TLS 1.2** specifies the minimum required Transport Layer Security version for protecting payment data in transit. Like requiring reinforced security trucks for valuable cargo transport, TLS 1.2 ensures that payment information cannot be intercepted or modified during network transmission.\n\nOur system enforces TLS 1.2 for all payment-related communications and rejects connections using older, vulnerable protocols. This includes connections to payment providers, webhook endpoints, and customer-facing payment forms.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe payment industry terminology forms the foundation for clear communication throughout system implementation. Understanding these concepts enables precise technical discussions, accurate requirement specifications, and effective debugging when issues arise.\n\n#### Payment Domain Language Usage\n\nWhen implementing payment systems, consistent terminology usage prevents misunderstandings that could lead to incorrect business logic or security vulnerabilities. Use these preferred terms consistently:\n\n| Concept | Preferred Term | Avoid | Reason |\n|---------|---------------|--------|---------|\n| Customer commitment to pay | payment intent | payment request, order | Aligns with industry standards |\n| Unique operation identifier | idempotency key | transaction id, request id | Specifies duplicate prevention purpose |\n| Card authentication protocol | 3D Secure | 3DS, three-d-secure | Official protocol name |\n| State synchronization | webhook reconciliation | webhook processing | Emphasizes consistency checking |\n| Sensitive data replacement | tokenization | encryption, hashing | Describes specific security technique |\n| Forced payment reversal | chargeback | dispute, reversal | Distinguishes from merchant-initiated refunds |\n| Security compliance framework | PCI DSS | PCI compliance | Complete standard name |\n| Final payment status | terminal state | end state, final status | Payment industry convention |\n\n#### Technical Term Application\n\nUnderstanding when and how to apply technical terms correctly prevents implementation errors:\n\n**Idempotency** applies to any operation that can be safely retried without changing the result. In payment systems, this includes payment intent creation, charge processing, refund requests, and webhook event processing. However, not all operations are naturally idempotent - some require explicit design to achieve idempotent behavior.\n\n**Eventual consistency** describes the expected behavior for distributed payment systems. Developers should design for temporary inconsistencies and implement reconciliation processes rather than expecting immediate consistency across all system components.\n\n**Circuit breakers** should be applied to all external service calls, including payment provider APIs, database connections, and webhook deliveries. However, circuit breakers must be configured appropriately for each service's characteristics - payment processing might tolerate longer timeout periods than user-facing API calls.\n\n#### Error Message and Log Terminology\n\nUse precise terminology in error messages, log entries, and monitoring alerts to facilitate rapid debugging:\n\n```\nGood: \"Payment intent pi_abc123 failed 3D Secure authentication - customer abandoned auth flow\"\nPoor: \"Payment failed - authentication error\"\n\nGood: \"Webhook reconciliation detected state mismatch: local=processing, provider=succeeded\"  \nPoor: \"Data sync error\"\n\nGood: \"Circuit breaker opened for provider stripe-api after 5 consecutive timeout failures\"\nPoor: \"External service unavailable\"\n```\n\n#### Domain Model Consistency\n\nMaintain terminology consistency throughout the codebase by establishing clear mappings between domain concepts and implementation artifacts:\n\n| Domain Concept | Code Representation | Database Schema | API Response |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Payment intent | `PaymentIntent` class | `payment_intents` table | `payment_intent` object |\n| Idempotency key | `idempotency_key` field | `idempotency_keys` table | `idempotency_key` property |\n| 3D Secure flow | `handle_three_ds_return` method | `three_ds_authentication` table | `next_action.redirect_to_url` |\n| Webhook reconciliation | `reconcile_payment_state` function | `reconciliation_runs` table | Not exposed externally |\n\nThis consistency enables new team members to understand the system quickly and reduces cognitive overhead when switching between different system layers.\n\n#### Compliance Communication\n\nWhen communicating with compliance teams, auditors, or legal counsel, use official terminology from relevant standards and regulations:\n\n- Reference \"PCI DSS requirements\" not \"PCI rules\"\n- Specify \"Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)\" not \"European payment authentication\"  \n- Use \"cardholder data environment (CDE)\" not \"payment processing system\"\n- Distinguish \"stored cardholder data\" from \"payment transaction data\"\n\n#### Integration Documentation\n\nWhen documenting integrations with external payment providers, maintain clear separation between our domain terminology and provider-specific terminology through translation tables:\n\n| Our Term | Stripe Term | PayPal Term | Square Term |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Payment intent | Payment Intent | Order | Payment |\n| Charge | Charge | Capture | Payment |\n| Refund | Refund | Refund | Refund |\n| Webhook event | Event | Webhook | Webhook |\n\nThis approach enables supporting multiple providers while maintaining consistent internal terminology throughout our system implementation.\n"}
