The key architectural challenge is creating a responsive, frame-rate independent physics system that handles complex interactions between player movement, environmental collision, and game entities while maintaining smooth 60fps gameplay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones - establishes foundational understanding for the entire project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building a 2D platformer presents a unique set of technical challenges that distinguish it from other types of software systems. Unlike traditional applications that respond to discrete user actions and maintain relatively static state, a platformer must simulate a continuous physical world that updates 60 times per second while responding instantly to player input. The core challenge lies in creating a system that feels responsive and predictable to players while managing complex interactions between movement physics, collision detection, and game state updates within strict timing constraints.</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem we&#39;re solving is creating a <strong>real-time interactive physics simulation</strong> that prioritizes player experience over physical accuracy. This requires careful balance between computational efficiency, visual smoothness, and gameplay responsiveness. Players expect their character to move immediately when they press a button, jump with consistent height and timing, and interact predictably with the game world - all while the system maintains steady 60fps performance across different hardware configurations.</p>\n<p>Three core technical challenges define the architecture of any successful 2D platformer engine:</p>\n<p><strong>Real-time Physics Simulation</strong>: The engine must continuously update entity positions, velocities, and accelerations while applying forces like gravity and friction. Unlike turn-based games where calculations happen between player actions, platformers require smooth, frame-rate independent physics that produce consistent behavior whether running at 30fps or 144fps. This demands careful time management, numerical stability in physics calculations, and efficient algorithms that can handle dozens of moving entities simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsive Input Handling</strong>: Player input must translate to immediate visual feedback with minimal latency. Modern platformers employ sophisticated techniques like input buffering (remembering button presses for a few frames) and coyote time (allowing jumps briefly after leaving a platform) to make controls feel more responsive than strict physics would allow. The input system must capture, queue, and process player actions while coordinating with physics updates to ensure consistent timing.</p>\n<p><strong>Precise Collision Detection and Resolution</strong>: The collision system must prevent players from falling through platforms, getting stuck in walls, or experiencing other physics glitches that break game immersion. This requires efficient spatial algorithms to detect when moving objects intersect with level geometry, followed by resolution algorithms that separate overlapping objects without introducing visual artifacts like jittering or tunneling through thin barriers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"game-physics-mental-model\">Game Physics Mental Model</h3>\n<p>Think of game physics as <strong>theatrical physics rather than scientific physics</strong>. Just as a stage play uses simplified sets, dramatic lighting, and exaggerated gestures to create emotional impact rather than literal realism, game physics uses simplified calculations, exaggerated forces, and carefully tuned parameters to create engaging gameplay rather than accurate simulation.</p>\n<p>In real physics, a falling object accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared regardless of what makes for fun gameplay. In game physics, gravity might be 2000 pixels per second squared because that creates the right &quot;weight&quot; feeling for your character. A real-world jump follows a precise parabolic arc determined by initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. A game jump might have reduced gravity while the jump button is held, creating variable height that feels more responsive to player input than realistic physics would allow.</p>\n<p>This theatrical approach extends to collision detection, where we often prioritize preventing frustrating edge cases over physical accuracy. Real objects have complex shapes and can collide in countless ways. Game objects typically use simplified <strong>Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)</strong> - invisible rectangles that approximate object shapes for collision testing. A player character might be a complex sprite with irregular edges, but for collision purposes, we treat them as a simple rectangle that&#39;s slightly smaller than their visual representation. This prevents pixel-perfect collisions that feel unfair while ensuring smooth interaction with level geometry.</p>\n<p>The mental model for velocity-based movement resembles <strong>numerical integration in physics simulations</strong>, but optimized for gaming constraints. Each frame, we update velocity based on acceleration (gravity, friction, player input), then update position based on velocity. However, unlike scientific simulation, we apply game-specific rules at each step. When the player releases the jump button mid-air, we might multiply upward velocity by 0.5 to create variable jump height. When the player changes direction while running, we might apply higher-than-realistic deceleration to make controls feel snappy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Game physics is not about simulating reality - it&#39;s about creating a consistent, predictable, and engaging interactive experience. Every physics parameter should be tuned based on how it feels to play, not how accurately it models real-world physics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Frame-rate independence requires thinking about <strong>delta time</strong> as the fundamental unit of game physics. Instead of assuming &quot;one unit of movement per frame,&quot; every physics calculation must be scaled by the time elapsed since the last frame update. A character moving at 200 pixels per second should move exactly the same distance over 1 second whether that&#39;s rendered as 60 frames of ~16.67ms each or 120 frames of ~8.33ms each. This requires disciplined use of delta time in every physics calculation and careful consideration of numerical stability when time steps vary.</p>\n<p>The collision resolution mental model resembles <strong>constraint satisfaction</strong> rather than physical impact simulation. When we detect that a player has moved inside a wall, we don&#39;t calculate realistic collision forces and momentum transfer. Instead, we treat the wall as an absolute constraint and move the player to the nearest valid position outside the wall. This constraint-based approach prevents common physics glitches while maintaining the theatrical physics that make platformers feel good to play.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-platformer-approaches\">Existing Platformer Approaches</h3>\n<p>Successful 2D platformers have evolved several distinct architectural patterns, each optimized for different types of gameplay and technical constraints. Understanding these established approaches helps inform design decisions and reveals trade-offs between different implementation strategies.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Fixed Timestep with Frame Skipping</strong> approach, popularized by classic arcade games and still used in many modern indie platformers, runs physics updates at a fixed rate (typically 60Hz) regardless of rendering framerate. If rendering runs faster than 60fps, the extra frames simply redraw the same physics state. If rendering runs slower, the physics system updates multiple times per render frame to maintain consistent gameplay timing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Fixed Timestep</th>\n<th>Variable Timestep</th>\n<th>Hybrid Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Physics Consistency</strong></td>\n<td>Perfect - same behavior every run</td>\n<td>Varies with framerate</td>\n<td>Good - bounded variation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Implementation Complexity</strong></td>\n<td>Simple - no delta time calculations</td>\n<td>Moderate - requires careful delta time use</td>\n<td>Complex - manages both approaches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Performance on Slow Hardware</strong></td>\n<td>Graceful degradation - gameplay stays consistent</td>\n<td>Poor - physics becomes sluggish</td>\n<td>Good - adapts to hardware capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Input Responsiveness</strong></td>\n<td>May lag on fast displays</td>\n<td>Always matches display refresh</td>\n<td>Best of both worlds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Determinism for Replay/Networking</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent - fixed timing guarantees repeatability</td>\n<td>Poor - timing variations cause divergence</td>\n<td>Moderate - requires careful synchronization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Hybrid Timestep with Physics Interpolation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Modern games run on hardware ranging from 60Hz mobile devices to 240Hz gaming monitors, requiring consistent physics across different framerates while maintaining input responsiveness</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Pure fixed timestep, pure variable timestep, hybrid with interpolation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with fixed physics timestep and interpolated rendering</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides consistent physics behavior across hardware while maintaining smooth visuals and responsive input on high-refresh displays</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more complex time management but eliminates framerate-dependent physics bugs while supporting modern high-refresh displays</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Entity-Component-System (ECS)</strong> architectural pattern treats game objects as collections of data components (position, velocity, sprite, health) processed by specialized systems (physics system, rendering system, AI system). This contrasts with traditional object-oriented approaches where entities inherit from base classes and contain their own update logic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Architecture</th>\n<th>Data Organization</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n<th>Code Maintainability</th>\n<th>Learning Curve</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Object-Oriented Inheritance</strong></td>\n<td>Objects contain all data and methods</td>\n<td>Moderate - virtual function overhead</td>\n<td>Good - familiar patterns</td>\n<td>Easy - matches typical programming education</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Entity-Component-System</strong></td>\n<td>Components hold data, systems process batches</td>\n<td>Excellent - cache-friendly data access</td>\n<td>Excellent - clear separation of concerns</td>\n<td>Steep - requires understanding data-oriented design</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Component-Based Objects</strong></td>\n<td>Objects compose functionality via components</td>\n<td>Good - reduces inheritance complexity</td>\n<td>Good - more flexible than pure inheritance</td>\n<td>Moderate - hybrid of familiar and new concepts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For an intermediate-level learning project, the <strong>Component-Based Objects</strong> approach offers the best balance. Each entity (player, enemy, platform) is an object that composes its behavior from component objects (physics component, sprite component, collision component). This provides the flexibility of ECS while maintaining familiar object-oriented patterns that are easier for intermediate developers to understand and debug.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Tile-Based Level Architecture</strong> remains the dominant approach for 2D platformers due to its efficiency and artistic flexibility. Levels are constructed from a grid of square tiles, each representing either solid geometry, background decoration, or special game elements like platforms or hazards. This contrasts with vector-based collision geometry or physics-simulated destructible terrain.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level Architecture</th>\n<th>Memory Usage</th>\n<th>Collision Performance</th>\n<th>Artistic Flexibility</th>\n<th>Dynamic Modification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Tile-Based Grid</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent - compact representation</td>\n<td>Excellent - O(1) tile lookup</td>\n<td>Good - modular tile-based art</td>\n<td>Limited - can modify individual tiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Vector Collision Shapes</strong></td>\n<td>Poor - complex shape data</td>\n<td>Moderate - requires spatial partitioning</td>\n<td>Excellent - arbitrary shapes</td>\n<td>Excellent - can modify any geometry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Physics-Simulated Terrain</strong></td>\n<td>Poor - detailed mesh data</td>\n<td>Poor - complex collision queries</td>\n<td>Limited - constrained by simulation</td>\n<td>Excellent - fully dynamic destruction</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Tile-based architecture excels for traditional platformers where levels consist primarily of static platforms, walls, and simple interactive elements. The collision detection becomes a simple matter of checking which tiles overlap with an entity&#39;s bounding box, making it both fast and predictable. Level data can be stored compactly as 2D arrays of tile IDs, and level editors can provide intuitive grid-based editing tools.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Tile-Based Level Architecture with AABB Entity Collision</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Building a learning-focused platformer that emphasizes physics and collision detection over complex level geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Tile-based collision, vector collision shapes, hybrid tile-and-vector approach</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Pure tile-based level architecture with Axis-Aligned Bounding Box entity collision</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides optimal learning experience by focusing complexity on physics and game mechanics rather than advanced spatial algorithms, while still representing the most common approach in successful 2D platformers</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Limits level design to grid-based layouts but significantly simplifies collision detection implementation and debugging</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Collision Resolution Strategy</strong> varies significantly between different platformer implementations, with major implications for how corner cases and edge conditions behave. The fundamental choice is between <strong>penetration resolution</strong> (detecting overlap and separating objects) versus <strong>predictive collision</strong> (preventing overlap before it occurs).</p>\n<p>Most modern platformers use penetration resolution with <strong>separating axis collision response</strong>. When an entity moves during a frame and ends up overlapping with level geometry, the collision system calculates the minimum distance needed to separate them and moves the entity to a valid position. The critical implementation detail is handling X and Y axis collisions separately to prevent corner-clipping issues where entities get stuck in walls when colliding with inside corners.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Strategy</th>\n<th>Accuracy</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Tunneling Prevention</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Penetration Resolution</strong></td>\n<td>Good - handles most cases well</td>\n<td>Excellent - simple calculations</td>\n<td>Moderate - requires separation logic</td>\n<td>Poor - fast objects can tunnel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Predictive/Swept Collision</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent - prevents all penetration</td>\n<td>Moderate - requires collision time calculation</td>\n<td>Complex - ray casting and time-of-impact</td>\n<td>Excellent - mathematically impossible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hybrid with Continuous Detection</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent - best of both approaches</td>\n<td>Poor - runs multiple collision passes</td>\n<td>Very Complex - combines both systems</td>\n<td>Excellent - handles all edge cases</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For the learning context, penetration resolution with separate X/Y axis handling provides the best balance of educational value and practical results. Students can understand and debug the collision resolution process, while the separate axis approach teaches important concepts about coordinate system decomposition that apply broadly in graphics and physics programming.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Principle</strong>: In platformer collision resolution, <strong>order of operations matters enormously</strong>. Resolving X-axis collisions before Y-axis collisions produces different behavior than the reverse order, especially in corner collision scenarios. Most successful platformers resolve X-axis movement first (horizontal collision against walls) then Y-axis movement (vertical collision with floors/ceilings) to create predictable corner behavior that players can learn and exploit skillfully.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Frame-Rate Dependent Physics Calculations</strong>\nMany beginning game developers write physics code that assumes a fixed framerate, such as <code>player.x += player.velocityX</code> without delta time scaling. This creates games that run faster or slower depending on the target machine&#39;s performance. On a 120fps display, the character moves twice as fast as intended. On a 30fps display during performance hitches, the character moves half speed. Always multiply movement and physics calculations by delta time: <code>player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime</code>. Test your game with artificially limited framerates to verify consistent behavior.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Gravity Values That Don&#39;t Match Jump Feel</strong>\nRealistic gravity (9.8 m/s²) typically feels too weak for platformer games, making jumps feel floaty and unresponsive. However, making gravity too strong creates characters that slam into the ground with uncomfortable speed. The solution is <strong>asymmetric gravity</strong>: apply stronger gravity when falling than when jumping up, and reduce gravity while the jump button is held for variable jump height. Typical values might be 1200 pixels/second² for falling, 800 pixels/second² for jumping up, and 400 pixels/second² while holding jump.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Collision Detection Without Separation Axis Handling</strong>\nNaive collision resolution that moves entities &quot;out of&quot; walls in a single direction often creates corner-clipping issues. When a character runs into an inside corner while falling, simultaneous X and Y collisions can cause the character to get pushed into the wall instead of sliding along it. Always resolve X-axis and Y-axis collisions as separate operations, typically handling horizontal movement first, then vertical movement. This creates predictable corner behavior that players can learn to expect.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Input Polling That Misses Quick Button Presses</strong>\nChecking button state once per frame (<code>if (jumpButton.isPressed)</code>) can miss quick button taps that occur between frames, especially on high framerate displays. Implement <strong>input buffering</strong> that remembers button presses for several frames, allowing the physics system to respond to inputs that occurred slightly before the optimal time. Store button press events in a queue and consume them when appropriate game conditions are met (like landing on ground after requesting a jump in mid-air).</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>Building a 2D platformer requires careful selection of libraries and tools that support real-time graphics rendering, precise timing control, and responsive input handling.

Think of this goals definition as drawing the boundaries of a game world - everything inside these boundaries represents the core mechanics that define a solid platformer experience, while everything outside represents advanced features that could distract from mastering the fundamentals. Just as a well-designed level guides the player through a focused experience without overwhelming them with too many mechanics at once, our engine goals create a focused learning path through game development concepts.</p>\n<p>The primary challenge in scoping a platformer engine lies in the interconnected nature of game systems. Unlike many software projects where components can be built independently, game systems form a tightly coupled web where physics affects collision detection, which affects entity behavior, which affects input responsiveness. Our goals must ensure each system receives adequate attention while maintaining clear boundaries that prevent feature creep from derailing the core learning experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-engine-goals\">Core Engine Goals</h3>\n<p>The platformer engine must deliver a complete, playable game experience that demonstrates professional-level game development patterns while remaining approachable for intermediate developers. Our goals focus on three primary pillars: responsive controls, reliable physics simulation, and extensible architecture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Focus on Theatrical Physics Over Realistic Simulation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Game physics can prioritize either physical realism or player experience, with most successful platformers choosing the latter</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Realistic physics with proper mass, friction coefficients, and momentum conservation</li>\n<li>Simplified theatrical physics optimized for responsive controls and predictable behavior</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with realistic base physics but overrides for specific gameplay situations</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement theatrical physics throughout the engine</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Platformers require precise, predictable movement where players can develop muscle memory. Realistic physics often feels &quot;slippery&quot; or unpredictable, making precise jumping and movement difficult. Professional platformers like Super Mario Bros. and Celeste use highly tuned, unrealistic physics that prioritize feel over accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Simpler implementation with fewer edge cases, better player experience, but physics knowledge won&#39;t transfer directly to simulation applications</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Physics Goal</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Learning Outcome</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Frame-rate Independence</strong></td>\n<td>Delta time scaling for all movement and physics calculations</td>\n<td>Understanding time-based vs frame-based simulation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Responsive Movement</strong></td>\n<td>Immediate acceleration/deceleration without realistic momentum</td>\n<td>Mastering input handling and player control systems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Predictable Jumping</strong></td>\n<td>Consistent jump height with variable duration control</td>\n<td>Learning jump mechanics design patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Reliable Collision</strong></td>\n<td>AABB collision with penetration resolution</td>\n<td>Understanding geometric collision detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Gravity Simulation</strong></td>\n<td>Constant downward acceleration with terminal velocity</td>\n<td>Implementing basic physics integration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The engine must handle the fundamental physics loop that drives all platformer gameplay: applying forces (gravity, input acceleration), updating velocities based on those forces, updating positions based on velocity, detecting collisions in the new positions, and resolving any overlaps by adjusting positions and velocities. This cycle repeats every frame and must remain stable across different hardware performance levels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: The order of physics operations matters tremendously. Updating position before resolving collisions can cause tunneling through thin walls. Resolving X and Y axis collisions simultaneously can cause corner-clipping artifacts. Our implementation must establish a consistent, well-tested update order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Movement Goal</th>\n<th>Specific Requirement</th>\n<th>Quality Metric</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Horizontal Movement</strong></td>\n<td>Left/right arrow keys provide immediate response</td>\n<td>Player reaches full speed within 3 frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Jump Mechanics</strong></td>\n<td>Space bar initiates jump, variable height with hold duration</td>\n<td>60% height difference between tap and held jump</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Coyote Time</strong></td>\n<td>Allow jumping for 100ms after leaving platform edge</td>\n<td>Players can successfully make edge jumps consistently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Input Buffering</strong></td>\n<td>Accept jump input 100ms before landing</td>\n<td>No missed jumps due to timing precision</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ground Detection</strong></td>\n<td>Accurate detection of when player contacts solid surfaces</td>\n<td>Zero false positives or negatives in collision tests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"collision-system-goals\">Collision System Goals</h3>\n<p>The collision detection system forms the foundation that enables all meaningful player-world interaction. Think of collision detection as the sensory system of our game world - it must accurately perceive when objects occupy the same space and respond appropriately. Unlike real-world physics where objects naturally resist interpenetration, our digital world allows objects to overlap freely unless we explicitly detect and resolve these situations.</p>\n<p>Our collision system must balance accuracy with performance, handling the common case of a single player entity moving through a tile-based world efficiently while maintaining precision for gameplay-critical interactions. The system should prevent all major collision artifacts that would break player immersion: tunneling through walls at high speeds, getting stuck in corners, sliding along surfaces unintentionally, or falling through floors due to floating-point precision errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate X and Y Axis Collision Resolution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When an entity moves diagonally and collides with a corner, resolving both axes simultaneously can cause unpredictable behavior</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Simultaneous X/Y resolution using vector projection to nearest surface</li>\n<li>Separate axis resolution handling X movement then Y movement independently</li>\n<li>Swept collision detection preventing overlap entirely</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement separate axis collision resolution</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Separate axis resolution provides predictable behavior in corner cases and simpler implementation. Players can understand that hitting a wall stops horizontal movement while allowing continued falling, which feels intuitive. Swept collision is more accurate but significantly more complex to implement correctly.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Some unrealistic behavior (sliding along walls during diagonal impacts) but much simpler debugging and more predictable gameplay</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Goal</th>\n<th>Technical Implementation</th>\n<th>Player Experience</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Accurate Detection</strong></td>\n<td>AABB intersection testing with floating-point precision handling</td>\n<td>No glitching through solid surfaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tunneling Prevention</strong></td>\n<td>Maximum movement distance per frame based on entity size</td>\n<td>No passing through walls at high speeds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Corner Handling</strong></td>\n<td>X-axis collision resolved before Y-axis collision</td>\n<td>Predictable sliding behavior at corners</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>One-way Platforms</strong></td>\n<td>Collision testing only when moving downward</td>\n<td>Jump-through platforms work as expected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tile Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td>Only test collision against nearby tiles based on movement vector</td>\n<td>60fps performance with large levels</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The collision system must integrate seamlessly with our physics simulation, providing accurate feedback that the physics system can use to adjust velocities and positions. When the player hits a wall while moving right, the collision system detects the overlap, calculates the penetration distance, and provides this information so physics can set horizontal velocity to zero and adjust position to resolve the overlap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-system-goals\">Entity System Goals</h3>\n<p>The entity system provides the foundation for all interactive objects in our game world, from the player character to enemies to collectible items. Think of entities as actors on a stage - each has a position, appearance, and behavior, but they all follow common patterns for how they exist and interact within the world. Our entity system must provide a consistent framework that makes it easy to create new types of game objects while ensuring they integrate properly with physics, collision, and rendering systems.</p>\n<p>The challenge lies in creating an entity architecture that remains simple enough for learning purposes while being flexible enough to support the diverse behaviors required by different game objects. The player entity needs complex input handling and state management, enemies need AI behavior and patrol logic, while static platforms need only position and collision properties.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Entity Goal</th>\n<th>Architecture Decision</th>\n<th>Implementation Benefits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Unified Interface</strong></td>\n<td>Common <code>Entity</code> base with position, velocity, dimensions</td>\n<td>Consistent collision and physics handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Polymorphic Behavior</strong></td>\n<td>Virtual <code>update()</code> and <code>render()</code> methods per entity type</td>\n<td>Easy to add new entity types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Component Integration</strong></td>\n<td>Direct integration with physics, collision, and input systems</td>\n<td>No complex message passing or event systems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>State Management</strong></td>\n<td>Simple state variables (onGround, facingDirection, health)</td>\n<td>Clear debugging and predictable behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td>Fixed-size arrays for entity storage rather than dynamic allocation</td>\n<td>Predictable performance characteristics</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Inheritance-based Entity System Over Component Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Game entities can be structured using inheritance (Player extends Entity) or composition (Entity contains MovementComponent, RenderComponent)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Component-based architecture with separate systems for each component type</li>\n<li>Inheritance-based system with Entity base class and specialized subclasses</li>\n<li>Data-oriented design with separate arrays for each entity property</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use inheritance-based entity system</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: For a learning project with limited entity types (Player, Enemy, Platform), inheritance provides simpler mental model and easier debugging. Component systems shine with dozens of entity types and complex interactions, but add significant complexity for minimal benefit in our scope.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Less flexible for complex games but much easier to understand, debug, and extend for our specific requirements</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"level-system-goals\">Level System Goals</h3>\n<p>The level system transforms static tile data into interactive game environments, providing the spatial framework within which all gameplay occurs. Think of the level system as the stage designer for our platformer - it defines not just where walls and platforms exist, but also where players spawn, where enemies patrol, and how the camera should frame the action. Our level system must balance simplicity of authoring with flexibility of design, enabling rapid iteration on level layouts while supporting the collision and rendering requirements of other systems.</p>\n<p>The tile-based approach provides natural advantages for collision detection and memory efficiency, allowing us to represent large game worlds using compact grid data while providing fast spatial lookup for collision testing. Each tile position can contain multiple properties: visual appearance, collision behavior, and gameplay semantics like checkpoint activation or enemy spawn points.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level Goal</th>\n<th>Data Structure</th>\n<th>Gameplay Support</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Tile-based Geometry</strong></td>\n<td>2D integer array mapping positions to tile types</td>\n<td>Fast collision lookup and memory efficiency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Visual Representation</strong></td>\n<td>Sprite indices for each tile supporting animated tiles</td>\n<td>Rich visual environments with minimal data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Collision Properties</strong></td>\n<td>Per-tile collision flags (solid, one-way, ladder, hazard)</td>\n<td>Diverse platform and obstacle behaviors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Spawn Management</strong></td>\n<td>Dedicated spawn points for player and enemy placement</td>\n<td>Consistent level initialization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Checkpoint System</strong></td>\n<td>Checkpoint tiles with activation state tracking</td>\n<td>Death recovery and progress preservation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The level system must integrate closely with our collision detection, providing efficient spatial queries that allow entities to quickly determine which tiles they might be colliding with based on their current position and movement vector. This spatial partitioning eliminates the need to test collision against every tile in the level, maintaining performance even with large environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"input-system-goals\">Input System Goals</h3>\n<p>The input system serves as the critical bridge between player intention and game response, determining whether our platformer feels responsive and precise or sluggish and frustrating. Think of input handling as the nervous system of our game - it must capture player intentions accurately, respond with minimal latency, and provide the sophisticated buffering and state management that enables advanced platformer techniques like coyote time and jump buffering.</p>\n<p>Modern platformers require input systems that go far beyond simple key polling, implementing temporal buffers that remember recent inputs and sophisticated state tracking that enables complex move sequences. Our input system must feel responsive at 60fps while remaining frame-rate independent, ensuring consistent behavior across different hardware configurations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Input Buffering with Temporal Windows</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Precise platforming requires forgiving input timing, as human reaction time and finger coordination have natural variance</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Direct key polling with no temporal assistance</li>\n<li>Input buffering that remembers key presses for short time windows</li>\n<li>Predictive input processing that anticipates player intentions</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement input buffering with 100ms temporal windows</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Professional platformers use buffering to reduce frustration from missed inputs due to timing precision. A 100ms buffer allows the game to register a jump input slightly before landing, making controls feel more responsive without compromising challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex input state management but significantly improved player experience and control responsiveness</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Input Goal</th>\n<th>Implementation Strategy</th>\n<th>Player Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Low Latency Response</strong></td>\n<td>Process input at start of game loop, before physics</td>\n<td>Immediate visual feedback to player actions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Jump Buffering</strong></td>\n<td>Store jump inputs for 100ms before landing detection</td>\n<td>No missed jumps due to precise timing requirements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Coyote Time</strong></td>\n<td>Allow jumping for 100ms after leaving platform</td>\n<td>Forgiveness for edge jump timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-key Support</strong></td>\n<td>Simultaneous processing of movement and jump inputs</td>\n<td>Complex maneuvers like running jumps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Configurable Mapping</strong></td>\n<td>Abstract action system supporting keyboard and gamepad</td>\n<td>Accessibility and player preference support</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"rendering-system-goals\">Rendering System Goals</h3>\n<p>The rendering system transforms our abstract game state into visual representation, providing the immediate feedback that enables players to understand and respond to the game world. Think of rendering as the lighting and cinematography department of our game production - it must not only display objects accurately but frame them in ways that support gameplay comprehension and emotional engagement.</p>\n<p>Our rendering system must balance visual appeal with performance constraints, maintaining smooth 60fps animation while supporting the sprite animation, tile rendering, and camera movement that brings our platformer world to life. The system should provide clear visual hierarchy that helps players distinguish between different types of game objects and understand their interactive properties.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rendering Goal</th>\n<th>Visual Requirement</th>\n<th>Technical Implementation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Sprite Animation</strong></td>\n<td>Smooth character animation with 8-12 frames per cycle</td>\n<td>Frame-based animation system with configurable timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tile Rendering</strong></td>\n<td>Efficient drawing of large tile-based environments</td>\n<td>Batch rendering of visible tiles only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Camera System</strong></td>\n<td>Smooth following of player with boundary constraints</td>\n<td>Interpolated camera movement with dead zones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Visual Feedback</strong></td>\n<td>Clear indication of interactive elements and hazards</td>\n<td>Distinct sprite families and animation states</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Performance</strong></td>\n<td>Consistent 60fps with minimal frame drops</td>\n<td>Culling of off-screen objects and efficient draw calls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Defining what our platformer engine will <strong>not</strong> include proves as important as defining its core features.

the entire platformer engine</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of a 2D platformer engine as a <strong>theater production</strong>. The game loop is the director coordinating all the actors (entities), the physics engine is the choreographer ensuring smooth movement, the collision system is the stage manager preventing actors from walking through walls, and the rendering system is the lighting crew making everything visible to the audience. Each system has a specific role, but they must work in perfect synchronization to create the illusion of a living, responsive world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"System Architecture Overview\"></p>\n<p>The architecture of our 2D platformer engine follows a <strong>component-based design</strong> where distinct systems handle specific aspects of game simulation. This approach provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining the tight coupling necessary for real-time performance. The central challenge is orchestrating these systems to run within a 16.67ms budget per frame to maintain 60fps gameplay.</p>\n<p>The engine operates on a <strong>push-based architecture</strong> where the game loop drives all other systems through explicit update calls. This differs from event-driven architectures and provides predictable performance characteristics essential for real-time games. Each frame follows a strict sequence: input processing, physics simulation, collision resolution, and rendering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Component-Based Architecture with Central Game Loop</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to manage complex interactions between physics, rendering, input, and game logic while maintaining 60fps performance</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Monolithic game object with all functionality</li>\n<li>Event-driven system with message passing</li>\n<li>Component-based system with central coordination</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Component-based system with central game loop coordination</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides clear separation of concerns for maintainability while avoiding the unpredictable timing of event systems.

Understanding these boundaries is crucial for maintaining code organization as the project grows.</p>\n<p>The <strong>GameLoop</strong> serves as the master coordinator, managing frame timing and orchestrating all other systems. It owns the core timing data and ensures frame-rate independence through delta time calculations. Think of it as the metronome in an orchestra - it sets the tempo that all other systems follow.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Data Ownership</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibilities</th>\n<th>Input Dependencies</th>\n<th>Output Products</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>GameLoop</td>\n<td>Frame timing, delta time, FPS targets</td>\n<td>Frame rate management, system coordination</td>\n<td>None (root component)</td>\n<td>Delta time, frame pacing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>InputManager</td>\n<td>Key states, input buffer, timing</td>\n<td>Input capture, buffering, state tracking</td>\n<td>Hardware input events</td>\n<td>Processed input states</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity System</td>\n<td>Entity positions, properties, states</td>\n<td>Entity lifecycle, property management</td>\n<td>Physics updates, collision results</td>\n<td>Entity state changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Physics Engine</td>\n<td>Velocities, accelerations, constraints</td>\n<td>Movement simulation, gravity application</td>\n<td>Entity states, input commands</td>\n<td>Updated positions, velocities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision System</td>\n<td>Collision geometry, tile data</td>\n<td>Intersection testing, penetration resolution</td>\n<td>Entity bounds, level geometry</td>\n<td>Collision events, corrections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rendering System</td>\n<td>Sprites, animations, camera state</td>\n<td>Visual presentation, frame composition</td>\n<td>Entity positions, level data</td>\n<td>Rendered frame</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>InputManager</strong> acts as the interface between hardware input and game logic. It maintains a dual responsibility: tracking current key states for immediate response and buffering recent inputs to improve perceived responsiveness. This system must handle the asynchronous nature of user input within the synchronous game loop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight here is that input buffering transforms the user experience from &quot;did the game detect my keypress at exactly the right frame?&quot; to &quot;did I press the key around the right time?&quot; This small window of forgiveness dramatically improves the feel of responsive controls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Entity System</strong> manages all game objects including the player, enemies, and interactive elements. Each entity carries both physical properties (position, velocity) and game-specific state (health, AI behavior). This system provides the common interface that allows physics and collision systems to operate on any entity uniformly.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Physics Engine</strong> implements theatrical physics - a simplified simulation focused on game feel rather than realism. It owns the fundamental constants like gravity and terminal velocity, applying them consistently across all entities. The physics system transforms input intentions into velocity changes and integrates those velocities into position updates.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Physics System Overreach</strong>\nMany developers make the physics system responsible for input processing or collision response. This creates circular dependencies and makes testing difficult. The physics system should only handle the mathematical simulation - velocity integration, gravity application, and constraint enforcement. Input interpretation belongs in the input system, and collision response belongs in the collision system.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Collision System</strong> bridges the gap between the continuous physics simulation and the discrete tile-based world geometry. It performs spatial queries to determine which tiles an entity overlaps, calculates intersection depths, and provides correction vectors. This system must handle the inherent precision issues of floating-point physics interacting with integer tile coordinates.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Rendering System</strong> transforms the abstract game state into visual presentation. It owns the camera, sprite resources, and the final composition pipeline. This system must interpolate between discrete entity positions to create smooth visual movement and manage the z-ordering of visual elements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate Physics and Collision Systems</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to handle both continuous physics simulation and discrete tile-based collision detection</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Combined physics-collision system</li>\n<li>Physics handles movement, separate collision detection</li>\n<li>Collision system owns all spatial queries, physics handles temporal updates</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate systems with physics handling temporal changes and collision handling spatial queries</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Physics operates in continuous time with velocities and accelerations, while collision operates in discrete space with tile grids. Different mathematical domains require different optimization strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Cleaner separation of concerns and easier optimization of each domain, but requires careful coordination of update order</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"data-flow-and-system-interactions\">Data Flow and System Interactions</h3>\n<p>The data flow through the architecture follows a strict sequence each frame, ensuring deterministic behavior essential for gameplay consistency. Understanding this flow helps identify where performance bottlenecks may occur and how changes in one system affect others.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Input Processing Phase</strong>: The <code>InputManager</code> captures hardware events and updates key states, while processing buffered inputs from previous frames</li>\n<li><strong>Physics Update Phase</strong>: The physics engine applies gravity, processes movement commands, and integrates velocities into position changes using delta time</li>\n<li><strong>Collision Detection Phase</strong>: The collision system tests entity bounding boxes against tile geometry and other entities</li>\n<li><strong>Collision Resolution Phase</strong>: Detected collisions are resolved by separating overlapping entities and updating their positions and velocities</li>\n<li><strong>Game Logic Phase</strong>: Entity-specific logic processes AI behavior, player state changes, and game rule enforcement</li>\n<li><strong>Rendering Phase</strong>: The rendering system composites the final frame using updated entity positions and camera state</li>\n</ol>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect Update Order</strong>\nProcessing collision detection before physics updates can cause entities to &quot;stick&quot; to surfaces due to stale velocity data.

The <code>GameLoop</code> serves as the entry point and coordinator, while <code>InputManager</code> provides input services to all other systems. These components have no dependencies on game-specific logic.</p>\n<p>The <strong>entities/</strong> directory encapsulates all game object behavior and state management. The base <code>Entity</code> class provides common properties like position and velocity, while specific classes like <code>Player</code> and <code>Enemy</code> implement specialized behavior. The <code>EntityManager</code> handles entity lifecycle operations like spawning and cleanup.</p>\n<p>The <strong>physics/</strong> directory contains the mathematical simulation systems responsible for movement and forces. These components operate on entity properties but don&#39;t directly modify entity state - they calculate new values that are applied by the entity system. This separation enables easier testing and tuning of physics behavior.</p>\n<p>The <strong>collision/</strong> directory handles all spatial query operations including entity-entity intersection testing and entity-environment collision detection. The <code>CollisionSystem</code> coordinates between different collision detection strategies, while specialized classes like <code>TileMap</code> handle specific collision geometry types.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Circular Dependencies</strong>\nAvoid having the physics system directly modify collision system state or vice versa. Instead, use the entity system as the intermediary - physics calculates new positions, collision detects problems with those positions, and entities apply the final resolved state. This prevents circular imports and makes the data flow explicit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-initialization-and-coordination\">System Initialization and Coordination</h3>\n<p>The startup sequence establishes the proper dependency relationships between systems and ensures all components are ready before the first frame update. This initialization order prevents race conditions and missing dependencies that can cause subtle bugs.</p>\n<p>The initialization follows a <strong>dependency-first order</strong> where each system initializes its dependencies before setting up its own state:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Constants and Configuration Loading</strong>: Load game constants, physics parameters, and configuration settings</li>\n<li><strong>Core System Initialization</strong>: Initialize <code>GameLoop</code> timing systems and <code>InputManager</code> event listeners</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Loading</strong>: Load sprites, tile graphics, and audio assets into memory</li>\n<li><strong>Level System Setup</strong>: Initialize <code>TileMap</code> collision geometry and <code>LevelLoader</code> capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>Physics Engine Initialization</strong>: Set up physics constants and integration parameters</li>\n<li><strong>Collision System Setup</strong>: Build spatial acceleration structures and collision geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Entity System Initialization</strong>: Create <code>EntityManager</code> and spawn initial entities</li>\n<li><strong>Rendering System Setup</strong>: Initialize graphics context, camera, and rendering pipeline</li>\n<li><strong>Game Loop Start</strong>: Begin the main update-render cycle</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Initialization Phase</th>\n<th>Systems Involved</th>\n<th>Dependencies</th>\n<th>Failure Recovery</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Asset Loading</td>\n<td>Renderer, Entity System</td>\n<td>File system access</td>\n<td>Fallback to default sprites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level Loading</td>\n<td>TileMap, EntityManager</td>\n<td>Asset loading complete</td>\n<td>Load default test level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Physics Setup</td>\n<td>PhysicsEngine</td>\n<td>Constants loaded</td>\n<td>Use hardcoded defaults</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Preparation</td>\n<td>CollisionSystem</td>\n<td>Level and physics ready</td>\n<td>Disable collision temporarily</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Game Loop Start</td>\n<td>All systems</td>\n<td>Everything initialized</td>\n<td>Graceful error display</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The coordination between systems during runtime follows a <strong>message-passing pattern</strong> where systems communicate through well-defined interfaces rather than direct state modification. This approach maintains the component boundaries while enabling the necessary inter-system communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight is that initialization order reflects runtime dependencies - systems that provide services to others must initialize first, while systems that consume multiple services initialize last. This creates a natural hierarchy that prevents circular dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"performance-considerations-and-optimization-points\">Performance Considerations and Optimization Points</h3>\n<p>The architecture includes several points where performance optimization becomes critical for maintaining 60fps gameplay. Understanding these bottlenecks early helps structure code to avoid performance problems as the game grows in complexity.</p>\n<p>The <strong>primary performance bottleneck</strong> is the collision detection system, which must test entity bounding boxes against potentially hundreds of tile positions each frame. The tile-based collision system provides natural spatial partitioning, but careful implementation is required to avoid unnecessary intersection tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory allocation patterns</strong> significantly impact frame rate consistency due to garbage collection pauses. The architecture minimizes allocations by reusing object pools for frequently created items like collision results and vector calculations. Each system pre-allocates working memory during initialization rather than creating objects during frame updates.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>System</th>\n<th>Primary Bottleneck</th>\n<th>Optimization Strategy</th>\n<th>Performance Target</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Physics Engine</td>\n<td>Vector math operations</td>\n<td>Object pooling, in-place calculations</td>\n<td>&lt; 2ms per frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Detection</td>\n<td>Tile intersection tests</td>\n<td>Spatial partitioning, early exit</td>\n<td>&lt; 4ms per frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rendering</td>\n<td>Sprite draw calls</td>\n<td>Batching, culling</td>\n<td>&lt; 8ms per frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity Updates</td>\n<td>AI behavior processing</td>\n<td>State machine optimization</td>\n<td>&lt; 2ms per frame</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>spiral of death</strong> problem occurs when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, causing subsequent frames to fall further behind. The architecture prevents this through <code>maxDeltaTime</code> clamping, which limits the physics simulation step size even if the actual frame time is longer.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Premature Optimization</strong>\nAvoid optimizing systems before they become bottlenecks. The architecture provides optimization points, but focus first on correctness and maintainability. Profile the actual performance with realistic game content before adding complexity for performance gains.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The implementation of the high-level architecture requires careful attention to initialization order and interface design.

Just as an architect needs precise drawings showing the dimensions and properties of every room, door, and fixture before construction begins, a game engine requires carefully designed data structures to represent every entity, physics property, and piece of level geometry before any gameplay code can function correctly.</p>\n<p>The data model serves as the <strong>contract</strong> between all game systems. The physics engine needs to know exactly where entities are located and how fast they&#39;re moving. The collision system needs precise dimensional data to detect overlaps. The rendering system needs sprite and visibility information to draw everything correctly. Without a well-designed data model, these systems would be unable to communicate effectively, leading to inconsistent behavior and hard-to-debug issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-data-structure\">Entity Data Structure</h3>\n<p>The <code>Entity</code> data structure serves as the <strong>universal language</strong> for representing any interactive object in the game world. Think of an entity as a <strong>game object passport</strong> - it contains all the essential information that other systems need to know about that object, from its current location and movement speed to its visual appearance and collision properties.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> The entity-component-system (ECS) pattern is popular in larger games, but for a platformer learning project, a simple inheritance-based entity system provides clearer understanding of object relationships and responsibilities. The additional complexity of ECS would distract from learning core physics and collision concepts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Unified Entity Base Class</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to represent diverse game objects (player, enemies, platforms, collectibles) with shared behavior like position tracking, physics simulation, and collision detection</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Separate classes for each object type with no shared interface</li>\n<li>Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with composition</li>\n<li>Inheritance-based system with Entity base class</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Inheritance-based Entity base class with specialized subclasses</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides code reuse for common properties while maintaining clear object relationships. ECS adds complexity that obscures learning goals, while separate classes lead to code duplication.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables shared physics and collision logic, but may require refactoring if object behavior becomes too diverse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The core <code>Entity</code> structure contains all properties needed for physics simulation, collision detection, and rendering:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>x</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current horizontal position in world coordinates (pixels)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>y</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current vertical position in world coordinates (pixels)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>width</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Entity collision box width in pixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>height</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Entity collision box height in pixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>velocityX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current horizontal velocity in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>velocityY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current vertical velocity in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>accelerationX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Horizontal acceleration in pixels per second squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>accelerationY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Vertical acceleration in pixels per second squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>onGround</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entity is currently touching solid ground</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>solid</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether other entities should collide with this entity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sprite</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Visual representation data including texture and animation frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>visible</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entity should be rendered to screen</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Position and Dimensions</strong>: The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates represent the entity&#39;s position in world space, typically anchored at the top-left corner for consistency with most 2D rendering systems. The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> define the entity&#39;s collision boundaries - these may differ from the sprite dimensions to provide more forgiving collision detection or to create entities that are larger or smaller than their visual representation.</p>\n<p><strong>Velocity and Acceleration</strong>: The velocity fields track how many pixels the entity moves per second in each direction. Positive <code>velocityY</code> indicates downward movement (following screen coordinate conventions), while negative values indicate upward movement. Acceleration represents forces acting on the entity - gravity typically applies negative acceleration to <code>accelerationY</code>, while input handling might apply acceleration to <code>accelerationX</code> for responsive movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Physics State</strong>: The <code>onGround</code> flag is crucial for jump mechanics and determines whether the entity is affected by gravity. This prevents entities from accelerating downward indefinitely when resting on solid surfaces. The collision system sets this flag based on contact with solid tiles or platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>Collision Properties</strong>: The <code>solid</code> flag determines collision behavior - solid entities block movement of other entities, while non-solid entities (like collectibles or decorative objects) can overlap with others. This allows for different interaction types without requiring separate collision detection paths.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Properties</strong>: The <code>sprite</code> object contains texture references, animation frame data, and rendering parameters. The <code>visible</code> flag allows entities to exist in the world without being drawn, useful for invisible collision volumes, checkpoints, or temporarily hidden objects.</p>\n<p>The <code>Entity</code> interface defines the standard methods that all game objects must implement:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>update</code></td>\n<td><code>deltaTime: number, inputManager: InputManager</code></td>\n<td>void</td>\n<td>Updates entity state for one frame using elapsed time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getBoundingBox</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>Rectangle</code></td>\n<td>Returns current collision rectangle in world coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>render</code></td>\n<td><code>renderer: object</code></td>\n<td>void</td>\n<td>Draws entity to screen using provided rendering context</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Update Method</strong>: The <code>update</code> method receives delta time for frame-rate independent calculations and an input manager for handling player controls. Each entity type implements this method differently - the player entity processes keyboard input and applies movement forces, while enemy entities run AI behavior logic. The method should modify the entity&#39;s position, velocity, and state based on elapsed time and current conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounding Box Method</strong>: The <code>getBoundingBox</code> method returns a <code>Rectangle</code> structure representing the entity&#39;s current collision area. This rectangle uses the entity&#39;s current <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> position along with its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> to create an axis-aligned bounding box for collision detection. The collision system calls this method to determine if entities overlap.</p>\n<p><strong>Render Method</strong>: The <code>render</code> method receives a rendering context and draws the entity&#39;s visual representation to the screen. This method should handle sprite positioning, animation frame selection, and any visual effects. The rendering system calls this method for all visible entities during the draw phase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"player-entity-specialization\">Player Entity Specialization</h3>\n<p>The <code>Player</code> entity extends the base <code>Entity</code> with additional properties specific to player character behavior:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>health</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current player health points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>coyoteTimer</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time remaining for coyote time jump window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpBuffer</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time remaining for jump input buffering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>invulnerabilityTimer</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time remaining of invincibility after taking damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checkpointX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Last activated checkpoint horizontal position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checkpointY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Last activated checkpoint vertical position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Coyote Time Implementation</strong>: The <code>coyoteTimer</code> starts counting down when the player leaves solid ground without jumping. While this timer is active, the player can still initiate a jump even though they&#39;re technically in mid-air. This creates more forgiving jump mechanics that feel responsive to players.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Buffering</strong>: The <code>jumpBuffer</code> timer activates when the player presses the jump button while in mid-air. If the player lands before this timer expires, the jump automatically executes. This prevents frustrating situations where the player pressed jump slightly too early before landing.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage and Respawn</strong>: The health system tracks player vitality, while <code>invulnerabilityTimer</code> provides brief immunity after taking damage to prevent rapid damage accumulation. The checkpoint coordinates store the last safe position for respawning after death.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enemy-entity-specialization\">Enemy Entity Specialization</h3>\n<p>Enemy entities require additional data for AI behavior and patrol patterns:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>patrolStartX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Left boundary of patrol movement area</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>patrolEndX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Right boundary of patrol movement area</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>patrolSpeed</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Movement speed during patrol in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>patrolDirection</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current movement direction (-1 for left, 1 for right)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>attackDamage</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Damage dealt to player on contact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Patrol System</strong>: The patrol boundaries define a movement area for the enemy. The AI system moves the enemy between these points, reversing direction when reaching either boundary. This creates predictable but challenging movement patterns for players to navigate around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"level-data-structure\">Level Data Structure</h3>\n<p>Think of the level data structure as a <strong>digital blueprint</strong> for the game world. Just as a city planner uses a grid system to organize streets, buildings, and zones, the platformer uses a tile-based grid to organize collision geometry, visual elements, and interactive objects in a way that&#39;s both memory-efficient and easy to edit.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision: Tile-Based Level Representation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need efficient storage and collision detection for large 2D game levels with repeating geometric patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Vector-based collision shapes with arbitrary polygons</li>\n<li>Tile-based grid system with fixed-size squares</li>\n<li>Hybrid system with tiles for background and vectors for special collision</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Pure tile-based system with 32x32 pixel tiles</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simplifies collision detection to grid lookups, enables easy level editing, reduces memory usage through tile reuse, and matches common platformer design patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Limits level geometry to grid-aligned shapes but provides predictable performance and straightforward collision algorithms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The level representation centers around a two-dimensional grid where each cell contains a tile identifier. This approach provides several advantages: collision detection reduces to simple grid lookups, memory usage remains constant regardless of level size, and level editing becomes intuitive through tile placement tools.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>width</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Level width in tiles (not pixels)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>height</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Level height in tiles (not pixels)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tileSize</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Size of each tile in pixels (typically 32)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tiles</code></td>\n<td>number[][]</td>\n<td>2D array of tile IDs, indexed as [y][x]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>entities</code></td>\n<td>Entity[]</td>\n<td>Array of all non-tile entities in the level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checkpoints</code></td>\n<td>Vector2[]</td>\n<td>Array of checkpoint positions for player respawn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>spawnPoint</code></td>\n<td>Vector2</td>\n<td>Initial player spawn position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Grid Dimensions</strong>: The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields specify the level size in tile units. A level with <code>width: 50</code> and <code>height: 20</code> contains 1000 total tiles and measures 1600x640 pixels when using 32-pixel tiles. This tile-based measurement simplifies level editing and collision calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>Tile Array Structure</strong>: The <code>tiles</code> array uses [y][x] indexing to match mathematical coordinate conventions and simplify rendering loops. Each tile ID corresponds to a tile type definition that specifies collision properties and visual appearance. A value of 0 typically represents empty space, while positive integers represent different tile types.</p>\n<p><strong>Entity Placement</strong>: The <code>entities</code> array contains all dynamic objects that don&#39;t conform to the tile grid - enemies, moving platforms, collectibles, and interactive objects. These entities have precise pixel positioning and can move freely without grid constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint System</strong>: The <code>checkpoints</code> array stores positions where players can respawn after death. Each checkpoint activates when the player touches it, updating the player&#39;s respawn point. The level designer places checkpoints at safe locations before challenging sections.</p>\n<p>The tile system requires a tile type definition structure to map tile IDs to gameplay behavior:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Unique identifier for this tile type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>solid</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entities collide with this tile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>oneWay</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether tile only blocks movement from above</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sprite</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Visual representation for rendering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>deadly</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether touching this tile kills the player</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Collision Types</strong>: Solid tiles block entity movement from all directions. One-way platforms allow entities to pass through from below but provide solid support when approached from above. Deadly tiles (like spikes) trigger player death on contact while also blocking movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Level Loading and Coordinate Systems</strong></p>\n<p>The level system provides methods for converting between different coordinate spaces:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>getTileAt</code></td>\n<td><code>x: number, y: number</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Returns tile ID at world coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getTileAtGrid</code></td>\n<td><code>tileX: number, tileY: number</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Returns tile ID at grid coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>worldToGrid</code></td>\n<td><code>x: number, y: number</code></td>\n<td>Vector2</td>\n<td>Converts world pixels to grid coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>gridToWorld</code></td>\n<td><code>tileX: number, tileY: number</code></td>\n<td>Vector2</td>\n<td>Converts grid coordinates to world pixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>isTileSolid</code></td>\n<td><code>tileX: number, tileY: number</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Checks if tile blocks movement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Coordinate Conversion</strong>: The <code>worldToGrid</code> method divides world pixel coordinates by <code>TILE_SIZE</code> and floors the result to get grid indices. The <code>gridToWorld</code> method multiplies grid coordinates by <code>TILE_SIZE</code> to get pixel positions. These conversions are essential for collision detection algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong>Boundary Checking</strong>: All tile access methods must validate grid coordinates to prevent array bounds errors. Tiles outside the level boundaries should be treated as solid to prevent entities from escaping the playable area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Position and Velocity Confusion</strong>\nMany developers initially store position as integers and wonder why movement feels choppy or objects get stuck against walls. The entity position must use floating-point numbers to support smooth movement at any frame rate. When delta time is 16.67ms (60fps), an entity moving at 100 pixels/second should move 1.667 pixels per frame. Using integers would truncate this to 1 pixel, causing irregular movement speeds.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Coordinate System Inconsistency</strong><br>Mixing up coordinate systems leads to collision detection bugs. Screen coordinates use (0,0) at top-left with positive Y pointing down, while mathematical coordinates use positive Y pointing up. Choose one system consistently throughout the entire engine. Most 2D games use screen coordinates to match rendering APIs.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Tile Array Index Confusion</strong>\nIndexing the tile array as <code>tiles[x][y]</code> instead of <code>tiles[y][x]</code> causes crashes or incorrect collision detection. The outer array represents rows (Y coordinates), while inner arrays represent columns (X coordinates). Always use <code>tiles[row][column]</code> or <code>tiles[y][x]</code> to maintain consistency with 2D array conventions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Bounds Checking</strong>\nAccessing tiles outside the level boundaries causes array index errors and crashes. Always validate grid coordinates before array access:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>if (tileY &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; tileY &lt; height &amp;&amp; tileX &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; tileX &lt; width)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Treat out-of-bounds tiles as solid to prevent entities from escaping the level.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting Delta Time in Entity Updates</strong>\nHard-coding movement values in the update method creates frame-rate dependent behavior. An entity moving <code>x += 2</code> per frame moves at different speeds on 30fps vs 60fps displays. Always multiply movement by delta time: <code>x += velocityX * deltaTime</code> to maintain consistent speeds across different hardware.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The data model implementation requires careful attention to memory layout, coordinate precision, and type safety.

Just as a conductor keeps an orchestra synchronized with a steady tempo, the game loop coordinates all game systems—physics, input, collision detection, rendering—ensuring they work together harmoniously regardless of whether the game runs on a 60Hz monitor, a 144Hz gaming display, or a mobile device struggling at 30fps. Without proper time management, your platformer would feel sluggish on slow devices and uncontrollably fast on high-refresh displays, creating an inconsistent and frustrating player experience.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in game loop design is achieving <strong>frame-rate independence</strong>—ensuring that game behavior remains consistent regardless of the actual framerate. A naive approach might update physics by fixed amounts each frame, but this creates a disaster: on a 30fps device, the player falls at half the speed compared to a 60fps device. Professional games solve this through <strong>delta time</strong>—measuring the actual elapsed time between frames and scaling all time-dependent calculations accordingly.</p>\n<p>The second critical aspect is <strong>update order consistency</strong>. Game systems have dependencies: input must be processed before physics updates, physics must complete before collision resolution, and collision resolution must finish before rendering. Breaking this order leads to subtle but game-breaking bugs like input lag, visual glitches, or physics objects appearing to &quot;teleport&quot; through walls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"delta-time-system\">Delta Time System</h3>\n<p><strong>Delta time</strong> represents the elapsed duration between consecutive frames, typically measured in seconds or milliseconds. Think of delta time as a <strong>scaling factor</strong> that adapts your game&#39;s calculations to the actual passage of time. Instead of saying &quot;move 5 pixels this frame&quot; (which depends on framerate), you say &quot;move 300 pixels per second * delta time&quot;—automatically scaling movement based on how much real time has passed.</p>\n<p>The mathematical foundation is straightforward: if an object should move at 200 pixels per second, and 16.67 milliseconds have elapsed since the last frame (60fps), then the object moves 200 * 0.01667 = 3.33 pixels this frame. On a slower 30fps system with 33.33ms between frames, the same object moves 200 * 0.03333 = 6.67 pixels, maintaining the same visual speed to the player.</p>\n<p>However, delta time introduces several implementation challenges that can destabilize your physics simulation if not handled carefully.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Delta Time Calculation Method</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to measure elapsed time between frames for frame-rate independent updates</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>System clock difference between frames</li>\n<li>High-resolution performance timer</li>\n<li>Fixed timestep with accumulator</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: High-resolution performance timer with maximum delta clamping</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Performance timers provide microsecond precision needed for smooth physics. System clocks can jump backward or forward due to system adjustments. Fixed timestep adds complexity for this intermediate-level project.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables smooth physics across different framerates but requires careful handling of edge cases like window focus loss</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Precision</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Frame Independence</th>\n<th>Chosen</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>System clock difference</td>\n<td>Low (milliseconds)</td>\n<td>Simple</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance timer</td>\n<td>High (microseconds)</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fixed timestep + accumulator</td>\n<td>Perfect</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most dangerous delta time scenario is the <strong>spiral of death</strong>—when frame processing takes longer than the target frame time, creating increasingly large delta values that make the next frame even slower to process. For example, if a 60fps game (16.67ms target) takes 50ms to process one frame due to a performance spike, the next frame receives a delta of 50ms, potentially causing physics objects to move so far they tunnel through collision boundaries, triggering expensive collision recovery that makes the subsequent frame even slower.</p>\n<p>To prevent spiral of death scenarios, professional games implement <strong>maximum delta clamping</strong>—artificially limiting delta time to a reasonable maximum value, typically 33.33ms (equivalent to 30fps minimum). This means that during severe performance drops, the game world effectively runs in slow motion rather than becoming increasingly unstable.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Current Frame Time: 45ms (fps drop to ~22)\nUnclamped Delta: 45ms\nClamped Delta: min(45ms, 33.33ms) = 33.33ms\nResult: Game runs slightly slow but remains stable</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Another critical consideration is <strong>delta time precision</strong>. Using integer milliseconds introduces quantization errors that accumulate over time, causing objects to drift from their expected positions. Professional implementations use floating-point seconds with microsecond precision from high-resolution timers.</p>\n<p>The <code>GameLoop</code> data structure encapsulates all timing-related state and behavior:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>isRunning</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Controls main loop execution state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>lastFrameTime</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>High-precision timestamp of previous frame start</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>targetFPS</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Desired frames per second (typically 60)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>maxDeltaTime</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Maximum allowed delta to prevent spiral of death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>updateCallback</td>\n<td>function</td>\n<td>Game logic update function receiving delta time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>renderCallback</td>\n<td>function</td>\n<td>Rendering function called after updates complete</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The delta time calculation algorithm follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capture high-precision current time</strong> using the platform&#39;s performance timer (not system clock)</li>\n<li><strong>Calculate raw delta</strong> by subtracting the last frame time from current time</li>\n<li><strong>Apply maximum delta clamping</strong> to prevent spiral of death scenarios</li>\n<li><strong>Store current time</strong> as the last frame time for next iteration</li>\n<li><strong>Convert to seconds</strong> if necessary for consistent units across game systems</li>\n<li><strong>Pass delta to update systems</strong> for frame-rate independent calculations</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that delta time transforms your game from a frame-based simulation to a time-based simulation. This paradigm shift requires disciplined thinking: every time-dependent calculation must be multiplied by delta time, from physics movement to animation timers to particle system lifespans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"update-order-and-phases\">Update Order and Phases</h3>\n<p>The game loop execution follows a carefully orchestrated sequence of phases, each with specific responsibilities and dependencies. Think of this as an <strong>assembly line</strong> where each station must complete its work before passing the product to the next station. Breaking this order creates bugs that are often subtle and difficult to reproduce.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fgame-loop-cycle.svg\" alt=\"Game Loop Execution Cycle\"></p>\n<p>The standard update sequence ensures data consistency and predictable behavior:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Input Processing Phase</strong>: Capture and buffer all input events from the current frame</li>\n<li><strong>Entity Update Phase</strong>: Update entity logic, AI decisions, and state machines</li>\n<li><strong>Physics Update Phase</strong>: Apply forces, update velocities, and calculate new positions</li>\n<li><strong>Collision Detection Phase</strong>: Identify all intersections between entities and level geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Collision Resolution Phase</strong>: Separate overlapping objects and update collision state</li>\n<li><strong>Camera Update Phase</strong>: Adjust camera position based on player location and boundaries</li>\n<li><strong>Render Phase</strong>: Draw all visible entities and UI elements to the screen</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each phase operates on the complete results of the previous phase, ensuring consistency. For example, the collision detection phase sees the final positions calculated by physics, not intermediate values from partial updates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Single-Threaded Sequential Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Game systems have complex interdependencies and shared state</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Sequential single-threaded updates</li>\n<li>Parallel system updates with synchronization</li>\n<li>Job-based threading with dependency graphs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Sequential single-threaded updates for all systems</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Eliminates race conditions and simplifies debugging for intermediate developers.

This includes both immediate key states (for continuous actions like running) and buffered key presses (for discrete actions like jumping). Input buffering is particularly crucial for responsive platformer controls—players expect their jump input to register even if pressed slightly before landing.</p>\n<p>Input processing must occur before entity updates to ensure that player actions affect the current frame rather than being delayed by one frame. One-frame input delay creates a noticeably sluggish feel that frustrates players, especially in precision platforming sections.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Entity Update Phase</strong> processes game logic for all entities—player state machines, enemy AI decisions, trigger activation, and animation updates. Entities make decisions based on their current state and input, but they don&#39;t yet modify their positions or velocities. This separation allows AI systems to react to the player&#39;s current position without being affected by the player&#39;s movement during the same frame.</p>\n<p>During this phase, entities update their internal state machines, make AI decisions about movement direction, and prepare for physics updates. For example, the player entity determines whether to apply jump velocity based on ground state and input buffering, but the actual velocity change occurs in the physics phase.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Physics Update Phase</strong> applies all forces and updates entity positions based on current velocities and elapsed time. This phase implements the core platformer physics: gravity acceleration, horizontal movement, velocity damping, and terminal velocity clamping. All physics calculations use delta time for frame-rate independence.</p>\n<p>The physics update algorithm processes each entity:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Apply gravity acceleration</strong> to vertical velocity if not on ground</li>\n<li><strong>Apply horizontal forces</strong> from input or AI decisions</li>\n<li><strong>Apply velocity damping</strong> for air resistance and friction effects</li>\n<li><strong>Clamp velocities</strong> to terminal velocity limits</li>\n<li><strong>Update positions</strong> using velocity multiplied by delta time</li>\n<li><strong>Reset force accumulators</strong> for the next frame</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Collision Detection Phase</strong> identifies all intersections between entities and level geometry without modifying any positions. This phase uses AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) intersection tests against the tile-based level data, producing a list of collision pairs that need resolution.</p>\n<p>Collision detection operates on the positions calculated during physics update, ensuring consistent results. The system tests each entity against nearby tiles and other entities, building a comprehensive list of all overlaps that occurred due to movement during this frame.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Collision Resolution Phase</strong> separates overlapping objects and updates collision-related state like the <code>onGround</code> flag. This phase modifies entity positions to resolve penetration and updates velocities when entities hit solid surfaces. The resolution algorithm processes X-axis and Y-axis collisions separately to handle corner cases properly.</p>\n<p>Resolution order matters: Y-axis collisions (typically from falling onto platforms) are often resolved before X-axis collisions to ensure proper ground detection. This ordering prevents the player from getting stuck in corner configurations where simultaneous X and Y collisions occur.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Camera Update Phase</strong> calculates the camera position based on the player&#39;s final position after collision resolution. The camera system implements smooth following behavior with configurable constraints to prevent the camera from leaving the level boundaries or moving too abruptly during rapid player movement.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Render Phase</strong> draws all visual elements using the final positions and camera settings calculated in previous phases. This phase is purely output-focused and doesn&#39;t modify game state. Rendering includes sprite drawing, tilemap rendering, UI overlay, and debug visualization if enabled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A common mistake is mixing rendering with game logic updates. Rendering should be a pure function of the current game state—it observes and draws but never modifies entity positions, velocities, or other gameplay-affecting properties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Using Frame Count Instead of Delta Time</strong>\nBeginners often implement movement as <code>position += velocity</code> assuming 60fps. This creates inconsistent behavior across different framerates. On 30fps systems, movement appears half-speed. On 144fps systems, movement becomes uncontrollably fast. Always scale time-dependent calculations: <code>position += velocity * deltaTime</code>.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Unbounded Delta Time During Debugging</strong>\nWhen stepping through code in a debugger, delta time can become extremely large (seconds or minutes). Without maximum delta clamping, resuming execution causes physics objects to teleport vast distances or tunnel through collision boundaries. Always clamp delta time to a reasonable maximum like 33.33ms.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Processing Input After Physics</strong>\nProcessing input after physics updates creates one-frame delay in player response. Players press jump, but the character doesn&#39;t respond until the next frame, creating sluggish controls. Input processing must occur first in the update sequence.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Update Order</strong>\nChanging the order of update phases between frames creates non-deterministic behavior. Sometimes collision resolution sees old positions, sometimes new ones. Maintain strict update order consistency across all frames.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Integer Delta Time Precision</strong>\nUsing integer milliseconds for delta time introduces quantization errors that accumulate over time. A 60fps game with 16ms integer delta (instead of 16.67ms float) runs slightly slow, causing objects to drift from expected positions over time. Use floating-point seconds with high precision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The game loop forms the execution foundation that drives all other game systems.

Just as gravity pulls objects downward in the real world and friction slows them down, your physics engine applies these forces consistently every frame to create believable movement. Unlike real-world physics that deals with complex molecular interactions and precise measurements, game physics prioritizes <strong>theatrical physics</strong> - movement that feels satisfying and responsive to players rather than scientifically accurate.</p>\n<p>The physics engine serves as the central nervous system of your platformer, coordinating between input intentions, environmental constraints, and visual feedback. Every frame, it must answer fundamental questions: Where should the player be next? How fast should they fall? Can they jump right now? When should momentum carry them forward versus when should friction bring them to a halt?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fphysics-update-flow.svg\" alt=\"Physics Update Flow\"></p>\n<p>The core challenge lies in creating frame-rate independence while maintaining responsive controls. A player pressing the jump button expects immediate response regardless of whether the game runs at 30fps or 144fps. Similarly, gravity must pull consistently, and movement must feel identical across different hardware configurations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"movement-physics\">Movement Physics</h3>\n<p>Think of horizontal movement as <strong>driving a car with both an accelerator and automatic brakes</strong>. When the player holds the right arrow key, they&#39;re pressing the accelerator - the character gains velocity in that direction up to a maximum speed. The moment they release the key, friction acts like automatic brakes, gradually reducing velocity until the character stops. This creates natural-feeling acceleration and deceleration without requiring players to manually brake.</p>\n<p>The physics engine implements velocity-based positioning where entities maintain persistent velocity values that accumulate over time. Each frame, input forces modify velocity, physics forces like friction adjust velocity, and finally the new velocity determines the change in position. This separation of concerns allows complex interactions - a player can be moving right from input while simultaneously falling from gravity, with both velocities contributing to the final position.</p>\n<p><strong>Movement Physics Data Structure:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>velocityX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current horizontal velocity in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>velocityY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current vertical velocity in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>accelerationX</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current horizontal acceleration in pixels per second squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>accelerationY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current vertical acceleration in pixels per second squared</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>maxSpeed</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Maximum horizontal movement velocity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>friction</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Deceleration rate when no input is applied</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>groundAcceleration</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Acceleration rate when player is on ground</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>airAcceleration</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Acceleration rate when player is airborne</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate Ground and Air Movement</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Players expect different movement responsiveness when running on ground versus floating in air</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Single acceleration value for all movement</li>\n<li>Different acceleration for ground vs air</li>\n<li>Complex momentum conservation system</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Different acceleration values for ground and air movement</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Ground movement should feel snappy and responsive for precise platforming, while air movement should feel slightly floated to prevent players from changing direction too easily mid-jump</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables tight ground controls while preventing &quot;helicopter&quot; movement in air, but requires ground state tracking</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Movement Physics Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Input Processing</strong>: Check current input state and determine desired movement direction</li>\n<li><strong>Acceleration Calculation</strong>: Apply ground or air acceleration based on current <code>onGround</code> state</li>\n<li><strong>Friction Application</strong>: When no input is pressed, apply friction to gradually reduce horizontal velocity</li>\n<li><strong>Velocity Clamping</strong>: Ensure horizontal velocity doesn&#39;t exceed <code>maxSpeed</code> in either direction</li>\n<li><strong>Position Integration</strong>: Update entity position by adding velocity multiplied by delta time</li>\n<li><strong>Velocity Persistence</strong>: Store final velocity values for next frame&#39;s calculations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The movement system distinguishes between <strong>acceleration</strong> (how quickly you reach top speed) and <strong>maximum speed</strong> (the fastest you can travel). A high acceleration with moderate maximum speed creates snappy, responsive controls. Low acceleration with high maximum speed creates momentum-heavy movement that takes time to build up and slow down.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Movement Physics Parameters:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Ground Value</th>\n<th>Air Value</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Acceleration</td>\n<td>1200 px/s²</td>\n<td>800 px/s²</td>\n<td>Responsive ground control, moderate air control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum Speed</td>\n<td>200 px/s</td>\n<td>200 px/s</td>\n<td>Consistent top speed regardless of surface</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friction</td>\n<td>800 px/s²</td>\n<td>50 px/s²</td>\n<td>Quick stopping on ground, momentum preservation in air</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Consider a concrete example: The player presses right while standing on the ground. The physics engine applies <code>groundAcceleration</code> of 1200 px/s² to increase <code>velocityX</code>. After 0.167 seconds (approximately 10 frames at 60fps), velocity reaches the <code>maxSpeed</code> of 200 px/s. When the player releases the right key, friction of 800 px/s² reduces velocity, bringing the character to a complete stop in 0.25 seconds.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Framerate-Dependent Movement</strong>\nMany beginners apply movement directly to position each frame (like <code>x += 5</code>) rather than using velocity and delta time. This creates movement that runs faster on high-framerate displays and slower on low-framerate displays. Always multiply velocity by delta time when updating position: <code>x += velocityX * deltaTime</code>.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Instant Direction Changes</strong>\nWithout proper friction and acceleration, characters can instantly reverse direction mid-air, creating unrealistic &quot;helicopter&quot; movement. Always apply different acceleration values for ground and air, and ensure friction provides momentum when no input is active.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gravity-and-falling\">Gravity and Falling</h3>\n<p>Think of gravity as a <strong>constant invisible force</strong> pushing down on your character every single frame, like standing in a gentle but persistent wind. Unlike horizontal movement which responds to player input, gravity acts continuously and independently. The physics engine must track whether entities are supported by solid ground and apply downward acceleration only when they&#39;re airborne.</p>\n<p>Gravity implementation requires careful balance between realistic falling behavior and responsive game feel. Real gravity accelerates objects at 9.8 m/s², but game gravity often uses higher values to prevent floaty, unresponsive jumping. The key insight is that players judge jump responsiveness by how quickly they start falling after reaching peak height, not by scientific accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravity Physics Data Structure:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>GRAVITY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Constant downward acceleration (980 px/s²)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Maximum falling speed (600 px/s)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>onGround</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entity is currently supported by solid surface</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>wasOnGround</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Ground state from previous frame for transition detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>groundCheckOffset</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Distance below entity feet to check for ground collision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The gravity system must solve several technical challenges. First, <strong>ground state detection</strong> determines when to apply gravity versus when to prevent it. An entity standing on solid ground should not accelerate downward, but the moment they step off a ledge, gravity should immediately take effect. Second, <strong>terminal velocity limiting</strong> prevents entities from falling infinitely fast, which would make collision detection unreliable and create unpleasant visual effects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Terminal Velocity Implementation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Without speed limits, falling entities accelerate infinitely, causing collision tunneling and visual issues</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>No terminal velocity limit</li>\n<li>Hard velocity cap at maximum value</li>\n<li>Gradual velocity approach to terminal velocity using drag</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hard velocity cap at terminal velocity value</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simpler implementation with predictable behavior.

The physics engine performs this check every frame before applying gravity, ensuring that entities standing on platforms don&#39;t fall through them while entities stepping off edges immediately begin falling.</p>\n<p>Consider a specific scenario: A player character runs off a platform edge. On the first frame after leaving the platform, <code>onGround</code> changes from true to false. The gravity system immediately begins applying 980 px/s² downward acceleration. After 0.61 seconds of free fall, the character reaches terminal velocity of 600 px/s and continues falling at that constant speed until hitting another surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravity Configuration Values:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Justification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>GRAVITY</code></td>\n<td>980 px/s²</td>\n<td>Twice real-world gravity for responsive jumping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code></td>\n<td>600 px/s</td>\n<td>Fast enough to feel weighty, slow enough for collision detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>groundCheckOffset</code></td>\n<td>2 px</td>\n<td>Small buffer to handle floating-point precision issues</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The ground check offset addresses a common technical challenge in collision detection. Due to floating-point precision, an entity positioned exactly on a platform might register as 0.001 pixels above the surface, causing them to start falling. A small offset ensures entities remain grounded when positioned very close to solid surfaces.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ground Detection Gaps</strong>\nChecking only the exact bottom edge of the character can miss ground when the character is partially overlapping a platform. Always check a small area below the character&#39;s feet, not just a single point. Use <code>groundCheckOffset</code> to create a small buffer zone for reliable ground detection.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Gravity Without Terminal Velocity</strong>\nWithout terminal velocity limits, characters can fall fast enough to tunnel through collision geometry. Always implement both <code>GRAVITY</code> for realistic acceleration and <code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code> to prevent collision system failures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-mechanics\">Jump Mechanics</h3>\n<p>Think of jumping as <strong>temporarily overpowering gravity</strong> with a strong upward impulse, like a compressed spring suddenly releasing. Unlike continuous forces like gravity and friction, jumping applies an instantaneous velocity change that fights against downward acceleration. The art lies in making this mechanical process feel natural and responsive to player input.</p>\n<p>Modern platformers implement sophisticated jump mechanics that go far beyond simply applying upward velocity. <strong>Variable height jumping</strong> allows players to control jump height by holding the button longer - tap for a small hop, hold for maximum height. <strong>Coyote time</strong> provides a grace period where players can still jump even after leaving a platform edge. <strong>Jump buffering</strong> registers jump input slightly before landing, making controls feel more responsive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fplayer-state-machine.svg\" alt=\"Player State Machine\"></p>\n<p><strong>Jump Mechanics Data Structure:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>jumpSpeed</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Initial upward velocity applied when jumping (-400 px/s)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpHoldGravity</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Reduced gravity while jump button held (490 px/s²)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpReleaseGravity</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Increased gravity when jump button released (1470 px/s²)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>coyoteTimer</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time remaining for coyote time jumping (0.1s max)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpBuffer</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time remaining for buffered jump input (0.1s max)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>COYOTE_TIME</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Maximum coyote time duration (0.1 seconds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>canJump</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entity is currently allowed to jump</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Variable height jumping works by <strong>manipulating gravity</strong> rather than the initial jump velocity. When the player presses jump, the character receives full upward velocity. While the jump button remains held, the physics engine applies reduced gravity, allowing the character to rise higher. The moment the player releases the button, gravity increases dramatically, causing the character to quickly reach peak height and begin falling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Variable Jump Implementation Method</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Players expect jump height to vary based on button hold duration for precise platforming</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Variable initial jump velocity based on predicted hold time</li>\n<li>Continuous thrust while button is held</li>\n<li>Gravity modification while button is held</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Gravity modification approach with reduced gravity during button hold</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides predictable maximum jump height, allows players to control arc naturally, and works well with existing gravity system</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables intuitive variable height jumping but requires tracking jump button state separately from initial jump trigger</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Coyote Time Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>Coyote time solves the frustrating problem where players press jump immediately after running off a ledge, expecting to jump, but failing because they&#39;re technically airborne. The system maintains a timer that counts down from <code>COYOTE_TIME</code> whenever the player leaves the ground. During this window, jump input is still accepted as if the player were grounded.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Buffer Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>Jump buffering addresses the opposite timing issue - when players press jump slightly before landing on a platform. Instead of losing the input, the system remembers the jump request for a brief period and automatically executes it the moment the character touches ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete Jump System Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Coyote Timer Update</strong>: If player was on ground last frame but not this frame, set <code>coyoteTimer</code> to <code>COYOTE_TIME</code></li>\n<li><strong>Coyote Timer Countdown</strong>: If player is airborne and <code>coyoteTimer</code> &gt; 0, reduce timer by delta time</li>\n<li><strong>Jump Buffer Update</strong>: If jump input detected, set <code>jumpBuffer</code> to buffer duration</li>\n<li><strong>Jump Buffer Countdown</strong>: If <code>jumpBuffer</code> &gt; 0, reduce timer by delta time  </li>\n<li><strong>Jump Eligibility Check</strong>: Player can jump if <code>onGround</code> is true OR <code>coyoteTimer</code> &gt; 0</li>\n<li><strong>Jump Execution</strong>: If jump eligible and <code>jumpBuffer</code> &gt; 0, apply <code>jumpSpeed</code> to <code>velocityY</code></li>\n<li><strong>Variable Height Processing</strong>: While airborne and jump held, apply <code>jumpHoldGravity</code>; otherwise apply <code>jumpReleaseGravity</code></li>\n<li><strong>State Cleanup</strong>: Reset timers and buffers after successful jump</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Jump Mechanics State Machine:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Input Event</th>\n<th>Conditions</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Grounded</td>\n<td>Jump Press</td>\n<td>Always</td>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Apply jumpSpeed, consume jumpBuffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Airborne</td>\n<td>Jump Press</td>\n<td>coyoteTimer &gt; 0</td>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Apply jumpSpeed, reset coyoteTimer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Jump Release</td>\n<td>velocityY &lt; 0</td>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Switch to jumpReleaseGravity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Land on Ground</td>\n<td>velocityY ≥ 0</td>\n<td>Grounded</td>\n<td>Set onGround true, check jumpBuffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Jump Press</td>\n<td>Can&#39;t jump</td>\n<td>Same</td>\n<td>Store in jumpBuffer for future use</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Consider a complex scenario demonstrating all systems working together: A player runs toward a gap, releases the run button just before the edge, and presses jump 50ms after leaving the platform. Without coyote time, this would fail. With coyote time, the jump succeeds because less than 100ms have passed since leaving the ground. The player then releases the jump button halfway up, causing increased gravity to pull them down faster, allowing precise control over jump height.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Mechanics Configuration:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>jumpSpeed</code></td>\n<td>-400 px/s</td>\n<td>Initial upward velocity (negative = upward)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpHoldGravity</code></td>\n<td>490 px/s²</td>\n<td>Half normal gravity for extended hang time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>jumpReleaseGravity</code></td>\n<td>1470 px/s²</td>\n<td>1.5x normal gravity for quick descent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>COYOTE_TIME</code></td>\n<td>0.1 seconds</td>\n<td>Grace period for edge jumping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>bufferDuration</code></td>\n<td>0.1 seconds</td>\n<td>Input memory window</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The negative jump speed value reflects the coordinate system where positive Y points downward (common in 2D graphics). Applying -400 px/s moves the character upward against the positive gravity acceleration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Coyote Time Without Limits</strong>\nUnlimited coyote time allows players to jump long after leaving platforms, breaking game physics. Always implement a reasonable time limit (typically 0.1 seconds) and ensure the timer only activates when transitioning from grounded to airborne.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Jump Buffer Overflow</strong>\nStoring multiple buffered jump inputs can cause double-jumping when landing. Always consume the jump buffer immediately after a successful jump and store only the most recent jump input, not a queue of multiple inputs.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Variable Jump Without State Tracking</strong>\nImplementing variable jump height without proper button state tracking can cause jumps to always use maximum height or fail to respond to button releases. Always track both the initial jump trigger and the ongoing button hold state separately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>Technology

Resolution</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - implements the collision detection and resolution system that prevents players from falling through platforms and enables interaction with game entities</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of collision detection as the <strong>bouncer at a nightclub</strong> - it constantly checks who&#39;s trying to enter restricted areas and enforces the rules. In our 2D platformer, the collision system serves as the bouncer between the physics simulation and the game world geometry, ensuring that entities respect solid boundaries while maintaining smooth, responsive movement. Unlike real-world physics where objects naturally can&#39;t occupy the same space, our digital entities can overlap freely unless we explicitly detect and resolve these intersections.</p>\n<p>The collision system operates in two distinct phases: <strong>detection</strong> (finding overlaps) and <strong>resolution</strong> (separating overlapping objects). Detection answers &quot;are these two things touching?&quot; while resolution answers &quot;how do we move them apart?&quot; This separation of concerns allows us to handle complex scenarios where multiple collisions occur simultaneously, such as a player sliding into a corner between two tiles.</p>\n<p>Modern 2D platformers have evolved sophisticated approaches to collision that prioritize gameplay feel over physical accuracy. The system must handle edge cases that rarely occur in real physics but are common in games: objects moving at high speeds, perfectly aligned rectangular boundaries, and the need for pixel-perfect precision. Our implementation will focus on <strong>theatrical physics</strong> - collision behavior that feels natural to players even when it bends the rules of reality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aabb-collision-detection\">AABB Collision Detection</h3>\n<p><strong>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection</strong> forms the foundation of our collision system. Think of AABB as placing invisible rectangular boxes around every game object - if two boxes overlap, the objects inside them are colliding. The &quot;axis-aligned&quot; constraint means these boxes always align with the screen&#39;s X and Y axes, never rotating, which dramatically simplifies the mathematical calculations required for intersection testing.</p>\n<p>The core insight behind AABB collision is that two rectangles overlap only when they overlap on <strong>both</strong> the X and Y axes simultaneously. If they&#39;re separated on either axis, there&#39;s no collision regardless of their position on the other axis. This allows us to break down the 2D intersection problem into two simpler 1D overlap tests, making the algorithm both efficient and easy to understand.</p>\n<p>Our collision detection system will represent every collidable entity as an <code>Entity</code> with position and dimensions that define its bounding box. The physics engine updates entity positions based on velocity and acceleration, while the collision system validates these new positions against the game world geometry. This creates a clear separation between &quot;where objects want to go&quot; (physics) and &quot;where they&#39;re allowed to go&quot; (collision).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>AABB Properties</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>x</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Left edge position in world coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>y</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Top edge position in world coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>width</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Horizontal extent of the bounding box</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>height</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Vertical extent of the bounding box</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>right</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Calculated as x + width, right edge position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bottom</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Calculated as y + height, bottom edge position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The intersection test between two AABB rectangles requires checking overlap on both axes. For the X axis, we verify that the left edge of rectangle A is less than the right edge of rectangle B, and the right edge of A is greater than the left edge of B.

The player&#39;s right edge extends to 132, while the tile&#39;s left edge starts at 128. Since 132 &gt; 128, there&#39;s X-axis overlap of 4 pixels. Both rectangles share the same Y coordinate with the player extending from 200 to 248 and the tile from 200 to 232, creating Y-axis overlap. The intersection test returns true, and we calculate 4 pixels of horizontal penetration for resolution.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Floating-Point Precision Errors</strong>\nWhen working with pixel-perfect collision detection, floating-point arithmetic can introduce tiny rounding errors that cause objects to &quot;stick&quot; to surfaces or create micro-gaps. Always use a small <strong>collision epsilon</strong> value (typically 0.01 pixels) when comparing positions to account for floating-point imprecision. Instead of checking <code>if (player.x === tile.x)</code>, use <code>if (Math.abs(player.x - tile.x) &lt; COLLISION_EPSILON)</code>.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Integer Coordinate Assumptions</strong>\nMany developers assume game coordinates will always be integers, leading to truncation bugs when entities move with sub-pixel velocity. Always treat coordinates as floating-point numbers throughout the collision system, only rounding to integers during final rendering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collision-resolution\">Collision Resolution</h3>\n<p>Once we&#39;ve detected that two objects are overlapping, <strong>collision resolution</strong> determines how to separate them while maintaining realistic movement behavior. Think of resolution as an <strong>undo button</strong> - we need to back the objects out of their overlapping state while preserving as much of their intended motion as possible. The key insight is that we want to move objects the <strong>minimum distance</strong> necessary to eliminate the overlap, preventing unnecessary corrections that would make movement feel sluggish.</p>\n<p>The critical design decision in collision resolution is whether to handle X and Y axes simultaneously or separately. Simultaneous resolution calculates the shortest vector to separate overlapping objects, while separate axis resolution handles horizontal and vertical collisions independently. Our platformer will use <strong>separate axis resolution</strong> because it produces more intuitive behavior for the rectangular, grid-aligned world typical of 2D platformers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate Axis Collision Resolution</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When a player moves diagonally into a corner, simultaneous resolution might push them at an unexpected angle, while separate resolution allows sliding along walls</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Simultaneous X/Y resolution using shortest separation vector</li>\n<li>Separate X then Y resolution with fixed order</li>\n<li>Separate resolution with velocity-based axis priority</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate X and Y resolution with velocity-based priority ordering</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Separate resolution allows natural wall-sliding behavior essential for platformers. Velocity-based priority ensures the axis with greater movement gets resolved first, preventing corner-clipping artifacts</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables smooth wall-sliding and corner navigation but requires careful ordering to prevent tunneling through thin walls</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resolution Approaches</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simultaneous X/Y</td>\n<td>Mathematically optimal separation distance</td>\n<td>Can push player away from walls at unexpected angles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fixed Order Separate</td>\n<td>Predictable, consistent behavior</td>\n<td>May feel biased toward one axis over another</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Velocity-Priority Separate</td>\n<td>Respects player&#39;s intended movement direction</td>\n<td>Slightly more complex to implement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Separate axis resolution works by handling X and Y collisions in sequence, typically processing the axis with greater velocity first. This priority system ensures that fast-moving objects don&#39;t get &quot;trapped&quot; by small corrections on the slower axis. The resolution process calculates the <strong>penetration depth</strong> on each axis - how far the objects have overlapped - then moves one or both objects back by this amount to eliminate the intersection.</p>\n<p>The penetration depth calculation extracts overlap distances directly from the AABB intersection. For X-axis penetration, we compare how far the objects have pushed into each other&#39;s boundaries. If object A is moving right and penetrating object B, the penetration equals A&#39;s right edge minus B&#39;s left edge. The resolution then subtracts this penetration from A&#39;s X position, effectively &quot;backing it out&quot; of the collision.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resolution Data</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>penetrationX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Horizontal overlap distance requiring correction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>penetrationY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Vertical overlap distance requiring correction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>separationX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Horizontal distance to move for resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>separationY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Vertical distance to move for resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>axisResolved</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Which axis was processed (&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, or &#39;both&#39;)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>velocityAffected</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether to zero velocity on resolved axis</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The step-by-step collision resolution process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculate penetration depth on both X and Y axes from the overlapping bounding boxes</li>\n<li>Determine axis priority based on the magnitude of velocity - resolve the faster-moving axis first</li>\n<li>For the primary axis, calculate the separation distance needed to eliminate overlap</li>\n<li>Move the moving object back by the separation distance, typically zeroing its velocity on that axis</li>\n<li>Recalculate bounding boxes after the first axis resolution</li>\n<li>Repeat the process for the secondary axis, handling any remaining overlap</li>\n<li>Update the entity&#39;s <code>onGround</code> state if vertical resolution occurred with downward velocity</li>\n<li>Apply any additional resolution effects like bounce or friction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Consider a player moving diagonally down-right with velocity (150, 300) who contacts a tile corner. The Y-axis has greater velocity magnitude, so we resolve vertical collision first. The player penetrates 8 pixels into the tile&#39;s top edge, so we move the player up by 8 pixels and set velocityY to 0, marking them as <code>onGround = true</code>. Next, we resolve the X-axis penetration of 3 pixels by moving the player left and setting velocityX to 0. This creates the familiar &quot;slide along the wall&quot; behavior that players expect in platformers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for collision resolution is that objects should lose velocity only on the axis where collision occurred. A player hitting a wall while falling should stop moving horizontally but continue falling vertically until they hit the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resolution Order Dependencies</strong>\nThe order of X and Y axis resolution can create different gameplay behaviors. Always resolve the axis with higher velocity first to prevent fast-moving objects from getting &quot;caught&quot; on corners. Inconsistent resolution ordering leads to unpredictable wall-sliding behavior.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Double Resolution</strong>\nAfter resolving collision on one axis, always recalculate bounding boxes before testing the second axis. Failing to update positions between axis resolutions can cause objects to be &quot;over-corrected&quot; and pushed too far from collision boundaries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tile-based-collision\">Tile-based Collision</h3>\n<p>Tile-based collision detection leverages the grid structure of our game world to dramatically optimize collision testing performance. Instead of testing every entity against every tile in the level (which could be thousands of comparisons), we calculate exactly which tiles could potentially intersect with a moving entity and test only those candidates. Think of this as <strong>spatial indexing</strong> - we use the entity&#39;s position to look up relevant tiles in a 2D grid, reducing collision detection from O(n) linear search to O(1) constant-time lookup.</p>\n<p>The tile-based approach represents the game world as a uniform grid where each cell is exactly <code>TILE_SIZE</code> pixels wide and tall. Each tile contains an ID that indicates its collision behavior: solid tiles block movement, empty tiles allow free passage, and special tiles like one-way platforms have conditional collision rules. This grid structure allows us to convert any world coordinate into tile grid coordinates using simple integer division, then look up the tile properties in constant time.</p>\n<p>Our collision system will need to test entities against multiple tiles simultaneously because entities can span tile boundaries. A 32-pixel-wide player positioned at X coordinate 48 will overlap both tile column 1 (pixels 32-63) and tile column 2 (pixels 64-95). The system must identify all potentially overlapping tiles and test each one for intersection.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tile Collision Properties</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>tileID</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Numeric identifier indicating tile behavior (0=empty, 1=solid, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>worldX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>World coordinate of tile&#39;s left edge (tileX * TILE_SIZE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>worldY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>World coordinate of tile&#39;s top edge (tileY * TILE_SIZE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gridX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Grid column index in the tilemap array</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gridY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Grid row index in the tilemap array</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>solid</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether this tile blocks entity movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>oneWay</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether this tile only blocks movement from above</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The coordinate conversion between world pixels and tile grid indices requires careful handling of negative coordinates and boundary conditions.

This <strong>bounding box sweep</strong> approach ensures we never miss collisions while minimizing the number of intersection tests performed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Multi-tile Collision Testing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Entities larger than a single tile or positioned across tile boundaries can collide with multiple tiles simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Test only the tile containing the entity&#39;s center point</li>\n<li>Test all tiles within the entity&#39;s bounding box</li>\n<li>Test tiles along the entity&#39;s movement path</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Test all tiles that intersect the entity&#39;s bounding box, expanded by velocity for fast-moving objects</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Center-point testing misses collisions when entities span boundaries.

The expanded bounding box extends from (100, 200) to (332, 248) to account for the rightward movement. Converting to tile coordinates: top-left tile is (3, 6) and bottom-right is (10, 7). The system tests tiles (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)...(10,7) for solid collision, finding a solid tile at (8,6) which converts to world coordinates (256, 192) with standard tile dimensions. The AABB test confirms intersection, and collision resolution prevents the player from moving through the wall.</p>\n<p><strong>One-way platforms</strong> require special collision logic that allows entities to pass through from certain directions while blocking from others. Typically, one-way platforms block entities moving downward (falling onto the platform) but allow upward movement (jumping through from below). This creates the classic platformer behavior where players can jump up through platforms but land on top of them.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>One-way Platform Logic</th>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Movement Direction</th>\n<th>Collision Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Player above platform</td>\n<td>Moving down</td>\n<td>Downward velocity</td>\n<td>Block collision, land on platform</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player below platform</td>\n<td>Moving up</td>\n<td>Upward velocity</td>\n<td>Allow pass-through, no collision</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player on platform</td>\n<td>Moving down</td>\n<td>Downward velocity + down input</td>\n<td>Allow drop-through if down key held</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player beside platform</td>\n<td>Moving horizontally</td>\n<td>Any horizontal velocity</td>\n<td>Allow pass-through, no collision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The one-way platform implementation modifies the standard collision detection by adding directional checks. Before resolving a collision with a one-way tile, the system examines the entity&#39;s velocity vector and position relative to the platform. Only downward-moving entities that approach from above trigger collision resolution, while all other movement directions pass through freely.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Tile Boundary Precision</strong>\nWhen converting between world coordinates and tile indices, always use consistent rounding behavior. Mixing <code>Math.floor()</code>, <code>Math.round()</code>, and integer truncation can cause entities to &quot;skip over&quot; tiles at exact boundary positions. Use <code>Math.floor(worldX / TILE_SIZE)</code> consistently for grid conversion.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Out-of-Bounds Tile Access</strong>\nAlways validate tile grid coordinates before accessing the tilemap array. Entities can move outside level boundaries, causing array index out-of-bounds errors. The <code>getTileAtGrid</code> function should return 0 (empty) for any coordinates outside the valid tilemap range.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: One-way Platform Edge Cases</strong>\nOne-way platforms can create edge cases where fast-moving entities approach from the side at nearly horizontal angles. Always check both the entity&#39;s velocity direction AND its position relative to the platform center to determine collision behavior. An entity moving slightly downward while positioned beside the platform should pass through, not land on top.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fphysics-update-flow.svg\" alt=\"Physics Update Flow\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fcollision-resolution-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Collision Resolution Sequence\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftile-collision-grid.svg\" alt=\"Tile-based Collision System\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The collision detection and resolution system requires careful coordination between multiple components to ensure accurate, performant collision testing.

System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - implements player character, enemy AI, and interaction systems that bring the game world to life</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the entity system as the <strong>cast of characters</strong> in our platformer theater. Just as a stage production has different types of actors with distinct roles and behaviors - the protagonist, the antagonists, and the supporting cast - our entity system manages the player character, enemies, and their interactions. Each entity is like an actor with their own script (behavior), costume (visual representation), and stage directions (movement patterns), but they all share the same stage (physics world) and must follow the same fundamental rules of the theater (physics and collision systems).</p>\n<p>The entity system serves as the bridge between the abstract physics simulation and the concrete game experience. While the physics engine deals with velocities and forces, the entity system translates these into meaningful game concepts like &quot;the player jumps,&quot; &quot;the enemy patrols,&quot; or &quot;the player defeats an enemy by stomping.&quot; This layer of abstraction allows us to create rich, interactive gameplay while maintaining clean separation between game logic and physics simulation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"player-entity\">Player Entity</h3>\n<p>The player entity represents the user&#39;s avatar in the game world and serves as the primary interface between human input and game physics. Think of the player entity as a <strong>marionette puppet</strong> - the input system pulls the strings (keyboard presses), the entity translates these into intentions (jump, move left, move right), and the physics system makes the puppet dance (applies forces and resolves collisions). The player entity must maintain awareness of its own state to make intelligent decisions about what actions are possible at any given moment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Extended Entity Architecture for Player</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The player needs capabilities beyond basic physics entities, including health, special movement states, and checkpoint tracking</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Monolithic player class with all functionality</li>\n<li>Component-based entity with attachable behaviors</li>\n<li>Inheritance-based extension of base Entity class</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Inheritance-based extension with specialized player properties</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides clear player-specific functionality while maintaining physics compatibility, simpler than component system for this scope</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Player entity can leverage all base Entity physics while adding game-specific features like health and respawn management</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>Player</code> entity extends the base <code>Entity</code> with additional properties that track game-specific state. The health system provides a simple life mechanism, while the invulnerability timer prevents rapid repeated damage. The checkpoint coordinates store the player&#39;s respawn location, updated whenever the player reaches a new checkpoint. The coyote timer and jump buffer implement the responsive jump mechanics that make platformer controls feel precise and forgiving.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>health</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Player&#39;s remaining lives, decremented on enemy contact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>coyoteTimer</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Remaining time (seconds) player can jump after leaving ground</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>jumpBuffer</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Remaining time (seconds) jump input is remembered before landing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>invulnerabilityTimer</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Remaining time (seconds) player cannot take damage after being hit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>checkpointX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>X coordinate of last activated checkpoint for respawn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>checkpointY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Y coordinate of last activated checkpoint for respawn</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The player&#39;s update logic follows a carefully orchestrated sequence that prioritizes input responsiveness while maintaining physics consistency. The player entity processes input first to capture player intentions, then applies physics updates to translate intentions into movement, and finally updates special timers that affect future input processing.</p>\n<p><strong>Player Update Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decrement Special Timers</strong>: Reduce coyoteTimer, jumpBuffer, and invulnerabilityTimer by deltaTime, clamping to zero</li>\n<li><strong>Process Horizontal Input</strong>: Check left/right input and apply horizontal acceleration based on ground friction or air control</li>\n<li><strong>Process Jump Input</strong>: If jump pressed, check conditions (onGround OR coyoteTimer &gt; 0) and apply upward velocity impulse</li>\n<li><strong>Update Jump Buffer</strong>: If jump pressed but conditions not met, set jumpBuffer to buffer duration for future use</li>\n<li><strong>Handle Variable Jump Height</strong>: If jump button released while moving upward, reduce upward velocity for shorter jump</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Coyote Time</strong>: If player leaves ground (onGround becomes false), start coyoteTimer countdown</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Jump Buffer</strong>: If player lands (onGround becomes true) and jumpBuffer &gt; 0, execute buffered jump</li>\n<li><strong>Call Parent Update</strong>: Invoke base Entity.update() to apply physics simulation and collision resolution</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The coyote time mechanism requires careful timing coordination. When the player walks off a platform, the physics system sets <code>onGround</code> to false, but the player entity immediately starts the coyote timer. During this grace period, jump input still triggers a jump as if the player were on solid ground. This creates the illusion that the player can jump slightly after leaving a platform, which feels more responsive than strict physical accuracy would allow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for coyote time is that it&#39;s implemented as a <strong>retroactive permission system</strong>. The player has already left the ground (physics reality), but we temporarily pretend they haven&#39;t (gameplay reality) to improve the feel of controls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jump buffering works in the opposite temporal direction - it remembers future intentions rather than past permissions. When the player presses jump while airborne, the input is stored in the jumpBuffer timer. When the player subsequently lands, the buffered input is immediately consumed and executed. This prevents the frustration of pressing jump just before landing and having the input ignored.</p>\n<p><strong>Player State Management:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Input Event</th>\n<th>Physics Condition</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Grounded</td>\n<td>Jump pressed</td>\n<td>onGround = true</td>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Apply upward velocity impulse, consume jump input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grounded</td>\n<td>Walk off edge</td>\n<td>onGround = false</td>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Start coyoteTimer countdown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Jump pressed</td>\n<td>coyoteTimer &gt; 0</td>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Apply upward velocity impulse, reset coyoteTimer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Jump pressed</td>\n<td>coyoteTimer = 0</td>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Store input in jumpBuffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jumping</td>\n<td>Jump released</td>\n<td>velocityY &lt; 0</td>\n<td>Falling</td>\n<td>Reduce upward velocity for variable jump height</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Enemy contact</td>\n<td>invulnerabilityTimer = 0</td>\n<td>Dead</td>\n<td>Decrement health, start invulnerability period</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dead</td>\n<td>Health &gt; 0</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Grounded</td>\n<td>Respawn at checkpoint coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The player&#39;s collision response must differentiate between different types of contact. Collision with solid tiles triggers standard physics resolution, while collision with enemies triggers the damage system. The direction of enemy collision determines the outcome - contact from above allows the player to defeat the enemy (stomping), while contact from the sides damages the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Player Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Coyote Time Duration Too Long</strong>\nSetting coyote time longer than 150ms makes the game feel floaty and unrealistic, as players can jump long after visibly leaving a platform. Keep coyote time between 100-120ms for responsive but believable controls.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Jump Buffer Consumed Incorrectly</strong>\nFailing to consume the jump buffer when a jump is executed leads to multiple unintended jumps when landing. Always reset jumpBuffer to 0 when a buffered jump is triggered.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Invulnerability Timer Not Checked</strong>\nForgetting to check invulnerabilityTimer before applying damage allows rapid damage from the same enemy. Always verify invulnerabilityTimer equals 0 before decrementing health.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enemy-ai-system\">Enemy AI System</h3>\n<p>Enemy entities provide dynamic obstacles and challenges that react to the player&#39;s presence and movement. Think of enemy AI as <strong>simple clockwork mechanisms</strong> - each enemy follows a predictable pattern that the player can learn and exploit, much like the mechanical obstacles in classic arcade games. The AI doesn&#39;t need to be sophisticated to be effective; consistent, readable behavior often creates more engaging gameplay than complex, unpredictable AI.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Patrol-Based AI Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Enemies need autonomous movement that creates obstacles without overwhelming complexity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>State machine-based AI with multiple behaviors</li>\n<li>Simple waypoint patrol system</li>\n<li>Player-following AI with pathfinding</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Simple waypoint patrol system with collision-based direction reversal</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides predictable, learnable enemy behavior that&#39;s easy to implement and debug, sufficient challenge for platformer gameplay</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables consistent enemy behavior patterns that players can master, avoids complex pathfinding implementation</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The enemy AI system uses a straightforward patrol mechanism where each enemy moves between two defined waypoints, reversing direction when reaching a boundary. This creates predictable movement patterns that players can observe, learn, and time their movements around. The simplicity of the system makes enemy behavior consistent and debuggable while still providing meaningful gameplay challenges.</p>\n<p>Enemy entities inherit from the base <code>Entity</code> class but add AI-specific properties for patrol behavior. The patrol system defines two waypoints that the enemy moves between, along with movement speed and direction tracking. The AI state tracks whether the enemy is moving left or right, and collision detection with level boundaries triggers direction reversal.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>patrolStartX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Left boundary X coordinate for patrol movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>patrolEndX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Right boundary X coordinate for patrol movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>patrolSpeed</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Horizontal movement speed in pixels per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>movingRight</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Current movement direction, true for rightward movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>health</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Enemy health points, typically 1 for simple enemies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>defeated</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether enemy has been defeated by player stomping</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The enemy update algorithm prioritizes collision detection and boundary checking to prevent enemies from walking off platforms or getting stuck in walls. Unlike the player entity, enemies don&#39;t process input, but they must make autonomous decisions about movement direction based on their environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Enemy AI Update Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Check Patrol Boundaries</strong>: Compare current X position with patrolStartX and patrolEndX boundaries</li>\n<li><strong>Reverse Direction if Needed</strong>: If at or beyond boundary, set movingRight to opposite value</li>\n<li><strong>Calculate Movement Velocity</strong>: Set velocityX based on patrolSpeed and movingRight direction</li>\n<li><strong>Check Ground Ahead</strong>: Verify solid ground exists in movement direction to prevent walking off platforms</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Movement</strong>: Set horizontal velocity for physics system to process</li>\n<li><strong>Call Parent Update</strong>: Invoke base Entity.update() for physics simulation and collision resolution</li>\n<li><strong>Update Animation</strong>: Select appropriate sprite frame based on movement direction</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The ground detection system prevents enemies from walking off platforms by checking for solid tiles in the movement direction. Before committing to movement, the enemy AI projects the position one tile ahead and verifies that solid ground exists. If no ground is detected, the enemy reverses direction as if it had hit an invisible wall at the platform edge.</p>\n<p>Ground detection requires coordination with the tile-based collision system. The enemy queries the level&#39;s tile map to check for solid tiles at the projected position. This look-ahead approach prevents the enemy from taking a step that would result in falling off the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Ground Detection Logic:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calculate Look-Ahead Position</strong>: Add (movement direction × tile size) to current position</li>\n<li><strong>Convert to Tile Coordinates</strong>: Use worldToGrid() to convert pixel position to tile indices  </li>\n<li><strong>Check Ground Tile</strong>: Query tile at (lookAheadX, entityY + entityHeight + 1) position</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Solidity</strong>: Use isTileSolid() to confirm the tile provides solid ground support</li>\n<li><strong>Make Direction Decision</strong>: If no solid ground found, reverse movingRight flag</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The enemy AI state machine handles the simple patrol behavior with direction reversal logic:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Trigger Condition</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Moving Right</td>\n<td>X position ≥ patrolEndX</td>\n<td>Moving Left</td>\n<td>Set movingRight = false, velocityX = -patrolSpeed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moving Right</td>\n<td>No ground ahead</td>\n<td>Moving Left</td>\n<td>Set movingRight = false, velocityX = -patrolSpeed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moving Left</td>\n<td>X position ≤ patrolStartX</td>\n<td>Moving Right</td>\n<td>Set movingRight = true, velocityX = patrolSpeed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moving Left</td>\n<td>No ground ahead</td>\n<td>Moving Right</td>\n<td>Set movingRight = true, velocityX = patrolSpeed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any State</td>\n<td>Player stomp collision</td>\n<td>Defeated</td>\n<td>Set defeated = true, remove from active entities</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Enemy collision detection must distinguish between different types of contact with the player. Side collisions typically damage the player, while top collisions (stomping) defeat the enemy. The collision system determines the contact direction based on the relative positions and velocities of the entities at the moment of collision.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Enemy AI Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: No Ground Detection</strong>\nEnemies without look-ahead ground detection will walk off platforms and fall indefinitely. Always check for solid ground in the movement direction before committing to movement.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Boundary Detection Off-by-One</strong>\nUsing strict equality (position === boundary) for boundary detection can cause enemies to overshoot boundaries due to floating-point movement. Use (position &gt;= boundary) for right boundaries and (position &lt;= boundary) for left boundaries.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Infinite Direction Reversal</strong><br>Enemies can get stuck rapidly switching directions if boundary and ground detection both trigger simultaneously. Prioritize boundary detection over ground detection to avoid oscillation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-interactions\">Entity Interactions</h3>\n<p>Entity interactions define how different game objects affect each other when they come into contact. Think of entity interactions as <strong>collision choreography</strong> - different combinations of entities perform different &quot;dance moves&quot; when they meet. A player-enemy collision might be a combat sequence, while a player-checkpoint collision is more like a handshake that saves progress.</p>\n<p>The interaction system builds on top of the collision detection to add semantic meaning to physical contact. While collision detection answers &quot;did these objects touch?&quot;, the interaction system answers &quot;what happens when they touch?&quot; This separation allows the same collision detection code to support multiple types of meaningful interactions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Direction-Based Interaction Classification</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Player-enemy collisions need different outcomes based on contact direction (stomp vs. damage)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Single interaction type with random outcomes</li>\n<li>Direction-based interaction with collision vector analysis  </li>\n<li>Separate collision boxes for different interaction types</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Direction-based interaction using collision vector analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides predictable interaction outcomes that match player expectations from classic platformers, allows single collision system to handle multiple interaction types</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables skill-based enemy interaction where player positioning determines outcome, requires precise collision direction detection</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The interaction system analyzes collision vectors to determine the primary direction of contact between entities. This directional analysis enables the same collision between player and enemy to produce different outcomes - stomping when approached from above, or damage when contacted from the side.</p>\n<p>Collision direction detection compares the relative positions and velocities of colliding entities at the moment of impact. The system calculates the collision vector (the direction from one entity&#39;s center to the other&#39;s center) and determines whether the collision occurred primarily along the vertical or horizontal axis.</p>\n<p><strong>Collision Direction Analysis Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calculate Entity Centers</strong>: Determine center points for both colliding entities</li>\n<li><strong>Compute Collision Vector</strong>: Calculate direction vector from entity A center to entity B center  </li>\n<li><strong>Analyze Vector Components</strong>: Compare absolute values of X and Y components of collision vector</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Primary Axis</strong>: If |vectorX| &gt; |vectorY|, collision is horizontal; otherwise vertical</li>\n<li><strong>Determine Direction</strong>: For vertical collisions, check if player is above or below enemy</li>\n<li><strong>Classify Interaction Type</strong>: Map direction to interaction outcome (stomp, damage, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The interaction classification produces different outcomes based on the collision analysis:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Direction</th>\n<th>Player Velocity</th>\n<th>Enemy State</th>\n<th>Interaction Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From Above</td>\n<td>velocityY &gt; 0 (falling)</td>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Player stomps enemy - enemy defeated, player bounces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>From Above</td>\n<td>velocityY ≤ 0</td>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Regular damage - player takes damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>From Side</td>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Player takes damage, knockback applied</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>From Below</td>\n<td>velocityY &lt; 0 (rising)</td>\n<td>Active</td>\n<td>Player takes damage, stops upward movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Any Direction</td>\n<td>Any</td>\n<td>Defeated</td>\n<td>No interaction - enemy already defeated</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The stomping mechanism requires precise timing and positioning detection. A successful stomp occurs when the player contacts the enemy from above while falling (positive Y velocity). This creates skill-based gameplay where players can defeat enemies by timing their jumps correctly, but mistimed approaches result in taking damage.</p>\n<p>When a successful stomp is detected, the interaction system applies several effects simultaneously. The enemy is marked as defeated and removed from active collision detection. The player receives an upward velocity boost (bounce effect) that provides feedback for the successful action and can be chained for advanced movement techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Player-Enemy Interaction Effects:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Interaction Type</th>\n<th>Player Effects</th>\n<th>Enemy Effects</th>\n<th>Physics Effects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Successful Stomp</td>\n<td>+100 upward velocity bounce</td>\n<td>Mark defeated, remove from world</td>\n<td>Player maintains horizontal momentum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Side Damage</td>\n<td>-1 health, start invulnerability</td>\n<td>Continue normal patrol</td>\n<td>Apply knockback velocity to player</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Damage During Invulnerability</td>\n<td>No effect</td>\n<td>Continue normal patrol</td>\n<td>No physics changes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The interaction system must coordinate with the player&#39;s invulnerability timer to prevent repeated damage from the same enemy. When damage is applied, the invulnerabilityTimer is set to a brief duration (typically 1-2 seconds) during which additional damage interactions are ignored. This prevents rapid health loss from continuous contact with an enemy.</p>\n<p>Player respawn interactions with the checkpoint system provide a safety net for failed encounters. When player health reaches zero, the death interaction triggers a respawn sequence that resets the player&#39;s position to the last activated checkpoint coordinates and restores health to the starting value.</p>\n<p><strong>Respawn Interaction Sequence:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Detect Death Condition</strong>: Check if player health ≤ 0 after damage application</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger Death State</strong>: Set player state to dead, disable collision detection temporarily  </li>\n<li><strong>Apply Respawn Delay</strong>: Brief pause (0.5-1.0 seconds) for visual feedback</li>\n<li><strong>Reset Player Position</strong>: Move player to (checkpointX, checkpointY) coordinates</li>\n<li><strong>Restore Player State</strong>: Reset health to maximum, clear velocity, reset timers</li>\n<li><strong>Reactivate Player</strong>: Re-enable collision detection and input processing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Checkpoint activation requires a separate interaction type that updates the respawn coordinates without affecting player health or physics. When the player contacts a checkpoint entity, the checkpoint system updates the stored respawn coordinates and typically provides visual feedback (animation, sound) to confirm activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Interaction Implementation:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Stomp Detection</strong>\nUsing only position comparison without velocity checking can cause stomps to trigger when jumping into an enemy from the side. Always verify player has positive Y velocity (falling) for stomp detection.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Invulnerability Check</strong><br>Applying damage without checking invulnerabilityTimer causes rapid health loss from continuous enemy contact. Always verify timer equals 0 before processing damage interactions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Respawn Position Not Updated</strong>\nFailing to update checkpoint coordinates when new checkpoints are activated leaves players respawning at outdated locations. Update checkpointX and checkpointY immediately upon checkpoint contact.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fentity-data-model.svg\" alt=\"Entity Data Model\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fplayer-state-machine.svg\" alt=\"Player State Machine\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fenemy-ai-behavior.svg\" alt=\"Enemy AI Behavior Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The entity system serves as the gameplay layer that transforms physics simulation into meaningful player experiences.

System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - implements tile-based level loading, collision geometry, and checkpoint management for player respawn</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of a level system as the <strong>stage and backdrop</strong> for a theater production. The tilemap is like the physical set pieces that actors (entities) can walk on, jump over, and interact with. The checkpoint system acts like <strong>scene markers</strong> that allow the director to restart from specific points when something goes wrong. Just as a theater set must be carefully designed with walkable platforms, proper sight lines, and safety considerations, our level system must efficiently handle collision geometry, visual rendering, and player state management.</p>\n<p>The level system serves as the foundational layer that defines the game world&#39;s physical structure and provides the spatial context for all gameplay interactions. Unlike entity-based objects that move and respond to physics, the level represents static environmental geometry that entities collide with and navigate around. This system must efficiently handle potentially thousands of tiles while providing fast collision queries and supporting various gameplay mechanics like one-way platforms and environmental hazards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tilemap-loading\">Tilemap Loading</h3>\n<p>Loading level data transforms abstract level definitions into interactive game environments with collision geometry. Think of this process as <strong>constructing a building from architectural blueprints</strong> - the level file contains the design specifications, but the loading system must interpret those specifications and construct the actual collision boundaries, visual representation, and spatial indexing structures that the game engine can efficiently query during runtime.</p>\n<p>The tilemap loading process involves three distinct phases: <strong>data parsing</strong> (reading level files and interpreting tile definitions), <strong>geometry construction</strong> (converting tile IDs into collision boundaries), and <strong>spatial indexing</strong> (organizing tiles for efficient collision queries). Each phase must handle potential errors gracefully while providing clear feedback when level data is malformed or incompatible.</p>\n<p>Level data can originate from multiple sources depending on the development workflow. Hand-authored JSON files provide precise control and easy version control integration. Visual level editors like Tiled generate standardized formats with rich metadata support. Procedural generation systems create level data algorithmically based on parameters and rules. Our loading system must accommodate these different sources while providing a consistent internal representation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: JSON-based Level Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Level designers need a format that supports version control, manual editing, and tool integration while remaining human-readable for debugging</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Binary formats (fast loading, compact), XML (verbose but standardized), JSON (readable, widely supported), Custom text format (domain-specific)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: JSON format with standardized schema for tile data, entity placement, and metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: JSON provides the best balance of readability, tool support, and parsing simplicity. Version control systems handle JSON well, and the format supports nested metadata for complex tile properties</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly larger file sizes than binary formats, but negligible for typical 2D platformer levels. Parsing overhead is minimal compared to asset loading</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level Format Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>JSON</td>\n<td>Human-readable, version control friendly, wide tool support, easy debugging</td>\n<td>Larger file size, parsing overhead</td>\n<td>✓ Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Binary</td>\n<td>Compact, fast loading, efficient storage</td>\n<td>Not human-readable, harder to debug, requires custom tools</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>XML</td>\n<td>Standardized, schema validation, tool support</td>\n<td>Verbose, complex parsing, large file size</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Text</td>\n<td>Domain-optimized, minimal syntax</td>\n<td>Requires custom parser, limited tool support</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The level file schema defines the structure and metadata required for complete level reconstruction. The schema must capture not only tile placement but also entity spawn points, checkpoint locations, collision properties, and visual layer information. Extensible metadata support allows for future features like animated tiles, trigger zones, and environmental effects without breaking backward compatibility.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level Schema Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>version</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Schema version for compatibility checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Human-readable level identifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>width</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Level width in tiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>height</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Level height in tiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tileSize</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Pixel dimensions of each tile (typically 32)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tiles</code></td>\n<td>number[][]</td>\n<td>2D array of tile IDs, indexed as <code>tiles[y][x]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tileProperties</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Mapping of tile IDs to collision and visual properties</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>entities</code></td>\n<td>object[]</td>\n<td>Entity spawn definitions with type, position, and parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checkpoints</code></td>\n<td>object[]</td>\n<td>Checkpoint locations with position and activation requirements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>backgroundLayers</code></td>\n<td>object[]</td>\n<td>Visual background layers for parallax scrolling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Level-specific configuration and custom properties</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Tile properties define the behavior and appearance characteristics of each tile type. The properties system must support both common attributes (solid collision, one-way platforms, visual sprites) and extensible custom properties for specialized gameplay mechanics. This design allows level designers to create rich, interactive environments without requiring code changes for each new tile type.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tile Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>solid</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether entities collide with this tile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>oneWay</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Allows upward passage but blocks downward movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>hazard</code></td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Damages player on contact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sprite</code></td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Sprite asset identifier for rendering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>animation</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Frame sequence and timing for animated tiles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>friction</code></td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Surface friction coefficient for entity movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>metadata</code></td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Custom properties for specialized tile behavior</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The loading process transforms raw level data into optimized runtime structures. <strong>Validation</strong> ensures that all referenced assets exist and tile coordinates remain within bounds. <strong>Optimization</strong> pre-computes collision boundaries and spatial indices to accelerate runtime queries. <strong>Error handling</strong> provides clear diagnostics when level data is malformed or when required assets are missing.</p>\n<p><strong>Tilemap Loading Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parse level file</strong> and validate JSON schema compliance, checking for required fields and proper data types</li>\n<li><strong>Validate dimensions</strong> ensuring width and height are positive integers and that the tiles array matches declared dimensions</li>\n<li><strong>Validate tile references</strong> confirming that all tile IDs in the tiles array have corresponding entries in tileProperties</li>\n<li><strong>Load tile assets</strong> and verify that all referenced sprites and animations exist in the asset management system</li>\n<li><strong>Construct collision grid</strong> by iterating through the tiles array and marking solid tiles in a spatial hash map</li>\n<li><strong>Build one-way platform index</strong> creating a separate lookup table for tiles that support upward passage</li>\n<li><strong>Initialize entity spawn points</strong> by processing the entities array and creating spawn definitions for runtime instantiation</li>\n<li><strong>Set up checkpoint system</strong> by registering checkpoint locations and initializing activation state tracking</li>\n<li><strong>Cache spatial queries</strong> by pre-computing tile boundary rectangles and organizing them in a spatial grid for efficient collision detection</li>\n<li><strong>Validate level completability</strong> by running pathfinding checks to ensure the player can reach all required areas</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for tilemap loading is that <strong>preprocessing during load time dramatically improves runtime performance</strong>. While it&#39;s tempting to keep level files minimal and compute everything at runtime, pre-computing collision boundaries, spatial indices, and tile properties during loading eliminates thousands of repeated calculations during gameplay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Coordinate System Management</strong> handles the conversion between different spatial representations used throughout the level system. <strong>World coordinates</strong> represent absolute pixel positions in the game world. <strong>Grid coordinates</strong> represent tile positions in the level array. <strong>Screen coordinates</strong> represent pixel positions relative to the camera viewport. Efficient conversion between these coordinate systems is essential for fast collision detection and rendering.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Coordinate Conversion Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>worldToGrid(x, y)</code></td>\n<td>x: number, y: number</td>\n<td>object: {tileX, tileY}</td>\n<td>Converts world pixel coordinates to tile grid indices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>gridToWorld(tileX, tileY)</code></td>\n<td>tileX: number, tileY: number</td>\n<td>object: {x, y}</td>\n<td>Converts tile grid indices to world pixel coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getTileAt(x, y)</code></td>\n<td>x: number, y: number</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Returns tile ID at world coordinates, handling bounds checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getTileAtGrid(tileX, tileY)</code></td>\n<td>tileX: number, tileY: number</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Returns tile ID at grid coordinates with bounds validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>isTileSolid(tileX, tileY)</code></td>\n<td>tileX: number, tileY: number</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Checks if tile at grid position blocks entity movement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftile-collision-grid.svg\" alt=\"Tile-based Collision System\"></p>\n<p><strong>Collision Geometry Construction</strong> converts the abstract tile grid into concrete collision boundaries that the physics engine can process. Rather than testing collision against individual tile rectangles, the system pre-computes <strong>merged collision regions</strong> where adjacent solid tiles combine into larger rectangular boundaries. This optimization reduces the number of collision tests required and eliminates edge cases where entities might catch on tile boundaries.</p>\n<p>The geometry construction process identifies connected regions of solid tiles and generates minimal bounding rectangles that encompass each region. <strong>One-way platforms</strong> require special handling since they only block movement from specific directions. The system maintains separate collision layers for different tile types, allowing the collision resolution system to apply appropriate response logic based on the collision type.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Handling and Validation</strong> ensures that malformed level data fails gracefully with clear diagnostic information. The loading system must detect and report common authoring errors like missing assets, invalid tile references, unreachable areas, and malformed JSON structure. Validation occurs at multiple stages: <strong>syntax validation</strong> during JSON parsing, <strong>schema validation</strong> against the level format specification, and <strong>semantic validation</strong> checking for logical consistency and asset availability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Malformed JSON</td>\n<td>JSON.parse() exception</td>\n<td>Display syntax error with line number, fall back to empty level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing tile assets</td>\n<td>Asset loading failure</td>\n<td>Substitute placeholder sprites, log warning with missing asset names</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid tile IDs</td>\n<td>Array bounds checking</td>\n<td>Replace invalid IDs with empty tiles (ID 0), log validation warnings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unreachable areas</td>\n<td>Pathfinding analysis</td>\n<td>Report accessibility warnings, continue loading with degraded functionality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dimension mismatch</td>\n<td>Array length validation</td>\n<td>Resize tiles array to match declared dimensions, padding with empty tiles</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"checkpoint-system\">Checkpoint System</h3>\n<p>The checkpoint system provides <strong>save points</strong> where players can respawn after death or failure. Think of checkpoints as <strong>bookmarks in an adventure novel</strong> - they mark significant progress points and allow readers to resume from meaningful locations rather than starting over from the beginning. Just as bookmarks must be placed at chapter breaks rather than mid-sentence, checkpoints must be positioned at safe, logical locations where respawning feels natural and fair.</p>\n<p>Checkpoints serve multiple gameplay functions beyond simple respawn points. They <strong>segment difficulty</strong> by breaking challenging sections into manageable chunks. They <strong>preserve progress</strong> by ensuring players don&#39;t lose significant advancement due to temporary failure. They <strong>provide pacing control</strong> by giving players moments to rest and prepare for upcoming challenges. The checkpoint system must balance <strong>player convenience</strong> with <strong>challenge preservation</strong> - checkpoints should reduce frustration without eliminating meaningful consequences for failure.</p>\n<p>The checkpoint system operates through three core mechanics: <strong>activation</strong> (marking checkpoints as available for respawn), <strong>state management</strong> (tracking which checkpoints are active and which is most recently used), and <strong>respawn handling</strong> (restoring player state and position when death occurs). Each mechanic must integrate cleanly with the broader game state management system while providing reliable, predictable behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Automatic Checkpoint Activation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Players need clear feedback when progress is saved, but manual activation interrupts gameplay flow</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Manual activation (player presses button), Proximity activation (automatic when nearby), Triggered activation (automatic after completing challenges), Hybrid activation (automatic with manual override)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Proximity-based automatic activation with visual and audio feedback</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Automatic activation eliminates the risk of players forgetting to save progress, while proximity detection ensures activation occurs at the intended moment. Visual feedback provides clear confirmation without requiring additional input</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful checkpoint placement to avoid premature activation, but eliminates player error and maintains smooth gameplay flow</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Checkpoint Activation Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Manual (button press)</td>\n<td>Player control, explicit confirmation, works in any location</td>\n<td>Requires extra input, players may forget, interrupts flow</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Proximity (automatic when near)</td>\n<td>Seamless integration, no player error, clear trigger point</td>\n<td>Requires careful placement, may activate prematurely</td>\n<td>✓ Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Triggered (after completing sections)</td>\n<td>Rewards progress, natural pacing</td>\n<td>Complex logic, may not match player expectations</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid (automatic with override)</td>\n<td>Best of both worlds</td>\n<td>Complex implementation, potential confusion</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint Data Structure</strong> defines the information required for each checkpoint in the level. Beyond basic position data, checkpoints store <strong>activation state</strong>, <strong>unlock conditions</strong>, and <strong>metadata</strong> for visual and audio presentation.

The activation process involves <strong>proximity detection</strong> (checking if the player is within the activation radius), <strong>condition validation</strong> (ensuring all unlock requirements are satisfied), <strong>state updates</strong> (marking the checkpoint as activated and deactivating previous checkpoints), and <strong>feedback presentation</strong> (triggering visual and audio effects to confirm activation).</p>\n<p>Proximity detection uses efficient <strong>bounding circle collision</strong> to determine when the player enters the checkpoint&#39;s activation radius. The system must account for the player&#39;s movement velocity to ensure activation occurs reliably even when moving at high speed. <strong>Hysteresis</strong> prevents activation flickering by using slightly different radii for activation and deactivation.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint State Management</strong> tracks the activation status of all checkpoints in the current level and maintains references to the most recently activated checkpoint for respawn purposes. The state manager handles <strong>checkpoint precedence</strong> (later checkpoints typically override earlier ones), <strong>save persistence</strong> (storing checkpoint progress across game sessions), and <strong>level transitions</strong> (preserving checkpoint state when moving between levels).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Checkpoint State Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>activateCheckpoint(checkpointId)</code></td>\n<td>checkpointId: string</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Activates specified checkpoint and deactivates others</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>getActiveCheckpoint()</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Returns currently active checkpoint data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>isCheckpointUnlocked(checkpointId)</code></td>\n<td>checkpointId: string</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Checks if checkpoint meets unlock conditions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>updateProximity(playerX, playerY)</code></td>\n<td>playerX: number, playerY: number</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>Checks for checkpoint activation based on player position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>resetCheckpoints()</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>Deactivates all checkpoints, typically used when restarting level</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Respawn Mechanics</strong> handle the restoration of player state when death or failure occurs. The respawn process involves <strong>position restoration</strong> (moving the player to the active checkpoint location), <strong>state reset</strong> (restoring health, removing temporary effects, clearing input buffers), <strong>world state management</strong> (handling enemy respawning and environmental resets), and <strong>transition effects</strong> (providing visual feedback during the respawn process).</p>\n<p>Player state restoration must carefully balance <strong>progress preservation</strong> with <strong>challenge reset</strong>. Core progress like checkpoint activation and key collection should persist through respawn, while temporary advantages like power-ups and invulnerability states should reset. The system must also handle <strong>cascading resets</strong> where respawning affects other game systems like enemy positions and environmental hazards.</p>\n<p><strong>Respawn Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Validate active checkpoint</strong> ensuring that a valid respawn point exists and is accessible</li>\n<li><strong>Store pre-death state</strong> preserving any progress elements that should survive respawn</li>\n<li><strong>Reset player entity</strong> clearing velocity, removing temporary effects, and restoring base health</li>\n<li><strong>Position player</strong> moving the player entity to the active checkpoint coordinates with safe placement</li>\n<li><strong>Reset world state</strong> respawning enemies, resetting environmental hazards, and clearing temporary entities</li>\n<li><strong>Restore persistent progress</strong> reapplying collected items, activated switches, and unlocked areas</li>\n<li><strong>Clear input buffers</strong> removing any queued input events that might affect the respawned player</li>\n<li><strong>Trigger respawn effects</strong> playing sound effects, visual transitions, and temporary invulnerability</li>\n<li><strong>Update camera</strong> smoothly transitioning the camera to focus on the respawned player position</li>\n<li><strong>Resume gameplay</strong> returning control to the player after respawn effects complete</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Unlock Conditions</strong> allow checkpoints to remain inactive until players meet specific requirements. Common unlock conditions include <strong>item collection</strong> (requiring specific keys or power-ups), <strong>enemy defeat</strong> (clearing all enemies in an area), <strong>switch activation</strong> (triggering environmental mechanisms), and <strong>area completion</strong> (reaching specific locations or solving puzzles). The condition system uses <strong>event subscription</strong> to automatically check conditions when relevant game state changes occur.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Unlock Condition Type</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>item_collected</code></td>\n<td>itemId: string, count: number</td>\n<td>Requires player to collect specified items</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>enemies_defeated</code></td>\n<td>areaId: string, enemyTypes: string[]</td>\n<td>Requires elimination of specified enemies in area</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>switch_activated</code></td>\n<td>switchIds: string[]</td>\n<td>Requires activation of environmental switches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>area_reached</code></td>\n<td>locationId: string</td>\n<td>Requires player to visit specific location</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>time_elapsed</code></td>\n<td>duration: number</td>\n<td>Requires minimum time since level start</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>score_achieved</code></td>\n<td>targetScore: number</td>\n<td>Requires minimum score accumulation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Visual and Audio Feedback</strong> provides clear communication about checkpoint status and activation events. <strong>Inactive checkpoints</strong> display subtle indicators that they exist but are not yet functional. <strong>Activating checkpoints</strong> play prominent animation and sound effects to clearly communicate when progress is saved. <strong>Active checkpoints</strong> maintain visual distinction to help players identify their current respawn point.</p>\n<p>The feedback system must be <strong>immediately recognizable</strong> to avoid confusion about save status. <strong>Color coding</strong> uses consistent visual language across all checkpoints. <strong>Animation timing</strong> ensures effects are noticeable without being disruptive. <strong>Audio design</strong> uses distinctive sounds that clearly communicate successful activation versus failed attempts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls in Checkpoint Systems</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Checkpoint Placement Too Close to Hazards</strong>\nPlacing checkpoints immediately adjacent to dangerous areas can create <strong>death loops</strong> where players respawn directly into harm&#39;s way. This occurs when checkpoint activation radius extends into hazard zones, or when environmental dangers (falling objects, moving platforms) can reach the respawn position. Always ensure checkpoints provide <strong>safe zones</strong> with sufficient buffer space and escape routes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Activation Feedback</strong>\nPlayers become confused when checkpoint activation uses inconsistent visual or audio cues. Some checkpoints might activate silently while others play dramatic effects, or visual indicators might vary between similar checkpoint types. Establish <strong>standardized feedback patterns</strong> and apply them consistently across all checkpoints to build reliable player expectations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: State Reset Ambiguity</strong>\nPlayers expect consistent rules about what persists through respawn versus what resets. Inconsistent behavior where some progress is lost unpredictably while other progress is preserved creates frustration and breaks player trust. <strong>Document and enforce clear rules</strong> about what survives respawn, and consider providing in-game indicators for temporary versus persistent progress.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Checkpoint Activation Race Conditions</strong>\nWhen multiple checkpoints exist in close proximity, players might activate them in unexpected orders or trigger multiple activations simultaneously. This can lead to <strong>state corruption</strong> where the active checkpoint becomes unclear or where activation effects interfere with each other. Implement <strong>activation prioritization</strong> and <strong>temporal cooldowns</strong> to prevent conflicting checkpoint interactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation

Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - establishes responsive input handling that enables smooth player control throughout all gameplay mechanics</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the input system as the <strong>nervous system</strong> of your platformer - it translates the player&#39;s intentions into game actions with lightning-fast responsiveness. Just as your nervous system doesn&#39;t just react to what&#39;s happening right now but also processes recent sensory information to make smooth movements possible, a good input system must capture, buffer, and intelligently process player input to create controls that feel responsive and forgiving.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in platformer input handling lies in bridging the gap between the <strong>discrete nature of input events</strong> and the <strong>continuous nature of game physics</strong>. When a player presses the jump button, that button press happens at a specific moment in time, but the game&#39;s physics simulation runs continuously at 60 frames per second. A naive input system that only checks input state during the exact frame when physics processes jumping will feel sluggish and unresponsive, especially during the precise timing windows that platformers demand.</p>\n<p>Modern platformers solve this through <strong>input buffering</strong> - remembering recent input events for a brief time window so that a jump button press that happens just before landing still registers as valid input. This creates the illusion that the game &quot;knows what the player meant&quot; even when the timing isn&#39;t pixel-perfect. Combined with sophisticated control mapping that can handle multiple input devices simultaneously, the input system becomes the foundation that makes challenging platformer gameplay feel fair and responsive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"input-buffering\">Input Buffering</h3>\n<p>Input buffering represents one of the most important yet invisible features in platformer design. Without buffering, players must time their inputs with frame-perfect precision, making the game feel unforgiving and frustrating. With proper buffering, the same challenging gameplay feels responsive and fair.</p>\n<p>The core insight behind input buffering is that <strong>human reaction times and intentions don&#39;t align perfectly with frame boundaries</strong>. A player might press the jump button 20 milliseconds before their character actually lands on a platform, but their intention was clearly to jump immediately upon landing. A buffering system captures this input event and holds it in memory until the game state makes the action valid, then executes it automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Intent Recorder</strong></p>\n<p>Think of input buffering like a <strong>short-term memory system</strong> that records the player&#39;s recent intentions. Just as you might remember someone&#39;s name for a few seconds after being introduced so you can use it in conversation, the input system remembers recent button presses for a brief window so it can apply them when the game state allows. This memory fades quickly - after 100-150 milliseconds, old inputs are forgotten to prevent stale actions from triggering unexpectedly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Input Buffer Implementation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Input buffering requires storing timestamped input events and checking them against current game state validity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Frame-based counter system (count frames since input)</li>\n<li>Timestamp-based system using delta time</li>\n<li>State machine with buffer states</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Timestamp-based system using delta time</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Frame-based counters break at different frame rates, making buffer windows inconsistent. Timestamp-based buffering provides consistent timing regardless of frame rate, essential for frame-rate independent gameplay</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful delta time management but ensures consistent feel across different devices and performance conditions</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>InputManager</code> maintains a separate buffer for each input action, storing both the fact that the input occurred and the timestamp when it was registered. During each game loop iteration, the system ages these buffered inputs and removes any that exceed the buffer duration threshold.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Input Buffer Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>keys</code></td>\n<td><code>Map&lt;string, boolean&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Current pressed state of each key</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>keyBuffer</code></td>\n<td><code>Map&lt;string, number&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp when each buffered key was pressed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>bufferDuration</code></td>\n<td><code>number</code></td>\n<td>Maximum time to retain buffered inputs (0.1 seconds)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>currentTime</code></td>\n<td><code>number</code></td>\n<td>Current game time for aging buffer entries</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The input buffer operates through a two-phase process during each frame. In the <strong>capture phase</strong>, the system records all new input events with precise timestamps. In the <strong>validation phase</strong>, game systems query the buffer to check whether specific actions should be triggered, and successful queries consume the buffered input to prevent duplicate actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Buffer Management Algorithm</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Input Event Capture</strong>: When a key press event occurs, record both the immediate key state and timestamp the event in the buffer map</li>\n<li><strong>Buffer Aging</strong>: Each frame, iterate through all buffered inputs and calculate their age using current time minus stored timestamp</li>\n<li><strong>Expiration Cleanup</strong>: Remove any buffered inputs that exceed the <code>bufferDuration</code> threshold to prevent stale actions</li>\n<li><strong>Query Processing</strong>: When game systems check for buffered input, return true if a valid timestamped entry exists within the buffer window</li>\n<li><strong>Input Consumption</strong>: After successful buffer queries, remove the consumed input from the buffer to prevent duplicate triggering</li>\n<li><strong>State Synchronization</strong>: Update immediate key state maps to reflect current hardware input state for continuous actions like movement</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Buffering Different Input Types</strong></p>\n<p>Different types of player actions require different buffering strategies. <strong>Discrete actions</strong> like jumping benefit from traditional input buffering - the system remembers that jump was pressed recently and triggers it when conditions become valid. <strong>Continuous actions</strong> like left/right movement should not be buffered in the same way, since holding left should continue moving left without consuming the input.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Action Type</th>\n<th>Buffer Strategy</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Consumption</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Jump</td>\n<td>Buffer press events</td>\n<td>100ms</td>\n<td>Consume on successful jump</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movement</td>\n<td>Direct state check</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Never consume</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attack</td>\n<td>Buffer press events</td>\n<td>150ms</td>\n<td>Consume on successful attack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interact</td>\n<td>Buffer press events</td>\n<td>200ms</td>\n<td>Consume on successful interaction</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key distinction is between <strong>intent-based actions</strong> (jumping, attacking) that represent discrete player intentions, and <strong>state-based actions</strong> (movement, crouching) that represent ongoing player control. Intent-based actions benefit from buffering and consumption, while state-based actions should be checked directly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jump Buffer Integration Example</strong></p>\n<p>Consider the interaction between input buffering and the jump mechanics described in the Physics Engine section. When a player approaches a platform edge, they might press jump slightly before landing, slightly after leaving the edge (covered by coyote time), or during the brief window between coyote time expiring and landing (where jump buffer provides the solution).</p>\n<p><strong>Walk-through Scenario: Edge Jump with Buffer</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Player character runs toward a platform edge while airborne (coyote time expired)</li>\n<li>Player presses jump button 50ms before landing, anticipating the ground contact</li>\n<li>Input system captures jump press with timestamp and stores in buffer</li>\n<li>Character continues falling and contacts ground, setting <code>onGround</code> to true</li>\n<li>Next physics update checks for valid jump conditions: character is grounded AND jump buffer contains recent input</li>\n<li>Jump system finds valid buffered input within 100ms window and triggers upward velocity</li>\n<li>Input system consumes the buffered jump press to prevent double-jumping</li>\n<li>Character begins jumping with smooth, responsive feel despite imperfect timing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This creates a <strong>forgiveness window</strong> that makes precise platforming feel fair while maintaining the challenge of proper positioning and timing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"control-mapping\">Control Mapping</h3>\n<p>Control mapping transforms raw hardware input events into meaningful game actions, providing the abstraction layer that allows the same game logic to work with keyboards, gamepads, and other input devices. More importantly, it provides a centralized location for input configuration and accessibility customization.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Translation Layer</strong></p>\n<p>Think of control mapping like a <strong>universal translator</strong> that converts different &quot;languages&quot; of input devices into a common language that your game systems understand. A keyboard speaks in terms of key codes and press/release events. A gamepad speaks in terms of button indices and analog stick values. The control mapping system learns both languages and translates everything into game-specific terms like &quot;move_left&quot;, &quot;jump&quot;, and &quot;attack&quot;.</p>\n<p>This translation layer also handles the <strong>semantic meaning</strong> of inputs. The left arrow key and the gamepad&#39;s left stick both mean &quot;move left&quot;, but they produce different raw input data. The mapping system normalizes these differences so the physics and entity systems can focus on game logic rather than input hardware details.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Control Mapping Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to support multiple input devices with customizable key bindings while maintaining clean separation between input hardware and game logic</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Direct key code checking in game systems</li>\n<li>Simple key remapping with hardcoded action names  </li>\n<li>Action-based mapping system with configurable bindings</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Action-based mapping system with configurable bindings</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Direct key checking creates tight coupling between input hardware and game logic, making device support and customization difficult. Action-based mapping provides clean abstraction, supports multiple devices naturally, and enables player customization without code changes</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more initial setup but provides extensibility for accessibility features, multiple control schemes, and easy device support</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The control mapping system operates through <strong>action definitions</strong> that describe the semantic meaning of each input, paired with <strong>binding configurations</strong> that specify which hardware inputs trigger each action. This separation allows the same action to be triggered by multiple input sources and enables runtime reconfiguration for accessibility or player preference.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Control Mapping Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>actionDefinitions</code></td>\n<td><code>Map&lt;string, ActionConfig&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Semantic actions the game supports (jump, move_left, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>inputBindings</code></td>\n<td><code>Map&lt;string, InputBinding[]&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Hardware inputs mapped to each action</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>deviceStates</code></td>\n<td><code>Map&lt;string, DeviceState&gt;</code></td>\n<td>Current state of each input device</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>inputContext</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Current input context (gameplay, menu, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Action Definition Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Each action definition describes not just the name of the action, but also its behavioral characteristics that affect how the mapping system processes it.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Action Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier for this action (jump, move_left)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>inputType</code></td>\n<td><code>ActionType</code></td>\n<td>Whether this is a button press, axis input, or trigger</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>requiresBuffering</code></td>\n<td><code>boolean</code></td>\n<td>Whether this action benefits from input buffering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>allowRepeat</code></td>\n<td><code>boolean</code></td>\n<td>Whether holding the input should generate repeated actions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>deadzone</code></td>\n<td><code>number</code></td>\n<td>Minimum input threshold for analog inputs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Input Binding Structure</strong>  </p>\n<p>Input bindings connect specific hardware inputs to action definitions, handling the complexity of different device types and input methods.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Binding Property</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>deviceType</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Input device type (keyboard, gamepad, mouse)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>inputCode</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Device-specific input identifier (KeyA, Button0, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>modifier</code></td>\n<td><code>InputModifier</code></td>\n<td>Additional processing (invert, scale, deadzone)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>context</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>When this binding is active (gameplay, menu, all)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Multi-Device Input Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Modern platformers must gracefully handle multiple input devices being used simultaneously or switched between during gameplay. The control mapping system maintains separate state tracking for each device while providing unified action queries to game systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Device Priority and Conflict Resolution</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple devices provide input for the same action simultaneously, the mapping system uses a priority system to determine which input takes precedence. This prevents conflicting inputs from canceling each other out while allowing seamless device switching.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Priority Level</th>\n<th>Device Types</th>\n<th>Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Most recently used device</td>\n<td>Takes precedence for conflicting actions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Explicitly configured primary device</td>\n<td>Used when no recent input detected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>All other connected devices</td>\n<td>Ignored during conflicts but monitored for activity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Input Context Management</strong></p>\n<p>Different game states require different input interpretations.

This creates inconsistent responsiveness where identical player timing might work at 60 FPS but fail at 30 FPS.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Input events are generated by the operating system at arbitrary times that don&#39;t align with your game&#39;s frame boundaries. Polling input only during <code>update()</code> calls means short-duration button presses might be missed entirely if they occur and release between frames.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use event-based input capture that records all input events as they occur, combined with buffering that maintains these events across multiple frames. Process input events in a separate phase from game logic updates.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Consuming Continuous Actions</strong></p>\n<p>Developers often apply the same buffering and consumption logic to both discrete actions (jumping) and continuous actions (movement), causing movement to stop working after the buffer expires even when the key is still held.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Movement should continue as long as the key is held, but consuming buffered movement input prevents this. The player holds right arrow to run, but after 100ms the buffered input gets consumed and movement stops despite the key still being pressed.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Distinguish between intent-based actions that should be consumed after use (jump, attack) and state-based actions that should be checked directly (movement, crouch). Use different processing paths for each type.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Input Context</strong></p>\n<p>Allowing all input actions to be processed regardless of game state creates bizarre behavior like jumping while in menus or moving during cutscenes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Input actions have semantic meaning that depends on game context. Jump should trigger jumping during gameplay but might mean &quot;confirm selection&quot; in menus. Processing all actions in all contexts creates confusing user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement input context management that enables/disables specific action categories based on current game state. Define clear context boundaries and transition rules.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Device State Desynchronization</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to properly track device connection/disconnection states can lead to phantom inputs from disconnected devices or missing inputs from newly connected devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Device states change dynamically during gameplay. A gamepad might be disconnected mid-game, or a player might plug in a controller after starting with keyboard. Stale device state causes the input system to check disconnected devices or ignore newly available ones.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement device monitoring that detects connection changes and updates device state accordingly. Provide graceful fallback when primary input device becomes unavailable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The input system requires careful integration with the game loop and clean separation between hardware-specific input capture and game-specific action processing.

System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> 1 (Basic Movement and Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - establishes the visual presentation layer that displays game entities, tiles, and camera-based views to the player</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the rendering system as a <strong>film crew with a camera operator</strong>. The film crew (sprite renderer) knows how to capture each actor (entity) in their current pose (animation frame), while the camera operator (camera system) follows the action smoothly, keeping the main character in frame while respecting the boundaries of the set (level boundaries). Just as a film crew must synchronize their equipment to capture 24 frames per second of smooth motion, our rendering system must coordinate sprite animation timing, camera movement, and screen drawing to deliver consistent 60fps visuals.</p>\n<p>The rendering system serves as the visual presentation layer for our 2D platformer, transforming the abstract game state maintained by the physics engine, entity system, and level system into the pixels that players see on screen. This system must handle multiple complex responsibilities simultaneously: rendering individual sprites with proper animation timing, managing a camera that smoothly follows player movement while respecting level boundaries, and coordinating all visual elements to create a cohesive game world.</p>\n<p>The core architectural challenge in rendering lies in the coordination between multiple moving parts that operate on different timescales. Entity sprites may animate at 12-15 frames per second to create character movement, while the camera follows player motion with smooth interpolation over multiple game frames, and the entire screen refreshes at 60fps. The rendering system must synchronize these different temporal requirements while maintaining consistent visual quality and performance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/platformer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fgame-loop-cycle.svg\" alt=\"Game Loop Execution Cycle\"></p>\n<p>The rendering system integrates into the main game loop as the final phase before frame presentation. After input processing, physics updates, and collision resolution complete, the rendering system takes the current game state and translates it into the visual representation that players experience. This separation of concerns ensures that visual presentation never interferes with game logic timing or physics simulation accuracy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Immediate Mode Rendering Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to choose between immediate mode rendering (draw commands issued each frame) vs retained mode rendering (scene graph with cached visual elements)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate mode with per-frame draw calls, retained mode with scene graph caching, hybrid approach with static/dynamic separation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Immediate mode rendering with frame-by-frame draw command issuing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: 2D platformers have relatively simple scenes with moderate entity counts, making caching overhead unnecessary. Immediate mode provides predictable performance characteristics and simpler debugging since all rendering logic executes in sequence each frame</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables straightforward rendering pipeline with clear execution order, but requires efficient sprite batching to avoid excessive draw calls for large tile maps</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rendering system architecture consists of three primary subsystems working in coordination. The sprite rendering subsystem manages individual entity and tile visualization with animation frame management. The camera system provides viewport management with smooth player tracking and boundary constraints. These subsystems share common rendering infrastructure including texture management, coordinate transformation, and screen presentation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rendering Subsystem</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Components</th>\n<th>Dependencies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sprite Renderer</td>\n<td>Entity and tile visualization</td>\n<td>Animation manager, texture atlas, sprite batching</td>\n<td>Entity positions, animation state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Camera System</td>\n<td>Viewport management and tracking</td>\n<td>Camera entity, smooth following, boundary constraints</td>\n<td>Player position, level boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Render Pipeline</td>\n<td>Screen presentation coordination</td>\n<td>Draw call sequencing, coordinate transformation, frame buffer management</td>\n<td>All visual elements</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"sprite-rendering\">Sprite Rendering</h3>\n<p>Think of sprite rendering as <strong>flip-book animation brought to life</strong>. Each entity in our game world is like a character in a flip-book, with multiple drawings (sprites) that show different poses or movements. The sprite renderer acts as the person flipping through the pages, showing the right drawing at the right time to create the illusion of smooth animation. Just as a flip-book artist must time page flips to match the desired motion speed, our sprite renderer must advance animation frames at the correct rate to make characters appear to run, jump, or patrol naturally.</p>\n<p>The sprite rendering subsystem handles the visual representation of all game entities including the player character, enemies, and environmental elements. This subsystem must coordinate multiple complex tasks: selecting the correct animation frame based on entity state and elapsed time, positioning sprites according to camera coordinates, and efficiently batching similar sprites to minimize draw calls and maintain 60fps performance.</p>\n<p>Entity sprite rendering begins with <strong>animation frame selection</strong> based on the entity&#39;s current state and internal animation timer. Each entity maintains animation state that tracks which animation sequence is currently playing (running, jumping, falling, idle) and how much time has elapsed since the animation began. The sprite renderer uses this timing information to calculate which frame within the animation sequence should be displayed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Animation Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>currentAnimation</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Name of active animation sequence</td>\n<td>&quot;idle&quot;, &quot;running&quot;, &quot;jumping&quot;, &quot;falling&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>frameIndex</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Current frame within animation sequence</td>\n<td>0, 1, 2, 3 for 4-frame run cycle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>frameTimer</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time elapsed in current frame</td>\n<td>0.0 to frameDuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>frameDuration</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Time each frame displays before advancing</td>\n<td>0.083 (12fps), 0.067 (15fps)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>looping</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether animation repeats after final frame</td>\n<td>true for run cycle, false for death</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>animationComplete</td>\n<td>boolean</td>\n<td>Whether non-looping animation finished</td>\n<td>false during play, true when finished</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The animation frame calculation follows a time-based approach that ensures consistent animation speed regardless of framerate variations. Each animation frame has a defined duration (typically 67-83ms for 12-15fps character animation), and the sprite renderer accumulates delta time until enough time passes to advance to the next frame. This approach prevents animation speed fluctuations when the game framerate varies between 50-60fps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Animation timing must remain independent of rendering framerate to ensure consistent visual behavior. A character&#39;s run cycle should complete in exactly 0.5 seconds whether the game runs at 45fps or 60fps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Animation frame advancement</strong> occurs through a time accumulation process that respects individual animation timing requirements. The sprite renderer maintains per-entity frame timers that accumulate delta time each frame. When the accumulated time exceeds the current frame&#39;s duration, the renderer advances to the next frame and subtracts the frame duration from the timer, preserving any excess time for smooth animation timing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Accumulate frame time</strong> by adding the current frame&#39;s delta time to the entity&#39;s frameTimer</li>\n<li><strong>Check frame duration</strong> to determine if enough time has passed to advance animation</li>\n<li><strong>Advance frame index</strong> by incrementing to the next frame in the animation sequence</li>\n<li><strong>Handle sequence completion</strong> by either looping back to frame 0 or marking animation complete</li>\n<li><strong>Preserve excess time</strong> by subtracting frame duration from timer rather than resetting to zero</li>\n<li><strong>Update sprite coordinates</strong> to reference the new frame in the texture atlas</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Texture atlas management provides the foundation for efficient sprite rendering by packing multiple animation frames into single texture files. The sprite renderer maintains atlas metadata that describes the pixel coordinates and dimensions of each frame within the texture. This approach minimizes texture binding operations and enables efficient sprite batching for improved rendering performance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Atlas Metadata Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>textureID</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Identifier for atlas texture file</td>\n<td>&quot;player_sprites&quot;, &quot;enemy_sprites&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>frameWidth</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Width of each sprite frame in pixels</td>\n<td>32, 48, 64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>frameHeight</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Height of each sprite frame in pixels</td>\n<td>32, 48, 64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>framesPerRow</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Number of frames in each atlas row</td>\n<td>8, 12, 16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>animations</td>\n<td>object</td>\n<td>Map of animation names to frame sequences</td>\n<td>{&quot;idle&quot;: [0,1,2,1], &quot;run&quot;: [4,5,6,7]}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Sprite positioning</strong> requires coordinate transformation between world space (where entities exist) and screen space (where pixels are drawn). The sprite renderer applies the camera&#39;s transformation matrix to convert entity world coordinates into screen coordinates that account for camera position, zoom level, and screen resolution. This transformation ensures sprites appear in the correct screen location as the camera follows the player.</p>\n<p>The coordinate transformation process involves several mathematical steps that convert from game world units to final pixel positions. First, the renderer subtracts the camera&#39;s world position from the entity&#39;s world position to get camera-relative coordinates. Then it applies any camera zoom scaling and adds the camera&#39;s screen offset to center the view appropriately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Pixel-Perfect Sprite Positioning</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to choose between sub-pixel sprite positioning (allowing fractional coordinates) vs pixel-perfect positioning (rounding to integer coordinates)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Sub-pixel positioning with linear filtering, pixel-perfect positioning with coordinate rounding, adaptive approach based on camera zoom</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Pixel-perfect positioning with coordinate rounding for primary game resolution</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: 2D platformers benefit from crisp pixel art aesthetics, and pixel-perfect positioning prevents sprite blurriness that occurs with sub-pixel positioning and linear filtering</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Ensures crisp visual appearance but may cause minor visual jitter during smooth camera movement at non-integer positions</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sprite batching optimization</strong> groups similar sprites together to minimize the number of individual draw calls required each frame. The renderer sorts sprites by texture atlas and depth layer, then issues single draw calls that render multiple sprites sharing the same texture. This batching approach dramatically improves rendering performance when displaying large tile maps or multiple enemies with shared sprite sheets.</p>\n<p>The batching process accumulates sprite data into vertex buffers that contain position, texture coordinate, and color information for multiple sprites. Each sprite contributes four vertices (forming a quad) with texture coordinates that reference the appropriate frame within the atlas. The graphics hardware can then render hundreds of sprites with a single draw call instead of requiring individual draw calls per sprite.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Animation State Desynchronization</strong>\nEntity animation state can become desynchronized with visual appearance when animation timers are not properly maintained during entity state changes. This occurs when changing from &quot;running&quot; to &quot;jumping&quot; animation without resetting the frame timer, causing the jump animation to begin partway through instead of starting from the first frame. Always reset <code>frameTimer</code> to 0 and <code>frameIndex</code> to 0 when changing animation sequences to ensure animations begin from the correct starting frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Tile rendering</strong> follows similar principles to entity sprite rendering but with optimizations for the static, grid-based nature of level geometry. Tile sprites typically don&#39;t animate (except for special tiles like water or lava), allowing the renderer to use more aggressive batching optimizations. The tile renderer can pre-calculate screen coordinates for visible tiles and update only when the camera moves significantly.</p>\n<p>The tile rendering process begins by determining which tiles are visible within the camera&#39;s viewport. This <strong>viewport culling</strong> prevents the renderer from processing tiles that are outside the screen boundaries, significantly improving performance for large levels. The renderer calculates the range of tile coordinates that intersect with the camera&#39;s view rectangle and processes only those tiles.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tile Rendering Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Viewport culling</td>\n<td>Rectangle calculation</td>\n<td>Determines visible tile range</td>\n<td>Reduces tile processing by 80-95%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sprite batching</td>\n<td>Vertex buffer optimization</td>\n<td>Groups tiles by texture atlas</td>\n<td>Reduces draw calls by 90-98%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Static optimization</td>\n<td>Pre-calculated geometry</td>\n<td>Caches tile positions until camera moves</td>\n<td>Eliminates per-frame calculations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"camera-system\">Camera System</h3>\n<p>Think of the camera system as a <strong>professional cinematographer</strong> following the action in a movie. Just as a skilled camera operator smoothly tracks actors while keeping them properly framed and never showing the edge of the set, our camera system must follow the player character with fluid motion while respecting level boundaries and maintaining appropriate composition. The camera operator makes subtle adjustments to keep the subject in the optimal position within the frame, anticipating movement and providing smooth, comfortable viewing that never distracts from the action.</p>\n<p>The camera system provides viewport management and player tracking functionality that determines what portion of the game world appears on screen at any given time. This system must balance multiple competing requirements: keeping the player character visible and appropriately positioned, responding smoothly to player movement without causing disorienting camera motion, and respecting level boundaries to never show empty space beyond the designed play area.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera following mechanics</strong> implement smooth player tracking that avoids jarring camera movement while maintaining appropriate player positioning within the screen. The camera doesn&#39;t simply lock to the player&#39;s exact position, as this would cause constant camera motion that makes the game difficult to play. Instead, the camera uses a <strong>deadzone</strong> approach where small player movements don&#39;t trigger camera adjustment, but larger movements cause the camera to smoothly interpolate toward a new position.</p>\n<p>The deadzone defines a rectangular region around the screen center where the player can move freely without causing camera adjustment. When the player moves outside this deadzone, the camera begins interpolating toward a new position that brings the player back within the acceptable region. This approach provides stable camera behavior during small movements while ensuring the camera responds appropriately to significant player motion.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Camera Component</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Typical Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>worldX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Camera center X coordinate in world space</td>\n<td>0 to levelWidth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>worldY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Camera center Y coordinate in world space</td>\n<td>0 to levelHeight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>targetX</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Desired camera X position based on player</td>\n<td>Player X position with offset</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>targetY</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Desired camera Y position based on player</td>\n<td>Player Y position with offset</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>deadzoneWidth</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Width of no-movement zone around screen center</td>\n<td>100-200 pixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>deadzoneHeight</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Height of no-movement zone around screen center</td>\n<td>80-150 pixels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>followSpeed</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Camera interpolation speed toward target</td>\n<td>2.0-5.0 units per second</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>lookAheadDistance</td>\n<td>number</td>\n<td>Additional offset in player movement direction</td>\n<td>50-100 pixels</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The camera update process occurs each frame during the rendering phase, after all entity positions have been finalized by the physics and collision systems. This timing ensures the camera responds to the player&#39;s actual position rather than predicted position, preventing visual lag or stuttering that could occur with incorrect update ordering.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Calculate target position</strong> by taking the player&#39;s current world position and adding appropriate offset for screen composition</li>\n<li><strong>Apply look-ahead offset</strong> by adding extra distance in the direction the player is moving to show more of the upcoming path</li>\n<li><strong>Check deadzone boundaries</strong> to determine if the target position requires camera movement</li>\n<li><strong>Interpolate camera position</strong> smoothly toward the target using exponential decay or linear interpolation</li>\n<li><strong>Apply boundary constraints</strong> to ensure the camera never shows areas outside the defined level boundaries</li>\n<li><strong>Update viewport transformation</strong> matrix that converts world coordinates to screen coordinates</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Look-ahead mechanics</strong> enhance player experience by showing more of the game world in the direction of player movement. When the player runs to the right, the camera gradually shifts to show more of the rightward path and less of the leftward area. This anticipatory camera behavior helps players see upcoming obstacles, enemies, and platforms before they become immediate concerns.</p>\n<p>The look-ahead calculation uses the player&#39;s current velocity to determine both the direction and magnitude of the camera offset. Faster player movement results in greater look-ahead distance, while stationary players receive no look-ahead offset. The camera applies this offset gradually to avoid sudden camera jumps when the player changes direction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Exponential Decay Camera Smoothing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to choose camera interpolation method that provides smooth following without lag or overshoot</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Linear interpolation toward target, exponential decay smoothing, spring-damper system</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Exponential decay smoothing with configurable follow speed</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Exponential decay provides natural-feeling camera movement that&#39;s fast when far from target and slow when close, preventing overshoot while maintaining responsiveness</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Creates smooth, professional-feeling camera movement but requires tuning the decay rate for optimal feel</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Boundary constraint enforcement</strong> prevents the camera from displaying areas outside the designed level boundaries. When the camera&#39;s target position would show empty space beyond the level edges, the constraint system clamps the camera position to keep only valid game world areas visible. This clamping must account for screen dimensions to ensure the entire screen remains filled with valid level content.</p>\n<p>The boundary calculation determines the valid range for camera center coordinates based on level dimensions and screen size. The minimum camera X position ensures the left edge of the screen doesn&#39;t extend beyond the left level boundary, while the maximum camera X position ensures the right edge of the screen doesn&#39;t extend beyond the right level boundary. Similar calculations apply for vertical boundaries.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Boundary Type</th>\n<th>Calculation</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Minimum X</td>\n<td>screenWidth / 2</td>\n<td>Leftmost valid camera center X</td>\n<td>400 for 800px screen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum X</td>\n<td>levelWidth - screenWidth / 2</td>\n<td>Rightmost valid camera center X</td>\n<td>1600 for 2400px level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Y</td>\n<td>screenHeight / 2</td>\n<td>Topmost valid camera center Y</td>\n<td>300 for 600px screen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum Y</td>\n<td>levelHeight - screenHeight / 2</td>\n<td>Bottommost valid camera center Y</td>\n<td>1200 for 1800px level</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Screen shake effects</strong> can be implemented as temporary camera offset modifiers that add controlled random motion to simulate impacts, explosions, or other dramatic events. The camera system applies these offset modifiers after calculating the base camera position but before final boundary constraint enforcement. Screen shake effects decay over time and should never violate level boundary constraints.</p>\n<p>The coordinate transformation system converts between world coordinates (where game entities exist) and screen coordinates (where pixels are drawn). This transformation accounts for camera position, any zoom scaling, and screen resolution to ensure all visual elements appear in the correct locations. The transformation matrix calculation occurs once per frame and applies to all rendered elements.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Camera Boundary Edge Cases</strong>\nCamera boundary constraints can create jarring visual behavior when the level is smaller than the screen size, causing the camera to lock to a fixed position that may not optimally frame the player. Handle small levels by centering the camera on the level center rather than following the player, or by adding padding areas that keep the camera behavior consistent. Always test camera behavior at level edges to ensure smooth constraint application.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-layer camera effects</strong> can enhance visual depth by applying different camera influence factors to background, midground, and foreground elements. Background elements might move at 50% of camera speed to create parallax effects, while foreground elements move at 120% of camera speed to enhance depth perception. These effects require careful coordination with the sprite rendering system to apply appropriate transformation matrices to different visual layers.</p>\n<p>The camera system integrates with the rendering pipeline by providing transformation matrices that convert world coordinates to screen coordinates. Every sprite rendering operation applies this transformation to position visual elements correctly relative to the camera&#39;s current view. The camera system updates these transformation matrices each frame based on its current world position and any active camera effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The rendering system requires careful coordination between graphics APIs, texture management, and animation timing to deliver smooth 60fps visuals.

Edge Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones - addresses critical robustness concerns that arise throughout the entire platformer implementation, from basic physics simulation through complex entity interactions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of error handling in a 2D platformer like <strong>safety systems in a high-speed train</strong>. The train (your game) needs to maintain smooth, consistent motion at 60 frames per second, but when something goes wrong—a calculation error, an unexpected collision, or a timing anomaly—the safety systems must detect the problem instantly and correct course without passengers (players) noticing the disruption. Unlike traditional software where you might show an error dialog and wait for user input, games must handle errors gracefully in real-time while maintaining the illusion of a consistent, physics-driven world.</p>\n<p>The challenge of error handling in real-time games is fundamentally different from typical application development. When your physics simulation encounters an edge case—like a player moving so fast they tunnel through a wall, or a floating-point precision error causing a character to vibrate infinitely—you cannot pause the game loop to debug the issue. Instead, you must detect these anomalies during execution and apply corrective measures that preserve game flow while preventing the error from cascading into other systems. This requires a defensive programming approach where every component assumes its inputs might be invalid and every calculation verifies its outputs before propagating them downstream.</p>\n<p>The most critical insight for platformer error handling is understanding the <strong>cascade effect</strong>: a small physics error can quickly amplify into game-breaking behavior. When a player&#39;s position becomes invalid due to a collision resolution bug, it affects rendering (camera following), input (ground state detection), entity interactions (enemy collision), and level progression (checkpoint activation). A robust error handling system must break these cascade chains early, isolating errors to their source components while maintaining consistent game state across all systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"physics-simulation-edge-cases\">Physics Simulation Edge Cases</h3>\n<p>Physics simulation in 2D platformers introduces several categories of edge cases that can break game flow if not handled properly. The most common issues stem from floating-point precision limitations, frame-rate dependent calculations, and boundary condition violations in the physics update loop.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating-point precision errors</strong> manifest when entities approach tile boundaries or when velocity calculations accumulate small rounding errors over many frames. These errors can cause entities to become &quot;stuck&quot; at tile edges, vibrate between positions, or slowly drift through solid geometry. The magnitude of these errors increases with game speed and decreases with the precision of your floating-point representation.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame-rate dependent edge cases</strong> occur when the physics simulation receives unexpected delta time values—either extremely large values during frame drops or negative values during system clock adjustments. Large delta times can cause entities to move so far in a single frame that they tunnel through collision geometry, while negative delta times can reverse physics calculations and cause entities to move backward in time.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal velocity violations</strong> happen when acceleration calculations exceed the defined <code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code> constant, either due to calculation errors or accumulated velocity from multiple acceleration sources. This can cause entities to move impossibly fast and break collision detection assumptions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Edge Case</th>\n<th>Symptoms</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Position Drift</td>\n<td>Entity slowly moves through solid tiles</td>\n<td>Floating-point precision loss in collision resolution</td>\n<td>Track entity position history, detect unexpected movement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Velocity Explosion</td>\n<td>Entity accelerates beyond terminal velocity</td>\n<td>Accumulated acceleration from multiple sources</td>\n<td>Validate velocity magnitude after physics update</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delta Time Spike</td>\n<td>Entity tunnels through collision geometry</td>\n<td>Frame drop or system performance issue</td>\n<td>Clamp delta time to <code>maxDeltaTime</code> threshold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Negative Delta</td>\n<td>Entity moves backward or physics reverses</td>\n<td>System clock adjustment or profiler interference</td>\n<td>Validate delta time is positive before physics update</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ground State Flip</td>\n<td>Player rapidly alternates between grounded/airborne</td>\n<td>Collision detection inconsistency at tile boundaries</td>\n<td>Implement state change hysteresis with <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infinite Jump</td>\n<td>Player gains unlimited jump height</td>\n<td>Jump velocity applied multiple frames during input buffer</td>\n<td>Clear jump input after applying velocity impulse</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> The key to robust physics error handling is <strong>graceful degradation</strong>—when the simulation encounters an impossible state, it should degrade to the closest valid state rather than allowing the error to propagate. For example, if collision resolution fails to separate overlapping entities, the system should snap them to the last known valid positions rather than leaving them stuck inside each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Delta Time Clamping Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Large delta time values during frame drops can cause physics tunneling and collision detection failures, while negative delta times can reverse physics calculations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Reject invalid frames entirely and skip updates</li>\n<li>Clamp delta time to maximum safe value and subdivide large updates</li>\n<li>Use fixed timestep physics with frame interpolation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Clamp delta time to <code>maxDeltaTime</code> (33.33ms) and subdivide large updates into multiple smaller steps</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Frame rejection creates visible stuttering during performance issues, while fixed timestep requires complex interpolation. Clamping preserves frame-rate independence while preventing physics instability during frame drops</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables graceful performance degradation at the cost of slight slow-motion effect during severe frame drops, maintains collision detection reliability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The delta time clamping system works by detecting when the elapsed frame time exceeds the maximum safe threshold, then subdividing the update into multiple smaller physics steps. Each subdivision uses the clamped delta time value, ensuring that no single physics update moves entities farther than the collision detection system can reliably handle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collision-detection-edge-cases\">Collision Detection Edge Cases</h3>\n<p>Collision detection and resolution present the most complex error scenarios in 2D platformers, as they involve geometric calculations between moving entities and static level geometry. The primary failure modes include tunneling through geometry, corner clipping, floating-point precision issues at tile boundaries, and resolution conflicts when multiple collisions occur simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Tunneling</strong> occurs when an entity moves so fast that it completely passes through collision geometry between frames, bypassing the intersection tests entirely. This happens most commonly during large delta time spikes, but can also occur with normal frame rates if the entity velocity exceeds the collision detection system&#39;s sweep distance assumptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Corner clipping</strong> manifests when entities get &quot;caught&quot; at the intersection of two collision tiles, often causing the player to stop abruptly when sliding along walls or attempting to pass through narrow passages. This occurs because the collision resolution system resolves each axis independently, and the resolution of one collision can inadvertently create a new collision on the perpendicular axis.</p>\n<p><strong>Precision boundary issues</strong> arise when entities are positioned exactly at tile boundaries due to floating-point representation limitations. An entity at position 64.0000001 might be detected as overlapping both tile (2,0) and tile (2,1), causing inconsistent collision responses or rapid state changes between grounded and airborne states.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Edge Case</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Prevention Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Tunneling Through Tiles</td>\n<td>Swept AABB test between previous and current position</td>\n<td>Clamp entity velocity to maximum safe speed per frame</td>\n<td>Revert to last valid position and zero velocity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corner Clip Sticking</td>\n<td>Detect perpendicular collision after resolution</td>\n<td>Apply <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code> separation after X-axis resolution</td>\n<td>Nudge entity away from corner by epsilon distance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boundary Precision Error</td>\n<td>Position exactly at tile boundary (remainder = 0)</td>\n<td>Round positions away from tile boundaries</td>\n<td>Snap to nearest valid position with epsilon offset</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple Collision Conflict</td>\n<td>Two+ collisions resolve to contradictory positions</td>\n<td>Prioritize collision resolution by surface normal</td>\n<td>Use most restrictive resolution and log conflict</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>One-way Platform Inconsistency</td>\n<td>Player falls through platform when barely touching</td>\n<td>Implement consistent downward velocity threshold</td>\n<td>Require minimum downward velocity to pass through</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Resolution Failure</td>\n<td>Entity remains overlapping after resolution</td>\n<td>All resolution attempts leave entities intersecting</td>\n<td>Emergency separation using entity bounding box centers</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most critical collision edge case is <strong>resolution failure</strong>, where the geometric separation calculations cannot find a valid position that separates overlapping entities. This typically occurs when multiple entities overlap simultaneously, when an entity becomes surrounded by collision geometry with no escape route, or when floating-point precision prevents the resolution algorithm from achieving the required <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code> separation distance.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision: Emergency Collision Recovery System</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Complex collision scenarios can cause the resolution system to fail completely, leaving entities permanently stuck inside collision geometry</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Restart the entity at its last known good position</li>\n<li>Disable collision for the entity temporarily until separation is achieved  </li>\n<li>Force separation using entity bounding box center points</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement emergency separation using bounding box centers with logarithmic fallback distances</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Restarting entities at previous positions can cause visible teleportation, while disabling collision creates new gameplay inconsistencies. Center-based separation provides deterministic recovery with minimal visual disruption</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Ensures entities never remain permanently stuck at the cost of occasional small position adjustments that may be visible to players</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The emergency collision recovery system activates when standard resolution fails after a maximum number of iterations. It calculates the vector between entity bounding box centers, normalizes it, and moves the entities apart by progressively larger distances until separation is achieved. This provides a deterministic escape mechanism that prevents infinite collision resolution loops.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-interaction-edge-cases\">Entity Interaction Edge Cases</h3>\n<p>Entity interactions between players, enemies, and environmental objects introduce state management complexities that can lead to inconsistent game behavior. The most problematic scenarios involve simultaneous interactions, state transition timing issues, and cascading effects between multiple entity systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Simultaneous interaction conflicts</strong> occur when multiple interaction types happen in the same frame—for example, when a player stomps an enemy while simultaneously touching a hazard. The order of interaction processing determines the final outcome, but this order may be non-deterministic depending on entity update sequence or collision detection timing.</p>\n<p><strong>Invulnerability frame exploitation</strong> happens when the timing of invulnerability periods allows players to pass through hazards or survive interactions that should be fatal. This occurs most commonly when invulnerability timers are managed inconsistently across different interaction types, or when frame-rate variations affect the duration of invulnerability periods.</p>\n<p><strong>State transition race conditions</strong> manifest when entities change state during interaction processing, causing subsequent interactions in the same frame to use outdated state information. For example, an enemy might be marked as defeated but continue processing collision with the player before the defeated state is fully applied.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Interaction Edge Case</th>\n<th>Symptoms</th>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Resolution Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stomp vs Damage Conflict</td>\n<td>Player dies while successfully stomping enemy</td>\n<td>Both interactions process simultaneously</td>\n<td>Prioritize stomp detection, cancel damage if successful</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Double Enemy Defeat</td>\n<td>Enemy defeat animation/sound plays twice</td>\n<td>Multiple entities stomp same enemy in one frame</td>\n<td>Mark enemy as defeated before processing interactions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invulnerability Bypass</td>\n<td>Player takes damage during invulnerability period</td>\n<td>Frame timing allows damage between invulnerability checks</td>\n<td>Check invulnerability immediately before applying damage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Checkpoint Activation Loop</td>\n<td>Checkpoint repeatedly activates each frame</td>\n<td>Player position exactly at checkpoint boundary</td>\n<td>Implement activation state tracking per checkpoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enemy Patrol Boundary Stuck</td>\n<td>Enemy stops moving at patrol limit</td>\n<td>Boundary collision prevents direction reversal</td>\n<td>Add small epsilon buffer inside patrol boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player Death During Jump</td>\n<td>Player dies while jump input is buffered</td>\n<td>Death doesn&#39;t clear input buffer state</td>\n<td>Clear all input buffers during player death transition</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most complex interaction edge case involves <strong>cascading entity state changes</strong> where one interaction triggers additional state changes that affect subsequent interactions within the same frame. For example, stomping an enemy might trigger a checkpoint activation, which triggers a state save, which processes all current entity positions, but some entities have not yet updated to their final frame positions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> Entity interaction systems must be <strong>transactional</strong>—either all related state changes succeed together, or the entire interaction is rolled back to prevent partial state corruption. This requires careful ordering of interaction processing and state validation before committing changes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"performance-degradation-handling\">Performance Degradation Handling</h3>\n<p>Performance issues in real-time games create a <strong>spiral of death</strong> where decreased frame rates cause increased delta times, which trigger more expensive calculations and error recovery operations, further degrading performance. The platformer engine must detect performance degradation early and implement graceful degradation strategies that preserve core gameplay at the expense of visual fidelity or secondary features.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame rate monitoring</strong> involves tracking rolling averages of frame time and delta time to identify performance trends before they become critical. When frame times consistently exceed target thresholds, the system should preemptively reduce computational load rather than waiting for frame drops to trigger emergency measures.</p>\n<p><strong>Computational load balancing</strong> spreads expensive operations across multiple frames to prevent individual frame spikes. This includes collision detection optimizations, entity AI updates, and rendering optimizations that can be deferred or approximated during performance stress.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory pressure handling</strong> addresses situations where garbage collection or memory allocation causes frame time spikes. The platformer engine should minimize dynamic allocations during gameplay and provide object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities like projectiles or particle effects.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Issue</th>\n<th>Early Warning Signs</th>\n<th>Degradation Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Frame Rate Drop</td>\n<td>Average frame time &gt; 18ms for 5+ frames</td>\n<td>Reduce collision detection precision, skip non-critical entity updates</td>\n<td>Return to normal when frame time &lt; 16ms for 30 frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Pressure</td>\n<td>GC frequency increases above baseline</td>\n<td>Pool and reuse entity objects, defer asset loading</td>\n<td>Resume normal allocation when GC pressure normalizes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Physics Instability</td>\n<td>Multiple collision resolution failures per frame</td>\n<td>Increase <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code>, reduce maximum entity velocity</td>\n<td>Restore full precision when collision failures drop to baseline</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Lag</td>\n<td>Input buffer filling faster than processing</td>\n<td>Process only most recent input events, clear buffer overflow</td>\n<td>Resume normal buffering when input queue stabilizes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rendering Bottleneck</td>\n<td>Draw calls exceed GPU capacity</td>\n<td>Batch sprite rendering, reduce particle counts</td>\n<td>Return to full quality when GPU utilization drops</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity Update Overload</td>\n<td>Too many entities active simultaneously</td>\n<td>Deactivate distant enemies, reduce AI update frequency</td>\n<td>Reactivate full entity systems when count decreases</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Decision: Adaptive Quality System</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Performance issues can cascade into game-breaking problems, but static quality settings cannot adapt to varying system capabilities or game complexity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Fixed quality levels set by user configuration</li>\n<li>Automatic quality reduction based on frame rate monitoring</li>\n<li>Predictive quality adjustment based on scene complexity</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement automatic quality reduction with hysteresis thresholds to prevent oscillation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fixed quality settings cannot respond to dynamic performance conditions, while predictive systems require complex scene analysis.

Unlike systems programming languages, JavaScript&#39;s automatic memory management can introduce unpredictable frame time spikes during garbage collection cycles.</p>\n<p><strong>Garbage collection pressure</strong> builds up when the game creates and discards objects faster than the garbage collector can reclaim memory. This is particularly problematic in game loops where temporary objects (like collision test results or entity position calculations) are created every frame. The garbage collector may pause execution for several milliseconds during cleanup, causing visible frame drops.</p>\n<p><strong>Object lifecycle mismanagement</strong> occurs when game entities are not properly cleaned up when removed from the game world. This includes removing event listeners, clearing timers, and dereferencing objects that hold references to large data structures. Improper cleanup can cause memory usage to grow continuously throughout the game session.</p>\n<p><strong>Event listener accumulation</strong> happens when entities register event listeners (for input, collision events, or state changes) but fail to remove these listeners when the entity is destroyed. This creates memory leaks and can cause destroyed entities to continue responding to events, leading to undefined behavior.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory Issue</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Prevention Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>GC Pressure Spikes</td>\n<td>Monitor frame time variance, detect GC pauses</td>\n<td>Object pooling for frequently created entities</td>\n<td>Force GC during level transitions, not during gameplay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity Memory Leaks</td>\n<td>Track active entity count vs expected count</td>\n<td>Implement <code>destroy()</code> method for all entities</td>\n<td>Scan for orphaned entities, force cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Event Listener Leaks</td>\n<td>Monitor registered listener count growth</td>\n<td>Remove listeners in entity cleanup methods</td>\n<td>Clear all listeners during scene transitions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circular References</td>\n<td>Memory usage grows without creating new entities</td>\n<td>Avoid parent-child entity references</td>\n<td>Implement weak references or manual cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asset Loading Bloat</td>\n<td>Memory usage spikes during level loading</td>\n<td>Stream assets, unload unused level data</td>\n<td>Implement asset reference counting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Animation Frame Leaks</td>\n<td><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> continues after game stops</td>\n<td>Cancel animation frame requests in cleanup</td>\n<td>Track and cancel all pending frame requests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most insidious memory management edge case is <strong>reference cycles</strong> where entities hold references to each other through event callbacks or parent-child relationships. JavaScript&#39;s garbage collector can handle simple cycles, but complex cycles involving DOM elements, event listeners, or large data structures may not be collected automatically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> Memory management in real-time games requires <strong>proactive cleanup</strong> rather than relying on automatic garbage collection. Every entity creation should have a corresponding explicit cleanup that removes all references, cancels all timers, and unregisters all event listeners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"input-system-edge-cases\">Input System Edge Cases</h3>\n<p>Input handling edge cases in platformers often involve timing-sensitive interactions between hardware input events, software input buffering, and game state changes. These issues can cause inputs to be lost, duplicated, or processed in the wrong game state, leading to frustrating player experiences that feel &quot;unresponsive&quot; or &quot;laggy.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Input event ordering</strong> problems occur when multiple input events arrive in a single frame but need to be processed in a specific sequence. For example, if a player presses and releases the jump button within the same frame, the input system must ensure the press is processed before the release to trigger the jump correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Buffer overflow conditions</strong> happen when the player provides input faster than the game can process it, particularly during performance issues or complex collision resolution. The input buffer may fill beyond capacity, causing either the oldest or newest inputs to be lost depending on the buffer implementation.</p>\n<p><strong>State transition input conflicts</strong> manifest when input is processed during state transitions, such as when a player dies while input is still buffered. The buffered input may be applied to the respawned player state, causing unexpected behavior like immediate movement or jumping upon respawn.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Input Edge Case</th>\n<th>Symptoms</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Mitigation Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Lost Jump Input</td>\n<td>Player presses jump but character doesn&#39;t jump</td>\n<td>Input processed during non-grounded state</td>\n<td>Extend jump buffer duration, improve ground state detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Double Jump Exploit</td>\n<td>Player achieves multiple jumps from single press</td>\n<td>Input buffer doesn&#39;t clear after successful jump</td>\n<td>Clear jump buffer immediately after applying jump velocity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input During Death</td>\n<td>Dead player responds to movement input</td>\n<td>Input buffer not cleared during state transition</td>\n<td>Clear all input buffers during player death/respawn</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rapid Input Overflow</td>\n<td>Input buffer fills during performance issues</td>\n<td>Input events arrive faster than processing</td>\n<td>Implement circular buffer, process only most recent inputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-Frame Input Loss</td>\n<td>Input pressed and released in same frame</td>\n<td>Input duration shorter than frame time</td>\n<td>Sample input state at frame boundaries, not events</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Controller vs Keyboard Conflict</td>\n<td>Multiple input sources provide conflicting commands</td>\n<td>Both input types active simultaneously</td>\n<td>Prioritize most recent input source</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most critical input edge case is <strong>input desynchronization</strong> where the input system&#39;s understanding of button states diverges from the actual hardware state. This can occur during focus changes, when the game window loses focus while buttons are pressed, or during system-level input handling that intercepts events before they reach the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision: Input State Reconciliation System</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Input state can become desynchronized with hardware state during window focus changes, system interruptions, or hardware disconnection events</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Trust hardware state completely and ignore desync issues</li>\n<li>Periodically poll hardware state to verify input system state</li>\n<li>Reset all input state during focus/unfocus events</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Reset all input state and clear buffers during window focus transitions</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Polling hardware state is not available in web browsers, and trusting desynchronized state causes players to get &quot;stuck&quot; in movement or jump states. Focus transition reset is reliable across platforms</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Provides consistent input state at the cost of losing buffered input during alt-tab or window switching, requires clear player feedback about focus state</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"graceful-degradation-strategies\">Graceful Degradation Strategies</h3>\n<p>When error conditions cannot be prevented or fully resolved, the platformer engine must implement graceful degradation strategies that preserve core gameplay functionality while sacrificing less critical features. The goal is to maintain the player&#39;s sense of consistent game physics and responsive controls even when individual systems encounter errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Priority-based system degradation</strong> establishes a hierarchy of game systems where core gameplay elements (player movement, basic collision) receive computational priority over secondary features (particle effects, complex AI, audio processing). During performance stress, secondary systems are progressively disabled to preserve core functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Error isolation boundaries</strong> prevent errors in one game system from cascading into other systems. Each major system (physics, rendering, audio, input) should handle its own error conditions and provide fallback behavior rather than propagating errors to dependent systems.</p>\n<p><strong>State consistency validation</strong> ensures that core game state remains valid even when individual calculations fail. After each game loop iteration, the engine validates that player position is within level boundaries, entity health values are within valid ranges, and physics state is consistent with collision geometry.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>System</th>\n<th>Core Function</th>\n<th>Degradation Strategy</th>\n<th>Fallback Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Physics Engine</td>\n<td>Player movement and gravity</td>\n<td>Reduce collision detection precision</td>\n<td>Use simplified AABB tests, disable slope collision</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision System</td>\n<td>Prevent entity overlap</td>\n<td>Emergency separation</td>\n<td>Snap entities to last valid positions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity System</td>\n<td>Enemy AI and interactions</td>\n<td>Reduce update frequency</td>\n<td>Enemies become static obstacles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rendering System</td>\n<td>Visual display</td>\n<td>Lower quality sprites</td>\n<td>Use solid color rectangles for entities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Audio System</td>\n<td>Sound effects and music</td>\n<td>Disable non-critical audio</td>\n<td>Preserve jump/death sounds, disable background music</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input System</td>\n<td>Player control response</td>\n<td>Simplify input processing</td>\n<td>Disable input buffering, use direct state polling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most important degradation strategy is <strong>core gameplay preservation</strong>—even in severe error conditions, the player should be able to move, jump, and interact with basic level geometry. This requires identifying the absolute minimum set of systems that must remain functional for the game to be playable, and ensuring these systems have the most robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight:</strong> Graceful degradation is not just about handling errors—it&#39;s about maintaining <strong>player trust</strong> in the game&#39;s physics and controls. Players can tolerate reduced visual quality or simplified AI, but they cannot tolerate inconsistent jumping or unreliable collision detection. Core movement mechanics must always work predictably, even when everything else is failing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"error-logging-and-diagnostics\">Error Logging and Diagnostics</h3>\n<p>Comprehensive error logging and diagnostic systems are essential for identifying and resolving edge cases during development and after release. The platformer engine must balance detailed error reporting with performance impact, providing enough information to debug issues without overwhelming the logging system or degrading game performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Runtime error classification</strong> categorizes errors by severity and impact on gameplay. Critical errors that break core gameplay (collision resolution failure, player state corruption) require immediate attention and detailed logging, while minor errors (animation frame skips, audio buffer underruns) can be logged with less detail or aggregated over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance impact monitoring</strong> tracks the relationship between error occurrences and frame rate degradation. This helps identify which error conditions contribute to performance issues and which error handling strategies are too expensive for real-time execution.</p>\n<p><strong>State dump capabilities</strong> provide detailed snapshots of game state when critical errors occur, including entity positions, velocities, collision geometry, input state, and recent state history. These dumps enable post-mortem debugging of complex edge cases that are difficult to reproduce.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Logging Level</th>\n<th>Information Captured</th>\n<th>Action Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Physics Failure</td>\n<td>CRITICAL</td>\n<td>Entity positions, velocities, collision geometry, last 10 frames of state</td>\n<td>Immediate investigation, may indicate fundamental physics bug</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Resolution Timeout</td>\n<td>ERROR</td>\n<td>Overlapping entities, attempted resolution vectors, geometry map</td>\n<td>Review collision algorithm, check for edge case geometry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Desynchronization</td>\n<td>WARNING</td>\n<td>Hardware vs software input state, recent input history</td>\n<td>Monitor frequency, may indicate platform-specific input issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Degradation</td>\n<td>INFO</td>\n<td>Frame times, system load, active entity count</td>\n<td>Track trends, optimize if degradation becomes frequent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Pressure</td>\n<td>WARNING</td>\n<td>Object creation/destruction rates, GC frequency, heap size</td>\n<td>Consider object pooling, optimize memory allocation patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Entity State Inconsistency</td>\n<td>ERROR</td>\n<td>Entity state before/after, state transition history</td>\n<td>Validate state machine implementation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Decision: Adaptive Logging System</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Comprehensive error logging is essential for debugging but can impact game performance if too verbose, while insufficient logging makes edge cases impossible to diagnose</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Fixed logging level set by configuration</li>\n<li>Dynamic logging based on error frequency</li>\n<li>Performance-aware logging that reduces detail under load</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement performance-aware logging with automatic detail reduction when frame rate drops below threshold</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Fixed logging levels cannot adapt to varying performance conditions, while frequency-based reduction may miss important but rare errors.

This includes collision boundary visualization, entity state displays, performance graphs, and input state indicators that help developers identify edge cases during testing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Floating-Point Precision in Collision Detection</strong>\nMany developers assume that floating-point calculations in collision detection are exact, leading to entities getting stuck at tile boundaries or slowly drifting through solid geometry. This occurs because repeated collision resolution calculations accumulate small rounding errors that can push entities into invalid positions. The solution is to implement <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code> separation and round entity positions away from exact tile boundaries after collision resolution.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Clamping Delta Time During Performance Issues</strong>\nWhen frame rates drop significantly, the physics system receives very large delta time values that can cause entities to move so far in a single frame that they bypass collision detection entirely. This creates tunneling behavior where players fall through the ground or pass through walls. Always clamp delta time to a maximum safe value (typically 33.33ms for 30 FPS minimum) and subdivide large updates into smaller steps.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Clearing Input Buffers Too Aggressively</strong>\nSome implementations clear all input buffers immediately after any input is processed, which defeats the purpose of input buffering for responsive controls. Input buffers should only be cleared after the specific action has been successfully executed. For example, the jump buffer should only be cleared after jump velocity has been applied, not when the jump button is first detected.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Processing Entity Interactions in Non-Deterministic Order</strong>\nWhen multiple entities interact in the same frame, processing them in different orders can lead to different outcomes, making the game behavior inconsistent between runs. This is particularly problematic for player-enemy interactions where the order of processing determines whether a stomp or damage occurs first. Always process interactions in a consistent order, such as by entity creation time or position sorting.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Handling Emergency Collision Resolution Failure</strong>\nMost collision systems assume that geometric separation can always be calculated successfully, but complex scenarios with multiple overlapping entities can cause resolution algorithms to fail entirely. Without emergency fallback behavior, entities become permanently stuck inside collision geometry. Implement center-based separation as a last resort when geometric resolution fails.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Event Listeners in Entity Systems</strong>\nJavaScript entities that register event listeners for collision detection, state changes, or input handling often forget to remove these listeners when the entity is destroyed. This causes memory leaks and can result in destroyed entities continuing to respond to events, leading to undefined behavior. Always implement explicit cleanup methods that remove all event listeners and references.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The error handling and edge case

verification approaches for physics behavior, collision accuracy, and gameplay feel with milestone checkpoints</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building a 2D platformer engine presents unique testing challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional software testing. Think of testing a platformer like <strong>quality assurance for a theme park ride</strong> - you need to verify not just that the ride works mechanically, but that it feels safe, exciting, and responds predictably to rider behavior. Traditional unit tests can verify mathematical correctness, but platformer games require additional testing layers that validate physics behavior, timing-dependent interactions, and subjective gameplay feel.</p>\n<p>The core testing challenge lies in the <strong>temporal nature</strong> of game systems. Unlike stateless functions that produce deterministic outputs, platformer mechanics involve continuous state changes over time, frame-rate dependent calculations, and complex interactions between multiple systems. A single frame of incorrect physics can compound into game-breaking behavior, while input timing differences measured in milliseconds can mean the difference between a responsive and frustrating control experience.</p>\n<p>This testing strategy addresses verification across multiple dimensions: <strong>mathematical correctness</strong> of physics calculations, <strong>temporal accuracy</strong> of frame-rate independent systems, <strong>interaction validity</strong> between game entities, and <strong>subjective quality</strong> of gameplay feel. Each milestone introduces new testing requirements that build upon previous verification foundations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-philosophy-and-approach\">Testing Philosophy and Approach</h3>\n<p>The platformer testing strategy employs a <strong>layered verification approach</strong> that mirrors the system architecture. Each layer validates different aspects of the engine, from low-level mathematical operations to high-level gameplay scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Mathematical Layer Testing</strong> focuses on the correctness of individual calculations. Physics formulas, collision detection algorithms, and coordinate transformations must produce mathematically accurate results regardless of timing or system state. These tests verify that <code>GRAVITY * deltaTime</code> produces expected velocity changes, that AABB intersection tests correctly identify overlapping rectangles, and that world-to-grid coordinate conversions maintain precision.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporal Layer Testing</strong> validates frame-rate independence and timing-dependent behaviors. These tests verify that physics simulation produces consistent results at different frame rates, that input buffering windows maintain their intended duration, and that animation systems advance frames at correct intervals regardless of rendering performance.</p>\n<p><strong>System Integration Testing</strong> validates interactions between major engine components. These tests verify that the physics engine correctly updates entity positions, that the collision system properly resolves overlapping objects, and that the input system accurately communicates player intentions to the physics engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Experience Testing</strong> validates the subjective quality of game mechanics. These tests verify that jumping feels responsive, that movement has appropriate weight and momentum, and that collision resolution appears smooth rather than jarring. This layer requires both automated verification of measurable properties and manual validation of qualitative aspects.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Automated vs Manual Testing Balance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Platformer testing requires verification of both objective correctness and subjective feel</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Pure automated testing with numerical thresholds</li>\n<li>Pure manual testing through gameplay</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with automated foundations and manual validation layers</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with 70% automated testing and 30% manual validation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Automated tests provide reliable verification of mathematical correctness and prevent regression, while manual testing validates gameplay feel aspects that cannot be quantified</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires investment in both automated test infrastructure and structured manual testing protocols</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Testing Approach</th>\n<th>Coverage</th>\n<th>Advantages</th>\n<th>Disadvantages</th>\n<th>Validation Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Automated Unit Tests</td>\n<td>Physics calculations, collision math, data structure operations</td>\n<td>Fast execution, regression prevention, precise numerical validation</td>\n<td>Cannot verify gameplay feel, limited temporal behavior validation</td>\n<td>Assertion-based verification with numerical thresholds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automated Integration Tests</td>\n<td>System interactions, state transitions, timing-dependent behaviors</td>\n<td>Validates complex scenarios, catches integration bugs, reproducible</td>\n<td>Difficult to set up, requires test harnesses, brittle to refactoring</td>\n<td>Scenario-based verification with expected state outcomes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manual Gameplay Tests</td>\n<td>Control responsiveness, visual smoothness, difficulty progression</td>\n<td>Validates player experience, catches feel issues, intuitive evaluation</td>\n<td>Time-intensive, subjective results, difficult to reproduce</td>\n<td>Structured play sessions with evaluation criteria</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"physics-system-testing\">Physics System Testing</h3>\n<p>Physics system testing validates the mathematical foundation of all game movement. The physics engine serves as the <strong>numerical backbone</strong> of the platformer, where small calculation errors can cascade into major gameplay problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravity and Terminal Velocity Testing</strong> verifies that falling objects behave according to the defined physics constants. Tests validate that entities accelerate downward at exactly <code>GRAVITY</code> pixels per second squared, that falling speed never exceeds <code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code>, and that gravity calculations remain consistent across different frame rates.</p>\n<p>The core gravity test creates a <code>Player</code> entity at a known position, applies gravity for a measured time period, and verifies the final velocity and position match expected values. Delta time variations are tested by running identical scenarios at different simulated frame rates and comparing final outcomes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Initial Conditions</th>\n<th>Expected Outcome</th>\n<th>Validation Method</th>\n<th>Pass Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Basic Gravity Application</td>\n<td>Player at rest, no ground collision</td>\n<td>Downward acceleration at <code>GRAVITY</code> rate</td>\n<td>Velocity measurement after fixed time</td>\n<td><code>velocityY = GRAVITY * timeElapsed</code> within 0.1% tolerance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Velocity Cap</td>\n<td>Player falling for extended period</td>\n<td>Velocity capped at <code>TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code></td>\n<td>Maximum velocity measurement</td>\n<td><code>velocityY &lt;= TERMINAL_VELOCITY</code> always maintained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Rate Independence</td>\n<td>Same scenario at 30fps vs 60fps</td>\n<td>Identical final position after same elapsed time</td>\n<td>Position comparison across frame rates</td>\n<td>Position difference &lt; 1 pixel after equivalent time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ground Collision Stop</td>\n<td>Falling player contacts solid ground</td>\n<td>Immediate velocity reset and position correction</td>\n<td>Velocity and position after collision</td>\n<td><code>velocityY = 0</code> and <code>onGround = true</code> after ground contact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Movement Physics Testing</strong> validates horizontal movement with acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed constraints. Tests verify that player movement responds correctly to input, that momentum carries appropriately when input stops, and that movement calculations maintain precision over extended gameplay sessions.</p>\n<p>Movement tests create controlled input scenarios and measure resulting velocity and position changes. Acceleration curves are verified by measuring velocity at regular intervals during movement startup, while deceleration curves are validated by measuring velocity decay after input cessation.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Mechanics Testing</strong> represents the most complex physics validation due to the interaction between vertical impulse, gravity, and variable height mechanics. Tests must verify that jump initiation applies correct upward velocity, that variable height jumping produces predictable apex heights, and that jump interruption behaves consistently.</p>\n<p>Jump testing employs <strong>trajectory analysis</strong> by recording player position over time and comparing actual flight paths to mathematical predictions. Variable height testing measures jump apex heights across different button hold durations and verifies the relationship follows expected curves.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Jump Test Type</th>\n<th>Test Conditions</th>\n<th>Measured Values</th>\n<th>Expected Relationship</th>\n<th>Validation Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Fixed Height Jump</td>\n<td>Minimum button press duration</td>\n<td>Maximum Y velocity, apex height, total air time</td>\n<td>Mathematical trajectory calculation</td>\n<td>Position within 2 pixels of predicted path</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Height Jump</td>\n<td>Button held for 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s intervals</td>\n<td>Apex height for each duration</td>\n<td>Linear or curved relationship based on design</td>\n<td>Height difference matches intended scaling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jump Interruption</td>\n<td>Button released at various trajectory points</td>\n<td>Final apex height vs release point</td>\n<td>Early release = lower apex</td>\n<td>Apex reduction proportional to release timing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coyote Time Jump</td>\n<td>Jump input 50ms after leaving platform edge</td>\n<td>Jump execution success</td>\n<td>Should allow jump within <code>COYOTE_TIME</code> window</td>\n<td>Jump executes successfully within timing window</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"collision-detection-and-resolution-testing\">Collision Detection and Resolution Testing</h3>\n<p>Collision system testing validates the accuracy of overlap detection and the stability of collision resolution. Think of collision testing like <strong>crash test validation</strong> - you need to verify that the system handles both normal interactions and extreme edge cases without catastrophic failure.</p>\n<p><strong>AABB Collision Accuracy Testing</strong> verifies that rectangle intersection calculations produce mathematically correct results across all possible overlap scenarios. Tests cover full overlap, partial overlap, edge contact, and no contact cases with entities of varying sizes and positions.</p>\n<p>Collision accuracy tests employ <strong>exhaustive case coverage</strong> by systematically testing intersection calculations across a grid of relative positions and sizes. Each test case verifies that the <code>intersectsAABB</code> function returns the correct boolean result and that calculated penetration depths match expected values.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Scenario</th>\n<th>Rectangle A Position/Size</th>\n<th>Rectangle B Position/Size</th>\n<th>Expected Result</th>\n<th>Penetration Depth</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Full Overlap</td>\n<td>(0,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>(8,8,16,16)</td>\n<td>True</td>\n<td>B completely inside A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Partial Overlap</td>\n<td>(0,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>(16,16,32,32)</td>\n<td>True</td>\n<td>16x16 pixel overlap region</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Edge Contact</td>\n<td>(0,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>(32,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>True (touching edges count)</td>\n<td>0 pixel penetration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No Contact</td>\n<td>(0,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>(64,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>False</td>\n<td>No overlap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corner Contact</td>\n<td>(0,0,32,32)</td>\n<td>(32,32,32,32)</td>\n<td>True (corner touching)</td>\n<td>Single point contact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Collision Resolution Testing</strong> validates that overlapping entities are separated correctly and that the separation process maintains system stability. Resolution tests verify that entities are moved to valid non-overlapping positions, that separation direction follows collision geometry, and that resolution doesn&#39;t introduce new overlaps or invalid positions.</p>\n<p>Resolution testing creates controlled overlap scenarios and verifies that the separation algorithm produces expected outcomes. Tests measure separation distances, validate final positions, and verify that resolved entities maintain correct spatial relationships.</p>\n<p><strong>Tile-based Collision Testing</strong> validates entity interaction with the level geometry. These tests verify that moving entities correctly detect collisions with solid tiles, that collision resolution prevents entities from penetrating tile boundaries, and that one-way platforms allow upward passage while blocking downward movement.</p>\n<p>Tile collision tests construct known level geometries and move entities through predictable paths while measuring collision detection and resolution results. Tests verify that entities stop at tile boundaries, slide along surfaces correctly, and handle internal corners without getting stuck.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tile Collision Test</th>\n<th>Level Geometry</th>\n<th>Entity Movement</th>\n<th>Expected Outcome</th>\n<th>Validation Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Wall Collision</td>\n<td>Vertical wall of solid tiles</td>\n<td>Horizontal movement toward wall</td>\n<td>Entity stops at wall boundary</td>\n<td>Final X position = wall edge minus entity width</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Floor Landing</td>\n<td>Horizontal floor of solid tiles</td>\n<td>Falling entity from above</td>\n<td>Entity stops on floor surface</td>\n<td>Final Y position = floor edge, <code>onGround = true</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slope Navigation</td>\n<td>Diagonal tile arrangement</td>\n<td>Horizontal movement across slope</td>\n<td>Entity follows slope contour</td>\n<td>Y position adjusts to maintain ground contact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>One-way Platform</td>\n<td>Platform tiles with upward-only collision</td>\n<td>Upward vs downward entity movement</td>\n<td>Up passes through, down stops</td>\n<td>Upward movement unblocked, downward movement blocked</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"input-system-testing\">Input System Testing</h3>\n<p>Input system testing validates the responsiveness and accuracy of player control interpretation. Think of input testing like <strong>musical instrument validation</strong> - the system must translate player intentions into game actions with precise timing and reliable consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Input Buffering Testing</strong> verifies that button presses are remembered for the correct duration and consumed appropriately. Tests validate that <code>wasKeyJustPressed</code> returns true within the <code>bufferDuration</code> window, that <code>consumeKeyPress</code> removes buffered inputs correctly, and that buffered inputs expire after their intended lifetime.</p>\n<p>Input buffer tests create controlled timing scenarios where button presses occur at specific intervals relative to input queries. Tests measure buffer state over time and verify that buffered inputs are available for exactly the intended duration.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Buffer Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Button Press Timing</th>\n<th>Query Timing</th>\n<th>Expected Buffer State</th>\n<th>Validation Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Immediate Query</td>\n<td>Press at frame 0</td>\n<td>Query at frame 0</td>\n<td><code>wasKeyJustPressed = true</code></td>\n<td>Buffer contains fresh input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Within Buffer Window</td>\n<td>Press at frame 0</td>\n<td>Query at frame 3 (50ms later)</td>\n<td><code>wasKeyJustPressed = true</code></td>\n<td>Buffer retains input within window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buffer Expiration</td>\n<td>Press at frame 0</td>\n<td>Query at frame 7 (150ms later)</td>\n<td><code>wasKeyJustPressed = false</code></td>\n<td>Buffer has expired input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Consumption</td>\n<td>Press at frame 0, consume at frame 1</td>\n<td>Query at frame 2</td>\n<td><code>wasKeyJustPressed = false</code></td>\n<td>Consumed input no longer available</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Coyote Time Testing</strong> validates that jump inputs are accepted for a brief period after leaving platform edges. Tests verify that the <code>coyoteTimer</code> tracks ground departure accurately, that jump inputs are accepted within the <code>COYOTE_TIME</code> window, and that coyote jumps apply the same physics as regular ground jumps.</p>\n<p>Coyote time tests create scenarios where the player moves off platform edges and attempts to jump at various intervals afterward. Tests measure whether jumps execute successfully and whether the resulting jump physics match ground-based jumps.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump Buffer Testing</strong> validates that jump inputs are remembered when the player is airborne and executed automatically upon landing. Tests verify that jump inputs during airborne states are stored correctly, that stored jumps execute immediately upon ground contact, and that buffered jumps expire after the intended duration.</p>\n<p>Jump buffer tests create airborne scenarios where jump inputs occur at various times before landing, then verify that the jump executes correctly upon ground contact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-interaction-testing\">Entity Interaction Testing</h3>\n<p>Entity interaction testing validates the complex behaviors that emerge when different game objects affect each other. Think of entity testing like <strong>choreography validation</strong> - you need to verify that all the actors move correctly both individually and in relation to each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Player-Enemy Collision Testing</strong> verifies the different outcomes based on collision direction and timing. Tests validate that side collisions damage the player, that stomp collisions defeat enemies, and that invulnerability periods prevent repeated damage.</p>\n<p>Player-enemy tests create controlled collision scenarios with known entity positions and velocities, then verify that the resulting state changes match expected behaviors. Tests measure damage application, invulnerability timer activation, and enemy defeat states.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Collision Type</th>\n<th>Player Position/Velocity</th>\n<th>Enemy Position/Velocity</th>\n<th>Expected Outcome</th>\n<th>State Changes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Side Collision</td>\n<td>Moving horizontally into enemy</td>\n<td>Stationary or moving</td>\n<td>Player takes damage, gains invulnerability</td>\n<td><code>player.health</code> decreases, <code>invulnerabilityTimer</code> &gt; 0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stomp Collision</td>\n<td>Falling downward onto enemy</td>\n<td>Ground-based enemy</td>\n<td>Enemy defeated, player bounces</td>\n<td><code>enemy.defeated = true</code>, player gets upward velocity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invulnerable Contact</td>\n<td>Any collision during invulnerability</td>\n<td>Any enemy state</td>\n<td>No damage taken</td>\n<td><code>player.health</code> unchanged, collision ignored</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Enemy AI Testing</strong> validates patrol behaviors, boundary detection, and player interaction responses. Tests verify that enemies move between waypoints correctly, reverse direction at patrol boundaries, and respond appropriately to player proximity.</p>\n<p>AI testing employs <strong>behavioral scenario validation</strong> by creating known level layouts with defined patrol paths, then measuring enemy movement over time to verify it matches expected patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Entity Scenarios</strong> test complex interactions involving multiple entities simultaneously. These tests verify that collision resolution works correctly when multiple entities overlap, that AI behaviors don&#39;t interfere with each other, and that system performance remains stable with many active entities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-stability-testing\">Performance and Stability Testing</h3>\n<p>Performance testing validates that the platformer engine maintains smooth gameplay under various load conditions and system configurations. Think of performance testing like <strong>stress testing a bridge</strong> - you need to verify that the system performs reliably not just under normal conditions, but when pushed to its operational limits.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame Rate Stability Testing</strong> verifies that the game maintains consistent performance across different hardware capabilities and system loads. Tests measure frame time consistency, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that frame rate drops degrade gracefully without breaking game mechanics.</p>\n<p>Frame rate tests run identical gameplay scenarios while measuring frame timing statistics. Tests verify that 99% of frames complete within target timing thresholds and that performance degradation doesn&#39;t introduce physics instability or input lag.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Test</th>\n<th>Test Conditions</th>\n<th>Measured Metrics</th>\n<th>Target Performance</th>\n<th>Degradation Limits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Entity Count Scaling</td>\n<td>1, 10, 50, 100 active entities</td>\n<td>Average frame time, 99th percentile frame time</td>\n<td>16.67ms average (60fps)</td>\n<td>&lt;33.33ms 99th percentile (30fps minimum)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Complexity</td>\n<td>Dense tile maps with many collision checks</td>\n<td>Collision detection time per frame</td>\n<td>&lt;2ms collision processing</td>\n<td>&lt;5ms collision processing under load</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rendering Load</td>\n<td>Large levels with many visible tiles/sprites</td>\n<td>Rendering time per frame</td>\n<td>&lt;4ms rendering time</td>\n<td>&lt;8ms rendering time under load</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Memory Usage Testing</strong> validates that the engine manages memory efficiently without leaks or excessive allocation. Tests monitor memory consumption over extended play sessions and verify that entity creation and destruction maintain stable memory usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Physics Stability Testing</strong> verifies that edge cases and extreme conditions don&#39;t break physics simulation. Tests create scenarios with high velocities, extreme positions, and unusual entity configurations to verify that the physics engine handles exceptional cases gracefully.</p>\n<p>Physics stability tests employ <strong>boundary condition validation</strong> by creating scenarios at the limits of system parameters and verifying that the engine continues to function correctly or fails gracefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Testing Only Happy Path Scenarios</strong>\nTesting only normal gameplay scenarios misses edge cases that cause production bugs. For example, testing jumping only when the player is clearly on solid ground misses cases where the player is at tile boundaries or on slopes. Edge case testing should include scenarios like jumping while partially off platform edges, landing on tile corners, or attempting actions during state transitions. Create test cases that specifically target boundary conditions and unusual input timing combinations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Frame Rate Variations in Tests</strong>\nWriting tests that assume consistent frame rates produces validation that doesn&#39;t reflect real-world performance variations. For example, testing coyote time mechanics with fixed frame counts instead of elapsed time leads to timing-dependent bugs when frame rates fluctuate. All temporal testing must use delta time calculations and validate behavior across different simulated frame rates to ensure frame-rate independence.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Testing Input Timing Edge Cases</strong>\nPlatformer controls depend heavily on precise input timing, but tests often check only discrete input states rather than timing relationships. For example, testing that jump input works when pressed doesn&#39;t verify that it works when pressed just before landing or just after leaving a platform. Input tests must specifically validate timing windows like jump buffering, coyote time, and input consumption.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Overlooking Floating Point Precision Issues</strong>\nPhysics calculations involve floating point arithmetic that can introduce small precision errors over time. Tests that use exact equality comparisons (<code>position === 100.0</code>) fail when calculations produce results like <code>99.99999</code>. All numerical comparisons in tests must use epsilon tolerance (<code>Math.abs(actual - expected) &lt; COLLISION_EPSILON</code>) to account for floating point precision limitations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Testing Individual Systems in Isolation</strong>\nTesting each game system separately misses integration bugs that occur when systems interact. For example, testing physics and collision systems independently doesn&#39;t catch issues where physics calculations assume collision resolution has completed, but collision resolution modifies entity state that affects subsequent physics calculations. Integration tests must validate complete update cycles with all systems working together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The testing implementation provides

addresses common issues learners encounter with physics simulation, collision detection, and input handling</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of debugging a 2D platformer as <strong>detective work in a physics laboratory</strong>. Unlike static software systems, games are dynamic simulations where timing, precision, and interactions create emergent behaviors. A small error in physics calculations can cascade into game-breaking behavior - a player might fall through the floor, get stuck in walls, or experience jerky movement. This debugging guide provides systematic approaches to identify, diagnose, and fix the most common issues that arise when building a platformer engine.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that platformer bugs often manifest as <strong>temporal accuracy</strong> problems - issues that only appear under specific timing conditions, frame rates, or interaction sequences. A system that works perfectly at 60fps might break catastrophically at 30fps, or a collision that resolves correctly in isolation might fail when multiple systems interact. This guide categorizes debugging by symptom patterns rather than system boundaries, since platformer issues frequently span multiple components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"physics-simulation-issues\">Physics Simulation Issues</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Physics simulation bugs are like <strong>mechanical clock malfunctions</strong> - a tiny error in one gear affects the entire mechanism&#39;s timing and precision. In platformers, physics errors compound over time and create increasingly erratic behavior.</p>\n<p>The most critical physics debugging skill is learning to <strong>separate symptoms from root causes</strong>. When a player clips through a platform, the visible symptom is penetration, but the root cause might be excessive velocity, insufficient collision checks, or incorrect delta time handling. Effective debugging requires understanding the chain of calculations that produce the visible behavior.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Root Cause</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Approach</th>\n<th>Fix Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Player falls through solid platforms</td>\n<td>Delta time too large causing tunneling</td>\n<td>Log <code>deltaTime</code> values and entity velocity</td>\n<td>Implement <code>maxDeltaTime</code> clamping and sub-stepping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movement feels sluggish or stuttery</td>\n<td>Frame rate dependency in physics calculations</td>\n<td>Test at different frame rates (30fps, 144fps)</td>\n<td>Convert all movement to velocity-based with delta time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player accelerates infinitely when holding movement key</td>\n<td>Missing terminal velocity or friction</td>\n<td>Monitor <code>velocityX</code> and <code>velocityY</code> over time</td>\n<td>Add maximum velocity caps and friction coefficients</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gravity feels too weak or strong</td>\n<td>Incorrect gravity scaling with delta time</td>\n<td>Compare gravity acceleration against expected values</td>\n<td>Adjust <code>GRAVITY</code> constant and verify delta time multiplication</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player bounces uncontrollably after collision</td>\n<td>Collision resolution applying multiple corrections</td>\n<td>Log collision resolution steps per frame</td>\n<td>Implement collision resolution ordering and epsilon checks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Delta Time Clamping</strong>\nMany learners forget to clamp <code>deltaTime</code> to a maximum value, causing physics instability when frame rates drop. If a frame takes 100ms (10fps), applying full gravity for that duration creates massive velocity spikes that cause tunneling. Always clamp <code>deltaTime</code> to <code>maxDeltaTime</code> (typically 33.33ms for 30fps minimum) to maintain physics stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Debugging Physics with Trajectory Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>When physics behavior seems erratic, implement trajectory logging to trace entity movement over time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a debug log that records entity position, velocity, and applied forces each frame</li>\n<li>Export the trajectory data and plot it visually to identify patterns</li>\n<li>Look for sudden velocity spikes, position discontinuities, or oscillating behavior</li>\n<li>Cross-reference trajectory anomalies with frame rate drops or input events</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Physics debugging is fundamentally about <strong>temporal accuracy</strong> - ensuring calculations produce consistent results regardless of frame rate. Every physics formula must account for variable delta time, and every force application must be frame-rate independent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"collision-detection-problems\">Collision Detection Problems</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Collision detection issues are like <strong>security checkpoint failures</strong> - they either let unauthorized entities through (false negatives) or stop legitimate passage (false positives). Both types of failures break the game world&#39;s physical laws.</p>\n<p>Collision bugs often manifest as <strong>integration bugs</strong> - errors that only appear when multiple collision checks interact. A single AABB test might work perfectly, but combining player-tile collision with player-enemy collision can create unexpected edge cases where collision responses conflict.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause Analysis</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Resolution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Player gets stuck in corners where tiles meet</td>\n<td>Corner clipping due to simultaneous X and Y collision</td>\n<td>Place debug tiles in corner configurations</td>\n<td>Implement separate X/Y axis collision resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player passes through thin platforms at high speed</td>\n<td>Tunneling between collision check positions</td>\n<td>Test with various velocity values and tile sizes</td>\n<td>Add continuous collision detection or velocity clamping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player bounces off platforms they should land on</td>\n<td>Collision normal calculation errors</td>\n<td>Visualize collision normals and penetration vectors</td>\n<td>Verify AABB collision resolution logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>One-way platforms block player from below</td>\n<td>Incorrect collision direction checking</td>\n<td>Log collision direction and player velocity</td>\n<td>Check vertical velocity direction before blocking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player clips into tiles and vibrates rapidly</td>\n<td>Floating point precision errors in collision resolution</td>\n<td>Monitor entity position values for sub-pixel drift</td>\n<td>Implement <code>COLLISION_EPSILON</code> for minimum separation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Collision Resolution Order</strong>\nResolving X and Y collisions simultaneously can cause corner clipping. When a player hits a corner, both horizontal and vertical collision occur. If you resolve both simultaneously, the player might end up inside the tile geometry. Always resolve X-axis collision first, then Y-axis collision, treating each as a separate step.</p>\n<p><strong>AABB Collision Debugging Workflow</strong></p>\n<p>When collision detection fails, follow this systematic debugging approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Visualize Bounding Boxes</strong>: Draw the actual <code>Rectangle</code> objects used for collision testing to verify they match entity visual representations</li>\n<li><strong>Log Collision Coordinates</strong>: Record the exact world coordinates where collision occurs and the tile grid positions being tested</li>\n<li><strong>Trace Grid Conversion</strong>: Verify <code>worldToGrid</code> and <code>gridToWorld</code> coordinate transformations with known test values</li>\n<li><strong>Test Boundary Conditions</strong>: Specifically test collision at tile boundaries (x = 0, x = TILE_SIZE - 1) where rounding errors occur</li>\n<li><strong>Validate Tile Lookup</strong>: Confirm <code>getTileAt</code> returns correct tile IDs for the collision coordinates</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Debug Pattern</strong>: When collision detection fails, the error is usually in coordinate space conversion. Platformers juggle three coordinate systems: world pixels, tile grid indices, and screen pixels. Bugs often occur at the boundaries between these systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"input-system-malfunctions\">Input System Malfunctions</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Input system problems are like <strong>telephone game distortions</strong> - the player&#39;s intention gets lost or corrupted as it passes through buffering, processing, and state management layers. The result is unresponsive or incorrectly interpreted controls.</p>\n<p>Input debugging requires understanding the distinction between <strong>intent-based actions</strong> (jumping, which should be buffered and consumed) and <strong>state-based actions</strong> (movement, which should be checked continuously). Mixing these patterns creates confusing control behavior where actions either don&#39;t register or register multiple times.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Input Symptom</th>\n<th>System Analysis</th>\n<th>Diagnostic Steps</th>\n<th>Correction</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Jump doesn&#39;t register despite key press</td>\n<td>Input buffer overflow or timing window too small</td>\n<td>Log <code>keyBuffer</code> contents and timing</td>\n<td>Increase <code>bufferDuration</code> or check buffer consumption logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Double jumping occurs when player doesn&#39;t intend it</td>\n<td>Key press registered multiple times or consumed incorrectly</td>\n<td>Monitor <code>jumpBuffer</code> and <code>onGround</code> state changes</td>\n<td>Ensure <code>consumeKeyPress</code> properly removes buffered input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Movement stutters or stops randomly</td>\n<td>Key state desynchronization between hardware and software</td>\n<td>Compare <code>isKeyPressed</code> results with actual key state</td>\n<td>Implement <code>reconcileInputState</code> to sync input manager</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Coyote time doesn&#39;t work consistently</td>\n<td>Timer reset conditions or timing precision issues</td>\n<td>Log <code>coyoteTimer</code> values and ground state transitions</td>\n<td>Verify timer updates only when appropriate state changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input lag or delayed response</td>\n<td>Processing input at wrong point in game loop</td>\n<td>Trace input processing order relative to physics update</td>\n<td>Move input processing to beginning of game loop</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Input Buffering vs State Checking</strong>\nMany learners incorrectly buffer movement input, causing movement to &quot;stick&quot; after releasing keys. Movement should use <code>isKeyPressed</code> for continuous state checking, while actions like jumping should use <code>wasKeyJustPressed</code> with buffering. Never buffer continuous actions - only discrete events.</p>\n<p><strong>Input System Debugging Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>When controls feel unresponsive or erratic:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Instrument Key Events</strong>: Log every key press/release with timestamps to verify hardware input registration</li>\n<li><strong>Trace Buffer State</strong>: Monitor input buffer contents each frame to identify timing window issues</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Consumption Logic</strong>: Ensure buffered inputs are properly consumed and not processed multiple times</li>\n<li><strong>Test Frame Rate Independence</strong>: Verify input responsiveness remains consistent at different frame rates</li>\n<li><strong>Validate State Transitions</strong>: Check that player state changes correctly trigger input behavior changes</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"entity-interaction-edge-cases\">Entity Interaction Edge Cases</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Entity interactions are like <strong>diplomatic negotiations</strong> - multiple parties with different priorities and capabilities must reach agreements about shared space and resources. When the negotiation rules are unclear or contradictory, conflicts arise.</p>\n<p>Entity interaction bugs typically manifest as <strong>cascade effects</strong> where a small error in one interaction triggers increasingly severe problems. A player-enemy collision that resolves incorrectly might push the enemy into a wall, causing wall collision issues, which might trigger emergency separation logic that teleports the enemy to an invalid location.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Interaction Problem</th>\n<th>Underlying Issue</th>\n<th>Debug Investigation</th>\n<th>Fix Implementation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Player dies when landing on enemy from above (should stomp)</td>\n<td>Collision direction detection failure</td>\n<td>Log contact normal vectors and relative velocities</td>\n<td>Improve stomp detection window and velocity thresholds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enemy gets stuck at patrol boundaries</td>\n<td>Boundary detection or direction reversal logic error</td>\n<td>Monitor <code>patrolStartX</code>, <code>patrolEndX</code>, and <code>movingRight</code> state</td>\n<td>Add epsilon tolerance for boundary detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Player passes through enemy without interaction</td>\n<td>Collision detection disabled or entity positioning error</td>\n<td>Verify entity <code>getBoundingBox</code> returns correct coordinates</td>\n<td>Validate bounding box calculations and update order</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invulnerability frames don&#39;t prevent damage</td>\n<td>Timer management or collision check ordering</td>\n<td>Track <code>invulnerabilityTimer</code> and damage application timing</td>\n<td>Ensure damage checks occur after timer validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enemy AI behaves erratically after player collision</td>\n<td>State corruption during collision resolution</td>\n<td>Monitor enemy state variables before and after collision</td>\n<td>Implement state validation and recovery mechanisms</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stomp Detection Timing</strong>\nStomp detection often fails because developers check collision direction at the wrong moment. The collision direction when entities first overlap might differ from the direction when collision is processed. Always calculate stomp based on relative velocity at the moment of contact, not the penetration direction during resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Entity State Validation Framework</strong></p>\n<p>When entity interactions produce unexpected results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Record Pre-Collision State</strong>: Capture position, velocity, and state variables for all entities before collision processing</li>\n<li><strong>Trace Interaction Sequence</strong>: Log the exact order of collision detection, response calculation, and state updates</li>\n<li><strong>Validate Post-Collision State</strong>: Verify all entities remain in valid states after interaction processing</li>\n<li><strong>Test Boundary Interactions</strong>: Specifically test entity interactions at level boundaries and platform edges</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor State Transitions</strong>: Ensure entity state machines transition correctly during and after interactions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-frame-rate-issues\">Performance and Frame Rate Issues</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Performance problems in platformers are like <strong>traffic congestion</strong> - small inefficiencies compound to create system-wide slowdowns. Unlike batch processing systems, games must maintain consistent frame timing, so even brief performance spikes cause visible stuttering.</p>\n<p>Frame rate debugging requires understanding the <strong>spiral of death</strong> phenomenon - when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, delta time increases, which often makes subsequent frames take even longer, creating a downward spiral that crashes the game.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Performance Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Performance Issue</th>\n<th>Measurement Approach</th>\n<th>Optimization Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Stuttering every few seconds</td>\n<td>Garbage collection or memory allocation spikes</td>\n<td>Profile memory allocation patterns</td>\n<td>Implement object pooling for frequently created entities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame rate drops in complex areas</td>\n<td>Too many collision checks or rendering calls</td>\n<td>Count collision tests and draw calls per frame</td>\n<td>Add spatial indexing and viewport culling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spiral of death during frame drops</td>\n<td>Physics simulation time exceeds frame budget</td>\n<td>Monitor frame processing time vs target duration</td>\n<td>Implement sub-stepping and calculation time budgets</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input becomes unresponsive during lag</td>\n<td>Input processing blocked by expensive operations</td>\n<td>Profile game loop phase timing</td>\n<td>Move expensive operations to separate threads or spread across frames</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory usage grows continuously</td>\n<td>Entity cleanup or resource disposal failure</td>\n<td>Track entity count and texture memory over time</td>\n<td>Implement proper cleanup in entity removal and level transitions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Frame Rate Dependency</strong>\nMany performance optimizations inadvertently introduce frame rate dependency. For example, reducing physics update frequency to improve performance can make gameplay feel different at various frame rates. Always verify that optimizations maintain frame-rate independent behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance Monitoring Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Effective performance debugging requires continuous monitoring:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frame Time Tracking</strong>: Record the time spent in each game loop phase (input, physics, rendering) to identify bottlenecks</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Allocation Monitoring</strong>: Track object creation and destruction to identify memory leaks or excessive allocations</li>\n<li><strong>Collision Check Counting</strong>: Monitor the number of collision tests per frame to identify inefficient spatial queries</li>\n<li><strong>Delta Time Analysis</strong>: Watch for excessive delta time values that indicate frame rate instability</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Usage Tracking</strong>: Monitor texture memory, entity counts, and other resource usage over gameplay sessions</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"error-recovery-and-graceful-degradation\">Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Error recovery in platformers is like <strong>emergency medical response</strong> - when critical systems fail, you need immediate stabilization to prevent complete system failure, followed by gradual restoration of normal function.</p>\n<p>Platformer error recovery focuses on <strong>graceful degradation</strong> - maintaining core gameplay functionality while sacrificing secondary features. If collision detection fails, emergency separation prevents entities from remaining stuck inside walls. If physics becomes unstable, fallback to simpler movement calculations maintains basic playability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Emergency Response</th>\n<th>Immediate Stabilization</th>\n<th>Long-term Recovery</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Entity Stuck in Geometry</td>\n<td><code>emergencyEntitySeparation</code> to move entity to valid position</td>\n<td>Disable movement until position validated</td>\n<td>Reset entity to last known good position or checkpoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Physics Instability</td>\n<td>Clamp velocity to safe maximum values</td>\n<td>Reduce physics complexity temporarily</td>\n<td>Identify and fix source of instability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input System Failure</td>\n<td>Switch to simplified direct key polling</td>\n<td>Buffer critical actions only</td>\n<td>Reinitialize input system and restore full functionality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision System Corruption</td>\n<td>Use simplified bounding box collision only</td>\n<td>Disable complex collision features</td>\n<td>Rebuild collision state from level data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Emergency garbage collection and resource cleanup</td>\n<td>Reduce entity count and disable non-essential effects</td>\n<td>Implement better resource management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Automated Error Recovery Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>Implement systematic error detection and recovery:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Boundary Condition Monitoring</strong>: Continuously check that entities remain within valid world boundaries</li>\n<li><strong>State Validation</strong>: Verify critical game state remains consistent (player health ≥ 0, position within level bounds)</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Threshold Monitoring</strong>: Detect when frame times exceed critical thresholds and trigger simplification</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Usage Limits</strong>: Automatically trigger cleanup when memory or entity counts approach limits</li>\n<li><strong>Fallback System Activation</strong>: Provide simplified versions of critical systems that can replace failed components</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: Error recovery should be <strong>invisible to players when possible</strong>.

Many platformer bugs are timing-dependent or emerge from complex interactions, making them difficult to reproduce reliably. Developing techniques for consistent reproduction is essential for systematic diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Reproduction Strategy Framework</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Bug Category</th>\n<th>Reproduction Approach</th>\n<th>Controlled Variables</th>\n<th>Success Metrics</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Physics Anomalies</td>\n<td>Create test levels with specific geometry configurations</td>\n<td>Frame rate, input timing, entity starting positions</td>\n<td>Bug occurs consistently with same inputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collision Failures</td>\n<td>Design minimal test cases isolating specific collision scenarios</td>\n<td>Entity velocities, collision geometries, approach angles</td>\n<td>Collision behavior is predictable and repeatable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Issues</td>\n<td>Script automated input sequences with precise timing</td>\n<td>Key press duration, release timing, frame boundaries</td>\n<td>Input response matches expected behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Problems</td>\n<td>Create stress test scenarios with known entity counts</td>\n<td>Entity count, level complexity, active systems</td>\n<td>Performance metrics remain within acceptable bounds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integration Bugs</td>\n<td>Test system combinations in isolation before integration</td>\n<td>Active systems, interaction types, update order</td>\n<td>Each system works correctly alone and together</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Debugging Tool Implementation</strong></p>\n<p>Effective platformer debugging requires specialized tools built into the game:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Visual Debug Overlays</strong>: Display bounding boxes, velocity vectors, and collision normals directly on the game screen</li>\n<li><strong>Frame-by-Frame Stepping</strong>: Allow pausing and single-step execution to examine exact frame-by-frame behavior</li>\n<li><strong>State Inspector</strong>: Show real-time values of critical variables (position, velocity, timers, state machine states)</li>\n<li><strong>Event Logging</strong>: Record sequences of input events, collision events, and state changes for later analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Profiler</strong>: Display real-time frame timing, collision check counts, and memory usage</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Debugging Insight</strong>: The most valuable debugging information is <strong>temporal context</strong> - understanding not just what state the system is in, but how it reached that state. Always log the sequence of events leading up to a problem, not just the problem state itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing-and-system-interactions\">Integration Testing and System Interactions</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Integration testing for platformers is like <strong>orchestra rehearsal</strong> - each instrument (system) might sound perfect in isolation, but creating harmony requires careful coordination of timing, dynamics, and interaction patterns.</p>\n<p>Integration bugs in platformers often manifest as <strong>emergent behaviors</strong> - complex patterns that arise from simple system interactions but weren&#39;t explicitly programmed.

extend the basic platformer engine into a more sophisticated game development framework</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the current platformer engine as a <strong>solid foundation</strong> - like a well-built house with strong bones, working plumbing, and reliable electrical systems. The core systems (physics, collision, input, rendering) provide everything needed for a functional 2D platformer, but there&#39;s tremendous potential to transform this foundation into something much more powerful and expressive.</p>\n<p>Future extensions fall into several categories: <strong>advanced physics simulation</strong> that adds richness to player movement and environmental interaction, <strong>visual effects systems</strong> that enhance player feedback and game juice, <strong>content creation tools</strong> that enable rapid level design and iteration, <strong>performance optimizations</strong> that allow for larger and more complex game worlds, and <strong>gameplay mechanics</strong> that expand the types of experiences possible within the platformer framework.</p>\n<p>The key insight when considering extensions is <strong>architectural compatibility</strong> - each enhancement should build upon the existing systems without requiring fundamental rewrites. This modular approach allows developers to add complexity incrementally, testing and refining each new capability before moving to the next enhancement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle: Progressive Enhancement</strong>\nEach extension should be additive rather than transformative. The core engine should remain fully functional even if advanced features are disabled or removed. This ensures that learners can implement extensions in any order and always maintain a working game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-physics-simulation\">Advanced Physics Simulation</h3>\n<p>The current physics engine provides solid velocity-based movement with gravity and collision resolution, but real-world platformers often employ more sophisticated physics simulation to create richer gameplay experiences. Advanced physics extensions can be categorized into <strong>enhanced movement mechanics</strong>, <strong>environmental physics</strong>, and <strong>particle-based simulation</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Movement Mechanics</strong> extend the basic player physics with additional movement options and constraints. Wall sliding allows players to slide down vertical surfaces at reduced speed, creating new traversal possibilities and adding strategic depth to level design. Wall jumping enables players to leap between parallel surfaces, requiring precise timing and creating exciting vertical challenges. Dashing provides burst movement in any direction, often with temporary invulnerability or collision changes.</p>\n<p>The wall sliding mechanic requires detecting when the player is pressed against a vertical surface while falling. The physics system must distinguish between normal collision resolution (stopping horizontal movement) and wall sliding conditions (allowing controlled downward movement). This involves checking for sustained input toward the wall combined with downward velocity and contact with a vertical surface.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Wall Sliding State</th>\n<th>Input Conditions</th>\n<th>Physics Behavior</th>\n<th>Duration Limits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Not Sliding</td>\n<td>No wall contact or no input toward wall</td>\n<td>Normal falling physics</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initial Contact</td>\n<td>Input toward wall + wall collision + falling</td>\n<td>Transition to sliding physics</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sliding Active</td>\n<td>Sustained input toward wall + wall contact</td>\n<td>Reduced falling speed (300px/s vs 600px/s)</td>\n<td>No time limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sliding Exit</td>\n<td>Input released or wall contact lost</td>\n<td>Return to normal physics</td>\n<td>Immediate transition</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Environmental Physics</strong> introduces interactive elements that respond to physics simulation. Moving platforms require careful coordination between platform movement and player movement to prevent issues like the player sliding off due to friction simulation. One-way platforms already exist in the basic collision system, but enhanced versions might include platforms that activate/deactivate based on player actions or timer conditions.</p>\n<p>Wind zones modify player movement by applying additional acceleration in specific directions. This creates areas where normal movement rules change, requiring players to adapt their strategies. The implementation involves defining rectangular regions with associated force vectors that apply additional acceleration to entities within their boundaries.</p>\n<p>Springs and bounce pads provide high-velocity launch mechanics, often overriding normal velocity constraints like terminal velocity. These elements require special collision handling that sets specific velocity values rather than just resolving penetration.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Environmental Element</th>\n<th>Trigger Condition</th>\n<th>Physics Effect</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Moving Platform</td>\n<td>Player standing on platform</td>\n<td>Add platform velocity to player</td>\n<td>Medium - requires velocity transfer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wind Zone</td>\n<td>Player within defined rectangle</td>\n<td>Apply constant acceleration</td>\n<td>Low - simple force application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spring/Bounce Pad</td>\n<td>Player collision from above</td>\n<td>Set upward velocity to fixed value</td>\n<td>Low - velocity override on collision</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conveyor Belt</td>\n<td>Player ground contact</td>\n<td>Apply horizontal acceleration</td>\n<td>Medium - requires surface friction modification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Particle-Based Simulation</strong> adds visual richness and can provide gameplay mechanics. Dust particles when landing or wall sliding provide player feedback about surface interaction. Debris from destroyed blocks adds satisfying destruction effects. Water or lava simulation using particle systems can create hazardous areas with realistic fluid behavior.</p>\n<p>The particle system requires its own update and rendering pipeline, separate from the main entity system. Particles typically have simplified physics (position, velocity, lifetime) and are managed in large batches for performance reasons. The key architectural decision is whether particles interact with the collision system (expensive but realistic) or remain purely visual (efficient but limited).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Particle Interaction Model</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Particles could be purely visual effects or interactive physics objects</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Visual-only particles with no collision</li>\n<li>Full physics particles with collision detection</li>\n<li>Hybrid system with optional physics interaction</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid system with physics interaction flag per particle type</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Allows visual-only particles for performance while enabling gameplay-relevant particles when needed</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex particle system but maximum flexibility for different use cases</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"visual-effects-and-animation-enhancements\">Visual Effects and Animation Enhancements</h3>\n<p>The current rendering system provides basic sprite animation and camera management, but modern 2D platformers rely heavily on <strong>visual effects</strong> to communicate game state, provide player feedback, and create engaging presentation. Visual enhancements fall into <strong>advanced animation systems</strong>, <strong>particle effects</strong>, <strong>lighting and shaders</strong>, and <strong>screen effects</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Animation Systems</strong> extend beyond simple flip-book animation to include procedural animation, blend trees, and state-driven animation. Procedural animation allows for dynamic responses to game state - for example, the player&#39;s idle animation might change based on health level, or walking animation speed might scale with actual movement velocity.</p>\n<p>Animation blend trees enable smooth transitions between different animation states. Instead of jarring cuts between running and idle animations, blend trees can interpolate between keyframes to create fluid motion. This requires storing multiple animation states simultaneously and calculating weighted averages of sprite positions or frame indices.</p>\n<p>State-driven animation connects the animation system directly to entity state machines. The player&#39;s animation controller monitors the player&#39;s physics state (grounded, falling, jumping) and input state (moving left, moving right, idle) to automatically select appropriate animations. This eliminates the need for manual animation triggering throughout the gameplay code.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Animation Enhancement</th>\n<th>Input Requirements</th>\n<th>Output Behavior</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Procedural Idle</td>\n<td>Health value, time elapsed</td>\n<td>Varying idle animation based on condition</td>\n<td>Low - simple parameter modification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Velocity-Scaled Walking</td>\n<td>Current movement speed</td>\n<td>Walking animation rate matches movement</td>\n<td>Low - frame timing adjustment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Animation Blending</td>\n<td>Two animation states + blend weight</td>\n<td>Interpolated frames between animations</td>\n<td>Medium - requires frame interpolation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State-Driven Control</td>\n<td>Entity state machine + input state</td>\n<td>Automatic animation selection</td>\n<td>Low - simple state mapping</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Particle Effects</strong> enhance visual feedback for player actions, environmental interactions, and special effects. Jump dust clouds provide satisfying feedback when the player lands after a jump. Wall slide sparks communicate surface interaction. Collect sparkles make item pickup feel rewarding. Death explosions provide dramatic feedback for enemy defeats.</p>\n<p>The particle effects system extends the basic particle simulation with <strong>effect templates</strong> that define common particle behaviors. A jump dust effect template might specify 5-8 particles with initial upward and outward velocities, brown/gray colors, short lifetimes (0.3-0.5 seconds), and gradual size reduction over time.</p>\n<p>Effect triggering integrates with the existing game systems through event-based communication. When the physics system detects a landing collision, it can emit a &quot;player landed&quot; event that the particle system receives and responds to by spawning the appropriate dust effect at the landing location.</p>\n<p><strong>Lighting and Shaders</strong> add atmospheric depth and can provide gameplay mechanics. Simple lighting simulation using color overlays can create day/night cycles or underground/surface distinctions. Dynamic lighting around torches or player-carried light sources creates exploration mechanics where visibility affects gameplay.</p>\n<p>In a 2D context, lighting is typically implemented through <strong>multiplicative color overlays</strong> rather than full 3D lighting calculations. The base level is rendered normally, then lighting information is applied as color multipliers. Dark areas use darker multipliers (0.3, 0.3, 0.3) while lit areas remain normal (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).</p>\n<p>Shader effects can add visual polish without requiring complex 3D graphics knowledge. Simple fragment shaders can create water wave distortion, screen-space lighting effects, or damage flash effects. Modern web browsers support WebGL shaders, making these effects accessible even in JavaScript implementations.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen Effects</strong> provide game state communication and dramatic moments. Screen shake during explosions or heavy landings adds impact feedback. Color grading or desaturation during low health creates tension. Slow-motion effects during precise timing moments enhance difficulty and drama.</p>\n<p>Screen shake implementation involves temporarily offsetting the camera position by small random amounts. The shake intensity decreases over time, creating a natural falloff. The key is ensuring the shake feels responsive to player actions rather than random or distracting.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Screen Effect</th>\n<th>Trigger Event</th>\n<th>Visual Behavior</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Impact Shake</td>\n<td>Enemy stomp, explosion collision</td>\n<td>Random camera offset, decreasing intensity</td>\n<td>0.3-0.5 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Damage Flash</td>\n<td>Player takes damage</td>\n<td>Red color overlay, fade out</td>\n<td>0.1 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slow Motion</td>\n<td>Entering bullet-time or precision mode</td>\n<td>Reduced game speed, audio pitch down</td>\n<td>Until player input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Death Desaturation</td>\n<td>Player health reaches zero</td>\n<td>Gradual color desaturation</td>\n<td>1-2 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"level-editor-and-content-creation-tools\">Level Editor and Content Creation Tools</h3>\n<p>The current level system loads static tile data from files, but game development benefits enormously from <strong>real-time level editing tools</strong> that enable rapid iteration and testing. Level editor functionality can be integrated directly into the game engine or provided as separate tooling, with trade-offs between convenience and complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>In-Game Level Editing</strong> allows developers to modify levels while the game is running, immediately testing changes without reloading or recompiling. This approach provides instant feedback but requires careful separation between editor functionality and gameplay systems. The editor mode might pause normal game physics while allowing camera movement and tile placement.</p>\n<p>In-game editing requires extending the input system to handle editor-specific controls. Mouse input for tile placement, keyboard shortcuts for different tile types, and modifier keys for copy/paste or selection operations. The challenge is ensuring editor controls don&#39;t interfere with normal gameplay input when editor mode is disabled.</p>\n<p>The tile placement system needs <strong>grid snapping</strong> to align placed tiles with the existing tilemap structure. This involves converting mouse coordinates to tile grid coordinates using the same <code>worldToGrid</code> conversion used by the collision system. Visual feedback showing the currently selected tile position helps users understand where tiles will be placed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Editor Operation</th>\n<th>Input Method</th>\n<th>System Requirements</th>\n<th>Data Changes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Tile Placement</td>\n<td>Mouse click on grid position</td>\n<td>Coordinate conversion, collision update</td>\n<td>Modify tiles array at grid coordinates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tile Deletion</td>\n<td>Right-click or delete key</td>\n<td>Selection detection, validation</td>\n<td>Set tile to empty (ID 0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tile Selection</td>\n<td>Mouse drag or shift-click</td>\n<td>Rectangle selection logic</td>\n<td>Maintain selection state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copy/Paste</td>\n<td>Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V with selection</td>\n<td>Clipboard storage, position offset</td>\n<td>Duplicate tile patterns</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Asset Management</strong> becomes crucial as level complexity increases. The editor needs systems for organizing tile sets, managing sprite atlases, and handling level-specific assets like background images or special effect definitions. This often involves file system integration for loading and saving asset files.</p>\n<p>Level validation ensures that created levels are playable and don&#39;t contain impossible situations. Basic validation might check that the player start position is on solid ground, that all areas are reachable, and that checkpoint positions are valid. Advanced validation could simulate player movement to verify that all intended paths are actually traversable.</p>\n<p><strong>External Level Editor</strong> provides more sophisticated editing capabilities at the cost of requiring separate tooling. External editors can offer features like multi-layer editing, advanced selection tools, scripting support, and asset management interfaces that would be complex to implement within the game engine itself.</p>\n<p>The external editor approach requires defining a <strong>level format specification</strong> that both the editor and game engine understand. This format needs to handle not just tile data but also entity placement, checkpoint locations, special zones (like wind areas), and metadata like level name and completion requirements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Level Editor Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need efficient level creation and iteration workflow for content development</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>In-game editor with runtime modification capabilities</li>\n<li>External standalone editor with import/export workflow</li>\n<li>Web-based editor with real-time preview integration</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: In-game editor with file export capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides immediate testing feedback while maintaining simple deployment and dependency management</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Some advanced editing features may be limited, but rapid iteration workflow is optimized</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"performance-optimization-extensions\">Performance Optimization Extensions</h3>\n<p>The current engine architecture prioritizes clarity and learning over maximum performance, but real games often require optimization to handle larger levels, more entities, or target lower-end hardware. Performance extensions focus on <strong>spatial optimization</strong>, <strong>rendering efficiency</strong>, <strong>memory management</strong>, and <strong>computational optimization</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Spatial Optimization</strong> addresses the fact that collision detection currently checks every entity against every tile, which scales poorly as level size increases. Spatial indexing techniques like <strong>quad-trees</strong> or <strong>spatial hash grids</strong> can dramatically reduce collision detection overhead by organizing entities and tiles into spatial regions.</p>\n<p>A spatial hash grid divides the game world into fixed-size cells (typically larger than individual tiles) and maintains lists of entities within each cell. When checking collisions for an entity, the system only needs to test against other entities in the same cell and adjacent cells. This reduces collision checks from O(n²) to approximately O(n) for well-distributed entities.</p>\n<p>The quad-tree approach recursively subdivides space into four quadrants, with each node containing entities that fit within its bounds. Entities that span multiple regions are stored in parent nodes. This approach adapts better to uneven entity distribution but requires more complex insertion and removal logic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Spatial Structure</th>\n<th>Memory Overhead</th>\n<th>Query Performance</th>\n<th>Update Performance</th>\n<th>Best Use Case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Brute Force</td>\n<td>Minimal</td>\n<td>O(n²)</td>\n<td>O(1)</td>\n<td>Small entity counts (&lt;50)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hash Grid</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>O(1) average</td>\n<td>O(1)</td>\n<td>Evenly distributed entities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quad-tree</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>O(log n)</td>\n<td>O(log n)</td>\n<td>Clustered or sparse entities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>R-tree</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>O(log n)</td>\n<td>O(log n)</td>\n<td>Large, irregular shaped entities</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Rendering Efficiency</strong> optimizations focus on reducing draw calls and GPU state changes. The current sprite rendering system draws each entity individually, but <strong>sprite batching</strong> can group multiple sprites using the same texture atlas into single draw calls.</p>\n<p>Sprite batching requires collecting all sprites that share the same texture, sorting them by depth or rendering order, then submitting them as a single batch of vertices to the graphics system. This is particularly effective for tile rendering, where hundreds of tiles might use the same texture atlas.</p>\n<p>Viewport culling becomes essential for large levels. Instead of rendering every tile and entity in the level, the rendering system should calculate which elements are actually visible within the camera bounds and skip rendering for off-screen elements. The camera&#39;s <code>getVisibleTiles</code> method provides the foundation for this optimization.</p>\n<p>Level-of-detail (LOD) systems can render distant or less important elements with reduced quality. For example, background tiles might use smaller textures when viewed from far away, or complex animations might run at reduced frame rates when entities are far from the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory Management</strong> optimizations address garbage collection pressure and memory usage patterns. The current entity system creates and destroys objects frequently, which can cause garbage collection stutters that interrupt smooth gameplay.</p>\n<p>Object pooling maintains pre-allocated pools of commonly used objects (entities, particles, collision results) and reuses them instead of creating new instances. When an enemy is defeated, instead of destroying the enemy object, it&#39;s returned to a pool for reuse when spawning new enemies.</p>\n<p>Asset streaming allows loading and unloading level sections dynamically as the player moves through the world. This enables much larger game worlds without requiring all assets to be loaded simultaneously. The challenge is predicting which assets will be needed soon and preloading them before they&#39;re required.</p>\n<p><strong>Computational Optimization</strong> focuses on algorithm efficiency and reducing unnecessary calculations. The physics update loop currently processes every entity every frame, but many optimizations are possible.</p>\n<p>Sleeping entities that haven&#39;t moved recently can skip physics updates until something interacts with them. This is particularly effective for enemies that spend most of their time in idle patrol loops or environmental elements that only activate when the player approaches.</p>\n<p>Temporal optimization spreads expensive calculations across multiple frames. Instead of updating all enemy AI every frame, the system might update one-third of enemies each frame, ensuring each enemy gets updated every three frames but reducing per-frame computational load.</p>\n<p>Fixed-point arithmetic can improve performance and ensure deterministic behavior across different hardware. Instead of floating-point coordinates, the system uses integer coordinates with an implicit decimal scale (e.g., 1000 units = 1 pixel). This eliminates floating-point precision issues and can be faster on some hardware.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-gameplay-mechanics\">Advanced Gameplay Mechanics</h3>\n<p>The core platformer engine supports basic movement, jumping, and enemy interaction, but many successful platformers incorporate additional mechanics that create unique gameplay experiences. Advanced mechanics fall into <strong>power-up systems</strong>, <strong>collectibles and progression</strong>, <strong>interactive objects</strong>, and <strong>special movement abilities</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Power-Up Systems</strong> temporarily or permanently modify player capabilities. Temporary power-ups might increase jump height, provide invulnerability, or enable special abilities like double-jumping or wall-running. Permanent upgrades unlock new areas by providing abilities like higher jumps or breaking specific block types.</p>\n<p>Power-up implementation requires extending the player entity with an <strong>ability state system</strong> that tracks active power-ups, their remaining durations, and their effects on player physics. This involves modifying physics calculations based on active power-ups and providing visual feedback about power-up status.</p>\n<p>The double-jump power-up serves as a good example. It requires tracking whether the player has used their ground jump, their air jump, or both. The jump input handling must check both ground state and available air jumps. Power-up collection sets a flag enabling double-jump capability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Power-Up Type</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Physics Modification</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Speed Boost</td>\n<td>10 seconds</td>\n<td>Increase horizontal acceleration by 50%</td>\n<td>Low - modify movement constants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High Jump</td>\n<td>15 seconds</td>\n<td>Increase jump velocity from 400 to 600</td>\n<td>Low - modify jump constants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Double Jump</td>\n<td>Permanent</td>\n<td>Allow second jump while airborne</td>\n<td>Medium - track jump state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wall Run</td>\n<td>Permanent</td>\n<td>Enable wall sliding and wall jumping</td>\n<td>High - new physics behaviors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Collectibles and Progression</strong> provide goals beyond level completion and can gate access to new areas or abilities. Basic collectibles like coins or gems might unlock bonus levels or provide extra lives. Key items enable progression by unlocking doors or providing necessary abilities.</p>\n<p>Collectible tracking requires persistent storage across level transitions and game sessions. The save system must track which collectibles have been obtained in each level and maintain counters for cumulative collectibles like coins.</p>\n<p>Achievement systems can provide additional goals and replay incentive. Achievements might require collecting all items in a level, completing levels within time limits, or demonstrating mastery of specific mechanics. The achievement system needs to monitor game events and trigger unlock conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Interactive Objects</strong> expand environmental possibilities beyond static platforms. Switches might open doors, activate moving platforms, or disable hazards. Pushable blocks create puzzle elements where players must arrange objects to access new areas. Destructible terrain adds action elements and can hide secret areas.</p>\n<p>Switch systems require <strong>state management</strong> that persists within a level session. When a switch is activated, it must communicate with its connected objects to trigger appropriate changes. This can be implemented through event systems or direct object references depending on complexity needs.</p>\n<p>Pushable blocks require physics integration where player movement can impart velocity to specific objects. This involves modifying collision resolution to transfer velocity rather than just preventing penetration. The blocks need their own collision detection against level geometry and other entities.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Movement Abilities</strong> dramatically expand player capabilities and enable new level design possibilities. Ledge grabbing allows players to hang from platform edges and climb up, requiring detection of specific collision conditions and new input handling for climbing actions.</p>\n<p>Dash abilities provide burst movement in any direction, often with limited uses that recharge over time or when touching ground. Dash implementation requires temporarily overriding normal physics constraints and providing invulnerability or modified collision behavior during the dash.</p>\n<p>Grappling hooks or swinging mechanics introduce complex physics simulation involving rope constraints and pendulum motion. These systems require understanding of constraint-based physics and careful tuning to feel responsive rather than realistic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight: Mechanical Complexity</strong>\nEach additional gameplay mechanic multiplies the complexity of level design and testing. A platformer with run, jump, wall-slide, dash, and grapple abilities has hundreds of possible movement combinations that level designers must consider. Start with one additional mechanic and fully explore its possibilities before adding more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"content-creation-pipeline-extensions\">Content Creation Pipeline Extensions</h3>\n<p>As the platformer grows in scope and sophistication, the <strong>content creation pipeline</strong> becomes increasingly important. Extensions in this area focus on <strong>automated testing</strong>, <strong>content validation</strong>, <strong>asset pipeline optimization</strong>, and <strong>collaboration tools</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated Testing</strong> for gameplay mechanics ensures that changes to physics or collision systems don&#39;t break existing content. Automated tests can simulate player input sequences and verify expected outcomes - for example, ensuring that a specific jump sequence successfully traverses a challenging level section.</p>\n<p>Physics regression testing captures current behavior as reference and detects unintended changes. When modifying gravity constants or collision resolution, automated tests verify that existing levels remain completable and that player movement still feels correct.</p>\n<p>Performance regression testing monitors frame rates and memory usage to detect optimization regressions. As new features are added, automated performance tests ensure that frame rates remain stable and memory usage doesn&#39;t grow excessively.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Validation</strong> tools help detect common level design problems before they reach players. Accessibility validation might check that levels don&#39;t require precise timing that excludes players with motor difficulties. Difficulty curve validation could analyze the spacing and intensity of challenges to ensure appropriate progression.</p>\n<p>Playtesting automation can simulate different player skill levels by varying input timing precision and decision-making speed. This helps identify level sections that are too difficult for novice players or too trivial for experienced players.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The future extensions described above represent a roadmap for growing the basic platformer engine into a sophisticated game development framework.

core engine code create maintenance nightmares and prevent modular development. Each extension should interact with core systems through well-defined interfaces and event systems rather than modifying engine internals.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Performance Extension Premature Optimization</strong>\nImplementing spatial optimization or advanced rendering techniques before they&#39;re actually needed wastes development time and adds complexity without benefit. Profile actual performance bottlenecks before adding optimization extensions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Feature Creep in Extensions</strong>\nExtensions can easily grow beyond their intended scope, particularly level editors which can become complex applications in their own right. Define clear boundaries for each extension and resist the temptation to add &quot;just one more feature.&quot;</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Extension Dependency Chains</strong>\nWhen extensions depend on other extensions, the system becomes fragile and difficult to maintain. Design extensions to be as independent as possible, with clear documentation of any dependencies.</p>\n<p>The future extensions outlined in this section transform the basic platformer engine into a comprehensive game development framework. However, the most successful approach is <strong>incremental enhancement</strong> - implementing one extension completely before moving to the next, ensuring each addition truly improves the development experience before adding complexity.</p>\n<p>Each extension should be evaluated not just on its technical merit, but on how it serves the broader goal of creating engaging platformer experiences. The best extensions are those that either significantly improve the player experience or dramatically reduce the effort required to create compelling content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones - provides essential terminology definitions used throughout the entire platformer engine implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Understanding 2D platformer development requires mastering a specialized vocabulary that bridges game design, physics simulation, and software engineering. This glossary serves as a <strong>technical dictionary</strong> for the domain-specific language used throughout the platformer engine design. Think of it as learning the professional vocabulary of a new field - each term represents a precise concept that prevents miscommunication and ensures consistent understanding across all system components.</p>\n<p>The terminology in this glossary falls into several categories: game physics concepts that differ from real-world physics, input handling patterns specific to responsive game controls, collision detection algorithms optimized for tile-based environments, rendering techniques for 2D graphics, and performance optimization strategies for real-time systems. Mastering these terms enables clear communication about complex technical concepts and facilitates deeper understanding of the underlying systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-game-development-terminology\">Core Game Development Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Delta time</strong> represents the elapsed time since the last frame update, measured in seconds as a floating-point value. This fundamental concept enables frame-rate independence by scaling all time-based calculations by the actual time elapsed rather than assuming a fixed frame duration. Delta time prevents the spiral of death where slow frames cause larger time steps, leading to even slower frames in a cascading failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame-rate independence</strong> ensures consistent behavior across different display refresh rates and system performance levels. A game running at 30fps should exhibit identical physics behavior to the same game running at 144fps, with movement distances and animation speeds remaining proportional to real-world time rather than frame count.</p>\n<p><strong>Theatrical physics</strong> describes game physics systems that prioritize feel and responsiveness over realistic simulation. Unlike scientific physics engines that model real-world forces accurately, theatrical physics implements simplified rules designed to create satisfying player experiences. Examples include instant direction changes that would require impossible acceleration in reality, or gravity that applies differently during jumping versus falling.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal velocity</strong> sets the maximum falling speed limit to prevent objects from accelerating infinitely under constant gravity. This parameter balances realistic acceleration with gameplay constraints, ensuring falling doesn&#39;t become uncontrollable while maintaining responsive physics feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiral of death</strong> occurs when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, causing increasingly large delta time values that make subsequent frames even slower. This cascading performance failure can render a game unplayable as physics calculations compound exponentially.</p>\n<h3 id=\"input-system-terminology\">Input System Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Input buffering</strong> captures and temporarily stores button press events within a time window, allowing responsive controls even when the press occurs slightly before the game state would normally allow the action. This technique bridges the gap between human reaction timing and precise game state requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Jump buffering</strong> specifically remembers jump button presses for a short duration before landing, automatically executing the jump when the player touches the ground. This creates more responsive jumping controls by accommodating the natural tendency to press jump slightly before reaching a platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Coyote time</strong> allows players to initiate jumps for a brief period after leaving a platform edge, named after the cartoon character who runs off cliffs but doesn&#39;t fall until looking down. This grace period compensates for the imprecision of human timing and creates more forgiving platforming controls.</p>\n<p><strong>Intent-based actions</strong> represent discrete player intentions like jumping or attacking that should be buffered when input occurs at suboptimal timing. These actions have clear start and end points and benefit from input forgiveness systems.</p>\n<p><strong>State-based actions</strong> encompass continuous player control like movement direction that should be checked directly each frame. These actions reflect ongoing player intent rather than discrete commands and don&#39;t require buffering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collision-detection-and-physics-terminology\">Collision Detection and Physics Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>AABB</strong> (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) defines rectangular collision boundaries aligned with coordinate axes, simplifying intersection testing through efficient min/max coordinate comparisons. AABB collision detection forms the foundation for most 2D platformer collision systems due to its computational efficiency and intuitive behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Penetration resolution</strong> separates overlapping objects after collision detection identifies an intersection. This process determines the minimum movement required to separate objects while preserving logical positioning and preventing objects from becoming permanently stuck within each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Collision epsilon</strong> establishes a minimum separation distance that accounts for floating-point precision limitations. Objects separated by distances smaller than epsilon are considered touching, preventing oscillation caused by tiny numerical errors in collision calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>Tunneling</strong> occurs when fast-moving entities pass completely through collision geometry between frames without detection. This artifact results from discrete collision checking that only tests positions at frame boundaries rather than continuous collision along movement paths.</p>\n<p><strong>Corner clipping</strong> happens when entities moving diagonally become stuck at tile intersections due to simultaneous collision on both axes. Proper collision resolution handles X and Y axes separately to prevent this common pathfinding issue.</p>\n<h3 id=\"entity-and-ai-terminology\">Entity and AI Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Stomp detection</strong> determines when a player successfully defeats an enemy by landing on top, typically requiring downward velocity and contact from above. This mechanic distinguishes between harmful side collisions and beneficial top-down defeats.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrol AI</strong> implements simple back-and-forth enemy movement between defined waypoints. This fundamental AI pattern provides predictable enemy behavior that players can learn and exploit strategically.</p>\n<p><strong>Invulnerability frames</strong> grant temporary damage immunity after taking a hit, preventing rapid successive damage and providing visual feedback through sprite flickering or color changes. This mechanic balances challenge with fairness in collision-dense scenarios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"level-design-and-architecture-terminology\">Level Design and Architecture Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Tilemap</strong> organizes level geometry as a 2D grid of tile IDs, where each ID references a specific tile type with associated visual and collision properties. This structure enables efficient level storage, editing, and collision detection through discrete grid-based calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>Collision geometry</strong> represents the physical boundaries derived from tile data that determine where entities can and cannot move. This geometry may differ from visual tile appearance, allowing decorative elements that don&#39;t affect gameplay and invisible barriers for game design purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Checkpoint</strong> establishes save points for player respawn after death, storing position and potentially game state information. Checkpoints balance challenge with progression by limiting setback distance while maintaining meaningful consequences for failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Spatial indexing</strong> organizes game objects by location for efficient proximity queries and collision detection. This optimization prevents the need to check every object against every other object by partitioning space into regions that can be queried selectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordinate conversion</strong> transforms between world pixels and tile grid positions, enabling efficient collision queries against the tile-based level structure. This conversion bridges the gap between precise entity positioning and discrete tile-based collision detection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rendering-and-animation-terminology\">Rendering and Animation Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Flip-book animation</strong> creates motion illusion through sequential sprite frames displayed at consistent intervals. This traditional animation technique forms the basis for character movement, environmental effects, and visual feedback systems in 2D games.</p>\n<p><strong>Texture atlas</strong> combines multiple sprite frames into a single image file, reducing draw calls and memory usage through batch rendering optimization. Frame coordinates within the atlas enable efficient sprite selection without texture switching overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Sprite batching</strong> groups multiple sprites sharing the same texture into single draw calls, dramatically improving rendering performance for scenes with many similar objects like particles, tiles, or repeated environmental elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Viewport culling</strong> skips rendering of objects outside the visible screen area, conserving processing power for complex scenes. This optimization becomes critical for large levels with many entities and detailed tile-based backgrounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Pixel-perfect positioning</strong> rounds coordinates to integer values, preventing sub-pixel sprite positioning that causes visual blurriness in pixel art games. This technique maintains crisp visual presentation but requires careful coordinate management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"camera-and-view-management-terminology\">Camera and View Management Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Deadzone</strong> defines a screen region where the player can move without triggering camera adjustment. This creates stable viewing areas that prevent constant camera motion while maintaining the player&#39;s position within the frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Look-ahead</strong> offsets the camera in the movement direction to show more area ahead of the player. This anticipatory positioning helps players see upcoming obstacles and plan their movement more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Boundary constraints</strong> prevent the camera from showing areas outside the defined level bounds, avoiding empty space or undefined regions that would break visual immersion.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordinate transformation</strong> converts between world space coordinates and screen space coordinates, enabling proper entity positioning relative to camera movement and viewport dimensions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-optimization-terminology\">Performance and Optimization Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Graceful degradation</strong> maintains core functionality while sacrificing secondary features when system performance degrades. This approach prioritizes essential gameplay systems over visual enhancements or convenience features during performance stress.</p>\n<p><strong>Delta time clamping</strong> limits maximum time steps to prevent physics instability during performance hiccups or frame rate drops. This technique prevents large time deltas from causing entities to move impossibly far in a single update.</p>\n<p><strong>Object pooling</strong> reuses allocated objects to reduce garbage collection overhead, particularly important for frequently created and destroyed entities like particles, projectiles, or temporary effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporal optimization</strong> spreads expensive calculations across multiple frames to maintain consistent frame rates. Non-critical operations can be distributed over time rather than performed entirely within single frame updates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"error-handling-and-robustness-terminology\">Error Handling and Robustness Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Emergency collision recovery</strong> provides fallback separation techniques when normal collision resolution fails to separate overlapping entities. This safety net prevents entities from becoming permanently stuck in invalid positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Input desynchronization</strong> occurs when the input system&#39;s internal state diverges from actual hardware input state, causing missed presses or phantom inputs. Recovery mechanisms re-establish synchronization between software state and hardware reality.</p>\n<p><strong>Cascade effect</strong> describes how small errors amplify into game-breaking behavior through system interactions. Understanding cascade potential helps prioritize error handling for systems with high downstream impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Boundary condition validation</strong> tests system behavior at parameter limits and edge cases where normal operation might fail. This validation prevents undefined behavior when values approach or exceed expected ranges.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration bugs</strong> arise from unexpected interactions between correctly implemented individual systems. These emergent failures require testing complete system combinations rather than isolated component validation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-features-and-extensions-terminology\">Advanced Features and Extensions Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> adds features in layers that don&#39;t break existing functionality, enabling modular development where advanced capabilities build upon stable foundations without compromising core systems.</p>\n<p><strong>State-driven animation</strong> automatically selects appropriate animation sequences based on entity state rather than requiring explicit animation management. This approach simplifies animation coordination and ensures visual consistency with gameplay state.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect templates</strong> provide predefined particle behavior patterns that can be instantiated with different parameters, enabling rich visual effects without requiring unique implementation for each variation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extension integration pattern</strong> establishes consistent approaches for adding modular functionality to the core engine, enabling third-party enhancements or experimental features without compromising system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Content validation</strong> implements automated checking of level design quality, detecting common design problems like unreachable areas, impossible jumps, or missing collision geometry before runtime errors occur.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-and-verification-terminology\">Testing and Verification Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Trajectory analysis</strong> records and analyzes entity movement paths over time to verify physics accuracy and detect anomalies in movement behavior. This technique helps validate frame-rate independence and collision resolution correctness.</p>\n<p><strong>Temporal accuracy</strong> ensures correct timing behavior in frame-rate independent systems by validating that time-based calculations produce consistent results across different frame rates and delta time variations.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance degradation</strong> monitoring tracks system performance over time to detect memory leaks, algorithmic inefficiencies, or resource accumulation that gradually reduces game performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone checkpoints</strong> provide concrete verification steps for each development phase, establishing clear success criteria and debugging guidance when systems don&#39;t behave as expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The terminology in this glossary directly corresponds to concepts implemented throughout the platformer engine.

platformer game engine that implements real-time physics simulation, collision detection, and game state management. The key architectural challenge is creating a responsive, frame-rate independent physics system that handles complex interactions between player movement, environmental collision, and game entities while maintaining smooth 60fps gameplay.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones - establishes foundational understanding for the entire project\n\nBuilding a 2D platformer presents a unique set of technical challenges that distinguish it from other types of software systems. Unlike traditional applications that respond to discrete user actions and maintain relatively static state, a platformer must simulate a continuous physical world that updates 60 times per second while responding instantly to player input. The core challenge lies in creating a system that feels responsive and predictable to players while managing complex interactions between movement physics, collision detection, and game state updates within strict timing constraints.\n\nThe fundamental problem we're solving is creating a **real-time interactive physics simulation** that prioritizes player experience over physical accuracy. This requires careful balance between computational efficiency, visual smoothness, and gameplay responsiveness. Players expect their character to move immediately when they press a button, jump with consistent height and timing, and interact predictably with the game world - all while the system maintains steady 60fps performance across different hardware configurations.\n\nThree core technical challenges define the architecture of any successful 2D platformer engine:\n\n**Real-time Physics Simulation**: The engine must continuously update entity positions, velocities, and accelerations while applying forces like gravity and friction. Unlike turn-based games where calculations happen between player actions, platformers require smooth, frame-rate independent physics that produce consistent behavior whether running at 30fps or 144fps. This demands careful time management, numerical stability in physics calculations, and efficient algorithms that can handle dozens of moving entities simultaneously.\n\n**Responsive Input Handling**: Player input must translate to immediate visual feedback with minimal latency. Modern platformers employ sophisticated techniques like input buffering (remembering button presses for a few frames) and coyote time (allowing jumps briefly after leaving a platform) to make controls feel more responsive than strict physics would allow. The input system must capture, queue, and process player actions while coordinating with physics updates to ensure consistent timing.\n\n**Precise Collision Detection and Resolution**: The collision system must prevent players from falling through platforms, getting stuck in walls, or experiencing other physics glitches that break game immersion. This requires efficient spatial algorithms to detect when moving objects intersect with level geometry, followed by resolution algorithms that separate overlapping objects without introducing visual artifacts like jittering or tunneling through thin barriers.\n\n### Game Physics Mental Model\n\nThink of game physics as **theatrical physics rather than scientific physics**. Just as a stage play uses simplified sets, dramatic lighting, and exaggerated gestures to create emotional impact rather than literal realism, game physics uses simplified calculations, exaggerated forces, and carefully tuned parameters to create engaging gameplay rather than accurate simulation.\n\nIn real physics, a falling object accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared regardless of what makes for fun gameplay. In game physics, gravity might be 2000 pixels per second squared because that creates the right \"weight\" feeling for your character. A real-world jump follows a precise parabolic arc determined by initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. A game jump might have reduced gravity while the jump button is held, creating variable height that feels more responsive to player input than realistic physics would allow.\n\nThis theatrical approach extends to collision detection, where we often prioritize preventing frustrating edge cases over physical accuracy. Real objects have complex shapes and can collide in countless ways. Game objects typically use simplified **Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)** - invisible rectangles that approximate object shapes for collision testing. A player character might be a complex sprite with irregular edges, but for collision purposes, we treat them as a simple rectangle that's slightly smaller than their visual representation. This prevents pixel-perfect collisions that feel unfair while ensuring smooth interaction with level geometry.\n\nThe mental model for velocity-based movement resembles **numerical integration in physics simulations**, but optimized for gaming constraints. Each frame, we update velocity based on acceleration (gravity, friction, player input), then update position based on velocity. However, unlike scientific simulation, we apply game-specific rules at each step. When the player releases the jump button mid-air, we might multiply upward velocity by 0.5 to create variable jump height. When the player changes direction while running, we might apply higher-than-realistic deceleration to make controls feel snappy.\n\n> **Key Insight**: Game physics is not about simulating reality - it's about creating a consistent, predictable, and engaging interactive experience. Every physics parameter should be tuned based on how it feels to play, not how accurately it models real-world physics.\n\nFrame-rate independence requires thinking about **delta time** as the fundamental unit of game physics. Instead of assuming \"one unit of movement per frame,\" every physics calculation must be scaled by the time elapsed since the last frame update. A character moving at 200 pixels per second should move exactly the same distance over 1 second whether that's rendered as 60 frames of ~16.67ms each or 120 frames of ~8.33ms each. This requires disciplined use of delta time in every physics calculation and careful consideration of numerical stability when time steps vary.\n\nThe collision resolution mental model resembles **constraint satisfaction** rather than physical impact simulation. When we detect that a player has moved inside a wall, we don't calculate realistic collision forces and momentum transfer. Instead, we treat the wall as an absolute constraint and move the player to the nearest valid position outside the wall. This constraint-based approach prevents common physics glitches while maintaining the theatrical physics that make platformers feel good to play.\n\n### Existing Platformer Approaches\n\nSuccessful 2D platformers have evolved several distinct architectural patterns, each optimized for different types of gameplay and technical constraints. Understanding these established approaches helps inform design decisions and reveals trade-offs between different implementation strategies.\n\nThe **Fixed Timestep with Frame Skipping** approach, popularized by classic arcade games and still used in many modern indie platformers, runs physics updates at a fixed rate (typically 60Hz) regardless of rendering framerate. If rendering runs faster than 60fps, the extra frames simply redraw the same physics state. If rendering runs slower, the physics system updates multiple times per render frame to maintain consistent gameplay timing.\n\n| Aspect | Fixed Timestep | Variable Timestep | Hybrid Approach |\n|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Physics Consistency** | Perfect - same behavior every run | Varies with framerate | Good - bounded variation |\n| **Implementation Complexity** | Simple - no delta time calculations | Moderate - requires careful delta time use | Complex - manages both approaches |\n| **Performance on Slow Hardware** | Graceful degradation - gameplay stays consistent | Poor - physics becomes sluggish | Good - adapts to hardware capabilities |\n| **Input Responsiveness** | May lag on fast displays | Always matches display refresh | Best of both worlds |\n| **Determinism for Replay/Networking** | Excellent - fixed timing guarantees repeatability | Poor - timing variations cause divergence | Moderate - requires careful synchronization |\n\n> **Decision: Hybrid Timestep with Physics Interpolation**\n> - **Context**: Modern games run on hardware ranging from 60Hz mobile devices to 240Hz gaming monitors, requiring consistent physics across different framerates while maintaining input responsiveness\n> - **Options Considered**: Pure fixed timestep, pure variable timestep, hybrid with interpolation\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with fixed physics timestep and interpolated rendering\n> - **Rationale**: Provides consistent physics behavior across hardware while maintaining smooth visuals and responsive input on high-refresh displays\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more complex time management but eliminates framerate-dependent physics bugs while supporting modern high-refresh displays\n\nThe **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architectural pattern treats game objects as collections of data components (position, velocity, sprite, health) processed by specialized systems (physics system, rendering system, AI system). This contrasts with traditional object-oriented approaches where entities inherit from base classes and contain their own update logic.\n\n| Architecture | Data Organization | Performance | Code Maintainability | Learning Curve |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Object-Oriented Inheritance** | Objects contain all data and methods | Moderate - virtual function overhead | Good - familiar patterns | Easy - matches typical programming education |\n| **Entity-Component-System** | Components hold data, systems process batches | Excellent - cache-friendly data access | Excellent - clear separation of concerns | Steep - requires understanding data-oriented design |\n| **Component-Based Objects** | Objects compose functionality via components | Good - reduces inheritance complexity | Good - more flexible than pure inheritance | Moderate - hybrid of familiar and new concepts |\n\nFor an intermediate-level learning project, the **Component-Based Objects** approach offers the best balance. Each entity (player, enemy, platform) is an object that composes its behavior from component objects (physics component, sprite component, collision component). This provides the flexibility of ECS while maintaining familiar object-oriented patterns that are easier for intermediate developers to understand and debug.\n\nThe **Tile-Based Level Architecture** remains the dominant approach for 2D platformers due to its efficiency and artistic flexibility. Levels are constructed from a grid of square tiles, each representing either solid geometry, background decoration, or special game elements like platforms or hazards. This contrasts with vector-based collision geometry or physics-simulated destructible terrain.\n\n| Level Architecture | Memory Usage | Collision Performance | Artistic Flexibility | Dynamic Modification |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| **Tile-Based Grid** | Excellent - compact representation | Excellent - O(1) tile lookup | Good - modular tile-based art | Limited - can modify individual tiles |\n| **Vector Collision Shapes** | Poor - complex shape data | Moderate - requires spatial partitioning | Excellent - arbitrary shapes | Excellent - can modify any geometry |\n| **Physics-Simulated Terrain** | Poor - detailed mesh data | Poor - complex collision queries | Limited - constrained by simulation | Excellent - fully dynamic destruction |\n\nTile-based architecture excels for traditional platformers where levels consist primarily of static platforms, walls, and simple interactive elements. The collision detection becomes a simple matter of checking which tiles overlap with an entity's bounding box, making it both fast and predictable. Level data can be stored compactly as 2D arrays of tile IDs, and level editors can provide intuitive grid-based editing tools.\n\n> **Decision: Tile-Based Level Architecture with AABB Entity Collision**\n> - **Context**: Building a learning-focused platformer that emphasizes physics and collision detection over complex level geometry\n> - **Options Considered**: Tile-based collision, vector collision shapes, hybrid tile-and-vector approach\n> - **Decision**: Pure tile-based level architecture with Axis-Aligned Bounding Box entity collision\n> - **Rationale**: Provides optimal learning experience by focusing complexity on physics and game mechanics rather than advanced spatial algorithms, while still representing the most common approach in successful 2D platformers\n> - **Consequences**: Limits level design to grid-based layouts but significantly simplifies collision detection implementation and debugging\n\nThe **Collision Resolution Strategy** varies significantly between different platformer implementations, with major implications for how corner cases and edge conditions behave. The fundamental choice is between **penetration resolution** (detecting overlap and separating objects) versus **predictive collision** (preventing overlap before it occurs).\n\nMost modern platformers use penetration resolution with **separating axis collision response**. When an entity moves during a frame and ends up overlapping with level geometry, the collision system calculates the minimum distance needed to separate them and moves the entity to a valid position. The critical implementation detail is handling X and Y axis collisions separately to prevent corner-clipping issues where entities get stuck in walls when colliding with inside corners.\n\n| Collision Strategy | Accuracy | Performance | Implementation Complexity | Tunneling Prevention |\n|-------------------|----------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Penetration Resolution** | Good - handles most cases well | Excellent - simple calculations | Moderate - requires separation logic | Poor - fast objects can tunnel |\n| **Predictive/Swept Collision** | Excellent - prevents all penetration | Moderate - requires collision time calculation | Complex - ray casting and time-of-impact | Excellent - mathematically impossible |\n| **Hybrid with Continuous Detection** | Excellent - best of both approaches | Poor - runs multiple collision passes | Very Complex - combines both systems | Excellent - handles all edge cases |\n\nFor the learning context, penetration resolution with separate X/Y axis handling provides the best balance of educational value and practical results. Students can understand and debug the collision resolution process, while the separate axis approach teaches important concepts about coordinate system decomposition that apply broadly in graphics and physics programming.\n\n> **Critical Design Principle**: In platformer collision resolution, **order of operations matters enormously**. Resolving X-axis collisions before Y-axis collisions produces different behavior than the reverse order, especially in corner collision scenarios. Most successful platformers resolve X-axis movement first (horizontal collision against walls) then Y-axis movement (vertical collision with floors/ceilings) to create predictable corner behavior that players can learn and exploit skillfully.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Frame-Rate Dependent Physics Calculations**\nMany beginning game developers write physics code that assumes a fixed framerate, such as `player.x += player.velocityX` without delta time scaling. This creates games that run faster or slower depending on the target machine's performance. On a 120fps display, the character moves twice as fast as intended. On a 30fps display during performance hitches, the character moves half speed. Always multiply movement and physics calculations by delta time: `player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime`. Test your game with artificially limited framerates to verify consistent behavior.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Gravity Values That Don't Match Jump Feel**\nRealistic gravity (9.8 m/s²) typically feels too weak for platformer games, making jumps feel floaty and unresponsive. However, making gravity too strong creates characters that slam into the ground with uncomfortable speed. The solution is **asymmetric gravity**: apply stronger gravity when falling than when jumping up, and reduce gravity while the jump button is held for variable jump height. Typical values might be 1200 pixels/second² for falling, 800 pixels/second² for jumping up, and 400 pixels/second² while holding jump.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Collision Detection Without Separation Axis Handling**\nNaive collision resolution that moves entities \"out of\" walls in a single direction often creates corner-clipping issues. When a character runs into an inside corner while falling, simultaneous X and Y collisions can cause the character to get pushed into the wall instead of sliding along it. Always resolve X-axis and Y-axis collisions as separate operations, typically handling horizontal movement first, then vertical movement. This creates predictable corner behavior that players can learn to expect.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Input Polling That Misses Quick Button Presses**\nChecking button state once per frame (`if (jumpButton.isPressed)`) can miss quick button taps that occur between frames, especially on high framerate displays. Implement **input buffering** that remembers button presses for several frames, allowing the physics system to respond to inputs that occurred slightly before the optimal time. Store button press events in a queue and consume them when appropriate game conditions are met (like landing on ground after requesting a jump in mid-air).\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nBuilding a 2D platformer requires careful selection of libraries and tools that support real-time graphics rendering, precise timing control, and responsive input handling.

Run `open index.html` in a web browser\n2. Open browser developer tools and see consistent FPS counter around 60fps\n3. Press arrow keys and see input events logged to console\n4. Observe smooth animation of a test rectangle moving across the screen\n5. Verify that movement speed stays consistent when artificially limiting framerate\n\nIf the game stutters or movement speed changes with different framerates, check that all movement calculations multiply by `deltaTime`. If inputs feel delayed or unresponsive, verify that the input buffer window is appropriate (100ms is typically good for platformers).\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones - defines the scope and boundaries for the entire platformer engine project\n\nBuilding a 2D platformer engine requires careful scope definition to balance learning objectives with project complexity. Think of this goals definition as drawing the boundaries of a game world - everything inside these boundaries represents the core mechanics that define a solid platformer experience, while everything outside represents advanced features that could distract from mastering the fundamentals. Just as a well-designed level guides the player through a focused experience without overwhelming them with too many mechanics at once, our engine goals create a focused learning path through game development concepts.\n\nThe primary challenge in scoping a platformer engine lies in the interconnected nature of game systems. Unlike many software projects where components can be built independently, game systems form a tightly coupled web where physics affects collision detection, which affects entity behavior, which affects input responsiveness. Our goals must ensure each system receives adequate attention while maintaining clear boundaries that prevent feature creep from derailing the core learning experience.\n\n### Core Engine Goals\n\nThe platformer engine must deliver a complete, playable game experience that demonstrates professional-level game development patterns while remaining approachable for intermediate developers. Our goals focus on three primary pillars: responsive controls, reliable physics simulation, and extensible architecture.\n\n> **Decision: Focus on Theatrical Physics Over Realistic Simulation**\n> - **Context**: Game physics can prioritize either physical realism or player experience, with most successful platformers choosing the latter\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Realistic physics with proper mass, friction coefficients, and momentum conservation\n>   2. Simplified theatrical physics optimized for responsive controls and predictable behavior\n>   3. Hybrid approach with realistic base physics but overrides for specific gameplay situations\n> - **Decision**: Implement theatrical physics throughout the engine\n> - **Rationale**: Platformers require precise, predictable movement where players can develop muscle memory. Realistic physics often feels \"slippery\" or unpredictable, making precise jumping and movement difficult. Professional platformers like Super Mario Bros. and Celeste use highly tuned, unrealistic physics that prioritize feel over accuracy.\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler implementation with fewer edge cases, better player experience, but physics knowledge won't transfer directly to simulation applications\n\n| Physics Goal | Implementation Approach | Learning Outcome |\n|--------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Frame-rate Independence** | Delta time scaling for all movement and physics calculations | Understanding time-based vs frame-based simulation |\n| **Responsive Movement** | Immediate acceleration/deceleration without realistic momentum | Mastering input handling and player control systems |\n| **Predictable Jumping** | Consistent jump height with variable duration control | Learning jump mechanics design patterns |\n| **Reliable Collision** | AABB collision with penetration resolution | Understanding geometric collision detection |\n| **Gravity Simulation** | Constant downward acceleration with terminal velocity | Implementing basic physics integration |\n\nThe engine must handle the fundamental physics loop that drives all platformer gameplay: applying forces (gravity, input acceleration), updating velocities based on those forces, updating positions based on velocity, detecting collisions in the new positions, and resolving any overlaps by adjusting positions and velocities. This cycle repeats every frame and must remain stable across different hardware performance levels.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: The order of physics operations matters tremendously. Updating position before resolving collisions can cause tunneling through thin walls. Resolving X and Y axis collisions simultaneously can cause corner-clipping artifacts. Our implementation must establish a consistent, well-tested update order.\n\n| Movement Goal | Specific Requirement | Quality Metric |\n|---------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Horizontal Movement** | Left/right arrow keys provide immediate response | Player reaches full speed within 3 frames |\n| **Jump Mechanics** | Space bar initiates jump, variable height with hold duration | 60% height difference between tap and held jump |\n| **Coyote Time** | Allow jumping for 100ms after leaving platform edge | Players can successfully make edge jumps consistently |\n| **Input Buffering** | Accept jump input 100ms before landing | No missed jumps due to timing precision |\n| **Ground Detection** | Accurate detection of when player contacts solid surfaces | Zero false positives or negatives in collision tests |\n\n### Collision System Goals\n\nThe collision detection system forms the foundation that enables all meaningful player-world interaction. Think of collision detection as the sensory system of our game world - it must accurately perceive when objects occupy the same space and respond appropriately. Unlike real-world physics where objects naturally resist interpenetration, our digital world allows objects to overlap freely unless we explicitly detect and resolve these situations.\n\nOur collision system must balance accuracy with performance, handling the common case of a single player entity moving through a tile-based world efficiently while maintaining precision for gameplay-critical interactions. The system should prevent all major collision artifacts that would break player immersion: tunneling through walls at high speeds, getting stuck in corners, sliding along surfaces unintentionally, or falling through floors due to floating-point precision errors.\n\n> **Decision: Separate X and Y Axis Collision Resolution**\n> - **Context**: When an entity moves diagonally and collides with a corner, resolving both axes simultaneously can cause unpredictable behavior\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Simultaneous X/Y resolution using vector projection to nearest surface\n>   2. Separate axis resolution handling X movement then Y movement independently\n>   3. Swept collision detection preventing overlap entirely\n> - **Decision**: Implement separate axis collision resolution\n> - **Rationale**: Separate axis resolution provides predictable behavior in corner cases and simpler implementation. Players can understand that hitting a wall stops horizontal movement while allowing continued falling, which feels intuitive. Swept collision is more accurate but significantly more complex to implement correctly.\n> - **Consequences**: Some unrealistic behavior (sliding along walls during diagonal impacts) but much simpler debugging and more predictable gameplay\n\n| Collision Goal | Technical Implementation | Player Experience |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Accurate Detection** | AABB intersection testing with floating-point precision handling | No glitching through solid surfaces |\n| **Tunneling Prevention** | Maximum movement distance per frame based on entity size | No passing through walls at high speeds |\n| **Corner Handling** | X-axis collision resolved before Y-axis collision | Predictable sliding behavior at corners |\n| **One-way Platforms** | Collision testing only when moving downward | Jump-through platforms work as expected |\n| **Tile Efficiency** | Only test collision against nearby tiles based on movement vector | 60fps performance with large levels |\n\nThe collision system must integrate seamlessly with our physics simulation, providing accurate feedback that the physics system can use to adjust velocities and positions. When the player hits a wall while moving right, the collision system detects the overlap, calculates the penetration distance, and provides this information so physics can set horizontal velocity to zero and adjust position to resolve the overlap.\n\n### Entity System Goals\n\nThe entity system provides the foundation for all interactive objects in our game world, from the player character to enemies to collectible items. Think of entities as actors on a stage - each has a position, appearance, and behavior, but they all follow common patterns for how they exist and interact within the world. Our entity system must provide a consistent framework that makes it easy to create new types of game objects while ensuring they integrate properly with physics, collision, and rendering systems.\n\nThe challenge lies in creating an entity architecture that remains simple enough for learning purposes while being flexible enough to support the diverse behaviors required by different game objects. The player entity needs complex input handling and state management, enemies need AI behavior and patrol logic, while static platforms need only position and collision properties.\n\n| Entity Goal | Architecture Decision | Implementation Benefits |\n|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| **Unified Interface** | Common `Entity` base with position, velocity, dimensions | Consistent collision and physics handling |\n| **Polymorphic Behavior** | Virtual `update()` and `render()` methods per entity type | Easy to add new entity types |\n| **Component Integration** | Direct integration with physics, collision, and input systems | No complex message passing or event systems |\n| **State Management** | Simple state variables (onGround, facingDirection, health) | Clear debugging and predictable behavior |\n| **Memory Efficiency** | Fixed-size arrays for entity storage rather than dynamic allocation | Predictable performance characteristics |\n\n> **Decision: Inheritance-based Entity System Over Component Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Game entities can be structured using inheritance (Player extends Entity) or composition (Entity contains MovementComponent, RenderComponent)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Component-based architecture with separate systems for each component type\n>   2. Inheritance-based system with Entity base class and specialized subclasses\n>   3. Data-oriented design with separate arrays for each entity property\n> - **Decision**: Use inheritance-based entity system\n> - **Rationale**: For a learning project with limited entity types (Player, Enemy, Platform), inheritance provides simpler mental model and easier debugging. Component systems shine with dozens of entity types and complex interactions, but add significant complexity for minimal benefit in our scope.\n> - **Consequences**: Less flexible for complex games but much easier to understand, debug, and extend for our specific requirements\n\n### Level System Goals\n\nThe level system transforms static tile data into interactive game environments, providing the spatial framework within which all gameplay occurs. Think of the level system as the stage designer for our platformer - it defines not just where walls and platforms exist, but also where players spawn, where enemies patrol, and how the camera should frame the action. Our level system must balance simplicity of authoring with flexibility of design, enabling rapid iteration on level layouts while supporting the collision and rendering requirements of other systems.\n\nThe tile-based approach provides natural advantages for collision detection and memory efficiency, allowing us to represent large game worlds using compact grid data while providing fast spatial lookup for collision testing. Each tile position can contain multiple properties: visual appearance, collision behavior, and gameplay semantics like checkpoint activation or enemy spawn points.\n\n| Level Goal | Data Structure | Gameplay Support |\n|------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Tile-based Geometry** | 2D integer array mapping positions to tile types | Fast collision lookup and memory efficiency |\n| **Visual Representation** | Sprite indices for each tile supporting animated tiles | Rich visual environments with minimal data |\n| **Collision Properties** | Per-tile collision flags (solid, one-way, ladder, hazard) | Diverse platform and obstacle behaviors |\n| **Spawn Management** | Dedicated spawn points for player and enemy placement | Consistent level initialization |\n| **Checkpoint System** | Checkpoint tiles with activation state tracking | Death recovery and progress preservation |\n\nThe level system must integrate closely with our collision detection, providing efficient spatial queries that allow entities to quickly determine which tiles they might be colliding with based on their current position and movement vector. This spatial partitioning eliminates the need to test collision against every tile in the level, maintaining performance even with large environments.\n\n### Input System Goals\n\nThe input system serves as the critical bridge between player intention and game response, determining whether our platformer feels responsive and precise or sluggish and frustrating. Think of input handling as the nervous system of our game - it must capture player intentions accurately, respond with minimal latency, and provide the sophisticated buffering and state management that enables advanced platformer techniques like coyote time and jump buffering.\n\nModern platformers require input systems that go far beyond simple key polling, implementing temporal buffers that remember recent inputs and sophisticated state tracking that enables complex move sequences. Our input system must feel responsive at 60fps while remaining frame-rate independent, ensuring consistent behavior across different hardware configurations.\n\n> **Decision: Input Buffering with Temporal Windows**\n> - **Context**: Precise platforming requires forgiving input timing, as human reaction time and finger coordination have natural variance\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Direct key polling with no temporal assistance\n>   2. Input buffering that remembers key presses for short time windows\n>   3. Predictive input processing that anticipates player intentions\n> - **Decision**: Implement input buffering with 100ms temporal windows\n> - **Rationale**: Professional platformers use buffering to reduce frustration from missed inputs due to timing precision. A 100ms buffer allows the game to register a jump input slightly before landing, making controls feel more responsive without compromising challenge.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex input state management but significantly improved player experience and control responsiveness\n\n| Input Goal | Implementation Strategy | Player Benefit |\n|------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| **Low Latency Response** | Process input at start of game loop, before physics | Immediate visual feedback to player actions |\n| **Jump Buffering** | Store jump inputs for 100ms before landing detection | No missed jumps due to precise timing requirements |\n| **Coyote Time** | Allow jumping for 100ms after leaving platform | Forgiveness for edge jump timing |\n| **Multi-key Support** | Simultaneous processing of movement and jump inputs | Complex maneuvers like running jumps |\n| **Configurable Mapping** | Abstract action system supporting keyboard and gamepad | Accessibility and player preference support |\n\n### Rendering System Goals\n\nThe rendering system transforms our abstract game state into visual representation, providing the immediate feedback that enables players to understand and respond to the game world. Think of rendering as the lighting and cinematography department of our game production - it must not only display objects accurately but frame them in ways that support gameplay comprehension and emotional engagement.\n\nOur rendering system must balance visual appeal with performance constraints, maintaining smooth 60fps animation while supporting the sprite animation, tile rendering, and camera movement that brings our platformer world to life. The system should provide clear visual hierarchy that helps players distinguish between different types of game objects and understand their interactive properties.\n\n| Rendering Goal | Visual Requirement | Technical Implementation |\n|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Sprite Animation** | Smooth character animation with 8-12 frames per cycle | Frame-based animation system with configurable timing |\n| **Tile Rendering** | Efficient drawing of large tile-based environments | Batch rendering of visible tiles only |\n| **Camera System** | Smooth following of player with boundary constraints | Interpolated camera movement with dead zones |\n| **Visual Feedback** | Clear indication of interactive elements and hazards | Distinct sprite families and animation states |\n| **Performance** | Consistent 60fps with minimal frame drops | Culling of off-screen objects and efficient draw calls |\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nDefining what our platformer engine will **not** include proves as important as defining its core features. These non-goals prevent scope creep while establishing clear boundaries that help learners focus on mastering fundamental concepts rather than getting distracted by advanced features that require significant additional complexity.\n\n> **Critical Boundary**: Each excluded feature represents a deliberate trade-off between learning value and implementation complexity.

The game loop is the director coordinating all the actors (entities), the physics engine is the choreographer ensuring smooth movement, the collision system is the stage manager preventing actors from walking through walls, and the rendering system is the lighting crew making everything visible to the audience. Each system has a specific role, but they must work in perfect synchronization to create the illusion of a living, responsive world.\n\n![System Architecture Overview](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\nThe architecture of our 2D platformer engine follows a **component-based design** where distinct systems handle specific aspects of game simulation. This approach provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining the tight coupling necessary for real-time performance. The central challenge is orchestrating these systems to run within a 16.67ms budget per frame to maintain 60fps gameplay.\n\nThe engine operates on a **push-based architecture** where the game loop drives all other systems through explicit update calls. This differs from event-driven architectures and provides predictable performance characteristics essential for real-time games. Each frame follows a strict sequence: input processing, physics simulation, collision resolution, and rendering.\n\n> **Decision: Component-Based Architecture with Central Game Loop**\n> - **Context**: Need to manage complex interactions between physics, rendering, input, and game logic while maintaining 60fps performance\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Monolithic game object with all functionality\n>   2. Event-driven system with message passing\n>   3. Component-based system with central coordination\n> - **Decision**: Component-based system with central game loop coordination\n> - **Rationale**: Provides clear separation of concerns for maintainability while avoiding the unpredictable timing of event systems. The game loop ensures deterministic update order crucial for physics stability.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables parallel development of systems, easier testing of individual components, but requires careful management of inter-system dependencies\n\n| Architecture Option | Pros | Cons | Performance | Chosen? |\n|---------------------|------|------|-------------|---------|\n| Monolithic | Simple, fast direct calls | Hard to maintain, tightly coupled | Excellent | ❌ |\n| Event-driven | Loose coupling, extensible | Unpredictable timing, complex debugging | Variable | ❌ |\n| Component-based | Clear separation, testable | Requires coordination layer | Good | ✅ |\n\n### Component Responsibilities\n\nEach system in the platformer engine owns specific data and functionality, creating clear boundaries that prevent the complexity explosion common in game development. Understanding these boundaries is crucial for maintaining code organization as the project grows.\n\nThe **GameLoop** serves as the master coordinator, managing frame timing and orchestrating all other systems. It owns the core timing data and ensures frame-rate independence through delta time calculations. Think of it as the metronome in an orchestra - it sets the tempo that all other systems follow.\n\n| Component | Data Ownership | Primary Responsibilities | Input Dependencies | Output Products |\n|-----------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| GameLoop | Frame timing, delta time, FPS targets | Frame rate management, system coordination | None (root component) | Delta time, frame pacing |\n| InputManager | Key states, input buffer, timing | Input capture, buffering, state tracking | Hardware input events | Processed input states |\n| Entity System | Entity positions, properties, states | Entity lifecycle, property management | Physics updates, collision results | Entity state changes |\n| Physics Engine | Velocities, accelerations, constraints | Movement simulation, gravity application | Entity states, input commands | Updated positions, velocities |\n| Collision System | Collision geometry, tile data | Intersection testing, penetration resolution | Entity bounds, level geometry | Collision events, corrections |\n| Rendering System | Sprites, animations, camera state | Visual presentation, frame composition | Entity positions, level data | Rendered frame |\n\nThe **InputManager** acts as the interface between hardware input and game logic. It maintains a dual responsibility: tracking current key states for immediate response and buffering recent inputs to improve perceived responsiveness. This system must handle the asynchronous nature of user input within the synchronous game loop.\n\n> The critical insight here is that input buffering transforms the user experience from \"did the game detect my keypress at exactly the right frame?\" to \"did I press the key around the right time?\" This small window of forgiveness dramatically improves the feel of responsive controls.\n\nThe **Entity System** manages all game objects including the player, enemies, and interactive elements. Each entity carries both physical properties (position, velocity) and game-specific state (health, AI behavior). This system provides the common interface that allows physics and collision systems to operate on any entity uniformly.\n\nThe **Physics Engine** implements theatrical physics - a simplified simulation focused on game feel rather than realism. It owns the fundamental constants like gravity and terminal velocity, applying them consistently across all entities. The physics system transforms input intentions into velocity changes and integrates those velocities into position updates.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Physics System Overreach**\nMany developers make the physics system responsible for input processing or collision response. This creates circular dependencies and makes testing difficult. The physics system should only handle the mathematical simulation - velocity integration, gravity application, and constraint enforcement. Input interpretation belongs in the input system, and collision response belongs in the collision system.\n\nThe **Collision System** bridges the gap between the continuous physics simulation and the discrete tile-based world geometry. It performs spatial queries to determine which tiles an entity overlaps, calculates intersection depths, and provides correction vectors. This system must handle the inherent precision issues of floating-point physics interacting with integer tile coordinates.\n\nThe **Rendering System** transforms the abstract game state into visual presentation. It owns the camera, sprite resources, and the final composition pipeline. This system must interpolate between discrete entity positions to create smooth visual movement and manage the z-ordering of visual elements.\n\n> **Decision: Separate Physics and Collision Systems**\n> - **Context**: Need to handle both continuous physics simulation and discrete tile-based collision detection\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Combined physics-collision system\n>   2. Physics handles movement, separate collision detection\n>   3. Collision system owns all spatial queries, physics handles temporal updates\n> - **Decision**: Separate systems with physics handling temporal changes and collision handling spatial queries\n> - **Rationale**: Physics operates in continuous time with velocities and accelerations, while collision operates in discrete space with tile grids. Different mathematical domains require different optimization strategies.\n> - **Consequences**: Cleaner separation of concerns and easier optimization of each domain, but requires careful coordination of update order\n\n### Data Flow and System Interactions\n\nThe data flow through the architecture follows a strict sequence each frame, ensuring deterministic behavior essential for gameplay consistency. Understanding this flow helps identify where performance bottlenecks may occur and how changes in one system affect others.\n\n1. **Input Processing Phase**: The `InputManager` captures hardware events and updates key states, while processing buffered inputs from previous frames\n2. **Physics Update Phase**: The physics engine applies gravity, processes movement commands, and integrates velocities into position changes using delta time\n3. **Collision Detection Phase**: The collision system tests entity bounding boxes against tile geometry and other entities\n4. **Collision Resolution Phase**: Detected collisions are resolved by separating overlapping entities and updating their positions and velocities\n5. **Game Logic Phase**: Entity-specific logic processes AI behavior, player state changes, and game rule enforcement\n6. **Rendering Phase**: The rendering system composites the final frame using updated entity positions and camera state\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect Update Order**\nProcessing collision detection before physics updates can cause entities to \"stick\" to surfaces due to stale velocity data. Processing rendering before collision resolution can cause visual artifacts where entities appear to clip through geometry for a single frame. The update order must reflect the causal relationship between systems.\n\n### Recommended Module Structure\n\nThe file organization reflects the component boundaries and supports parallel development while maintaining clear dependencies. This structure scales from a simple prototype to a complex game without major reorganization.\n\n```\nplatformer-game/\n├── src/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── GameLoop.js              ← Central game loop and timing\n│   │   ├── InputManager.js          ← Input handling and buffering\n│   │   └── Constants.js             ← Shared game constants\n│   ├── entities/\n│   │   ├── Entity.js                ← Base entity class and common functionality\n│   │   ├── Player.js                ← Player-specific logic and state\n│   │   ├── Enemy.js                 ← Enemy AI and behavior\n│   │   └── EntityManager.js         ← Entity lifecycle management\n│   ├── physics/\n│   │   ├── PhysicsEngine.js         ← Movement simulation and integration\n│   │   ├── Vector2.js               ← 2D vector mathematics\n│   │   └── PhysicsConstants.js      ← Physics tuning parameters\n│   ├── collision/\n│   │   ├── CollisionSystem.js       ← Collision detection and resolution\n│   │   ├── Rectangle.js             ← AABB collision geometry\n│   │   └── TileMap.js               ← Tile-based level collision\n│   ├── rendering/\n│   │   ├── Renderer.js              ← Main rendering pipeline\n│   │   ├── Camera.js                ← Camera positioning and following\n│   │   ├── Sprite.js                ← Sprite rendering and animation\n│   │   └── TileRenderer.js          ← Tilemap rendering\n│   ├── levels/\n│   │   ├── LevelLoader.js           ← Level data loading and parsing\n│   │   ├── Checkpoint.js            ← Checkpoint and respawn system\n│   │   └── data/                    ← Level data files\n│   └── utils/\n│       ├── MathUtils.js             ← Mathematical utilities and helpers\n│       └── Debug.js                 ← Debug visualization and logging\n├── assets/\n│   ├── sprites/                     ← Character and entity sprites\n│   ├── tiles/                       ← Tile graphics\n│   └── levels/                      ← Level definition files\n├── tests/\n│   ├── core/                        ← Core system unit tests\n│   ├── physics/                     ← Physics simulation tests\n│   └── collision/                   ← Collision detection tests\n└── index.html                       ← Main entry point\n```\n\n> **Decision: Separate Directories by System Responsibility**\n> - **Context**: Need to organize code in a way that supports parallel development and clear dependency management\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single directory with all files\n>   2. Organize by game object type (player/, enemy/, level/)\n>   3. Organize by system responsibility (physics/, rendering/, input/)\n> - **Decision**: Organize by system responsibility with clear dependency hierarchy\n> - **Rationale**: System-based organization aligns with the component architecture and makes it easy to understand data flow. Developers can work on physics improvements without touching rendering code.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables parallel development and easier maintenance, but requires understanding the system architecture to locate relevant code\n\nThe **core/** directory contains the foundational systems that other components depend on. The `GameLoop` serves as the entry point and coordinator, while `InputManager` provides input services to all other systems. These components have no dependencies on game-specific logic.\n\nThe **entities/** directory encapsulates all game object behavior and state management. The base `Entity` class provides common properties like position and velocity, while specific classes like `Player` and `Enemy` implement specialized behavior. The `EntityManager` handles entity lifecycle operations like spawning and cleanup.\n\nThe **physics/** directory contains the mathematical simulation systems responsible for movement and forces. These components operate on entity properties but don't directly modify entity state - they calculate new values that are applied by the entity system. This separation enables easier testing and tuning of physics behavior.\n\nThe **collision/** directory handles all spatial query operations including entity-entity intersection testing and entity-environment collision detection. The `CollisionSystem` coordinates between different collision detection strategies, while specialized classes like `TileMap` handle specific collision geometry types.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circular Dependencies**\nAvoid having the physics system directly modify collision system state or vice versa. Instead, use the entity system as the intermediary - physics calculates new positions, collision detects problems with those positions, and entities apply the final resolved state. This prevents circular imports and makes the data flow explicit.\n\n### System Initialization and Coordination\n\nThe startup sequence establishes the proper dependency relationships between systems and ensures all components are ready before the first frame update. This initialization order prevents race conditions and missing dependencies that can cause subtle bugs.\n\nThe initialization follows a **dependency-first order** where each system initializes its dependencies before setting up its own state:\n\n1. **Constants and Configuration Loading**: Load game constants, physics parameters, and configuration settings\n2. **Core System Initialization**: Initialize `GameLoop` timing systems and `InputManager` event listeners\n3. **Asset Loading**: Load sprites, tile graphics, and audio assets into memory\n4. **Level System Setup**: Initialize `TileMap` collision geometry and `LevelLoader` capabilities\n5. **Physics Engine Initialization**: Set up physics constants and integration parameters\n6. **Collision System Setup**: Build spatial acceleration structures and collision geometry\n7. **Entity System Initialization**: Create `EntityManager` and spawn initial entities\n8. **Rendering System Setup**: Initialize graphics context, camera, and rendering pipeline\n9. **Game Loop Start**: Begin the main update-render cycle\n\n| Initialization Phase | Systems Involved | Dependencies | Failure Recovery |\n|---------------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Asset Loading | Renderer, Entity System | File system access | Fallback to default sprites |\n| Level Loading | TileMap, EntityManager | Asset loading complete | Load default test level |\n| Physics Setup | PhysicsEngine | Constants loaded | Use hardcoded defaults |\n| Collision Preparation | CollisionSystem | Level and physics ready | Disable collision temporarily |\n| Game Loop Start | All systems | Everything initialized | Graceful error display |\n\nThe coordination between systems during runtime follows a **message-passing pattern** where systems communicate through well-defined interfaces rather than direct state modification. This approach maintains the component boundaries while enabling the necessary inter-system communication.\n\n> The key insight is that initialization order reflects runtime dependencies - systems that provide services to others must initialize first, while systems that consume multiple services initialize last. This creates a natural hierarchy that prevents circular dependencies.\n\n### Performance Considerations and Optimization Points\n\nThe architecture includes several points where performance optimization becomes critical for maintaining 60fps gameplay. Understanding these bottlenecks early helps structure code to avoid performance problems as the game grows in complexity.\n\nThe **primary performance bottleneck** is the collision detection system, which must test entity bounding boxes against potentially hundreds of tile positions each frame. The tile-based collision system provides natural spatial partitioning, but careful implementation is required to avoid unnecessary intersection tests.\n\n**Memory allocation patterns** significantly impact frame rate consistency due to garbage collection pauses. The architecture minimizes allocations by reusing object pools for frequently created items like collision results and vector calculations. Each system pre-allocates working memory during initialization rather than creating objects during frame updates.\n\n| System | Primary Bottleneck | Optimization Strategy | Performance Target |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Physics Engine | Vector math operations | Object pooling, in-place calculations | < 2ms per frame |\n| Collision Detection | Tile intersection tests | Spatial partitioning, early exit | < 4ms per frame |\n| Rendering | Sprite draw calls | Batching, culling | < 8ms per frame |\n| Entity Updates | AI behavior processing | State machine optimization | < 2ms per frame |\n\nThe **spiral of death** problem occurs when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, causing subsequent frames to fall further behind. The architecture prevents this through `maxDeltaTime` clamping, which limits the physics simulation step size even if the actual frame time is longer.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Premature Optimization**\nAvoid optimizing systems before they become bottlenecks. The architecture provides optimization points, but focus first on correctness and maintainability. Profile the actual performance with realistic game content before adding complexity for performance gains.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe implementation of the high-level architecture requires careful attention to initialization order and interface design. The following guidance provides practical starting points for each major system component.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Recommended for Learning |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Game Loop | `requestAnimationFrame` with manual delta time | Custom high-precision timer with interpolation | Simple option |\n| Input Handling | Direct `keydown`/`keyup` event listeners | Input system with state machine and buffering | Advanced option |\n| Rendering | Canvas 2D context with immediate mode | WebGL with sprite batching | Simple option |\n| Asset Loading | Direct image loading with callbacks | Asset manager with preloading pipeline | Simple option |\n| Physics Math | Built-in JavaScript math operations | Optimized vector library (gl-matrix) | Simple option |\n\n#### Core System Starter Code\n\n**GameLoop.js** - Complete implementation for frame timing and coordination:\n\n```javascript\n// GameLoop.js - Central game loop with frame rate management\nclass GameLoop {\n    constructor() {\n        this.isRunning = false;\n        this.lastFrameTime = 0;\n        this.targetFPS = 60;\n        this.maxDeltaTime = 33.33; // Prevent spiral of death\n        this.updateCallback = null;\n        this.renderCallback = null;\n        this.frameCount = 0;\n        this.fpsDisplay = 0;\n        this.fpsTimer = 0;\n    }\n\n    start(updateCallback, renderCallback) {\n        this.updateCallback = updateCallback;\n        this.renderCallback = renderCallback;\n        this.isRunning = true;\n        this.lastFrameTime = performance.now();\n        this.gameLoopStep();\n    }\n\n    stop() {\n        this.isRunning = false;\n    }\n\n    gameLoopStep() {\n        if (!this.isRunning) return;\n\n        const currentTime = performance.now();\n        let deltaTime = (currentTime - this.lastFrameTime) / 1000.0;\n        \n        // Clamp delta time to prevent spiral of death\n        deltaTime = Math.min(deltaTime, this.maxDeltaTime / 1000.0);\n        \n        this.lastFrameTime = currentTime;\n\n        // Update game systems\n        if (this.updateCallback) {\n            this.updateCallback(deltaTime);\n        }\n\n        // Render current frame\n        if (this.renderCallback) {\n            this.renderCallback();\n        }\n\n        // Calculate FPS for debugging\n        this.frameCount++;\n        this.fpsTimer += deltaTime;\n        if (this.fpsTimer >= 1.0) {\n            this.fpsDisplay = this.frameCount;\n            this.frameCount = 0;\n            this.fpsTimer = 0;\n        }\n\n        requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoopStep());\n    }\n\n    getFPS() {\n        return this.fpsDisplay;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**InputManager.js** - Complete input handling with buffering:\n\n```javascript\n// InputManager.js - Input capture with buffering for responsive controls\nclass InputManager {\n    constructor() {\n        this.keys = new Map();\n        this.keyBuffer = new Map();\n        this.bufferDuration = 0.1; // 100ms buffer window\n        \n        this.setupEventListeners();\n    }\n\n    setupEventListeners() {\n        window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {\n            this.keys.set(event.code, true);\n            this.keyBuffer.set(event.code, 0); // Reset buffer timer\n        });\n\n        window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {\n            this.keys.set(event.code, false);\n        });\n    }\n\n    update(deltaTime) {\n        // Update buffer timers\n        for (const [key, timer] of this.keyBuffer) {\n            const newTimer = timer + deltaTime;\n            if (newTimer > this.bufferDuration) {\n                this.keyBuffer.delete(key);\n            } else {\n                this.keyBuffer.set(key, newTimer);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    isKeyPressed(keyCode) {\n        return this.keys.get(keyCode) || false;\n    }\n\n    wasKeyJustPressed(keyCode) {\n        return this.keyBuffer.has(keyCode);\n    }\n\n    consumeKeyPress(keyCode) {\n        this.keyBuffer.delete(keyCode);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Core Logic Skeletons\n\n**Entity.js** - Base entity class for implementation:\n\n```javascript\n// Entity.js - Base class for all game objects\nclass Entity {\n    constructor(x, y, width, height) {\n        // TODO 1: Initialize position properties (x, y, width, height)\n        // TODO 2: Initialize physics properties (velocityX, velocityY, accelerationX, accelerationY)\n        // TODO 3: Initialize state properties (onGround, solid, visible)\n        // TODO 4: Initialize rendering properties (sprite)\n        // Hint: Use the exact field names from the naming conventions\n    }\n\n    update(deltaTime, inputManager) {\n        // TODO 1: Apply acceleration to velocity (physics integration)\n        // TODO 2: Apply velocity to position using delta time\n        // TODO 3: Update entity-specific behavior (override in subclasses)\n        // TODO 4: Update animation frame based on movement state\n        // Hint: This is the base update - subclasses will extend this behavior\n    }\n\n    getBoundingBox() {\n        // TODO 1: Create Rectangle object with current position and dimensions\n        // TODO 2: Return Rectangle for collision detection system\n        // Hint: Rectangle constructor takes (x, y, width, height)\n    }\n\n    render(renderer) {\n        // TODO 1: Check if entity is visible before rendering\n        // TODO 2: Draw sprite at current position\n        // TODO 3: Optionally draw debug bounding box\n        // Hint: Use renderer.drawSprite(sprite, x, y) method\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**PhysicsEngine.js** - Physics simulation skeleton:\n\n```javascript\n// PhysicsEngine.js - Movement simulation and physics integration\nclass PhysicsEngine {\n    constructor() {\n        // TODO 1: Initialize physics constants (GRAVITY, TERMINAL_VELOCITY)\n        // TODO 2: Set up physics world properties\n        // Hint: Use constants from naming conventions\n    }\n\n    updateEntity(entity, deltaTime) {\n        // TODO 1: Apply gravity acceleration if entity is not on ground\n        // TODO 2: Clamp velocity to terminal velocity limits\n        // TODO 3: Integrate acceleration into velocity using delta time\n        // TODO 4: Integrate velocity into position using delta time\n        // TODO 5: Apply friction/drag forces to horizontal movement\n        // Hint: Standard physics integration: velocity += acceleration * deltaTime\n    }\n\n    applyForce(entity, forceX, forceY) {\n        // TODO 1: Convert force to acceleration (F = ma, assume mass = 1)\n        // TODO 2: Add acceleration to entity's current acceleration\n        // TODO 3: Handle impulse forces vs continuous forces\n        // Hint: Impulse forces are applied once, continuous forces each frame\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Module Integration Pattern\n\n**Main.js** - System integration and startup sequence:\n\n```javascript\n// Main.js - Application entry point and system coordination\nclass Game {\n    constructor() {\n        // TODO 1: Initialize all system instances in dependency order\n        // TODO 2: Set up canvas and rendering context\n        // TODO 3: Create initial game entities\n        // TODO 4: Load level data\n        // Hint: Follow the initialization order from the architecture section\n    }\n\n    init() {\n        // TODO 1: Load assets and wait for completion\n        // TODO 2: Initialize each system with proper dependencies\n        // TODO 3: Set up level geometry and spawn entities\n        // TODO 4: Start the main game loop\n        // Hint: Use async/await for asset loading to ensure proper sequencing\n    }\n\n    update(deltaTime) {\n        // TODO 1: Update input manager with delta time\n        // TODO 2: Update physics for all entities\n        // TODO 3: Process collision detection and resolution\n        // TODO 4: Update entity game logic\n        // TODO 5: Update camera position based on player\n        // Hint: Follow the exact update order from the data flow section\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        // TODO 1: Clear the canvas/screen\n        // TODO 2: Render background/tilemap\n        // TODO 3: Render all entities in proper z-order\n        // TODO 4: Render UI elements (health, score, etc.)\n        // TODO 5: Render debug information if enabled\n        // Hint: Render background to foreground for proper layering\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### File Structure Setup\n\nCreate the directory structure exactly as specified in the module organization section. Each system should be self-contained with clear imports and exports:\n\n```javascript\n// Example: Entity.js exports\nexport { Entity };\n\n// Example: Game.js imports\nimport { GameLoop } from './core/GameLoop.js';\nimport { InputManager } from './core/InputManager.js';\nimport { Entity } from './entities/Entity.js';\nimport { PhysicsEngine } from './physics/PhysicsEngine.js';\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Checkpoint 1 - System Integration**: After implementing the basic architecture, you should be able to:\n- Run the game loop and see a consistent FPS counter\n- Detect keyboard input with buffering working correctly\n- Create entities and see them update their positions each frame\n- Verify systems are updating in the correct order through console logging\n\n**Checkpoint 2 - Physics Integration**: After connecting physics and entities:\n- Entities should fall due to gravity when not on ground\n- Horizontal movement should respond to input with proper acceleration\n- Terminal velocity should prevent infinite falling speed\n- Delta time should provide consistent behavior regardless of frame rate\n\n**Checkpoint 3 - Collision Integration**: After implementing collision detection:\n- Entities should stop falling when they hit ground tiles\n- Horizontal movement should be blocked by wall tiles\n- Collision resolution should prevent entities from clipping through geometry\n- Multiple entities should interact properly with the same collision surfaces\n\n⚠️ **Common Integration Issues**:\n- **Update order problems**: Physics running before input can cause delayed response. Follow the exact sequence: input → physics → collision → rendering.\n- **Delta time misuse**: Multiplying position directly by delta time instead of velocity. Position should equal current position plus velocity times delta time.\n- **Circular dependencies**: Systems trying to import each other. Use the entity system as the data hub between physics, collision, and rendering.\n\n\n## Data Model\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1 (Basic Movement and Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - establishes the core data structures used throughout all game systems\n\nThink of the data model as the **blueprint** for everything that exists in your game world. Just as an architect needs precise drawings showing the dimensions and properties of every room, door, and fixture before construction begins, a game engine requires carefully designed data structures to represent every entity, physics property, and piece of level geometry before any gameplay code can function correctly.\n\nThe data model serves as the **contract** between all game systems. The physics engine needs to know exactly where entities are located and how fast they're moving. The collision system needs precise dimensional data to detect overlaps. The rendering system needs sprite and visibility information to draw everything correctly. Without a well-designed data model, these systems would be unable to communicate effectively, leading to inconsistent behavior and hard-to-debug issues.\n\n### Entity Data Structure\n\nThe `Entity` data structure serves as the **universal language** for representing any interactive object in the game world. Think of an entity as a **game object passport** - it contains all the essential information that other systems need to know about that object, from its current location and movement speed to its visual appearance and collision properties.\n\n> **Design Insight:** The entity-component-system (ECS) pattern is popular in larger games, but for a platformer learning project, a simple inheritance-based entity system provides clearer understanding of object relationships and responsibilities. The additional complexity of ECS would distract from learning core physics and collision concepts.\n\n**Decision: Unified Entity Base Class**\n- **Context**: Need to represent diverse game objects (player, enemies, platforms, collectibles) with shared behavior like position tracking, physics simulation, and collision detection\n- **Options Considered**: \n  1. Separate classes for each object type with no shared interface\n  2. Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with composition\n  3. Inheritance-based system with Entity base class\n- **Decision**: Inheritance-based Entity base class with specialized subclasses\n- **Rationale**: Provides code reuse for common properties while maintaining clear object relationships. ECS adds complexity that obscures learning goals, while separate classes lead to code duplication.\n- **Consequences**: Enables shared physics and collision logic, but may require refactoring if object behavior becomes too diverse\n\nThe core `Entity` structure contains all properties needed for physics simulation, collision detection, and rendering:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `x` | number | Current horizontal position in world coordinates (pixels) |\n| `y` | number | Current vertical position in world coordinates (pixels) |\n| `width` | number | Entity collision box width in pixels |\n| `height` | number | Entity collision box height in pixels |\n| `velocityX` | number | Current horizontal velocity in pixels per second |\n| `velocityY` | number | Current vertical velocity in pixels per second |\n| `accelerationX` | number | Horizontal acceleration in pixels per second squared |\n| `accelerationY` | number | Vertical acceleration in pixels per second squared |\n| `onGround` | boolean | Whether entity is currently touching solid ground |\n| `solid` | boolean | Whether other entities should collide with this entity |\n| `sprite` | object | Visual representation data including texture and animation frame |\n| `visible` | boolean | Whether entity should be rendered to screen |\n\n**Position and Dimensions**: The `x` and `y` coordinates represent the entity's position in world space, typically anchored at the top-left corner for consistency with most 2D rendering systems. The `width` and `height` define the entity's collision boundaries - these may differ from the sprite dimensions to provide more forgiving collision detection or to create entities that are larger or smaller than their visual representation.\n\n**Velocity and Acceleration**: The velocity fields track how many pixels the entity moves per second in each direction. Positive `velocityY` indicates downward movement (following screen coordinate conventions), while negative values indicate upward movement. Acceleration represents forces acting on the entity - gravity typically applies negative acceleration to `accelerationY`, while input handling might apply acceleration to `accelerationX` for responsive movement.\n\n**Physics State**: The `onGround` flag is crucial for jump mechanics and determines whether the entity is affected by gravity. This prevents entities from accelerating downward indefinitely when resting on solid surfaces. The collision system sets this flag based on contact with solid tiles or platforms.\n\n**Collision Properties**: The `solid` flag determines collision behavior - solid entities block movement of other entities, while non-solid entities (like collectibles or decorative objects) can overlap with others. This allows for different interaction types without requiring separate collision detection paths.\n\n**Visual Properties**: The `sprite` object contains texture references, animation frame data, and rendering parameters. The `visible` flag allows entities to exist in the world without being drawn, useful for invisible collision volumes, checkpoints, or temporarily hidden objects.\n\nThe `Entity` interface defines the standard methods that all game objects must implement:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `update` | `deltaTime: number, inputManager: InputManager` | void | Updates entity state for one frame using elapsed time |\n| `getBoundingBox` | none | `Rectangle` | Returns current collision rectangle in world coordinates |\n| `render` | `renderer: object` | void | Draws entity to screen using provided rendering context |\n\n**Update Method**: The `update` method receives delta time for frame-rate independent calculations and an input manager for handling player controls. Each entity type implements this method differently - the player entity processes keyboard input and applies movement forces, while enemy entities run AI behavior logic. The method should modify the entity's position, velocity, and state based on elapsed time and current conditions.\n\n**Bounding Box Method**: The `getBoundingBox` method returns a `Rectangle` structure representing the entity's current collision area. This rectangle uses the entity's current `x` and `y` position along with its `width` and `height` to create an axis-aligned bounding box for collision detection. The collision system calls this method to determine if entities overlap.\n\n**Render Method**: The `render` method receives a rendering context and draws the entity's visual representation to the screen. This method should handle sprite positioning, animation frame selection, and any visual effects. The rendering system calls this method for all visible entities during the draw phase.\n\n### Player Entity Specialization\n\nThe `Player` entity extends the base `Entity` with additional properties specific to player character behavior:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `health` | number | Current player health points |\n| `coyoteTimer` | number | Time remaining for coyote time jump window |\n| `jumpBuffer` | number | Time remaining for jump input buffering |\n| `invulnerabilityTimer` | number | Time remaining of invincibility after taking damage |\n| `checkpointX` | number | Last activated checkpoint horizontal position |\n| `checkpointY` | number | Last activated checkpoint vertical position |\n\n**Coyote Time Implementation**: The `coyoteTimer` starts counting down when the player leaves solid ground without jumping. While this timer is active, the player can still initiate a jump even though they're technically in mid-air. This creates more forgiving jump mechanics that feel responsive to players.\n\n**Jump Buffering**: The `jumpBuffer` timer activates when the player presses the jump button while in mid-air. If the player lands before this timer expires, the jump automatically executes. This prevents frustrating situations where the player pressed jump slightly too early before landing.\n\n**Damage and Respawn**: The health system tracks player vitality, while `invulnerabilityTimer` provides brief immunity after taking damage to prevent rapid damage accumulation. The checkpoint coordinates store the last safe position for respawning after death.\n\n### Enemy Entity Specialization\n\nEnemy entities require additional data for AI behavior and patrol patterns:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `patrolStartX` | number | Left boundary of patrol movement area |\n| `patrolEndX` | number | Right boundary of patrol movement area |\n| `patrolSpeed` | number | Movement speed during patrol in pixels per second |\n| `patrolDirection` | number | Current movement direction (-1 for left, 1 for right) |\n| `attackDamage` | number | Damage dealt to player on contact |\n\n**Patrol System**: The patrol boundaries define a movement area for the enemy. The AI system moves the enemy between these points, reversing direction when reaching either boundary. This creates predictable but challenging movement patterns for players to navigate around.\n\n### Level Data Structure\n\nThink of the level data structure as a **digital blueprint** for the game world. Just as a city planner uses a grid system to organize streets, buildings, and zones, the platformer uses a tile-based grid to organize collision geometry, visual elements, and interactive objects in a way that's both memory-efficient and easy to edit.\n\n**Decision: Tile-Based Level Representation**\n- **Context**: Need efficient storage and collision detection for large 2D game levels with repeating geometric patterns\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Vector-based collision shapes with arbitrary polygons\n  2. Tile-based grid system with fixed-size squares\n  3. Hybrid system with tiles for background and vectors for special collision\n- **Decision**: Pure tile-based system with 32x32 pixel tiles\n- **Rationale**: Simplifies collision detection to grid lookups, enables easy level editing, reduces memory usage through tile reuse, and matches common platformer design patterns\n- **Consequences**: Limits level geometry to grid-aligned shapes but provides predictable performance and straightforward collision algorithms\n\nThe level representation centers around a two-dimensional grid where each cell contains a tile identifier. This approach provides several advantages: collision detection reduces to simple grid lookups, memory usage remains constant regardless of level size, and level editing becomes intuitive through tile placement tools.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `width` | number | Level width in tiles (not pixels) |\n| `height` | number | Level height in tiles (not pixels) |\n| `tileSize` | number | Size of each tile in pixels (typically 32) |\n| `tiles` | number[][] | 2D array of tile IDs, indexed as [y][x] |\n| `entities` | Entity[] | Array of all non-tile entities in the level |\n| `checkpoints` | Vector2[] | Array of checkpoint positions for player respawn |\n| `spawnPoint` | Vector2 | Initial player spawn position |\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The `width` and `height` fields specify the level size in tile units. A level with `width: 50` and `height: 20` contains 1000 total tiles and measures 1600x640 pixels when using 32-pixel tiles. This tile-based measurement simplifies level editing and collision calculations.\n\n**Tile Array Structure**: The `tiles` array uses [y][x] indexing to match mathematical coordinate conventions and simplify rendering loops. Each tile ID corresponds to a tile type definition that specifies collision properties and visual appearance. A value of 0 typically represents empty space, while positive integers represent different tile types.\n\n**Entity Placement**: The `entities` array contains all dynamic objects that don't conform to the tile grid - enemies, moving platforms, collectibles, and interactive objects. These entities have precise pixel positioning and can move freely without grid constraints.\n\n**Checkpoint System**: The `checkpoints` array stores positions where players can respawn after death. Each checkpoint activates when the player touches it, updating the player's respawn point. The level designer places checkpoints at safe locations before challenging sections.\n\nThe tile system requires a tile type definition structure to map tile IDs to gameplay behavior:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | number | Unique identifier for this tile type |\n| `solid` | boolean | Whether entities collide with this tile |\n| `oneWay` | boolean | Whether tile only blocks movement from above |\n| `sprite` | object | Visual representation for rendering |\n| `deadly` | boolean | Whether touching this tile kills the player |\n\n**Collision Types**: Solid tiles block entity movement from all directions. One-way platforms allow entities to pass through from below but provide solid support when approached from above. Deadly tiles (like spikes) trigger player death on contact while also blocking movement.\n\n**Level Loading and Coordinate Systems**\n\nThe level system provides methods for converting between different coordinate spaces:\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `getTileAt` | `x: number, y: number` | number | Returns tile ID at world coordinates |\n| `getTileAtGrid` | `tileX: number, tileY: number` | number | Returns tile ID at grid coordinates |\n| `worldToGrid` | `x: number, y: number` | Vector2 | Converts world pixels to grid coordinates |\n| `gridToWorld` | `tileX: number, tileY: number` | Vector2 | Converts grid coordinates to world pixels |\n| `isTileSolid` | `tileX: number, tileY: number` | boolean | Checks if tile blocks movement |\n\n**Coordinate Conversion**: The `worldToGrid` method divides world pixel coordinates by `TILE_SIZE` and floors the result to get grid indices. The `gridToWorld` method multiplies grid coordinates by `TILE_SIZE` to get pixel positions. These conversions are essential for collision detection algorithms.\n\n**Boundary Checking**: All tile access methods must validate grid coordinates to prevent array bounds errors. Tiles outside the level boundaries should be treated as solid to prevent entities from escaping the playable area.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Position and Velocity Confusion**\nMany developers initially store position as integers and wonder why movement feels choppy or objects get stuck against walls. The entity position must use floating-point numbers to support smooth movement at any frame rate. When delta time is 16.67ms (60fps), an entity moving at 100 pixels/second should move 1.667 pixels per frame. Using integers would truncate this to 1 pixel, causing irregular movement speeds.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Coordinate System Inconsistency**  \nMixing up coordinate systems leads to collision detection bugs. Screen coordinates use (0,0) at top-left with positive Y pointing down, while mathematical coordinates use positive Y pointing up. Choose one system consistently throughout the entire engine. Most 2D games use screen coordinates to match rendering APIs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Tile Array Index Confusion**\nIndexing the tile array as `tiles[x][y]` instead of `tiles[y][x]` causes crashes or incorrect collision detection. The outer array represents rows (Y coordinates), while inner arrays represent columns (X coordinates). Always use `tiles[row][column]` or `tiles[y][x]` to maintain consistency with 2D array conventions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Bounds Checking**\nAccessing tiles outside the level boundaries causes array index errors and crashes. Always validate grid coordinates before array access:\n```\nif (tileY >= 0 && tileY < height && tileX >= 0 && tileX < width)\n```\nTreat out-of-bounds tiles as solid to prevent entities from escaping the level.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting Delta Time in Entity Updates**\nHard-coding movement values in the update method creates frame-rate dependent behavior. An entity moving `x += 2` per frame moves at different speeds on 30fps vs 60fps displays. Always multiply movement by delta time: `x += velocityX * deltaTime` to maintain consistent speeds across different hardware.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe data model implementation requires careful attention to memory layout, coordinate precision, and type safety. Here's how to structure these core components in JavaScript:\n\n**A.

JavaScript-Specific Implementation Notes:**\n\n- Use `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth game loop timing and automatic delta time calculation\n- Store sprite images in a Map for efficient lookup: `const sprites = new Map()`\n- Use `Array.from({length: height}, () => new Array(width).fill(0))` to create 2D tile arrays safely\n- Consider using `Object.freeze()` on tile definitions to prevent accidental modification\n- Use strict equality (`===`) when comparing tile IDs to avoid type coercion issues\n\n**I. Milestone Checkpoints:**\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint**: After implementing the basic Entity and Level classes, you should be able to:\n- Create a Player entity and update its position using delta time\n- Load a simple level from JSON and access tiles using world coordinates\n- Verify coordinate conversion between world pixels and grid tiles works correctly\n- Test command: `console.log(level.getTileAt(player.x, player.y))` should return correct tile ID\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint**: With player movement implemented:\n- Player should respond to keyboard input with smooth acceleration\n- Position updates should be frame-rate independent (test at different frame rates)\n- Coyote time and jump buffering timers should update correctly\n\n\n## Game Loop and Time Management\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1 (Basic Movement and Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - establishes the frame-rate independent execution foundation that all game systems depend upon\n\nThink of the game loop as the **heartbeat of your game world**. Just as a conductor keeps an orchestra synchronized with a steady tempo, the game loop coordinates all game systems—physics, input, collision detection, rendering—ensuring they work together harmoniously regardless of whether the game runs on a 60Hz monitor, a 144Hz gaming display, or a mobile device struggling at 30fps. Without proper time management, your platformer would feel sluggish on slow devices and uncontrollably fast on high-refresh displays, creating an inconsistent and frustrating player experience.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in game loop design is achieving **frame-rate independence**—ensuring that game behavior remains consistent regardless of the actual framerate. A naive approach might update physics by fixed amounts each frame, but this creates a disaster: on a 30fps device, the player falls at half the speed compared to a 60fps device. Professional games solve this through **delta time**—measuring the actual elapsed time between frames and scaling all time-dependent calculations accordingly.\n\nThe second critical aspect is **update order consistency**. Game systems have dependencies: input must be processed before physics updates, physics must complete before collision resolution, and collision resolution must finish before rendering. Breaking this order leads to subtle but game-breaking bugs like input lag, visual glitches, or physics objects appearing to \"teleport\" through walls.\n\n### Delta Time System\n\n**Delta time** represents the elapsed duration between consecutive frames, typically measured in seconds or milliseconds. Think of delta time as a **scaling factor** that adapts your game's calculations to the actual passage of time. Instead of saying \"move 5 pixels this frame\" (which depends on framerate), you say \"move 300 pixels per second * delta time\"—automatically scaling movement based on how much real time has passed.\n\nThe mathematical foundation is straightforward: if an object should move at 200 pixels per second, and 16.67 milliseconds have elapsed since the last frame (60fps), then the object moves 200 * 0.01667 = 3.33 pixels this frame. On a slower 30fps system with 33.33ms between frames, the same object moves 200 * 0.03333 = 6.67 pixels, maintaining the same visual speed to the player.\n\nHowever, delta time introduces several implementation challenges that can destabilize your physics simulation if not handled carefully.\n\n> **Decision: Delta Time Calculation Method**\n> - **Context**: Need to measure elapsed time between frames for frame-rate independent updates\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - System clock difference between frames\n>   - High-resolution performance timer\n>   - Fixed timestep with accumulator\n> - **Decision**: High-resolution performance timer with maximum delta clamping\n> - **Rationale**: Performance timers provide microsecond precision needed for smooth physics. System clocks can jump backward or forward due to system adjustments. Fixed timestep adds complexity for this intermediate-level project.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables smooth physics across different framerates but requires careful handling of edge cases like window focus loss\n\n| Approach | Precision | Complexity | Frame Independence | Chosen |\n|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------|\n| System clock difference | Low (milliseconds) | Simple | Yes | No |\n| Performance timer | High (microseconds) | Medium | Yes | **Yes** |\n| Fixed timestep + accumulator | Perfect | High | Yes | No |\n\nThe most dangerous delta time scenario is the **spiral of death**—when frame processing takes longer than the target frame time, creating increasingly large delta values that make the next frame even slower to process. For example, if a 60fps game (16.67ms target) takes 50ms to process one frame due to a performance spike, the next frame receives a delta of 50ms, potentially causing physics objects to move so far they tunnel through collision boundaries, triggering expensive collision recovery that makes the subsequent frame even slower.\n\nTo prevent spiral of death scenarios, professional games implement **maximum delta clamping**—artificially limiting delta time to a reasonable maximum value, typically 33.33ms (equivalent to 30fps minimum). This means that during severe performance drops, the game world effectively runs in slow motion rather than becoming increasingly unstable.\n\n```\nCurrent Frame Time: 45ms (fps drop to ~22)\nUnclamped Delta: 45ms\nClamped Delta: min(45ms, 33.33ms) = 33.33ms\nResult: Game runs slightly slow but remains stable\n```\n\nAnother critical consideration is **delta time precision**. Using integer milliseconds introduces quantization errors that accumulate over time, causing objects to drift from their expected positions. Professional implementations use floating-point seconds with microsecond precision from high-resolution timers.\n\nThe `GameLoop` data structure encapsulates all timing-related state and behavior:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| isRunning | boolean | Controls main loop execution state |\n| lastFrameTime | number | High-precision timestamp of previous frame start |\n| targetFPS | number | Desired frames per second (typically 60) |\n| maxDeltaTime | number | Maximum allowed delta to prevent spiral of death |\n| updateCallback | function | Game logic update function receiving delta time |\n| renderCallback | function | Rendering function called after updates complete |\n\nThe delta time calculation algorithm follows these steps:\n\n1. **Capture high-precision current time** using the platform's performance timer (not system clock)\n2. **Calculate raw delta** by subtracting the last frame time from current time\n3. **Apply maximum delta clamping** to prevent spiral of death scenarios\n4. **Store current time** as the last frame time for next iteration\n5. **Convert to seconds** if necessary for consistent units across game systems\n6. **Pass delta to update systems** for frame-rate independent calculations\n\n> The critical insight is that delta time transforms your game from a frame-based simulation to a time-based simulation. This paradigm shift requires disciplined thinking: every time-dependent calculation must be multiplied by delta time, from physics movement to animation timers to particle system lifespans.\n\n### Update Order and Phases\n\nThe game loop execution follows a carefully orchestrated sequence of phases, each with specific responsibilities and dependencies. Think of this as an **assembly line** where each station must complete its work before passing the product to the next station. Breaking this order creates bugs that are often subtle and difficult to reproduce.\n\n![Game Loop Execution Cycle](./diagrams/game-loop-cycle.svg)\n\nThe standard update sequence ensures data consistency and predictable behavior:\n\n1. **Input Processing Phase**: Capture and buffer all input events from the current frame\n2. **Entity Update Phase**: Update entity logic, AI decisions, and state machines\n3. **Physics Update Phase**: Apply forces, update velocities, and calculate new positions\n4. **Collision Detection Phase**: Identify all intersections between entities and level geometry\n5. **Collision Resolution Phase**: Separate overlapping objects and update collision state\n6. **Camera Update Phase**: Adjust camera position based on player location and boundaries\n7. **Render Phase**: Draw all visible entities and UI elements to the screen\n\nEach phase operates on the complete results of the previous phase, ensuring consistency. For example, the collision detection phase sees the final positions calculated by physics, not intermediate values from partial updates.\n\n> **Decision: Single-Threaded Sequential Updates**\n> - **Context**: Game systems have complex interdependencies and shared state\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Sequential single-threaded updates\n>   - Parallel system updates with synchronization\n>   - Job-based threading with dependency graphs\n> - **Decision**: Sequential single-threaded updates for all systems\n> - **Rationale**: Eliminates race conditions and simplifies debugging for intermediate developers. Performance is sufficient for 2D platformers with moderate entity counts.\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler code and debugging at the cost of CPU utilization on multi-core systems\n\n| Phase | Input Dependencies | Output Products | Critical Timing |\n|-------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Input Processing | Hardware input events | Key states, input buffer | Must complete before entity updates |\n| Entity Updates | Input states, previous entity state | New entity decisions, state changes | Must complete before physics |\n| Physics Updates | Entity states, forces | New positions, velocities | Must complete before collision detection |\n| Collision Detection | Final positions, geometry | Collision pairs, intersection data | Must complete before resolution |\n| Collision Resolution | Collision data | Corrected positions, collision state | Must complete before rendering |\n| Camera Updates | Player position, level bounds | Camera position, viewport | Must complete before rendering |\n| Rendering | All final positions, camera | Visual output | Final phase, no dependencies |\n\nThe **Input Processing Phase** captures all input events that occurred since the last frame and updates the input manager's state. This includes both immediate key states (for continuous actions like running) and buffered key presses (for discrete actions like jumping). Input buffering is particularly crucial for responsive platformer controls—players expect their jump input to register even if pressed slightly before landing.\n\nInput processing must occur before entity updates to ensure that player actions affect the current frame rather than being delayed by one frame. One-frame input delay creates a noticeably sluggish feel that frustrates players, especially in precision platforming sections.\n\nThe **Entity Update Phase** processes game logic for all entities—player state machines, enemy AI decisions, trigger activation, and animation updates. Entities make decisions based on their current state and input, but they don't yet modify their positions or velocities. This separation allows AI systems to react to the player's current position without being affected by the player's movement during the same frame.\n\nDuring this phase, entities update their internal state machines, make AI decisions about movement direction, and prepare for physics updates. For example, the player entity determines whether to apply jump velocity based on ground state and input buffering, but the actual velocity change occurs in the physics phase.\n\nThe **Physics Update Phase** applies all forces and updates entity positions based on current velocities and elapsed time. This phase implements the core platformer physics: gravity acceleration, horizontal movement, velocity damping, and terminal velocity clamping. All physics calculations use delta time for frame-rate independence.\n\nThe physics update algorithm processes each entity:\n\n1. **Apply gravity acceleration** to vertical velocity if not on ground\n2. **Apply horizontal forces** from input or AI decisions\n3. **Apply velocity damping** for air resistance and friction effects\n4. **Clamp velocities** to terminal velocity limits\n5. **Update positions** using velocity multiplied by delta time\n6. **Reset force accumulators** for the next frame\n\nThe **Collision Detection Phase** identifies all intersections between entities and level geometry without modifying any positions. This phase uses AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) intersection tests against the tile-based level data, producing a list of collision pairs that need resolution.\n\nCollision detection operates on the positions calculated during physics update, ensuring consistent results. The system tests each entity against nearby tiles and other entities, building a comprehensive list of all overlaps that occurred due to movement during this frame.\n\nThe **Collision Resolution Phase** separates overlapping objects and updates collision-related state like the `onGround` flag. This phase modifies entity positions to resolve penetration and updates velocities when entities hit solid surfaces. The resolution algorithm processes X-axis and Y-axis collisions separately to handle corner cases properly.\n\nResolution order matters: Y-axis collisions (typically from falling onto platforms) are often resolved before X-axis collisions to ensure proper ground detection. This ordering prevents the player from getting stuck in corner configurations where simultaneous X and Y collisions occur.\n\nThe **Camera Update Phase** calculates the camera position based on the player's final position after collision resolution. The camera system implements smooth following behavior with configurable constraints to prevent the camera from leaving the level boundaries or moving too abruptly during rapid player movement.\n\nThe **Render Phase** draws all visual elements using the final positions and camera settings calculated in previous phases. This phase is purely output-focused and doesn't modify game state. Rendering includes sprite drawing, tilemap rendering, UI overlay, and debug visualization if enabled.\n\n> A common mistake is mixing rendering with game logic updates. Rendering should be a pure function of the current game state—it observes and draws but never modifies entity positions, velocities, or other gameplay-affecting properties.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Using Frame Count Instead of Delta Time**\nBeginners often implement movement as `position += velocity` assuming 60fps. This creates inconsistent behavior across different framerates. On 30fps systems, movement appears half-speed. On 144fps systems, movement becomes uncontrollably fast. Always scale time-dependent calculations: `position += velocity * deltaTime`.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unbounded Delta Time During Debugging**\nWhen stepping through code in a debugger, delta time can become extremely large (seconds or minutes). Without maximum delta clamping, resuming execution causes physics objects to teleport vast distances or tunnel through collision boundaries. Always clamp delta time to a reasonable maximum like 33.33ms.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Processing Input After Physics**\nProcessing input after physics updates creates one-frame delay in player response. Players press jump, but the character doesn't respond until the next frame, creating sluggish controls. Input processing must occur first in the update sequence.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Update Order**\nChanging the order of update phases between frames creates non-deterministic behavior. Sometimes collision resolution sees old positions, sometimes new ones. Maintain strict update order consistency across all frames.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Integer Delta Time Precision**\nUsing integer milliseconds for delta time introduces quantization errors that accumulate over time. A 60fps game with 16ms integer delta (instead of 16.67ms float) runs slightly slow, causing objects to drift from expected positions over time. Use floating-point seconds with high precision.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe game loop forms the execution foundation that drives all other game systems.

Core Logic Skeleton:**\n\n**GameLoop.js** - Main game loop structure:\n```javascript\nexport class GameLoop {\n    constructor() {\n        this.isRunning = false;\n        this.lastFrameTime = 0;\n        this.targetFPS = 60;\n        this.maxDeltaTime = 33.33; // milliseconds\n        this.updateCallback = null;\n        this.renderCallback = null;\n        this.animationFrameId = null;\n    }\n\n    start(updateCallback, renderCallback) {\n        // TODO 1: Store the update and render callback functions\n        // TODO 2: Set isRunning to true\n        // TODO 3: Initialize lastFrameTime with current high-precision time\n        // TODO 4: Start the game loop with requestAnimationFrame\n        // Hint: Use performance.now() for high-precision timing\n    }\n\n    stop() {\n        // TODO 1: Set isRunning to false\n        // TODO 2: Cancel the current animation frame request\n        // Hint: Use cancelAnimationFrame with stored animation frame ID\n    }\n\n    gameLoopStep(currentTime) {\n        // TODO 1: Calculate raw delta time from currentTime and lastFrameTime\n        // TODO 2: Clamp delta time to maxDeltaTime to prevent spiral of death\n        // TODO 3: Convert delta time from milliseconds to seconds\n        // TODO 4: Call updateCallback with clamped delta time\n        // TODO 5: Call renderCallback to draw the current frame\n        // TODO 6: Store currentTime as lastFrameTime for next iteration\n        // TODO 7: Schedule next frame with requestAnimationFrame if still running\n        // Hint: Handle the first frame case where lastFrameTime might be 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Game.js** - Main game class integration:\n```javascript\nimport { GameLoop } from './core/GameLoop.js';\nimport { TimeManager } from './core/TimeManager.js';\nimport { InputManager } from './input/InputManager.js';\n\nexport class Game {\n    constructor() {\n        this.gameLoop = new GameLoop();\n        this.timeManager = new TimeManager();\n        this.inputManager = new InputManager();\n        this.entities = [];\n        // Other game systems will be added here\n    }\n\n    start() {\n        // TODO 1: Start the game loop with update and render methods as callbacks\n        // TODO 2: Handle any initialization that needs to happen before first frame\n    }\n\n    update(deltaTime) {\n        // TODO 1: Update the time manager with current frame timing\n        // TODO 2: Update input manager to process buffered inputs\n        // TODO 3: Update all entities with delta time and input manager\n        // TODO 4: Update physics system with delta time\n        // TODO 5: Perform collision detection and resolution\n        // TODO 6: Update camera system based on player position\n        // Hint: Follow the update phase order described in the design section\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        // TODO 1: Clear the canvas or rendering surface\n        // TODO 2: Set up camera transform for world rendering\n        // TODO 3: Render all visible entities\n        // TODO 4: Render UI elements and debug information\n        // TODO 5: Present the completed frame to the screen\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**E. Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n- Use `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()` for high-precision timing measurements\n- `requestAnimationFrame()` automatically syncs with the display refresh rate for smooth rendering\n- Convert delta time from milliseconds to seconds early in the loop for consistent units: `deltaTime / 1000.0`\n- Store animation frame IDs to properly cancel the loop during cleanup: `this.animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(...)`\n- Handle window focus loss by clamping large delta times that accumulate while the browser tab is inactive\n- Use `Map` objects for key tracking instead of plain objects for better performance with frequent lookups\n- Consider using `const` for mathematical constants like `targetFPS: 60` and `maxDeltaTime: 33.33`\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoints:**\n\nAfter implementing the basic game loop structure:\n- **Verification**: Open browser developer tools and confirm `gameLoop.start()` executes without errors\n- **Expected Output**: Console should show steady stream of update and render calls at approximately 60fps\n- **Manual Test**: Add temporary logging to update callback: `console.log('Delta:', deltaTime)` should show values around 0.016-0.017 seconds\n- **Performance Test**: Deliberately cause lag (infinite loop in update) and verify delta time clamps to maximum value\n- **Recovery Test**: After lag resolves, confirm game systems return to normal timing behavior\n\n**G. Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Game runs too fast/slow | Missing delta time scaling | Check if physics uses raw values | Multiply movements by deltaTime |\n| Choppy animation | Inconsistent frame timing | Log delta time values | Use requestAnimationFrame, not setInterval |\n| Game freezes after tab switch | Unbounded delta time | Log delta time after focus return | Implement maximum delta clamping |\n| Controls feel sluggish | Input processed after physics | Check update phase order | Move input processing to first phase |\n| Inconsistent physics behavior | Variable update order | Add logging to update sequence | Ensure consistent phase ordering |\n\n\n## Physics Engine\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1 (Basic Movement and Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision) - implements the core physics simulation that drives player movement, gravity, and jumping mechanics\n\nThink of the physics engine as the **invisible hand** that governs how objects move through your game world. Just as gravity pulls objects downward in the real world and friction slows them down, your physics engine applies these forces consistently every frame to create believable movement. Unlike real-world physics that deals with complex molecular interactions and precise measurements, game physics prioritizes **theatrical physics** - movement that feels satisfying and responsive to players rather than scientifically accurate.\n\nThe physics engine serves as the central nervous system of your platformer, coordinating between input intentions, environmental constraints, and visual feedback. Every frame, it must answer fundamental questions: Where should the player be next? How fast should they fall? Can they jump right now? When should momentum carry them forward versus when should friction bring them to a halt?\n\n![Physics Update Flow](./diagrams/physics-update-flow.svg)\n\nThe core challenge lies in creating frame-rate independence while maintaining responsive controls. A player pressing the jump button expects immediate response regardless of whether the game runs at 30fps or 144fps. Similarly, gravity must pull consistently, and movement must feel identical across different hardware configurations.\n\n### Movement Physics\n\nThink of horizontal movement as **driving a car with both an accelerator and automatic brakes**. When the player holds the right arrow key, they're pressing the accelerator - the character gains velocity in that direction up to a maximum speed. The moment they release the key, friction acts like automatic brakes, gradually reducing velocity until the character stops. This creates natural-feeling acceleration and deceleration without requiring players to manually brake.\n\nThe physics engine implements velocity-based positioning where entities maintain persistent velocity values that accumulate over time. Each frame, input forces modify velocity, physics forces like friction adjust velocity, and finally the new velocity determines the change in position. This separation of concerns allows complex interactions - a player can be moving right from input while simultaneously falling from gravity, with both velocities contributing to the final position.\n\n**Movement Physics Data Structure:**\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| `velocityX` | number | Current horizontal velocity in pixels per second |\n| `velocityY` | number | Current vertical velocity in pixels per second |\n| `accelerationX` | number | Current horizontal acceleration in pixels per second squared |\n| `accelerationY` | number | Current vertical acceleration in pixels per second squared |\n| `maxSpeed` | number | Maximum horizontal movement velocity |\n| `friction` | number | Deceleration rate when no input is applied |\n| `groundAcceleration` | number | Acceleration rate when player is on ground |\n| `airAcceleration` | number | Acceleration rate when player is airborne |\n\n> **Decision: Separate Ground and Air Movement**\n> - **Context**: Players expect different movement responsiveness when running on ground versus floating in air\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Single acceleration value for all movement\n>   2. Different acceleration for ground vs air\n>   3. Complex momentum conservation system\n> - **Decision**: Different acceleration values for ground and air movement\n> - **Rationale**: Ground movement should feel snappy and responsive for precise platforming, while air movement should feel slightly floated to prevent players from changing direction too easily mid-jump\n> - **Consequences**: Enables tight ground controls while preventing \"helicopter\" movement in air, but requires ground state tracking\n\n**Movement Physics Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Input Processing**: Check current input state and determine desired movement direction\n2. **Acceleration Calculation**: Apply ground or air acceleration based on current `onGround` state\n3. **Friction Application**: When no input is pressed, apply friction to gradually reduce horizontal velocity\n4. **Velocity Clamping**: Ensure horizontal velocity doesn't exceed `maxSpeed` in either direction\n5. **Position Integration**: Update entity position by adding velocity multiplied by delta time\n6. **Velocity Persistence**: Store final velocity values for next frame's calculations\n\nThe movement system distinguishes between **acceleration** (how quickly you reach top speed) and **maximum speed** (the fastest you can travel). A high acceleration with moderate maximum speed creates snappy, responsive controls. Low acceleration with high maximum speed creates momentum-heavy movement that takes time to build up and slow down.\n\n**Common Movement Physics Parameters:**\n\n| Parameter | Ground Value | Air Value | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Acceleration | 1200 px/s² | 800 px/s² | Responsive ground control, moderate air control |\n| Maximum Speed | 200 px/s | 200 px/s | Consistent top speed regardless of surface |\n| Friction | 800 px/s² | 50 px/s² | Quick stopping on ground, momentum preservation in air |\n\nConsider a concrete example: The player presses right while standing on the ground. The physics engine applies `groundAcceleration` of 1200 px/s² to increase `velocityX`. After 0.167 seconds (approximately 10 frames at 60fps), velocity reaches the `maxSpeed` of 200 px/s. When the player releases the right key, friction of 800 px/s² reduces velocity, bringing the character to a complete stop in 0.25 seconds.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Framerate-Dependent Movement**\nMany beginners apply movement directly to position each frame (like `x += 5`) rather than using velocity and delta time. This creates movement that runs faster on high-framerate displays and slower on low-framerate displays. Always multiply velocity by delta time when updating position: `x += velocityX * deltaTime`.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Instant Direction Changes**\nWithout proper friction and acceleration, characters can instantly reverse direction mid-air, creating unrealistic \"helicopter\" movement. Always apply different acceleration values for ground and air, and ensure friction provides momentum when no input is active.\n\n### Gravity and Falling\n\nThink of gravity as a **constant invisible force** pushing down on your character every single frame, like standing in a gentle but persistent wind. Unlike horizontal movement which responds to player input, gravity acts continuously and independently. The physics engine must track whether entities are supported by solid ground and apply downward acceleration only when they're airborne.\n\nGravity implementation requires careful balance between realistic falling behavior and responsive game feel. Real gravity accelerates objects at 9.8 m/s², but game gravity often uses higher values to prevent floaty, unresponsive jumping. The key insight is that players judge jump responsiveness by how quickly they start falling after reaching peak height, not by scientific accuracy.\n\n**Gravity Physics Data Structure:**\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| `GRAVITY` | number | Constant downward acceleration (980 px/s²) |\n| `TERMINAL_VELOCITY` | number | Maximum falling speed (600 px/s) |\n| `onGround` | boolean | Whether entity is currently supported by solid surface |\n| `wasOnGround` | boolean | Ground state from previous frame for transition detection |\n| `groundCheckOffset` | number | Distance below entity feet to check for ground collision |\n\nThe gravity system must solve several technical challenges. First, **ground state detection** determines when to apply gravity versus when to prevent it. An entity standing on solid ground should not accelerate downward, but the moment they step off a ledge, gravity should immediately take effect. Second, **terminal velocity limiting** prevents entities from falling infinitely fast, which would make collision detection unreliable and create unpleasant visual effects.\n\n> **Decision: Terminal Velocity Implementation**\n> - **Context**: Without speed limits, falling entities accelerate infinitely, causing collision tunneling and visual issues\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. No terminal velocity limit\n>   2. Hard velocity cap at maximum value\n>   3. Gradual velocity approach to terminal velocity using drag\n> - **Decision**: Hard velocity cap at terminal velocity value\n> - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation with predictable behavior. Drag-based systems add complexity without significant gameplay benefit for platformers\n> - **Consequences**: Consistent maximum falling speed, easier collision prediction, but less realistic physics simulation\n\n**Gravity Application Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Ground State Check**: Determine if entity is currently supported by solid ground\n2. **Gravity Acceleration**: If not on ground, add `GRAVITY * deltaTime` to `velocityY`\n3. **Terminal Velocity Clamping**: Ensure `velocityY` does not exceed `TERMINAL_VELOCITY`\n4. **Ground State Transition**: Update `wasOnGround` for next frame's transition detection\n5. **Position Update**: Apply final `velocityY` to entity position\n\nGround state detection typically involves checking collision with solid tiles immediately below the entity's feet. The physics engine performs this check every frame before applying gravity, ensuring that entities standing on platforms don't fall through them while entities stepping off edges immediately begin falling.\n\nConsider a specific scenario: A player character runs off a platform edge. On the first frame after leaving the platform, `onGround` changes from true to false. The gravity system immediately begins applying 980 px/s² downward acceleration. After 0.61 seconds of free fall, the character reaches terminal velocity of 600 px/s and continues falling at that constant speed until hitting another surface.\n\n**Gravity Configuration Values:**\n\n| Parameter | Value | Justification |\n|-----------|-------|---------------|\n| `GRAVITY` | 980 px/s² | Twice real-world gravity for responsive jumping |\n| `TERMINAL_VELOCITY` | 600 px/s | Fast enough to feel weighty, slow enough for collision detection |\n| `groundCheckOffset` | 2 px | Small buffer to handle floating-point precision issues |\n\nThe ground check offset addresses a common technical challenge in collision detection. Due to floating-point precision, an entity positioned exactly on a platform might register as 0.001 pixels above the surface, causing them to start falling. A small offset ensures entities remain grounded when positioned very close to solid surfaces.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ground Detection Gaps**\nChecking only the exact bottom edge of the character can miss ground when the character is partially overlapping a platform. Always check a small area below the character's feet, not just a single point. Use `groundCheckOffset` to create a small buffer zone for reliable ground detection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Gravity Without Terminal Velocity**\nWithout terminal velocity limits, characters can fall fast enough to tunnel through collision geometry. Always implement both `GRAVITY` for realistic acceleration and `TERMINAL_VELOCITY` to prevent collision system failures.\n\n### Jump Mechanics\n\nThink of jumping as **temporarily overpowering gravity** with a strong upward impulse, like a compressed spring suddenly releasing. Unlike continuous forces like gravity and friction, jumping applies an instantaneous velocity change that fights against downward acceleration. The art lies in making this mechanical process feel natural and responsive to player input.\n\nModern platformers implement sophisticated jump mechanics that go far beyond simply applying upward velocity. **Variable height jumping** allows players to control jump height by holding the button longer - tap for a small hop, hold for maximum height. **Coyote time** provides a grace period where players can still jump even after leaving a platform edge. **Jump buffering** registers jump input slightly before landing, making controls feel more responsive.\n\n![Player State Machine](./diagrams/player-state-machine.svg)\n\n**Jump Mechanics Data Structure:**\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| `jumpSpeed` | number | Initial upward velocity applied when jumping (-400 px/s) |\n| `jumpHoldGravity` | number | Reduced gravity while jump button held (490 px/s²) |\n| `jumpReleaseGravity` | number | Increased gravity when jump button released (1470 px/s²) |\n| `coyoteTimer` | number | Time remaining for coyote time jumping (0.1s max) |\n| `jumpBuffer` | number | Time remaining for buffered jump input (0.1s max) |\n| `COYOTE_TIME` | number | Maximum coyote time duration (0.1 seconds) |\n| `canJump` | boolean | Whether entity is currently allowed to jump |\n\nVariable height jumping works by **manipulating gravity** rather than the initial jump velocity. When the player presses jump, the character receives full upward velocity. While the jump button remains held, the physics engine applies reduced gravity, allowing the character to rise higher. The moment the player releases the button, gravity increases dramatically, causing the character to quickly reach peak height and begin falling.\n\n> **Decision: Variable Jump Implementation Method**\n> - **Context**: Players expect jump height to vary based on button hold duration for precise platforming\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Variable initial jump velocity based on predicted hold time\n>   2. Continuous thrust while button is held\n>   3. Gravity modification while button is held\n> - **Decision**: Gravity modification approach with reduced gravity during button hold\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable maximum jump height, allows players to control arc naturally, and works well with existing gravity system\n> - **Consequences**: Enables intuitive variable height jumping but requires tracking jump button state separately from initial jump trigger\n\n**Coyote Time Implementation:**\n\nCoyote time solves the frustrating problem where players press jump immediately after running off a ledge, expecting to jump, but failing because they're technically airborne. The system maintains a timer that counts down from `COYOTE_TIME` whenever the player leaves the ground. During this window, jump input is still accepted as if the player were grounded.\n\n**Jump Buffer Implementation:**\n\nJump buffering addresses the opposite timing issue - when players press jump slightly before landing on a platform. Instead of losing the input, the system remembers the jump request for a brief period and automatically executes it the moment the character touches ground.\n\n**Complete Jump System Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Coyote Timer Update**: If player was on ground last frame but not this frame, set `coyoteTimer` to `COYOTE_TIME`\n2. **Coyote Timer Countdown**: If player is airborne and `coyoteTimer` > 0, reduce timer by delta time\n3. **Jump Buffer Update**: If jump input detected, set `jumpBuffer` to buffer duration\n4. **Jump Buffer Countdown**: If `jumpBuffer` > 0, reduce timer by delta time  \n5. **Jump Eligibility Check**: Player can jump if `onGround` is true OR `coyoteTimer` > 0\n6. **Jump Execution**: If jump eligible and `jumpBuffer` > 0, apply `jumpSpeed` to `velocityY`\n7. **Variable Height Processing**: While airborne and jump held, apply `jumpHoldGravity`; otherwise apply `jumpReleaseGravity`\n8. **State Cleanup**: Reset timers and buffers after successful jump\n\n**Jump Mechanics State Machine:**\n\n| Current State | Input Event | Conditions | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------|\n| Grounded | Jump Press | Always | Jumping | Apply jumpSpeed, consume jumpBuffer |\n| Airborne | Jump Press | coyoteTimer > 0 | Jumping | Apply jumpSpeed, reset coyoteTimer |\n| Jumping | Jump Release | velocityY < 0 | Falling | Switch to jumpReleaseGravity |\n| Falling | Land on Ground | velocityY ≥ 0 | Grounded | Set onGround true, check jumpBuffer |\n| Any | Jump Press | Can't jump | Same | Store in jumpBuffer for future use |\n\nConsider a complex scenario demonstrating all systems working together: A player runs toward a gap, releases the run button just before the edge, and presses jump 50ms after leaving the platform. Without coyote time, this would fail. With coyote time, the jump succeeds because less than 100ms have passed since leaving the ground. The player then releases the jump button halfway up, causing increased gravity to pull them down faster, allowing precise control over jump height.\n\n**Jump Mechanics Configuration:**\n\n| Parameter | Value | Purpose |\n|-----------|-------|---------|\n| `jumpSpeed` | -400 px/s | Initial upward velocity (negative = upward) |\n| `jumpHoldGravity` | 490 px/s² | Half normal gravity for extended hang time |\n| `jumpReleaseGravity` | 1470 px/s² | 1.5x normal gravity for quick descent |\n| `COYOTE_TIME` | 0.1 seconds | Grace period for edge jumping |\n| `bufferDuration` | 0.1 seconds | Input memory window |\n\nThe negative jump speed value reflects the coordinate system where positive Y points downward (common in 2D graphics). Applying -400 px/s moves the character upward against the positive gravity acceleration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Coyote Time Without Limits**\nUnlimited coyote time allows players to jump long after leaving platforms, breaking game physics. Always implement a reasonable time limit (typically 0.1 seconds) and ensure the timer only activates when transitioning from grounded to airborne.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Jump Buffer Overflow**\nStoring multiple buffered jump inputs can cause double-jumping when landing. Always consume the jump buffer immediately after a successful jump and store only the most recent jump input, not a queue of multiple inputs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Variable Jump Without State Tracking**\nImplementing variable jump height without proper button state tracking can cause jumps to always use maximum height or fail to respond to button releases.

implements the collision detection and resolution system that prevents players from falling through platforms and enables interaction with game entities\n\nThink of collision detection as the **bouncer at a nightclub** - it constantly checks who's trying to enter restricted areas and enforces the rules. In our 2D platformer, the collision system serves as the bouncer between the physics simulation and the game world geometry, ensuring that entities respect solid boundaries while maintaining smooth, responsive movement. Unlike real-world physics where objects naturally can't occupy the same space, our digital entities can overlap freely unless we explicitly detect and resolve these intersections.\n\nThe collision system operates in two distinct phases: **detection** (finding overlaps) and **resolution** (separating overlapping objects). Detection answers \"are these two things touching?\" while resolution answers \"how do we move them apart?\" This separation of concerns allows us to handle complex scenarios where multiple collisions occur simultaneously, such as a player sliding into a corner between two tiles.\n\nModern 2D platformers have evolved sophisticated approaches to collision that prioritize gameplay feel over physical accuracy. The system must handle edge cases that rarely occur in real physics but are common in games: objects moving at high speeds, perfectly aligned rectangular boundaries, and the need for pixel-perfect precision. Our implementation will focus on **theatrical physics** - collision behavior that feels natural to players even when it bends the rules of reality.\n\n### AABB Collision Detection\n\n**Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection** forms the foundation of our collision system. Think of AABB as placing invisible rectangular boxes around every game object - if two boxes overlap, the objects inside them are colliding. The \"axis-aligned\" constraint means these boxes always align with the screen's X and Y axes, never rotating, which dramatically simplifies the mathematical calculations required for intersection testing.\n\nThe core insight behind AABB collision is that two rectangles overlap only when they overlap on **both** the X and Y axes simultaneously. If they're separated on either axis, there's no collision regardless of their position on the other axis. This allows us to break down the 2D intersection problem into two simpler 1D overlap tests, making the algorithm both efficient and easy to understand.\n\nOur collision detection system will represent every collidable entity as an `Entity` with position and dimensions that define its bounding box. The physics engine updates entity positions based on velocity and acceleration, while the collision system validates these new positions against the game world geometry. This creates a clear separation between \"where objects want to go\" (physics) and \"where they're allowed to go\" (collision).\n\n| AABB Properties | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------|-------------|\n| x | number | Left edge position in world coordinates |\n| y | number | Top edge position in world coordinates |\n| width | number | Horizontal extent of the bounding box |\n| height | number | Vertical extent of the bounding box |\n| right | number | Calculated as x + width, right edge position |\n| bottom | number | Calculated as y + height, bottom edge position |\n\nThe intersection test between two AABB rectangles requires checking overlap on both axes. For the X axis, we verify that the left edge of rectangle A is less than the right edge of rectangle B, and the right edge of A is greater than the left edge of B. The same logic applies to the Y axis with top and bottom edges. Only when both axes show overlap do we have a collision.\n\n> **Decision: Rectangle Intersection Algorithm**\n> - **Context**: Multiple algorithms exist for testing rectangle intersection, from simple bounds checking to more complex geometric approaches\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) for general polygon intersection\n>   - Point-in-rectangle testing with four corner checks  \n>   - Axis-aligned bounds comparison\n> - **Decision**: Use axis-aligned bounds comparison with explicit X and Y overlap tests\n> - **Rationale**: AABB bounds comparison provides O(1) constant-time intersection testing with minimal computational overhead. SAT is overkill for axis-aligned rectangles, while point-testing requires four separate calculations and can miss edge cases\n> - **Consequences**: Restricts us to axis-aligned collision boxes but provides maximum performance for the high-frequency collision testing required in real-time games\n\n| Algorithm Options | Pros | Cons |\n|-------------------|------|------|\n| Separating Axis Theorem | Handles rotated rectangles, mathematically robust | Computational overhead, unnecessary complexity for axis-aligned cases |\n| Point-in-Rectangle Testing | Intuitive to understand, works with any polygon | Requires 4+ tests per intersection, misses edge-touching cases |\n| Axis-Aligned Bounds | Constant-time O(1) performance, simple implementation | Limited to axis-aligned rectangles only |\n\nThe AABB intersection algorithm follows these steps:\n\n1. Extract the bounding coordinates from both rectangles, calculating right and bottom edges from position and dimensions\n2. Test X-axis overlap by verifying that A's left edge is less than B's right edge AND A's right edge is greater than B's left edge  \n3. Test Y-axis overlap using the same logic with top and bottom coordinates\n4. Return true only if both X and Y axes show overlap, indicating a collision\n5. Optionally calculate penetration depth on each axis for resolution purposes\n\nConsider a concrete example: Player rectangle at (100, 200) with dimensions (32, 48) colliding with a tile at (128, 200) with dimensions (32, 32). The player's right edge extends to 132, while the tile's left edge starts at 128. Since 132 > 128, there's X-axis overlap of 4 pixels. Both rectangles share the same Y coordinate with the player extending from 200 to 248 and the tile from 200 to 232, creating Y-axis overlap. The intersection test returns true, and we calculate 4 pixels of horizontal penetration for resolution.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Floating-Point Precision Errors**\nWhen working with pixel-perfect collision detection, floating-point arithmetic can introduce tiny rounding errors that cause objects to \"stick\" to surfaces or create micro-gaps. Always use a small **collision epsilon** value (typically 0.01 pixels) when comparing positions to account for floating-point imprecision. Instead of checking `if (player.x === tile.x)`, use `if (Math.abs(player.x - tile.x) < COLLISION_EPSILON)`.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Integer Coordinate Assumptions**\nMany developers assume game coordinates will always be integers, leading to truncation bugs when entities move with sub-pixel velocity. Always treat coordinates as floating-point numbers throughout the collision system, only rounding to integers during final rendering.\n\n### Collision Resolution\n\nOnce we've detected that two objects are overlapping, **collision resolution** determines how to separate them while maintaining realistic movement behavior. Think of resolution as an **undo button** - we need to back the objects out of their overlapping state while preserving as much of their intended motion as possible. The key insight is that we want to move objects the **minimum distance** necessary to eliminate the overlap, preventing unnecessary corrections that would make movement feel sluggish.\n\nThe critical design decision in collision resolution is whether to handle X and Y axes simultaneously or separately. Simultaneous resolution calculates the shortest vector to separate overlapping objects, while separate axis resolution handles horizontal and vertical collisions independently. Our platformer will use **separate axis resolution** because it produces more intuitive behavior for the rectangular, grid-aligned world typical of 2D platformers.\n\n> **Decision: Separate Axis Collision Resolution**\n> - **Context**: When a player moves diagonally into a corner, simultaneous resolution might push them at an unexpected angle, while separate resolution allows sliding along walls\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Simultaneous X/Y resolution using shortest separation vector\n>   - Separate X then Y resolution with fixed order\n>   - Separate resolution with velocity-based axis priority\n> - **Decision**: Separate X and Y resolution with velocity-based priority ordering\n> - **Rationale**: Separate resolution allows natural wall-sliding behavior essential for platformers. Velocity-based priority ensures the axis with greater movement gets resolved first, preventing corner-clipping artifacts\n> - **Consequences**: Enables smooth wall-sliding and corner navigation but requires careful ordering to prevent tunneling through thin walls\n\n| Resolution Approaches | Pros | Cons |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Simultaneous X/Y | Mathematically optimal separation distance | Can push player away from walls at unexpected angles |\n| Fixed Order Separate | Predictable, consistent behavior | May feel biased toward one axis over another |\n| Velocity-Priority Separate | Respects player's intended movement direction | Slightly more complex to implement |\n\nSeparate axis resolution works by handling X and Y collisions in sequence, typically processing the axis with greater velocity first. This priority system ensures that fast-moving objects don't get \"trapped\" by small corrections on the slower axis. The resolution process calculates the **penetration depth** on each axis - how far the objects have overlapped - then moves one or both objects back by this amount to eliminate the intersection.\n\nThe penetration depth calculation extracts overlap distances directly from the AABB intersection. For X-axis penetration, we compare how far the objects have pushed into each other's boundaries. If object A is moving right and penetrating object B, the penetration equals A's right edge minus B's left edge. The resolution then subtracts this penetration from A's X position, effectively \"backing it out\" of the collision.\n\n| Resolution Data | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------|-------------|\n| penetrationX | number | Horizontal overlap distance requiring correction |\n| penetrationY | number | Vertical overlap distance requiring correction |\n| separationX | number | Horizontal distance to move for resolution |\n| separationY | number | Vertical distance to move for resolution |\n| axisResolved | string | Which axis was processed ('x', 'y', or 'both') |\n| velocityAffected | boolean | Whether to zero velocity on resolved axis |\n\nThe step-by-step collision resolution process:\n\n1. Calculate penetration depth on both X and Y axes from the overlapping bounding boxes\n2. Determine axis priority based on the magnitude of velocity - resolve the faster-moving axis first\n3. For the primary axis, calculate the separation distance needed to eliminate overlap\n4. Move the moving object back by the separation distance, typically zeroing its velocity on that axis\n5. Recalculate bounding boxes after the first axis resolution\n6. Repeat the process for the secondary axis, handling any remaining overlap\n7. Update the entity's `onGround` state if vertical resolution occurred with downward velocity\n8. Apply any additional resolution effects like bounce or friction\n\nConsider a player moving diagonally down-right with velocity (150, 300) who contacts a tile corner. The Y-axis has greater velocity magnitude, so we resolve vertical collision first. The player penetrates 8 pixels into the tile's top edge, so we move the player up by 8 pixels and set velocityY to 0, marking them as `onGround = true`. Next, we resolve the X-axis penetration of 3 pixels by moving the player left and setting velocityX to 0. This creates the familiar \"slide along the wall\" behavior that players expect in platformers.\n\n> The key insight for collision resolution is that objects should lose velocity only on the axis where collision occurred. A player hitting a wall while falling should stop moving horizontally but continue falling vertically until they hit the ground.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resolution Order Dependencies**\nThe order of X and Y axis resolution can create different gameplay behaviors. Always resolve the axis with higher velocity first to prevent fast-moving objects from getting \"caught\" on corners. Inconsistent resolution ordering leads to unpredictable wall-sliding behavior.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Double Resolution**\nAfter resolving collision on one axis, always recalculate bounding boxes before testing the second axis. Failing to update positions between axis resolutions can cause objects to be \"over-corrected\" and pushed too far from collision boundaries.\n\n### Tile-based Collision\n\nTile-based collision detection leverages the grid structure of our game world to dramatically optimize collision testing performance. Instead of testing every entity against every tile in the level (which could be thousands of comparisons), we calculate exactly which tiles could potentially intersect with a moving entity and test only those candidates. Think of this as **spatial indexing** - we use the entity's position to look up relevant tiles in a 2D grid, reducing collision detection from O(n) linear search to O(1) constant-time lookup.\n\nThe tile-based approach represents the game world as a uniform grid where each cell is exactly `TILE_SIZE` pixels wide and tall. Each tile contains an ID that indicates its collision behavior: solid tiles block movement, empty tiles allow free passage, and special tiles like one-way platforms have conditional collision rules. This grid structure allows us to convert any world coordinate into tile grid coordinates using simple integer division, then look up the tile properties in constant time.\n\nOur collision system will need to test entities against multiple tiles simultaneously because entities can span tile boundaries. A 32-pixel-wide player positioned at X coordinate 48 will overlap both tile column 1 (pixels 32-63) and tile column 2 (pixels 64-95). The system must identify all potentially overlapping tiles and test each one for intersection.\n\n| Tile Collision Properties | Type | Description |\n|---------------------------|------|-------------|\n| tileID | number | Numeric identifier indicating tile behavior (0=empty, 1=solid, etc.) |\n| worldX | number | World coordinate of tile's left edge (tileX * TILE_SIZE) |\n| worldY | number | World coordinate of tile's top edge (tileY * TILE_SIZE) |\n| gridX | number | Grid column index in the tilemap array |\n| gridY | number | Grid row index in the tilemap array |\n| solid | boolean | Whether this tile blocks entity movement |\n| oneWay | boolean | Whether this tile only blocks movement from above |\n\nThe coordinate conversion between world pixels and tile grid indices requires careful handling of negative coordinates and boundary conditions. World coordinates can be negative (for levels that extend left of the origin), while tile grid indices must remain non-negative array indices. The conversion functions handle this mapping while ensuring entities can't access tiles outside the level boundaries.\n\n| Coordinate Conversion Methods | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| worldToGrid | x: number, y: number | {tileX: number, tileY: number} | Converts world pixel coordinates to tile grid indices |\n| gridToWorld | tileX: number, tileY: number | {x: number, y: number} | Converts tile grid indices to world pixel coordinates |\n| getTileAt | x: number, y: number | number | Returns tile ID at world coordinates, 0 if out of bounds |\n| getTileAtGrid | tileX: number, tileY: number | number | Returns tile ID at grid coordinates, 0 if out of bounds |\n| isTileSolid | tileX: number, tileY: number | boolean | Returns whether tile blocks movement |\n\nThe tile collision detection algorithm identifies the range of tiles that could potentially intersect with an entity's bounding box, then tests each candidate tile for AABB intersection. This **bounding box sweep** approach ensures we never miss collisions while minimizing the number of intersection tests performed.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-tile Collision Testing**\n> - **Context**: Entities larger than a single tile or positioned across tile boundaries can collide with multiple tiles simultaneously\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Test only the tile containing the entity's center point\n>   - Test all tiles within the entity's bounding box\n>   - Test tiles along the entity's movement path\n> - **Decision**: Test all tiles that intersect the entity's bounding box, expanded by velocity for fast-moving objects\n> - **Rationale**: Center-point testing misses collisions when entities span boundaries. Bounding box testing catches all potential collisions while movement path testing prevents tunneling at high velocities\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher computational cost but eliminates missed collisions and tunneling artifacts\n\nThe step-by-step tile collision process:\n\n1. Calculate the entity's expanded bounding box including its current position plus velocity vector\n2. Convert the expanded bounding box corners to tile grid coordinates using `worldToGrid`\n3. Iterate through all tiles within the grid coordinate range from top-left to bottom-right\n4. For each tile, check if its ID indicates solid collision geometry using `isTileSolid`\n5. Convert the tile's grid coordinates back to world coordinates to create its bounding box\n6. Perform AABB intersection test between the entity and tile bounding boxes\n7. If collision detected, add the tile to the collision results list with penetration information\n8. Sort collision results by penetration depth to resolve closest collisions first\n\nConsider a player at world position (100, 200) with dimensions (32, 48) moving with velocity (200, 0). The expanded bounding box extends from (100, 200) to (332, 248) to account for the rightward movement. Converting to tile coordinates: top-left tile is (3, 6) and bottom-right is (10, 7). The system tests tiles (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)...(10,7) for solid collision, finding a solid tile at (8,6) which converts to world coordinates (256, 192) with standard tile dimensions. The AABB test confirms intersection, and collision resolution prevents the player from moving through the wall.\n\n**One-way platforms** require special collision logic that allows entities to pass through from certain directions while blocking from others. Typically, one-way platforms block entities moving downward (falling onto the platform) but allow upward movement (jumping through from below). This creates the classic platformer behavior where players can jump up through platforms but land on top of them.\n\n| One-way Platform Logic | Current State | Movement Direction | Collision Result |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Player above platform | Moving down | Downward velocity | Block collision, land on platform |\n| Player below platform | Moving up | Upward velocity | Allow pass-through, no collision |\n| Player on platform | Moving down | Downward velocity + down input | Allow drop-through if down key held |\n| Player beside platform | Moving horizontally | Any horizontal velocity | Allow pass-through, no collision |\n\nThe one-way platform implementation modifies the standard collision detection by adding directional checks. Before resolving a collision with a one-way tile, the system examines the entity's velocity vector and position relative to the platform. Only downward-moving entities that approach from above trigger collision resolution, while all other movement directions pass through freely.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Tile Boundary Precision**\nWhen converting between world coordinates and tile indices, always use consistent rounding behavior. Mixing `Math.floor()`, `Math.round()`, and integer truncation can cause entities to \"skip over\" tiles at exact boundary positions. Use `Math.floor(worldX / TILE_SIZE)` consistently for grid conversion.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Out-of-Bounds Tile Access**\nAlways validate tile grid coordinates before accessing the tilemap array. Entities can move outside level boundaries, causing array index out-of-bounds errors. The `getTileAtGrid` function should return 0 (empty) for any coordinates outside the valid tilemap range.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: One-way Platform Edge Cases**\nOne-way platforms can create edge cases where fast-moving entities approach from the side at nearly horizontal angles. Always check both the entity's velocity direction AND its position relative to the platform center to determine collision behavior. An entity moving slightly downward while positioned beside the platform should pass through, not land on top.\n\n![Physics Update Flow](./diagrams/physics-update-flow.svg)\n\n![Collision Resolution Sequence](./diagrams/collision-resolution-sequence.svg)\n\n![Tile-based Collision System](./diagrams/tile-collision-grid.svg)\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe collision detection and resolution system requires careful coordination between multiple components to ensure accurate, performant collision testing.

implements player character, enemy AI, and interaction systems that bring the game world to life\n\nThink of the entity system as the **cast of characters** in our platformer theater. Just as a stage production has different types of actors with distinct roles and behaviors - the protagonist, the antagonists, and the supporting cast - our entity system manages the player character, enemies, and their interactions. Each entity is like an actor with their own script (behavior), costume (visual representation), and stage directions (movement patterns), but they all share the same stage (physics world) and must follow the same fundamental rules of the theater (physics and collision systems).\n\nThe entity system serves as the bridge between the abstract physics simulation and the concrete game experience. While the physics engine deals with velocities and forces, the entity system translates these into meaningful game concepts like \"the player jumps,\" \"the enemy patrols,\" or \"the player defeats an enemy by stomping.\" This layer of abstraction allows us to create rich, interactive gameplay while maintaining clean separation between game logic and physics simulation.\n\n### Player Entity\n\nThe player entity represents the user's avatar in the game world and serves as the primary interface between human input and game physics. Think of the player entity as a **marionette puppet** - the input system pulls the strings (keyboard presses), the entity translates these into intentions (jump, move left, move right), and the physics system makes the puppet dance (applies forces and resolves collisions). The player entity must maintain awareness of its own state to make intelligent decisions about what actions are possible at any given moment.\n\n> **Decision: Extended Entity Architecture for Player**\n> - **Context**: The player needs capabilities beyond basic physics entities, including health, special movement states, and checkpoint tracking\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Monolithic player class with all functionality\n>   2. Component-based entity with attachable behaviors\n>   3. Inheritance-based extension of base Entity class\n> - **Decision**: Inheritance-based extension with specialized player properties\n> - **Rationale**: Provides clear player-specific functionality while maintaining physics compatibility, simpler than component system for this scope\n> - **Consequences**: Player entity can leverage all base Entity physics while adding game-specific features like health and respawn management\n\nThe `Player` entity extends the base `Entity` with additional properties that track game-specific state. The health system provides a simple life mechanism, while the invulnerability timer prevents rapid repeated damage. The checkpoint coordinates store the player's respawn location, updated whenever the player reaches a new checkpoint. The coyote timer and jump buffer implement the responsive jump mechanics that make platformer controls feel precise and forgiving.\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| health | number | Player's remaining lives, decremented on enemy contact |\n| coyoteTimer | number | Remaining time (seconds) player can jump after leaving ground |\n| jumpBuffer | number | Remaining time (seconds) jump input is remembered before landing |\n| invulnerabilityTimer | number | Remaining time (seconds) player cannot take damage after being hit |\n| checkpointX | number | X coordinate of last activated checkpoint for respawn |\n| checkpointY | number | Y coordinate of last activated checkpoint for respawn |\n\nThe player's update logic follows a carefully orchestrated sequence that prioritizes input responsiveness while maintaining physics consistency. The player entity processes input first to capture player intentions, then applies physics updates to translate intentions into movement, and finally updates special timers that affect future input processing.\n\n**Player Update Algorithm:**\n1. **Decrement Special Timers**: Reduce coyoteTimer, jumpBuffer, and invulnerabilityTimer by deltaTime, clamping to zero\n2. **Process Horizontal Input**: Check left/right input and apply horizontal acceleration based on ground friction or air control\n3. **Process Jump Input**: If jump pressed, check conditions (onGround OR coyoteTimer > 0) and apply upward velocity impulse\n4. **Update Jump Buffer**: If jump pressed but conditions not met, set jumpBuffer to buffer duration for future use\n5. **Handle Variable Jump Height**: If jump button released while moving upward, reduce upward velocity for shorter jump\n6. **Apply Coyote Time**: If player leaves ground (onGround becomes false), start coyoteTimer countdown\n7. **Apply Jump Buffer**: If player lands (onGround becomes true) and jumpBuffer > 0, execute buffered jump\n8. **Call Parent Update**: Invoke base Entity.update() to apply physics simulation and collision resolution\n\nThe coyote time mechanism requires careful timing coordination. When the player walks off a platform, the physics system sets `onGround` to false, but the player entity immediately starts the coyote timer. During this grace period, jump input still triggers a jump as if the player were on solid ground. This creates the illusion that the player can jump slightly after leaving a platform, which feels more responsive than strict physical accuracy would allow.\n\n> The critical insight for coyote time is that it's implemented as a **retroactive permission system**. The player has already left the ground (physics reality), but we temporarily pretend they haven't (gameplay reality) to improve the feel of controls.\n\nJump buffering works in the opposite temporal direction - it remembers future intentions rather than past permissions. When the player presses jump while airborne, the input is stored in the jumpBuffer timer. When the player subsequently lands, the buffered input is immediately consumed and executed. This prevents the frustration of pressing jump just before landing and having the input ignored.\n\n**Player State Management:**\n\n| Current State | Input Event | Physics Condition | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|\n| Grounded | Jump pressed | onGround = true | Jumping | Apply upward velocity impulse, consume jump input |\n| Grounded | Walk off edge | onGround = false | Falling | Start coyoteTimer countdown |\n| Falling | Jump pressed | coyoteTimer > 0 | Jumping | Apply upward velocity impulse, reset coyoteTimer |\n| Falling | Jump pressed | coyoteTimer = 0 | Falling | Store input in jumpBuffer |\n| Jumping | Jump released | velocityY < 0 | Falling | Reduce upward velocity for variable jump height |\n| Any | Enemy contact | invulnerabilityTimer = 0 | Dead | Decrement health, start invulnerability period |\n| Dead | Health > 0 | - | Grounded | Respawn at checkpoint coordinates |\n\nThe player's collision response must differentiate between different types of contact. Collision with solid tiles triggers standard physics resolution, while collision with enemies triggers the damage system. The direction of enemy collision determines the outcome - contact from above allows the player to defeat the enemy (stomping), while contact from the sides damages the player.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Player Implementation:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Coyote Time Duration Too Long**\nSetting coyote time longer than 150ms makes the game feel floaty and unrealistic, as players can jump long after visibly leaving a platform. Keep coyote time between 100-120ms for responsive but believable controls.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Jump Buffer Consumed Incorrectly**\nFailing to consume the jump buffer when a jump is executed leads to multiple unintended jumps when landing. Always reset jumpBuffer to 0 when a buffered jump is triggered.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Invulnerability Timer Not Checked**\nForgetting to check invulnerabilityTimer before applying damage allows rapid damage from the same enemy. Always verify invulnerabilityTimer equals 0 before decrementing health.\n\n### Enemy AI System\n\nEnemy entities provide dynamic obstacles and challenges that react to the player's presence and movement. Think of enemy AI as **simple clockwork mechanisms** - each enemy follows a predictable pattern that the player can learn and exploit, much like the mechanical obstacles in classic arcade games. The AI doesn't need to be sophisticated to be effective; consistent, readable behavior often creates more engaging gameplay than complex, unpredictable AI.\n\n> **Decision: Patrol-Based AI Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Enemies need autonomous movement that creates obstacles without overwhelming complexity\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. State machine-based AI with multiple behaviors\n>   2. Simple waypoint patrol system\n>   3. Player-following AI with pathfinding\n> - **Decision**: Simple waypoint patrol system with collision-based direction reversal\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable, learnable enemy behavior that's easy to implement and debug, sufficient challenge for platformer gameplay\n> - **Consequences**: Enables consistent enemy behavior patterns that players can master, avoids complex pathfinding implementation\n\nThe enemy AI system uses a straightforward patrol mechanism where each enemy moves between two defined waypoints, reversing direction when reaching a boundary. This creates predictable movement patterns that players can observe, learn, and time their movements around. The simplicity of the system makes enemy behavior consistent and debuggable while still providing meaningful gameplay challenges.\n\nEnemy entities inherit from the base `Entity` class but add AI-specific properties for patrol behavior. The patrol system defines two waypoints that the enemy moves between, along with movement speed and direction tracking. The AI state tracks whether the enemy is moving left or right, and collision detection with level boundaries triggers direction reversal.\n\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| patrolStartX | number | Left boundary X coordinate for patrol movement |\n| patrolEndX | number | Right boundary X coordinate for patrol movement |\n| patrolSpeed | number | Horizontal movement speed in pixels per second |\n| movingRight | boolean | Current movement direction, true for rightward movement |\n| health | number | Enemy health points, typically 1 for simple enemies |\n| defeated | boolean | Whether enemy has been defeated by player stomping |\n\nThe enemy update algorithm prioritizes collision detection and boundary checking to prevent enemies from walking off platforms or getting stuck in walls. Unlike the player entity, enemies don't process input, but they must make autonomous decisions about movement direction based on their environment.\n\n**Enemy AI Update Algorithm:**\n1. **Check Patrol Boundaries**: Compare current X position with patrolStartX and patrolEndX boundaries\n2. **Reverse Direction if Needed**: If at or beyond boundary, set movingRight to opposite value\n3. **Calculate Movement Velocity**: Set velocityX based on patrolSpeed and movingRight direction\n4. **Check Ground Ahead**: Verify solid ground exists in movement direction to prevent walking off platforms\n5. **Apply Movement**: Set horizontal velocity for physics system to process\n6. **Call Parent Update**: Invoke base Entity.update() for physics simulation and collision resolution\n7. **Update Animation**: Select appropriate sprite frame based on movement direction\n\nThe ground detection system prevents enemies from walking off platforms by checking for solid tiles in the movement direction. Before committing to movement, the enemy AI projects the position one tile ahead and verifies that solid ground exists. If no ground is detected, the enemy reverses direction as if it had hit an invisible wall at the platform edge.\n\nGround detection requires coordination with the tile-based collision system. The enemy queries the level's tile map to check for solid tiles at the projected position. This look-ahead approach prevents the enemy from taking a step that would result in falling off the platform.\n\n**Ground Detection Logic:**\n1. **Calculate Look-Ahead Position**: Add (movement direction × tile size) to current position\n2. **Convert to Tile Coordinates**: Use worldToGrid() to convert pixel position to tile indices  \n3. **Check Ground Tile**: Query tile at (lookAheadX, entityY + entityHeight + 1) position\n4. **Verify Solidity**: Use isTileSolid() to confirm the tile provides solid ground support\n5. **Make Direction Decision**: If no solid ground found, reverse movingRight flag\n\nThe enemy AI state machine handles the simple patrol behavior with direction reversal logic:\n\n| Current State | Trigger Condition | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|--------------|-------------------|------------|---------------|\n| Moving Right | X position ≥ patrolEndX | Moving Left | Set movingRight = false, velocityX = -patrolSpeed |\n| Moving Right | No ground ahead | Moving Left | Set movingRight = false, velocityX = -patrolSpeed |  \n| Moving Left | X position ≤ patrolStartX | Moving Right | Set movingRight = true, velocityX = patrolSpeed |\n| Moving Left | No ground ahead | Moving Right | Set movingRight = true, velocityX = patrolSpeed |\n| Any State | Player stomp collision | Defeated | Set defeated = true, remove from active entities |\n\nEnemy collision detection must distinguish between different types of contact with the player. Side collisions typically damage the player, while top collisions (stomping) defeat the enemy. The collision system determines the contact direction based on the relative positions and velocities of the entities at the moment of collision.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Enemy AI Implementation:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: No Ground Detection**\nEnemies without look-ahead ground detection will walk off platforms and fall indefinitely. Always check for solid ground in the movement direction before committing to movement.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Boundary Detection Off-by-One**\nUsing strict equality (position === boundary) for boundary detection can cause enemies to overshoot boundaries due to floating-point movement. Use (position >= boundary) for right boundaries and (position <= boundary) for left boundaries.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Infinite Direction Reversal**  \nEnemies can get stuck rapidly switching directions if boundary and ground detection both trigger simultaneously. Prioritize boundary detection over ground detection to avoid oscillation.\n\n### Entity Interactions\n\nEntity interactions define how different game objects affect each other when they come into contact. Think of entity interactions as **collision choreography** - different combinations of entities perform different \"dance moves\" when they meet. A player-enemy collision might be a combat sequence, while a player-checkpoint collision is more like a handshake that saves progress.\n\nThe interaction system builds on top of the collision detection to add semantic meaning to physical contact. While collision detection answers \"did these objects touch?\", the interaction system answers \"what happens when they touch?\" This separation allows the same collision detection code to support multiple types of meaningful interactions.\n\n> **Decision: Direction-Based Interaction Classification**\n> - **Context**: Player-enemy collisions need different outcomes based on contact direction (stomp vs. damage)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single interaction type with random outcomes\n>   2. Direction-based interaction with collision vector analysis  \n>   3. Separate collision boxes for different interaction types\n> - **Decision**: Direction-based interaction using collision vector analysis\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable interaction outcomes that match player expectations from classic platformers, allows single collision system to handle multiple interaction types\n> - **Consequences**: Enables skill-based enemy interaction where player positioning determines outcome, requires precise collision direction detection\n\nThe interaction system analyzes collision vectors to determine the primary direction of contact between entities. This directional analysis enables the same collision between player and enemy to produce different outcomes - stomping when approached from above, or damage when contacted from the side.\n\nCollision direction detection compares the relative positions and velocities of colliding entities at the moment of impact. The system calculates the collision vector (the direction from one entity's center to the other's center) and determines whether the collision occurred primarily along the vertical or horizontal axis.\n\n**Collision Direction Analysis Algorithm:**\n1. **Calculate Entity Centers**: Determine center points for both colliding entities\n2. **Compute Collision Vector**: Calculate direction vector from entity A center to entity B center  \n3. **Analyze Vector Components**: Compare absolute values of X and Y components of collision vector\n4. **Determine Primary Axis**: If |vectorX| > |vectorY|, collision is horizontal; otherwise vertical\n5. **Determine Direction**: For vertical collisions, check if player is above or below enemy\n6. **Classify Interaction Type**: Map direction to interaction outcome (stomp, damage, etc.)\n\nThe interaction classification produces different outcomes based on the collision analysis:\n\n| Collision Direction | Player Velocity | Enemy State | Interaction Result |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| From Above | velocityY > 0 (falling) | Active | Player stomps enemy - enemy defeated, player bounces |\n| From Above | velocityY ≤ 0 | Active | Regular damage - player takes damage |\n| From Side | Any | Active | Player takes damage, knockback applied |\n| From Below | velocityY < 0 (rising) | Active | Player takes damage, stops upward movement |\n| Any Direction | Any | Defeated | No interaction - enemy already defeated |\n\nThe stomping mechanism requires precise timing and positioning detection. A successful stomp occurs when the player contacts the enemy from above while falling (positive Y velocity). This creates skill-based gameplay where players can defeat enemies by timing their jumps correctly, but mistimed approaches result in taking damage.\n\nWhen a successful stomp is detected, the interaction system applies several effects simultaneously. The enemy is marked as defeated and removed from active collision detection. The player receives an upward velocity boost (bounce effect) that provides feedback for the successful action and can be chained for advanced movement techniques.\n\n**Player-Enemy Interaction Effects:**\n\n| Interaction Type | Player Effects | Enemy Effects | Physics Effects |\n|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Successful Stomp | +100 upward velocity bounce | Mark defeated, remove from world | Player maintains horizontal momentum |\n| Side Damage | -1 health, start invulnerability | Continue normal patrol | Apply knockback velocity to player |\n| Damage During Invulnerability | No effect | Continue normal patrol | No physics changes |\n\nThe interaction system must coordinate with the player's invulnerability timer to prevent repeated damage from the same enemy. When damage is applied, the invulnerabilityTimer is set to a brief duration (typically 1-2 seconds) during which additional damage interactions are ignored. This prevents rapid health loss from continuous contact with an enemy.\n\nPlayer respawn interactions with the checkpoint system provide a safety net for failed encounters. When player health reaches zero, the death interaction triggers a respawn sequence that resets the player's position to the last activated checkpoint coordinates and restores health to the starting value.\n\n**Respawn Interaction Sequence:**\n1. **Detect Death Condition**: Check if player health ≤ 0 after damage application\n2. **Trigger Death State**: Set player state to dead, disable collision detection temporarily  \n3. **Apply Respawn Delay**: Brief pause (0.5-1.0 seconds) for visual feedback\n4. **Reset Player Position**: Move player to (checkpointX, checkpointY) coordinates\n5. **Restore Player State**: Reset health to maximum, clear velocity, reset timers\n6. **Reactivate Player**: Re-enable collision detection and input processing\n\nCheckpoint activation requires a separate interaction type that updates the respawn coordinates without affecting player health or physics. When the player contacts a checkpoint entity, the checkpoint system updates the stored respawn coordinates and typically provides visual feedback (animation, sound) to confirm activation.\n\n**Common Pitfalls in Interaction Implementation:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Stomp Detection**\nUsing only position comparison without velocity checking can cause stomps to trigger when jumping into an enemy from the side. Always verify player has positive Y velocity (falling) for stomp detection.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Invulnerability Check**  \nApplying damage without checking invulnerabilityTimer causes rapid health loss from continuous enemy contact.

The tilemap is like the physical set pieces that actors (entities) can walk on, jump over, and interact with. The checkpoint system acts like **scene markers** that allow the director to restart from specific points when something goes wrong. Just as a theater set must be carefully designed with walkable platforms, proper sight lines, and safety considerations, our level system must efficiently handle collision geometry, visual rendering, and player state management.\n\nThe level system serves as the foundational layer that defines the game world's physical structure and provides the spatial context for all gameplay interactions. Unlike entity-based objects that move and respond to physics, the level represents static environmental geometry that entities collide with and navigate around. This system must efficiently handle potentially thousands of tiles while providing fast collision queries and supporting various gameplay mechanics like one-way platforms and environmental hazards.\n\n### Tilemap Loading\n\nLoading level data transforms abstract level definitions into interactive game environments with collision geometry. Think of this process as **constructing a building from architectural blueprints** - the level file contains the design specifications, but the loading system must interpret those specifications and construct the actual collision boundaries, visual representation, and spatial indexing structures that the game engine can efficiently query during runtime.\n\nThe tilemap loading process involves three distinct phases: **data parsing** (reading level files and interpreting tile definitions), **geometry construction** (converting tile IDs into collision boundaries), and **spatial indexing** (organizing tiles for efficient collision queries). Each phase must handle potential errors gracefully while providing clear feedback when level data is malformed or incompatible.\n\nLevel data can originate from multiple sources depending on the development workflow. Hand-authored JSON files provide precise control and easy version control integration. Visual level editors like Tiled generate standardized formats with rich metadata support. Procedural generation systems create level data algorithmically based on parameters and rules. Our loading system must accommodate these different sources while providing a consistent internal representation.\n\n> **Decision: JSON-based Level Format**\n> - **Context**: Level designers need a format that supports version control, manual editing, and tool integration while remaining human-readable for debugging\n> - **Options Considered**: Binary formats (fast loading, compact), XML (verbose but standardized), JSON (readable, widely supported), Custom text format (domain-specific)\n> - **Decision**: JSON format with standardized schema for tile data, entity placement, and metadata\n> - **Rationale**: JSON provides the best balance of readability, tool support, and parsing simplicity. Version control systems handle JSON well, and the format supports nested metadata for complex tile properties\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly larger file sizes than binary formats, but negligible for typical 2D platformer levels. Parsing overhead is minimal compared to asset loading\n\n| Level Format Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|---------------------|------|------|---------|\n| JSON | Human-readable, version control friendly, wide tool support, easy debugging | Larger file size, parsing overhead | ✓ Yes |\n| Binary | Compact, fast loading, efficient storage | Not human-readable, harder to debug, requires custom tools | No |\n| XML | Standardized, schema validation, tool support | Verbose, complex parsing, large file size | No |\n| Custom Text | Domain-optimized, minimal syntax | Requires custom parser, limited tool support | No |\n\nThe level file schema defines the structure and metadata required for complete level reconstruction. The schema must capture not only tile placement but also entity spawn points, checkpoint locations, collision properties, and visual layer information. Extensible metadata support allows for future features like animated tiles, trigger zones, and environmental effects without breaking backward compatibility.\n\n| Level Schema Field | Type | Description |\n|-------------------|------|-------------|\n| `version` | string | Schema version for compatibility checking |\n| `name` | string | Human-readable level identifier |\n| `width` | number | Level width in tiles |\n| `height` | number | Level height in tiles |\n| `tileSize` | number | Pixel dimensions of each tile (typically 32) |\n| `tiles` | number[][] | 2D array of tile IDs, indexed as `tiles[y][x]` |\n| `tileProperties` | object | Mapping of tile IDs to collision and visual properties |\n| `entities` | object[] | Entity spawn definitions with type, position, and parameters |\n| `checkpoints` | object[] | Checkpoint locations with position and activation requirements |\n| `backgroundLayers` | object[] | Visual background layers for parallax scrolling |\n| `metadata` | object | Level-specific configuration and custom properties |\n\nTile properties define the behavior and appearance characteristics of each tile type. The properties system must support both common attributes (solid collision, one-way platforms, visual sprites) and extensible custom properties for specialized gameplay mechanics. This design allows level designers to create rich, interactive environments without requiring code changes for each new tile type.\n\n| Tile Property | Type | Description |\n|--------------|------|-------------|\n| `solid` | boolean | Whether entities collide with this tile |\n| `oneWay` | boolean | Allows upward passage but blocks downward movement |\n| `hazard` | boolean | Damages player on contact |\n| `sprite` | string | Sprite asset identifier for rendering |\n| `animation` | object | Frame sequence and timing for animated tiles |\n| `friction` | number | Surface friction coefficient for entity movement |\n| `metadata` | object | Custom properties for specialized tile behavior |\n\nThe loading process transforms raw level data into optimized runtime structures. **Validation** ensures that all referenced assets exist and tile coordinates remain within bounds. **Optimization** pre-computes collision boundaries and spatial indices to accelerate runtime queries. **Error handling** provides clear diagnostics when level data is malformed or when required assets are missing.\n\n**Tilemap Loading Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Parse level file** and validate JSON schema compliance, checking for required fields and proper data types\n2. **Validate dimensions** ensuring width and height are positive integers and that the tiles array matches declared dimensions\n3. **Validate tile references** confirming that all tile IDs in the tiles array have corresponding entries in tileProperties\n4. **Load tile assets** and verify that all referenced sprites and animations exist in the asset management system\n5. **Construct collision grid** by iterating through the tiles array and marking solid tiles in a spatial hash map\n6. **Build one-way platform index** creating a separate lookup table for tiles that support upward passage\n7. **Initialize entity spawn points** by processing the entities array and creating spawn definitions for runtime instantiation\n8. **Set up checkpoint system** by registering checkpoint locations and initializing activation state tracking\n9. **Cache spatial queries** by pre-computing tile boundary rectangles and organizing them in a spatial grid for efficient collision detection\n10. **Validate level completability** by running pathfinding checks to ensure the player can reach all required areas\n\n> The critical insight for tilemap loading is that **preprocessing during load time dramatically improves runtime performance**. While it's tempting to keep level files minimal and compute everything at runtime, pre-computing collision boundaries, spatial indices, and tile properties during loading eliminates thousands of repeated calculations during gameplay.\n\n**Coordinate System Management** handles the conversion between different spatial representations used throughout the level system. **World coordinates** represent absolute pixel positions in the game world. **Grid coordinates** represent tile positions in the level array. **Screen coordinates** represent pixel positions relative to the camera viewport. Efficient conversion between these coordinate systems is essential for fast collision detection and rendering.\n\n| Coordinate Conversion Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|----------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `worldToGrid(x, y)` | x: number, y: number | object: {tileX, tileY} | Converts world pixel coordinates to tile grid indices |\n| `gridToWorld(tileX, tileY)` | tileX: number, tileY: number | object: {x, y} | Converts tile grid indices to world pixel coordinates |\n| `getTileAt(x, y)` | x: number, y: number | number | Returns tile ID at world coordinates, handling bounds checking |\n| `getTileAtGrid(tileX, tileY)` | tileX: number, tileY: number | number | Returns tile ID at grid coordinates with bounds validation |\n| `isTileSolid(tileX, tileY)` | tileX: number, tileY: number | boolean | Checks if tile at grid position blocks entity movement |\n\n![Tile-based Collision System](./diagrams/tile-collision-grid.svg)\n\n**Collision Geometry Construction** converts the abstract tile grid into concrete collision boundaries that the physics engine can process. Rather than testing collision against individual tile rectangles, the system pre-computes **merged collision regions** where adjacent solid tiles combine into larger rectangular boundaries. This optimization reduces the number of collision tests required and eliminates edge cases where entities might catch on tile boundaries.\n\nThe geometry construction process identifies connected regions of solid tiles and generates minimal bounding rectangles that encompass each region. **One-way platforms** require special handling since they only block movement from specific directions. The system maintains separate collision layers for different tile types, allowing the collision resolution system to apply appropriate response logic based on the collision type.\n\n**Error Handling and Validation** ensures that malformed level data fails gracefully with clear diagnostic information. The loading system must detect and report common authoring errors like missing assets, invalid tile references, unreachable areas, and malformed JSON structure. Validation occurs at multiple stages: **syntax validation** during JSON parsing, **schema validation** against the level format specification, and **semantic validation** checking for logical consistency and asset availability.\n\n| Error Condition | Detection Method | Recovery Strategy |\n|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Malformed JSON | JSON.parse() exception | Display syntax error with line number, fall back to empty level |\n| Missing tile assets | Asset loading failure | Substitute placeholder sprites, log warning with missing asset names |\n| Invalid tile IDs | Array bounds checking | Replace invalid IDs with empty tiles (ID 0), log validation warnings |\n| Unreachable areas | Pathfinding analysis | Report accessibility warnings, continue loading with degraded functionality |\n| Dimension mismatch | Array length validation | Resize tiles array to match declared dimensions, padding with empty tiles |\n\n### Checkpoint System\n\nThe checkpoint system provides **save points** where players can respawn after death or failure. Think of checkpoints as **bookmarks in an adventure novel** - they mark significant progress points and allow readers to resume from meaningful locations rather than starting over from the beginning. Just as bookmarks must be placed at chapter breaks rather than mid-sentence, checkpoints must be positioned at safe, logical locations where respawning feels natural and fair.\n\nCheckpoints serve multiple gameplay functions beyond simple respawn points. They **segment difficulty** by breaking challenging sections into manageable chunks. They **preserve progress** by ensuring players don't lose significant advancement due to temporary failure. They **provide pacing control** by giving players moments to rest and prepare for upcoming challenges. The checkpoint system must balance **player convenience** with **challenge preservation** - checkpoints should reduce frustration without eliminating meaningful consequences for failure.\n\nThe checkpoint system operates through three core mechanics: **activation** (marking checkpoints as available for respawn), **state management** (tracking which checkpoints are active and which is most recently used), and **respawn handling** (restoring player state and position when death occurs). Each mechanic must integrate cleanly with the broader game state management system while providing reliable, predictable behavior.\n\n> **Decision: Automatic Checkpoint Activation**\n> - **Context**: Players need clear feedback when progress is saved, but manual activation interrupts gameplay flow\n> - **Options Considered**: Manual activation (player presses button), Proximity activation (automatic when nearby), Triggered activation (automatic after completing challenges), Hybrid activation (automatic with manual override)\n> - **Decision**: Proximity-based automatic activation with visual and audio feedback\n> - **Rationale**: Automatic activation eliminates the risk of players forgetting to save progress, while proximity detection ensures activation occurs at the intended moment. Visual feedback provides clear confirmation without requiring additional input\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful checkpoint placement to avoid premature activation, but eliminates player error and maintains smooth gameplay flow\n\n| Checkpoint Activation Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|----------------------------|------|------|---------|\n| Manual (button press) | Player control, explicit confirmation, works in any location | Requires extra input, players may forget, interrupts flow | No |\n| Proximity (automatic when near) | Seamless integration, no player error, clear trigger point | Requires careful placement, may activate prematurely | ✓ Yes |\n| Triggered (after completing sections) | Rewards progress, natural pacing | Complex logic, may not match player expectations | No |\n| Hybrid (automatic with override) | Best of both worlds | Complex implementation, potential confusion | No |\n\n**Checkpoint Data Structure** defines the information required for each checkpoint in the level. Beyond basic position data, checkpoints store **activation state**, **unlock conditions**, and **metadata** for visual and audio presentation. The data structure must support both static checkpoints defined in level files and dynamic checkpoints created at runtime based on gameplay events.\n\n| Checkpoint Field | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | string | Unique identifier for this checkpoint within the level |\n| `x` | number | World X coordinate for player respawn position |\n| `y` | number | World Y coordinate for player respawn position |\n| `activated` | boolean | Whether this checkpoint is available for respawn |\n| `isActive` | boolean | Whether this is the currently selected respawn point |\n| `unlockConditions` | object[] | Requirements that must be met before activation |\n| `activationRadius` | number | Distance from checkpoint center that triggers activation |\n| `visualState` | string | Current visual representation ('inactive', 'activating', 'active') |\n| `lastActivationTime` | number | Timestamp when checkpoint was last activated |\n| `metadata` | object | Custom properties for specialized checkpoint behavior |\n\n**Checkpoint Activation Logic** handles the transition from inactive to active state when players approach or meet unlock conditions. The activation process involves **proximity detection** (checking if the player is within the activation radius), **condition validation** (ensuring all unlock requirements are satisfied), **state updates** (marking the checkpoint as activated and deactivating previous checkpoints), and **feedback presentation** (triggering visual and audio effects to confirm activation).\n\nProximity detection uses efficient **bounding circle collision** to determine when the player enters the checkpoint's activation radius. The system must account for the player's movement velocity to ensure activation occurs reliably even when moving at high speed. **Hysteresis** prevents activation flickering by using slightly different radii for activation and deactivation.\n\n**Checkpoint State Management** tracks the activation status of all checkpoints in the current level and maintains references to the most recently activated checkpoint for respawn purposes. The state manager handles **checkpoint precedence** (later checkpoints typically override earlier ones), **save persistence** (storing checkpoint progress across game sessions), and **level transitions** (preserving checkpoint state when moving between levels).\n\n| Checkpoint State Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|------------------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `activateCheckpoint(checkpointId)` | checkpointId: string | boolean | Activates specified checkpoint and deactivates others |\n| `getActiveCheckpoint()` | none | object | Returns currently active checkpoint data |\n| `isCheckpointUnlocked(checkpointId)` | checkpointId: string | boolean | Checks if checkpoint meets unlock conditions |\n| `updateProximity(playerX, playerY)` | playerX: number, playerY: number | none | Checks for checkpoint activation based on player position |\n| `resetCheckpoints()` | none | none | Deactivates all checkpoints, typically used when restarting level |\n\n**Respawn Mechanics** handle the restoration of player state when death or failure occurs. The respawn process involves **position restoration** (moving the player to the active checkpoint location), **state reset** (restoring health, removing temporary effects, clearing input buffers), **world state management** (handling enemy respawning and environmental resets), and **transition effects** (providing visual feedback during the respawn process).\n\nPlayer state restoration must carefully balance **progress preservation** with **challenge reset**. Core progress like checkpoint activation and key collection should persist through respawn, while temporary advantages like power-ups and invulnerability states should reset. The system must also handle **cascading resets** where respawning affects other game systems like enemy positions and environmental hazards.\n\n**Respawn Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Validate active checkpoint** ensuring that a valid respawn point exists and is accessible\n2. **Store pre-death state** preserving any progress elements that should survive respawn\n3. **Reset player entity** clearing velocity, removing temporary effects, and restoring base health\n4. **Position player** moving the player entity to the active checkpoint coordinates with safe placement\n5. **Reset world state** respawning enemies, resetting environmental hazards, and clearing temporary entities\n6. **Restore persistent progress** reapplying collected items, activated switches, and unlocked areas\n7. **Clear input buffers** removing any queued input events that might affect the respawned player\n8. **Trigger respawn effects** playing sound effects, visual transitions, and temporary invulnerability\n9. **Update camera** smoothly transitioning the camera to focus on the respawned player position\n10. **Resume gameplay** returning control to the player after respawn effects complete\n\n**Unlock Conditions** allow checkpoints to remain inactive until players meet specific requirements. Common unlock conditions include **item collection** (requiring specific keys or power-ups), **enemy defeat** (clearing all enemies in an area), **switch activation** (triggering environmental mechanisms), and **area completion** (reaching specific locations or solving puzzles). The condition system uses **event subscription** to automatically check conditions when relevant game state changes occur.\n\n| Unlock Condition Type | Parameters | Description |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------|\n| `item_collected` | itemId: string, count: number | Requires player to collect specified items |\n| `enemies_defeated` | areaId: string, enemyTypes: string[] | Requires elimination of specified enemies in area |\n| `switch_activated` | switchIds: string[] | Requires activation of environmental switches |\n| `area_reached` | locationId: string | Requires player to visit specific location |\n| `time_elapsed` | duration: number | Requires minimum time since level start |\n| `score_achieved` | targetScore: number | Requires minimum score accumulation |\n\n**Visual and Audio Feedback** provides clear communication about checkpoint status and activation events. **Inactive checkpoints** display subtle indicators that they exist but are not yet functional. **Activating checkpoints** play prominent animation and sound effects to clearly communicate when progress is saved. **Active checkpoints** maintain visual distinction to help players identify their current respawn point.\n\nThe feedback system must be **immediately recognizable** to avoid confusion about save status. **Color coding** uses consistent visual language across all checkpoints. **Animation timing** ensures effects are noticeable without being disruptive. **Audio design** uses distinctive sounds that clearly communicate successful activation versus failed attempts.\n\n> **Common Pitfalls in Checkpoint Systems**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Checkpoint Placement Too Close to Hazards**\nPlacing checkpoints immediately adjacent to dangerous areas can create **death loops** where players respawn directly into harm's way. This occurs when checkpoint activation radius extends into hazard zones, or when environmental dangers (falling objects, moving platforms) can reach the respawn position. Always ensure checkpoints provide **safe zones** with sufficient buffer space and escape routes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Activation Feedback**\nPlayers become confused when checkpoint activation uses inconsistent visual or audio cues. Some checkpoints might activate silently while others play dramatic effects, or visual indicators might vary between similar checkpoint types. Establish **standardized feedback patterns** and apply them consistently across all checkpoints to build reliable player expectations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: State Reset Ambiguity**\nPlayers expect consistent rules about what persists through respawn versus what resets. Inconsistent behavior where some progress is lost unpredictably while other progress is preserved creates frustration and breaks player trust. **Document and enforce clear rules** about what survives respawn, and consider providing in-game indicators for temporary versus persistent progress.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Checkpoint Activation Race Conditions**\nWhen multiple checkpoints exist in close proximity, players might activate them in unexpected orders or trigger multiple activations simultaneously. This can lead to **state corruption** where the active checkpoint becomes unclear or where activation effects interfere with each other. Implement **activation prioritization** and **temporal cooldowns** to prevent conflicting checkpoint interactions.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Level File Format | JSON with fs.readFileSync | JSON Schema validation with ajv |\n| Asset Loading | Direct file path references | Asset manifest with dependency tracking |\n| Spatial Indexing | Simple 2D array lookup | Quadtree or spatial hash grid |\n| Checkpoint Persistence | localStorage for web, JSON files for desktop | IndexedDB for web, SQLite for desktop |\n| Animation System | CSS transitions for DOM, manual tweening for canvas | Dedicated animation library (GreenSock, Tween.js) |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n  level/\n    LevelLoader.js           ← Main level loading and management\n    TileMap.js              ← Tile-based collision and rendering\n    CheckpointManager.js    ← Checkpoint activation and respawn\n    CoordinateConverter.js  ← World/grid coordinate transformations\n  assets/\n    levels/\n      level1.json           ← Level data files\n      level2.json\n    sprites/\n      tiles/                ← Tile sprite assets\n      checkpoints/          ← Checkpoint visual assets\n  tests/\n    level/\n      LevelLoader.test.js   ← Unit tests for level loading\n      CheckpointManager.test.js\n```\n\n**Complete Level Data Structure:**\n```javascript\n// Level.js - Complete level data container with all required functionality\nclass Level {\n    constructor(width, height, tileSize) {\n        this.width = width;

Just as your nervous system doesn't just react to what's happening right now but also processes recent sensory information to make smooth movements possible, a good input system must capture, buffer, and intelligently process player input to create controls that feel responsive and forgiving.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in platformer input handling lies in bridging the gap between the **discrete nature of input events** and the **continuous nature of game physics**. When a player presses the jump button, that button press happens at a specific moment in time, but the game's physics simulation runs continuously at 60 frames per second. A naive input system that only checks input state during the exact frame when physics processes jumping will feel sluggish and unresponsive, especially during the precise timing windows that platformers demand.\n\nModern platformers solve this through **input buffering** - remembering recent input events for a brief time window so that a jump button press that happens just before landing still registers as valid input. This creates the illusion that the game \"knows what the player meant\" even when the timing isn't pixel-perfect. Combined with sophisticated control mapping that can handle multiple input devices simultaneously, the input system becomes the foundation that makes challenging platformer gameplay feel fair and responsive.\n\n### Input Buffering\n\nInput buffering represents one of the most important yet invisible features in platformer design. Without buffering, players must time their inputs with frame-perfect precision, making the game feel unforgiving and frustrating. With proper buffering, the same challenging gameplay feels responsive and fair.\n\nThe core insight behind input buffering is that **human reaction times and intentions don't align perfectly with frame boundaries**. A player might press the jump button 20 milliseconds before their character actually lands on a platform, but their intention was clearly to jump immediately upon landing. A buffering system captures this input event and holds it in memory until the game state makes the action valid, then executes it automatically.\n\n**Mental Model: The Intent Recorder**\n\nThink of input buffering like a **short-term memory system** that records the player's recent intentions. Just as you might remember someone's name for a few seconds after being introduced so you can use it in conversation, the input system remembers recent button presses for a brief window so it can apply them when the game state allows. This memory fades quickly - after 100-150 milliseconds, old inputs are forgotten to prevent stale actions from triggering unexpectedly.\n\n> **Decision: Input Buffer Implementation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Input buffering requires storing timestamped input events and checking them against current game state validity\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Frame-based counter system (count frames since input)\n>   2. Timestamp-based system using delta time\n>   3. State machine with buffer states\n> - **Decision**: Timestamp-based system using delta time\n> - **Rationale**: Frame-based counters break at different frame rates, making buffer windows inconsistent. Timestamp-based buffering provides consistent timing regardless of frame rate, essential for frame-rate independent gameplay\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful delta time management but ensures consistent feel across different devices and performance conditions\n\nThe `InputManager` maintains a separate buffer for each input action, storing both the fact that the input occurred and the timestamp when it was registered. During each game loop iteration, the system ages these buffered inputs and removes any that exceed the buffer duration threshold.\n\n| Input Buffer Component | Type | Description |\n|----------------------|------|-------------|\n| `keys` | `Map<string, boolean>` | Current pressed state of each key |\n| `keyBuffer` | `Map<string, number>` | Timestamp when each buffered key was pressed |\n| `bufferDuration` | `number` | Maximum time to retain buffered inputs (0.1 seconds) |\n| `currentTime` | `number` | Current game time for aging buffer entries |\n\nThe input buffer operates through a two-phase process during each frame. In the **capture phase**, the system records all new input events with precise timestamps. In the **validation phase**, game systems query the buffer to check whether specific actions should be triggered, and successful queries consume the buffered input to prevent duplicate actions.\n\n**Buffer Management Algorithm**\n\n1. **Input Event Capture**: When a key press event occurs, record both the immediate key state and timestamp the event in the buffer map\n2. **Buffer Aging**: Each frame, iterate through all buffered inputs and calculate their age using current time minus stored timestamp\n3. **Expiration Cleanup**: Remove any buffered inputs that exceed the `bufferDuration` threshold to prevent stale actions\n4. **Query Processing**: When game systems check for buffered input, return true if a valid timestamped entry exists within the buffer window\n5. **Input Consumption**: After successful buffer queries, remove the consumed input from the buffer to prevent duplicate triggering\n6. **State Synchronization**: Update immediate key state maps to reflect current hardware input state for continuous actions like movement\n\n**Buffering Different Input Types**\n\nDifferent types of player actions require different buffering strategies. **Discrete actions** like jumping benefit from traditional input buffering - the system remembers that jump was pressed recently and triggers it when conditions become valid. **Continuous actions** like left/right movement should not be buffered in the same way, since holding left should continue moving left without consuming the input.\n\n| Action Type | Buffer Strategy | Duration | Consumption |\n|------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|\n| Jump | Buffer press events | 100ms | Consume on successful jump |\n| Movement | Direct state check | N/A | Never consume |\n| Attack | Buffer press events | 150ms | Consume on successful attack |\n| Interact | Buffer press events | 200ms | Consume on successful interaction |\n\n> The key distinction is between **intent-based actions** (jumping, attacking) that represent discrete player intentions, and **state-based actions** (movement, crouching) that represent ongoing player control. Intent-based actions benefit from buffering and consumption, while state-based actions should be checked directly.\n\n**Jump Buffer Integration Example**\n\nConsider the interaction between input buffering and the jump mechanics described in the Physics Engine section. When a player approaches a platform edge, they might press jump slightly before landing, slightly after leaving the edge (covered by coyote time), or during the brief window between coyote time expiring and landing (where jump buffer provides the solution).\n\n**Walk-through Scenario: Edge Jump with Buffer**\n\n1. Player character runs toward a platform edge while airborne (coyote time expired)\n2. Player presses jump button 50ms before landing, anticipating the ground contact\n3. Input system captures jump press with timestamp and stores in buffer\n4. Character continues falling and contacts ground, setting `onGround` to true\n5. Next physics update checks for valid jump conditions: character is grounded AND jump buffer contains recent input\n6. Jump system finds valid buffered input within 100ms window and triggers upward velocity\n7. Input system consumes the buffered jump press to prevent double-jumping\n8. Character begins jumping with smooth, responsive feel despite imperfect timing\n\nThis creates a **forgiveness window** that makes precise platforming feel fair while maintaining the challenge of proper positioning and timing.\n\n### Control Mapping\n\nControl mapping transforms raw hardware input events into meaningful game actions, providing the abstraction layer that allows the same game logic to work with keyboards, gamepads, and other input devices. More importantly, it provides a centralized location for input configuration and accessibility customization.\n\n**Mental Model: The Translation Layer**\n\nThink of control mapping like a **universal translator** that converts different \"languages\" of input devices into a common language that your game systems understand. A keyboard speaks in terms of key codes and press/release events. A gamepad speaks in terms of button indices and analog stick values. The control mapping system learns both languages and translates everything into game-specific terms like \"move_left\", \"jump\", and \"attack\".\n\nThis translation layer also handles the **semantic meaning** of inputs. The left arrow key and the gamepad's left stick both mean \"move left\", but they produce different raw input data. The mapping system normalizes these differences so the physics and entity systems can focus on game logic rather than input hardware details.\n\n> **Decision: Control Mapping Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Need to support multiple input devices with customizable key bindings while maintaining clean separation between input hardware and game logic\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Direct key code checking in game systems\n>   2. Simple key remapping with hardcoded action names  \n>   3. Action-based mapping system with configurable bindings\n> - **Decision**: Action-based mapping system with configurable bindings\n> - **Rationale**: Direct key checking creates tight coupling between input hardware and game logic, making device support and customization difficult. Action-based mapping provides clean abstraction, supports multiple devices naturally, and enables player customization without code changes\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more initial setup but provides extensibility for accessibility features, multiple control schemes, and easy device support\n\nThe control mapping system operates through **action definitions** that describe the semantic meaning of each input, paired with **binding configurations** that specify which hardware inputs trigger each action. This separation allows the same action to be triggered by multiple input sources and enables runtime reconfiguration for accessibility or player preference.\n\n| Control Mapping Component | Type | Description |\n|---------------------------|------|-------------|\n| `actionDefinitions` | `Map<string, ActionConfig>` | Semantic actions the game supports (jump, move_left, etc.) |\n| `inputBindings` | `Map<string, InputBinding[]>` | Hardware inputs mapped to each action |\n| `deviceStates` | `Map<string, DeviceState>` | Current state of each input device |\n| `inputContext` | `string` | Current input context (gameplay, menu, etc.) |\n\n**Action Definition Structure**\n\nEach action definition describes not just the name of the action, but also its behavioral characteristics that affect how the mapping system processes it.\n\n| Action Property | Type | Description |\n|-----------------|------|-------------|\n| `name` | `string` | Unique identifier for this action (jump, move_left) |\n| `inputType` | `ActionType` | Whether this is a button press, axis input, or trigger |\n| `requiresBuffering` | `boolean` | Whether this action benefits from input buffering |\n| `allowRepeat` | `boolean` | Whether holding the input should generate repeated actions |\n| `deadzone` | `number` | Minimum input threshold for analog inputs |\n\n**Input Binding Structure**  \n\nInput bindings connect specific hardware inputs to action definitions, handling the complexity of different device types and input methods.\n\n| Binding Property | Type | Description |\n|------------------|------|-------------|\n| `deviceType` | `string` | Input device type (keyboard, gamepad, mouse) |\n| `inputCode` | `string` | Device-specific input identifier (KeyA, Button0, etc.) |\n| `modifier` | `InputModifier` | Additional processing (invert, scale, deadzone) |\n| `context` | `string` | When this binding is active (gameplay, menu, all) |\n\n**Multi-Device Input Handling**\n\nModern platformers must gracefully handle multiple input devices being used simultaneously or switched between during gameplay. The control mapping system maintains separate state tracking for each device while providing unified action queries to game systems.\n\n**Device Priority and Conflict Resolution**\n\nWhen multiple devices provide input for the same action simultaneously, the mapping system uses a priority system to determine which input takes precedence. This prevents conflicting inputs from canceling each other out while allowing seamless device switching.\n\n| Priority Level | Device Types | Behavior |\n|---------------|--------------|----------|\n| High | Most recently used device | Takes precedence for conflicting actions |\n| Medium | Explicitly configured primary device | Used when no recent input detected |  \n| Low | All other connected devices | Ignored during conflicts but monitored for activity |\n\n**Input Context Management**\n\nDifferent game states require different input interpretations. Menu navigation should not trigger jump actions, and pause screens should not process movement input. The control mapping system manages **input contexts** that define which actions are valid in each game state.\n\n| Context | Active Actions | Behavior |\n|---------|---------------|----------|\n| `gameplay` | All movement and game actions | Full input processing with buffering |\n| `menu` | Navigation and selection only | Disable movement actions, enable menu navigation |\n| `paused` | Pause/unpause only | Block all other input while maintaining pause functionality |\n| `dialog` | Continue/skip dialog actions | Process text advancement, block movement |\n\n**Walk-through Example: Complex Input Processing**\n\nConsider a scenario where a player is using a keyboard for movement but occasionally uses a gamepad for more precise jumping:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Player moves right using keyboard (D key held), approaching a platform edge\n2. **Device Switch**: Player grabs gamepad and presses A button for jump while still holding D key\n3. **Multi-Device Resolution**: Control mapping system detects gamepad input and switches priority to gamepad while maintaining keyboard movement\n4. **Action Processing**: Jump action triggered from gamepad A button, movement continues from keyboard D key\n5. **Input Buffering**: Jump input gets buffered with gamepad device tag in case landing timing is imperfect\n6. **Unified Output**: Game systems receive clean action signals (is_moving_right=true, buffered_jump_available=true) without knowing about device complexity\n\nThis seamless device switching maintains player flow while providing the precision benefits of different input methods for different actions.\n\n**Accessibility and Customization**\n\nThe control mapping system serves as the foundation for accessibility features that make platformers playable for users with different physical capabilities. By centralizing input processing, the system can provide features like **input remapping**, **button combinations**, and **alternative input methods** without requiring changes to core game logic.\n\n| Accessibility Feature | Implementation | Benefit |\n|----------------------|----------------|---------|\n| Button remapping | Runtime binding modification | Custom layouts for physical limitations |\n| Combination inputs | Multiple buttons triggering single action | Easier access to complex actions |\n| Hold-to-toggle | Converting hold actions to toggle actions | Reduced finger strain |\n| Input timing adjustment | Customizable buffer and timing windows | Accommodation for slower reaction times |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Frame-Rate Dependent Input Polling**\n\nMany developers implement input checking that only captures input events during specific frame boundaries, missing inputs that occur between frames. This creates inconsistent responsiveness where identical player timing might work at 60 FPS but fail at 30 FPS.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Input events are generated by the operating system at arbitrary times that don't align with your game's frame boundaries. Polling input only during `update()` calls means short-duration button presses might be missed entirely if they occur and release between frames.\n\n**How to fix**: Use event-based input capture that records all input events as they occur, combined with buffering that maintains these events across multiple frames. Process input events in a separate phase from game logic updates.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Consuming Continuous Actions**\n\nDevelopers often apply the same buffering and consumption logic to both discrete actions (jumping) and continuous actions (movement), causing movement to stop working after the buffer expires even when the key is still held.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Movement should continue as long as the key is held, but consuming buffered movement input prevents this. The player holds right arrow to run, but after 100ms the buffered input gets consumed and movement stops despite the key still being pressed.\n\n**How to fix**: Distinguish between intent-based actions that should be consumed after use (jump, attack) and state-based actions that should be checked directly (movement, crouch). Use different processing paths for each type.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Input Context**\n\nAllowing all input actions to be processed regardless of game state creates bizarre behavior like jumping while in menus or moving during cutscenes.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Input actions have semantic meaning that depends on game context. Jump should trigger jumping during gameplay but might mean \"confirm selection\" in menus. Processing all actions in all contexts creates confusing user experience.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement input context management that enables/disables specific action categories based on current game state. Define clear context boundaries and transition rules.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Device State Desynchronization**\n\nFailing to properly track device connection/disconnection states can lead to phantom inputs from disconnected devices or missing inputs from newly connected devices.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Device states change dynamically during gameplay. A gamepad might be disconnected mid-game, or a player might plug in a controller after starting with keyboard. Stale device state causes the input system to check disconnected devices or ignore newly available ones.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement device monitoring that detects connection changes and updates device state accordingly. Provide graceful fallback when primary input device becomes unavailable.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe input system requires careful integration with the game loop and clean separation between hardware-specific input capture and game-specific action processing. The key architectural principle is maintaining responsive input capture while providing predictable, frame-rate independent behavior to game systems.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Event Capture | Browser keyboard/gamepad events | Custom input driver with raw device access |\n| Input Processing | Direct event handling in main loop | Separate input thread with event queuing |\n| Device Management | Manual device enumeration | HID device abstraction library |\n| Configuration | JSON configuration files | Runtime remapping UI with persistence |\n\n**Recommended File Structure**\n\n```\nsrc/\n  input/\n    InputManager.js          ← main input system coordination\n    ActionMapper.js          ← control mapping and action definitions  \n    InputBuffer.js           ← buffering system for discrete actions\n    DeviceManager.js         ← device detection and state management\n    InputConfig.js           ← default key bindings and configuration\n  game/\n    GameLoop.js              ← integrates input processing into main loop\n    Player.js                ← consumes processed input actions\n```\n\n**Core Input Infrastructure (Complete Implementation)**\n\n```javascript\n// InputBuffer.js -

should still jump when touching ground\n- Test pressing jump multiple times rapidly - should only trigger one jump per ground contact\n- Expected behavior: Jump feels responsive even with imperfect timing, no double jumps\n\n**Debugging Tips**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Keys work inconsistently | Event listeners not properly attached | Check browser console for errors, verify addEventListener calls | Ensure listeners are added after DOM is ready |\n| Jump doesn't work sometimes | Buffer timing issues or consumption problems | Log buffer state and timing values | Verify buffer duration and consumption logic |\n| Movement stutters | Multiple event listeners or state conflicts | Check for duplicate event handlers | Ensure only one InputManager instance exists |\n| Gamepad not detected | Gamepad API not properly initialized | Test with `navigator.getGamepads()` in console | Add gamepad connection event listeners |\n| Input lag | Processing too much during input events | Profile input event handler performance | Move heavy processing out of event handlers |\n\n\n## Rendering System\n\n> **Milestone(s):** 1 (Basic Movement and Gravity), 2 (Jumping), 3 (Tile-based Collision), 4 (Enemies and Hazards) - establishes the visual presentation layer that displays game entities, tiles, and camera-based views to the player\n\nThink of the rendering system as a **film crew with a camera operator**. The film crew (sprite renderer) knows how to capture each actor (entity) in their current pose (animation frame), while the camera operator (camera system) follows the action smoothly, keeping the main character in frame while respecting the boundaries of the set (level boundaries). Just as a film crew must synchronize their equipment to capture 24 frames per second of smooth motion, our rendering system must coordinate sprite animation timing, camera movement, and screen drawing to deliver consistent 60fps visuals.\n\nThe rendering system serves as the visual presentation layer for our 2D platformer, transforming the abstract game state maintained by the physics engine, entity system, and level system into the pixels that players see on screen. This system must handle multiple complex responsibilities simultaneously: rendering individual sprites with proper animation timing, managing a camera that smoothly follows player movement while respecting level boundaries, and coordinating all visual elements to create a cohesive game world.\n\nThe core architectural challenge in rendering lies in the coordination between multiple moving parts that operate on different timescales. Entity sprites may animate at 12-15 frames per second to create character movement, while the camera follows player motion with smooth interpolation over multiple game frames, and the entire screen refreshes at 60fps. The rendering system must synchronize these different temporal requirements while maintaining consistent visual quality and performance.\n\n![Game Loop Execution Cycle](./diagrams/game-loop-cycle.svg)\n\nThe rendering system integrates into the main game loop as the final phase before frame presentation. After input processing, physics updates, and collision resolution complete, the rendering system takes the current game state and translates it into the visual representation that players experience. This separation of concerns ensures that visual presentation never interferes with game logic timing or physics simulation accuracy.\n\n> **Decision: Immediate Mode Rendering Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Need to choose between immediate mode rendering (draw commands issued each frame) vs retained mode rendering (scene graph with cached visual elements)\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate mode with per-frame draw calls, retained mode with scene graph caching, hybrid approach with static/dynamic separation\n> - **Decision**: Immediate mode rendering with frame-by-frame draw command issuing\n> - **Rationale**: 2D platformers have relatively simple scenes with moderate entity counts, making caching overhead unnecessary. Immediate mode provides predictable performance characteristics and simpler debugging since all rendering logic executes in sequence each frame\n> - **Consequences**: Enables straightforward rendering pipeline with clear execution order, but requires efficient sprite batching to avoid excessive draw calls for large tile maps\n\nThe rendering system architecture consists of three primary subsystems working in coordination. The sprite rendering subsystem manages individual entity and tile visualization with animation frame management. The camera system provides viewport management with smooth player tracking and boundary constraints. These subsystems share common rendering infrastructure including texture management, coordinate transformation, and screen presentation.\n\n| Rendering Subsystem | Primary Responsibility | Key Components | Dependencies |\n|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Sprite Renderer | Entity and tile visualization | Animation manager, texture atlas, sprite batching | Entity positions, animation state |\n| Camera System | Viewport management and tracking | Camera entity, smooth following, boundary constraints | Player position, level boundaries |\n| Render Pipeline | Screen presentation coordination | Draw call sequencing, coordinate transformation, frame buffer management | All visual elements |\n\n### Sprite Rendering\n\nThink of sprite rendering as **flip-book animation brought to life**. Each entity in our game world is like a character in a flip-book, with multiple drawings (sprites) that show different poses or movements. The sprite renderer acts as the person flipping through the pages, showing the right drawing at the right time to create the illusion of smooth animation. Just as a flip-book artist must time page flips to match the desired motion speed, our sprite renderer must advance animation frames at the correct rate to make characters appear to run, jump, or patrol naturally.\n\nThe sprite rendering subsystem handles the visual representation of all game entities including the player character, enemies, and environmental elements. This subsystem must coordinate multiple complex tasks: selecting the correct animation frame based on entity state and elapsed time, positioning sprites according to camera coordinates, and efficiently batching similar sprites to minimize draw calls and maintain 60fps performance.\n\nEntity sprite rendering begins with **animation frame selection** based on the entity's current state and internal animation timer. Each entity maintains animation state that tracks which animation sequence is currently playing (running, jumping, falling, idle) and how much time has elapsed since the animation began. The sprite renderer uses this timing information to calculate which frame within the animation sequence should be displayed.\n\n| Animation Component | Type | Description | Example Values |\n|---------------------|------|-------------|----------------|\n| currentAnimation | string | Name of active animation sequence | \"idle\", \"running\", \"jumping\", \"falling\" |\n| frameIndex | number | Current frame within animation sequence | 0, 1, 2, 3 for 4-frame run cycle |\n| frameTimer | number | Time elapsed in current frame | 0.0 to frameDuration |\n| frameDuration | number | Time each frame displays before advancing | 0.083 (12fps), 0.067 (15fps) |\n| looping | boolean | Whether animation repeats after final frame | true for run cycle, false for death |\n| animationComplete | boolean | Whether non-looping animation finished | false during play, true when finished |\n\nThe animation frame calculation follows a time-based approach that ensures consistent animation speed regardless of framerate variations. Each animation frame has a defined duration (typically 67-83ms for 12-15fps character animation), and the sprite renderer accumulates delta time until enough time passes to advance to the next frame. This approach prevents animation speed fluctuations when the game framerate varies between 50-60fps.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Animation timing must remain independent of rendering framerate to ensure consistent visual behavior. A character's run cycle should complete in exactly 0.5 seconds whether the game runs at 45fps or 60fps.\n\n**Animation frame advancement** occurs through a time accumulation process that respects individual animation timing requirements. The sprite renderer maintains per-entity frame timers that accumulate delta time each frame. When the accumulated time exceeds the current frame's duration, the renderer advances to the next frame and subtracts the frame duration from the timer, preserving any excess time for smooth animation timing.\n\n1. **Accumulate frame time** by adding the current frame's delta time to the entity's frameTimer\n2. **Check frame duration** to determine if enough time has passed to advance animation\n3. **Advance frame index** by incrementing to the next frame in the animation sequence\n4. **Handle sequence completion** by either looping back to frame 0 or marking animation complete\n5. **Preserve excess time** by subtracting frame duration from timer rather than resetting to zero\n6. **Update sprite coordinates** to reference the new frame in the texture atlas\n\nTexture atlas management provides the foundation for efficient sprite rendering by packing multiple animation frames into single texture files. The sprite renderer maintains atlas metadata that describes the pixel coordinates and dimensions of each frame within the texture. This approach minimizes texture binding operations and enables efficient sprite batching for improved rendering performance.\n\n| Atlas Metadata Field | Type | Description | Example Values |\n|----------------------|------|-------------|----------------|\n| textureID | string | Identifier for atlas texture file | \"player_sprites\", \"enemy_sprites\" |\n| frameWidth | number | Width of each sprite frame in pixels | 32, 48, 64 |\n| frameHeight | number | Height of each sprite frame in pixels | 32, 48, 64 |\n| framesPerRow | number | Number of frames in each atlas row | 8, 12, 16 |\n| animations | object | Map of animation names to frame sequences | {\"idle\": [0,1,2,1], \"run\": [4,5,6,7]} |\n\n**Sprite positioning** requires coordinate transformation between world space (where entities exist) and screen space (where pixels are drawn). The sprite renderer applies the camera's transformation matrix to convert entity world coordinates into screen coordinates that account for camera position, zoom level, and screen resolution. This transformation ensures sprites appear in the correct screen location as the camera follows the player.\n\nThe coordinate transformation process involves several mathematical steps that convert from game world units to final pixel positions. First, the renderer subtracts the camera's world position from the entity's world position to get camera-relative coordinates. Then it applies any camera zoom scaling and adds the camera's screen offset to center the view appropriately.\n\n> **Decision: Pixel-Perfect Sprite Positioning**\n> - **Context**: Need to choose between sub-pixel sprite positioning (allowing fractional coordinates) vs pixel-perfect positioning (rounding to integer coordinates)\n> - **Options Considered**: Sub-pixel positioning with linear filtering, pixel-perfect positioning with coordinate rounding, adaptive approach based on camera zoom\n> - **Decision**: Pixel-perfect positioning with coordinate rounding for primary game resolution\n> - **Rationale**: 2D platformers benefit from crisp pixel art aesthetics, and pixel-perfect positioning prevents sprite blurriness that occurs with sub-pixel positioning and linear filtering\n> - **Consequences**: Ensures crisp visual appearance but may cause minor visual jitter during smooth camera movement at non-integer positions\n\n**Sprite batching optimization** groups similar sprites together to minimize the number of individual draw calls required each frame. The renderer sorts sprites by texture atlas and depth layer, then issues single draw calls that render multiple sprites sharing the same texture. This batching approach dramatically improves rendering performance when displaying large tile maps or multiple enemies with shared sprite sheets.\n\nThe batching process accumulates sprite data into vertex buffers that contain position, texture coordinate, and color information for multiple sprites. Each sprite contributes four vertices (forming a quad) with texture coordinates that reference the appropriate frame within the atlas. The graphics hardware can then render hundreds of sprites with a single draw call instead of requiring individual draw calls per sprite.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Animation State Desynchronization**\nEntity animation state can become desynchronized with visual appearance when animation timers are not properly maintained during entity state changes. This occurs when changing from \"running\" to \"jumping\" animation without resetting the frame timer, causing the jump animation to begin partway through instead of starting from the first frame. Always reset `frameTimer` to 0 and `frameIndex` to 0 when changing animation sequences to ensure animations begin from the correct starting frame.\n\n**Tile rendering** follows similar principles to entity sprite rendering but with optimizations for the static, grid-based nature of level geometry. Tile sprites typically don't animate (except for special tiles like water or lava), allowing the renderer to use more aggressive batching optimizations. The tile renderer can pre-calculate screen coordinates for visible tiles and update only when the camera moves significantly.\n\nThe tile rendering process begins by determining which tiles are visible within the camera's viewport. This **viewport culling** prevents the renderer from processing tiles that are outside the screen boundaries, significantly improving performance for large levels. The renderer calculates the range of tile coordinates that intersect with the camera's view rectangle and processes only those tiles.\n\n| Tile Rendering Component | Type | Description | Performance Impact |\n|-------------------------|------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Viewport culling | Rectangle calculation | Determines visible tile range | Reduces tile processing by 80-95% |\n| Sprite batching | Vertex buffer optimization | Groups tiles by texture atlas | Reduces draw calls by 90-98% |\n| Static optimization | Pre-calculated geometry | Caches tile positions until camera moves | Eliminates per-frame calculations |\n\n### Camera System\n\nThink of the camera system as a **professional cinematographer** following the action in a movie. Just as a skilled camera operator smoothly tracks actors while keeping them properly framed and never showing the edge of the set, our camera system must follow the player character with fluid motion while respecting level boundaries and maintaining appropriate composition. The camera operator makes subtle adjustments to keep the subject in the optimal position within the frame, anticipating movement and providing smooth, comfortable viewing that never distracts from the action.\n\nThe camera system provides viewport management and player tracking functionality that determines what portion of the game world appears on screen at any given time. This system must balance multiple competing requirements: keeping the player character visible and appropriately positioned, responding smoothly to player movement without causing disorienting camera motion, and respecting level boundaries to never show empty space beyond the designed play area.\n\n**Camera following mechanics** implement smooth player tracking that avoids jarring camera movement while maintaining appropriate player positioning within the screen. The camera doesn't simply lock to the player's exact position, as this would cause constant camera motion that makes the game difficult to play. Instead, the camera uses a **deadzone** approach where small player movements don't trigger camera adjustment, but larger movements cause the camera to smoothly interpolate toward a new position.\n\nThe deadzone defines a rectangular region around the screen center where the player can move freely without causing camera adjustment. When the player moves outside this deadzone, the camera begins interpolating toward a new position that brings the player back within the acceptable region. This approach provides stable camera behavior during small movements while ensuring the camera responds appropriately to significant player motion.\n\n| Camera Component | Type | Description | Typical Values |\n|------------------|------|-------------|----------------|\n| worldX | number | Camera center X coordinate in world space | 0 to levelWidth |\n| worldY | number | Camera center Y coordinate in world space | 0 to levelHeight |\n| targetX | number | Desired camera X position based on player | Player X position with offset |\n| targetY | number | Desired camera Y position based on player | Player Y position with offset |\n| deadzoneWidth | number | Width of no-movement zone around screen center | 100-200 pixels |\n| deadzoneHeight | number | Height of no-movement zone around screen center | 80-150 pixels |\n| followSpeed | number | Camera interpolation speed toward target | 2.0-5.0 units per second |\n| lookAheadDistance | number | Additional offset in player movement direction | 50-100 pixels |\n\nThe camera update process occurs each frame during the rendering phase, after all entity positions have been finalized by the physics and collision systems. This timing ensures the camera responds to the player's actual position rather than predicted position, preventing visual lag or stuttering that could occur with incorrect update ordering.\n\n1. **Calculate target position** by taking the player's current world position and adding appropriate offset for screen composition\n2. **Apply look-ahead offset** by adding extra distance in the direction the player is moving to show more of the upcoming path\n3. **Check deadzone boundaries** to determine if the target position requires camera movement\n4. **Interpolate camera position** smoothly toward the target using exponential decay or linear interpolation\n5. **Apply boundary constraints** to ensure the camera never shows areas outside the defined level boundaries\n6. **Update viewport transformation** matrix that converts world coordinates to screen coordinates\n\n**Look-ahead mechanics** enhance player experience by showing more of the game world in the direction of player movement. When the player runs to the right, the camera gradually shifts to show more of the rightward path and less of the leftward area. This anticipatory camera behavior helps players see upcoming obstacles, enemies, and platforms before they become immediate concerns.\n\nThe look-ahead calculation uses the player's current velocity to determine both the direction and magnitude of the camera offset. Faster player movement results in greater look-ahead distance, while stationary players receive no look-ahead offset. The camera applies this offset gradually to avoid sudden camera jumps when the player changes direction.\n\n> **Decision: Exponential Decay Camera Smoothing**\n> - **Context**: Need to choose camera interpolation method that provides smooth following without lag or overshoot\n> - **Options Considered**: Linear interpolation toward target, exponential decay smoothing, spring-damper system\n> - **Decision**: Exponential decay smoothing with configurable follow speed\n> - **Rationale**: Exponential decay provides natural-feeling camera movement that's fast when far from target and slow when close, preventing overshoot while maintaining responsiveness\n> - **Consequences**: Creates smooth, professional-feeling camera movement but requires tuning the decay rate for optimal feel\n\n**Boundary constraint enforcement** prevents the camera from displaying areas outside the designed level boundaries. When the camera's target position would show empty space beyond the level edges, the constraint system clamps the camera position to keep only valid game world areas visible. This clamping must account for screen dimensions to ensure the entire screen remains filled with valid level content.\n\nThe boundary calculation determines the valid range for camera center coordinates based on level dimensions and screen size. The minimum camera X position ensures the left edge of the screen doesn't extend beyond the left level boundary, while the maximum camera X position ensures the right edge of the screen doesn't extend beyond the right level boundary. Similar calculations apply for vertical boundaries.\n\n| Boundary Type | Calculation | Description | Example Values |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Minimum X | screenWidth / 2 | Leftmost valid camera center X | 400 for 800px screen |\n| Maximum X | levelWidth - screenWidth / 2 | Rightmost valid camera center X | 1600 for 2400px level |\n| Minimum Y | screenHeight / 2 | Topmost valid camera center Y | 300 for 600px screen |\n| Maximum Y | levelHeight - screenHeight / 2 | Bottommost valid camera center Y | 1200 for 1800px level |\n\n**Screen shake effects** can be implemented as temporary camera offset modifiers that add controlled random motion to simulate impacts, explosions, or other dramatic events. The camera system applies these offset modifiers after calculating the base camera position but before final boundary constraint enforcement. Screen shake effects decay over time and should never violate level boundary constraints.\n\nThe coordinate transformation system converts between world coordinates (where game entities exist) and screen coordinates (where pixels are drawn). This transformation accounts for camera position, any zoom scaling, and screen resolution to ensure all visual elements appear in the correct locations. The transformation matrix calculation occurs once per frame and applies to all rendered elements.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Camera Boundary Edge Cases**\nCamera boundary constraints can create jarring visual behavior when the level is smaller than the screen size, causing the camera to lock to a fixed position that may not optimally frame the player. Handle small levels by centering the camera on the level center rather than following the player, or by adding padding areas that keep the camera behavior consistent. Always test camera behavior at level edges to ensure smooth constraint application.\n\n**Multi-layer camera effects** can enhance visual depth by applying different camera influence factors to background, midground, and foreground elements. Background elements might move at 50% of camera speed to create parallax effects, while foreground elements move at 120% of camera speed to enhance depth perception. These effects require careful coordination with the sprite rendering system to apply appropriate transformation matrices to different visual layers.\n\nThe camera system integrates with the rendering pipeline by providing transformation matrices that convert world coordinates to screen coordinates. Every sprite rendering operation applies this transformation to position visual elements correctly relative to the camera's current view. The camera system updates these transformation matrices each frame based on its current world position and any active camera effects.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe rendering system requires careful coordination between graphics APIs, texture management, and animation timing to deliver smooth 60fps visuals.

physics simulation through complex entity interactions\n\nThink of error handling in a 2D platformer like **safety systems in a high-speed train**. The train (your game) needs to maintain smooth, consistent motion at 60 frames per second, but when something goes wrong—a calculation error, an unexpected collision, or a timing anomaly—the safety systems must detect the problem instantly and correct course without passengers (players) noticing the disruption. Unlike traditional software where you might show an error dialog and wait for user input, games must handle errors gracefully in real-time while maintaining the illusion of a consistent, physics-driven world.\n\nThe challenge of error handling in real-time games is fundamentally different from typical application development. When your physics simulation encounters an edge case—like a player moving so fast they tunnel through a wall, or a floating-point precision error causing a character to vibrate infinitely—you cannot pause the game loop to debug the issue. Instead, you must detect these anomalies during execution and apply corrective measures that preserve game flow while preventing the error from cascading into other systems. This requires a defensive programming approach where every component assumes its inputs might be invalid and every calculation verifies its outputs before propagating them downstream.\n\nThe most critical insight for platformer error handling is understanding the **cascade effect**: a small physics error can quickly amplify into game-breaking behavior. When a player's position becomes invalid due to a collision resolution bug, it affects rendering (camera following), input (ground state detection), entity interactions (enemy collision), and level progression (checkpoint activation). A robust error handling system must break these cascade chains early, isolating errors to their source components while maintaining consistent game state across all systems.\n\n### Physics Simulation Edge Cases\n\nPhysics simulation in 2D platformers introduces several categories of edge cases that can break game flow if not handled properly. The most common issues stem from floating-point precision limitations, frame-rate dependent calculations, and boundary condition violations in the physics update loop.\n\n**Floating-point precision errors** manifest when entities approach tile boundaries or when velocity calculations accumulate small rounding errors over many frames. These errors can cause entities to become \"stuck\" at tile edges, vibrate between positions, or slowly drift through solid geometry. The magnitude of these errors increases with game speed and decreases with the precision of your floating-point representation.\n\n**Frame-rate dependent edge cases** occur when the physics simulation receives unexpected delta time values—either extremely large values during frame drops or negative values during system clock adjustments. Large delta times can cause entities to move so far in a single frame that they tunnel through collision geometry, while negative delta times can reverse physics calculations and cause entities to move backward in time.\n\n**Terminal velocity violations** happen when acceleration calculations exceed the defined `TERMINAL_VELOCITY` constant, either due to calculation errors or accumulated velocity from multiple acceleration sources. This can cause entities to move impossibly fast and break collision detection assumptions.\n\n| Edge Case | Symptoms | Root Cause | Detection Method |\n|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|\n| Position Drift | Entity slowly moves through solid tiles | Floating-point precision loss in collision resolution | Track entity position history, detect unexpected movement |\n| Velocity Explosion | Entity accelerates beyond terminal velocity | Accumulated acceleration from multiple sources | Validate velocity magnitude after physics update |\n| Delta Time Spike | Entity tunnels through collision geometry | Frame drop or system performance issue | Clamp delta time to `maxDeltaTime` threshold |\n| Negative Delta | Entity moves backward or physics reverses | System clock adjustment or profiler interference | Validate delta time is positive before physics update |\n| Ground State Flip | Player rapidly alternates between grounded/airborne | Collision detection inconsistency at tile boundaries | Implement state change hysteresis with `COLLISION_EPSILON` |\n| Infinite Jump | Player gains unlimited jump height | Jump velocity applied multiple frames during input buffer | Clear jump input after applying velocity impulse |\n\n> **Design Insight:** The key to robust physics error handling is **graceful degradation**—when the simulation encounters an impossible state, it should degrade to the closest valid state rather than allowing the error to propagate. For example, if collision resolution fails to separate overlapping entities, the system should snap them to the last known valid positions rather than leaving them stuck inside each other.\n\n**Decision: Delta Time Clamping Strategy**\n- **Context**: Large delta time values during frame drops can cause physics tunneling and collision detection failures, while negative delta times can reverse physics calculations\n- **Options Considered**: \n  1. Reject invalid frames entirely and skip updates\n  2. Clamp delta time to maximum safe value and subdivide large updates\n  3. Use fixed timestep physics with frame interpolation\n- **Decision**: Clamp delta time to `maxDeltaTime` (33.33ms) and subdivide large updates into multiple smaller steps\n- **Rationale**: Frame rejection creates visible stuttering during performance issues, while fixed timestep requires complex interpolation. Clamping preserves frame-rate independence while preventing physics instability during frame drops\n- **Consequences**: Enables graceful performance degradation at the cost of slight slow-motion effect during severe frame drops, maintains collision detection reliability\n\nThe delta time clamping system works by detecting when the elapsed frame time exceeds the maximum safe threshold, then subdividing the update into multiple smaller physics steps. Each subdivision uses the clamped delta time value, ensuring that no single physics update moves entities farther than the collision detection system can reliably handle.\n\n### Collision Detection Edge Cases\n\nCollision detection and resolution present the most complex error scenarios in 2D platformers, as they involve geometric calculations between moving entities and static level geometry. The primary failure modes include tunneling through geometry, corner clipping, floating-point precision issues at tile boundaries, and resolution conflicts when multiple collisions occur simultaneously.\n\n**Tunneling** occurs when an entity moves so fast that it completely passes through collision geometry between frames, bypassing the intersection tests entirely. This happens most commonly during large delta time spikes, but can also occur with normal frame rates if the entity velocity exceeds the collision detection system's sweep distance assumptions.\n\n**Corner clipping** manifests when entities get \"caught\" at the intersection of two collision tiles, often causing the player to stop abruptly when sliding along walls or attempting to pass through narrow passages. This occurs because the collision resolution system resolves each axis independently, and the resolution of one collision can inadvertently create a new collision on the perpendicular axis.\n\n**Precision boundary issues** arise when entities are positioned exactly at tile boundaries due to floating-point representation limitations. An entity at position 64.0000001 might be detected as overlapping both tile (2,0) and tile (2,1), causing inconsistent collision responses or rapid state changes between grounded and airborne states.\n\n| Collision Edge Case | Detection Method | Prevention Strategy | Recovery Action |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Tunneling Through Tiles | Swept AABB test between previous and current position | Clamp entity velocity to maximum safe speed per frame | Revert to last valid position and zero velocity |\n| Corner Clip Sticking | Detect perpendicular collision after resolution | Apply `COLLISION_EPSILON` separation after X-axis resolution | Nudge entity away from corner by epsilon distance |\n| Boundary Precision Error | Position exactly at tile boundary (remainder = 0) | Round positions away from tile boundaries | Snap to nearest valid position with epsilon offset |\n| Multiple Collision Conflict | Two+ collisions resolve to contradictory positions | Prioritize collision resolution by surface normal | Use most restrictive resolution and log conflict |\n| One-way Platform Inconsistency | Player falls through platform when barely touching | Implement consistent downward velocity threshold | Require minimum downward velocity to pass through |\n| Collision Resolution Failure | Entity remains overlapping after resolution | All resolution attempts leave entities intersecting | Emergency separation using entity bounding box centers |\n\nThe most critical collision edge case is **resolution failure**, where the geometric separation calculations cannot find a valid position that separates overlapping entities. This typically occurs when multiple entities overlap simultaneously, when an entity becomes surrounded by collision geometry with no escape route, or when floating-point precision prevents the resolution algorithm from achieving the required `COLLISION_EPSILON` separation distance.\n\n**Decision: Emergency Collision Recovery System**\n- **Context**: Complex collision scenarios can cause the resolution system to fail completely, leaving entities permanently stuck inside collision geometry\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Restart the entity at its last known good position\n  2. Disable collision for the entity temporarily until separation is achieved  \n  3. Force separation using entity bounding box center points\n- **Decision**: Implement emergency separation using bounding box centers with logarithmic fallback distances\n- **Rationale**: Restarting entities at previous positions can cause visible teleportation, while disabling collision creates new gameplay inconsistencies. Center-based separation provides deterministic recovery with minimal visual disruption\n- **Consequences**: Ensures entities never remain permanently stuck at the cost of occasional small position adjustments that may be visible to players\n\nThe emergency collision recovery system activates when standard resolution fails after a maximum number of iterations. It calculates the vector between entity bounding box centers, normalizes it, and moves the entities apart by progressively larger distances until separation is achieved. This provides a deterministic escape mechanism that prevents infinite collision resolution loops.\n\n### Entity Interaction Edge Cases\n\nEntity interactions between players, enemies, and environmental objects introduce state management complexities that can lead to inconsistent game behavior. The most problematic scenarios involve simultaneous interactions, state transition timing issues, and cascading effects between multiple entity systems.\n\n**Simultaneous interaction conflicts** occur when multiple interaction types happen in the same frame—for example, when a player stomps an enemy while simultaneously touching a hazard. The order of interaction processing determines the final outcome, but this order may be non-deterministic depending on entity update sequence or collision detection timing.\n\n**Invulnerability frame exploitation** happens when the timing of invulnerability periods allows players to pass through hazards or survive interactions that should be fatal. This occurs most commonly when invulnerability timers are managed inconsistently across different interaction types, or when frame-rate variations affect the duration of invulnerability periods.\n\n**State transition race conditions** manifest when entities change state during interaction processing, causing subsequent interactions in the same frame to use outdated state information. For example, an enemy might be marked as defeated but continue processing collision with the player before the defeated state is fully applied.\n\n| Interaction Edge Case | Symptoms | Failure Mode | Resolution Strategy |\n|----------------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Stomp vs Damage Conflict | Player dies while successfully stomping enemy | Both interactions process simultaneously | Prioritize stomp detection, cancel damage if successful |\n| Double Enemy Defeat | Enemy defeat animation/sound plays twice | Multiple entities stomp same enemy in one frame | Mark enemy as defeated before processing interactions |\n| Invulnerability Bypass | Player takes damage during invulnerability period | Frame timing allows damage between invulnerability checks | Check invulnerability immediately before applying damage |\n| Checkpoint Activation Loop | Checkpoint repeatedly activates each frame | Player position exactly at checkpoint boundary | Implement activation state tracking per checkpoint |\n| Enemy Patrol Boundary Stuck | Enemy stops moving at patrol limit | Boundary collision prevents direction reversal | Add small epsilon buffer inside patrol boundaries |\n| Player Death During Jump | Player dies while jump input is buffered | Death doesn't clear input buffer state | Clear all input buffers during player death transition |\n\nThe most complex interaction edge case involves **cascading entity state changes** where one interaction triggers additional state changes that affect subsequent interactions within the same frame. For example, stomping an enemy might trigger a checkpoint activation, which triggers a state save, which processes all current entity positions, but some entities have not yet updated to their final frame positions.\n\n> **Design Insight:** Entity interaction systems must be **transactional**—either all related state changes succeed together, or the entire interaction is rolled back to prevent partial state corruption. This requires careful ordering of interaction processing and state validation before committing changes.\n\n### Performance Degradation Handling\n\nPerformance issues in real-time games create a **spiral of death** where decreased frame rates cause increased delta times, which trigger more expensive calculations and error recovery operations, further degrading performance. The platformer engine must detect performance degradation early and implement graceful degradation strategies that preserve core gameplay at the expense of visual fidelity or secondary features.\n\n**Frame rate monitoring** involves tracking rolling averages of frame time and delta time to identify performance trends before they become critical. When frame times consistently exceed target thresholds, the system should preemptively reduce computational load rather than waiting for frame drops to trigger emergency measures.\n\n**Computational load balancing** spreads expensive operations across multiple frames to prevent individual frame spikes. This includes collision detection optimizations, entity AI updates, and rendering optimizations that can be deferred or approximated during performance stress.\n\n**Memory pressure handling** addresses situations where garbage collection or memory allocation causes frame time spikes. The platformer engine should minimize dynamic allocations during gameplay and provide object pooling for frequently created/destroyed entities like projectiles or particle effects.\n\n| Performance Issue | Early Warning Signs | Degradation Strategy | Recovery Threshold |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Frame Rate Drop | Average frame time > 18ms for 5+ frames | Reduce collision detection precision, skip non-critical entity updates | Return to normal when frame time < 16ms for 30 frames |\n| Memory Pressure | GC frequency increases above baseline | Pool and reuse entity objects, defer asset loading | Resume normal allocation when GC pressure normalizes |\n| Physics Instability | Multiple collision resolution failures per frame | Increase `COLLISION_EPSILON`, reduce maximum entity velocity | Restore full precision when collision failures drop to baseline |\n| Input Lag | Input buffer filling faster than processing | Process only most recent input events, clear buffer overflow | Resume normal buffering when input queue stabilizes |\n| Rendering Bottleneck | Draw calls exceed GPU capacity | Batch sprite rendering, reduce particle counts | Return to full quality when GPU utilization drops |\n| Entity Update Overload | Too many entities active simultaneously | Deactivate distant enemies, reduce AI update frequency | Reactivate full entity systems when count decreases |\n\n**Decision: Adaptive Quality System**\n- **Context**: Performance issues can cascade into game-breaking problems, but static quality settings cannot adapt to varying system capabilities or game complexity\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Fixed quality levels set by user configuration\n  2. Automatic quality reduction based on frame rate monitoring\n  3. Predictive quality adjustment based on scene complexity\n- **Decision**: Implement automatic quality reduction with hysteresis thresholds to prevent oscillation\n- **Rationale**: Fixed quality settings cannot respond to dynamic performance conditions, while predictive systems require complex scene analysis. Frame rate monitoring with hysteresis provides responsive adaptation without constant quality changes\n- **Consequences**: Maintains consistent frame rate at the cost of occasional visual quality reduction, requires careful threshold tuning to avoid quality oscillation\n\n### Memory Management Edge Cases\n\nMemory management issues in JavaScript-based platformers primarily involve garbage collection pressure, object lifecycle mismatagement, and memory leaks from event listeners or circular references. Unlike systems programming languages, JavaScript's automatic memory management can introduce unpredictable frame time spikes during garbage collection cycles.\n\n**Garbage collection pressure** builds up when the game creates and discards objects faster than the garbage collector can reclaim memory. This is particularly problematic in game loops where temporary objects (like collision test results or entity position calculations) are created every frame. The garbage collector may pause execution for several milliseconds during cleanup, causing visible frame drops.\n\n**Object lifecycle mismanagement** occurs when game entities are not properly cleaned up when removed from the game world. This includes removing event listeners, clearing timers, and dereferencing objects that hold references to large data structures. Improper cleanup can cause memory usage to grow continuously throughout the game session.\n\n**Event listener accumulation** happens when entities register event listeners (for input, collision events, or state changes) but fail to remove these listeners when the entity is destroyed. This creates memory leaks and can cause destroyed entities to continue responding to events, leading to undefined behavior.\n\n| Memory Issue | Detection Method | Prevention Strategy | Recovery Action |\n|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| GC Pressure Spikes | Monitor frame time variance, detect GC pauses | Object pooling for frequently created entities | Force GC during level transitions, not during gameplay |\n| Entity Memory Leaks | Track active entity count vs expected count | Implement `destroy()` method for all entities | Scan for orphaned entities, force cleanup |\n| Event Listener Leaks | Monitor registered listener count growth | Remove listeners in entity cleanup methods | Clear all listeners during scene transitions |\n| Circular References | Memory usage grows without creating new entities | Avoid parent-child entity references | Implement weak references or manual cleanup |\n| Asset Loading Bloat | Memory usage spikes during level loading | Stream assets, unload unused level data | Implement asset reference counting |\n| Animation Frame Leaks | `requestAnimationFrame` continues after game stops | Cancel animation frame requests in cleanup | Track and cancel all pending frame requests |\n\nThe most insidious memory management edge case is **reference cycles** where entities hold references to each other through event callbacks or parent-child relationships. JavaScript's garbage collector can handle simple cycles, but complex cycles involving DOM elements, event listeners, or large data structures may not be collected automatically.\n\n> **Design Insight:** Memory management in real-time games requires **proactive cleanup** rather than relying on automatic garbage collection. Every entity creation should have a corresponding explicit cleanup that removes all references, cancels all timers, and unregisters all event listeners.\n\n### Input System Edge Cases\n\nInput handling edge cases in platformers often involve timing-sensitive interactions between hardware input events, software input buffering, and game state changes. These issues can cause inputs to be lost, duplicated, or processed in the wrong game state, leading to frustrating player experiences that feel \"unresponsive\" or \"laggy.\"\n\n**Input event ordering** problems occur when multiple input events arrive in a single frame but need to be processed in a specific sequence. For example, if a player presses and releases the jump button within the same frame, the input system must ensure the press is processed before the release to trigger the jump correctly.\n\n**Buffer overflow conditions** happen when the player provides input faster than the game can process it, particularly during performance issues or complex collision resolution. The input buffer may fill beyond capacity, causing either the oldest or newest inputs to be lost depending on the buffer implementation.\n\n**State transition input conflicts** manifest when input is processed during state transitions, such as when a player dies while input is still buffered. The buffered input may be applied to the respawned player state, causing unexpected behavior like immediate movement or jumping upon respawn.\n\n| Input Edge Case | Symptoms | Root Cause | Mitigation Strategy |\n|----------------|----------|------------|-------------------|\n| Lost Jump Input | Player presses jump but character doesn't jump | Input processed during non-grounded state | Extend jump buffer duration, improve ground state detection |\n| Double Jump Exploit | Player achieves multiple jumps from single press | Input buffer doesn't clear after successful jump | Clear jump buffer immediately after applying jump velocity |\n| Input During Death | Dead player responds to movement input | Input buffer not cleared during state transition | Clear all input buffers during player death/respawn |\n| Rapid Input Overflow | Input buffer fills during performance issues | Input events arrive faster than processing | Implement circular buffer, process only most recent inputs |\n| Cross-Frame Input Loss | Input pressed and released in same frame | Input duration shorter than frame time | Sample input state at frame boundaries, not events |\n| Controller vs Keyboard Conflict | Multiple input sources provide conflicting commands | Both input types active simultaneously | Prioritize most recent input source |\n\nThe most critical input edge case is **input desynchronization** where the input system's understanding of button states diverges from the actual hardware state. This can occur during focus changes, when the game window loses focus while buttons are pressed, or during system-level input handling that intercepts events before they reach the game.\n\n**Decision: Input State Reconciliation System**\n- **Context**: Input state can become desynchronized with hardware state during window focus changes, system interruptions, or hardware disconnection events\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Trust hardware state completely and ignore desync issues\n  2. Periodically poll hardware state to verify input system state\n  3. Reset all input state during focus/unfocus events\n- **Decision**: Reset all input state and clear buffers during window focus transitions\n- **Rationale**: Polling hardware state is not available in web browsers, and trusting desynchronized state causes players to get \"stuck\" in movement or jump states. Focus transition reset is reliable across platforms\n- **Consequences**: Provides consistent input state at the cost of losing buffered input during alt-tab or window switching, requires clear player feedback about focus state\n\n### Graceful Degradation Strategies\n\nWhen error conditions cannot be prevented or fully resolved, the platformer engine must implement graceful degradation strategies that preserve core gameplay functionality while sacrificing less critical features. The goal is to maintain the player's sense of consistent game physics and responsive controls even when individual systems encounter errors.\n\n**Priority-based system degradation** establishes a hierarchy of game systems where core gameplay elements (player movement, basic collision) receive computational priority over secondary features (particle effects, complex AI, audio processing). During performance stress, secondary systems are progressively disabled to preserve core functionality.\n\n**Error isolation boundaries** prevent errors in one game system from cascading into other systems. Each major system (physics, rendering, audio, input) should handle its own error conditions and provide fallback behavior rather than propagating errors to dependent systems.\n\n**State consistency validation** ensures that core game state remains valid even when individual calculations fail. After each game loop iteration, the engine validates that player position is within level boundaries, entity health values are within valid ranges, and physics state is consistent with collision geometry.\n\n| System | Core Function | Degradation Strategy | Fallback Behavior |\n|--------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Physics Engine | Player movement and gravity | Reduce collision detection precision | Use simplified AABB tests, disable slope collision |\n| Collision System | Prevent entity overlap | Emergency separation | Snap entities to last valid positions |\n| Entity System | Enemy AI and interactions | Reduce update frequency | Enemies become static obstacles |\n| Rendering System | Visual display | Lower quality sprites | Use solid color rectangles for entities |\n| Audio System | Sound effects and music | Disable non-critical audio | Preserve jump/death sounds, disable background music |\n| Input System | Player control response | Simplify input processing | Disable input buffering, use direct state polling |\n\nThe most important degradation strategy is **core gameplay preservation**—even in severe error conditions, the player should be able to move, jump, and interact with basic level geometry. This requires identifying the absolute minimum set of systems that must remain functional for the game to be playable, and ensuring these systems have the most robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.\n\n> **Design Insight:** Graceful degradation is not just about handling errors—it's about maintaining **player trust** in the game's physics and controls. Players can tolerate reduced visual quality or simplified AI, but they cannot tolerate inconsistent jumping or unreliable collision detection. Core movement mechanics must always work predictably, even when everything else is failing.\n\n### Error Logging and Diagnostics\n\nComprehensive error logging and diagnostic systems are essential for identifying and resolving edge cases during development and after release. The platformer engine must balance detailed error reporting with performance impact, providing enough information to debug issues without overwhelming the logging system or degrading game performance.\n\n**Runtime error classification** categorizes errors by severity and impact on gameplay. Critical errors that break core gameplay (collision resolution failure, player state corruption) require immediate attention and detailed logging, while minor errors (animation frame skips, audio buffer underruns) can be logged with less detail or aggregated over time.\n\n**Performance impact monitoring** tracks the relationship between error occurrences and frame rate degradation. This helps identify which error conditions contribute to performance issues and which error handling strategies are too expensive for real-time execution.\n\n**State dump capabilities** provide detailed snapshots of game state when critical errors occur, including entity positions, velocities, collision geometry, input state, and recent state history. These dumps enable post-mortem debugging of complex edge cases that are difficult to reproduce.\n\n| Error Category | Logging Level | Information Captured | Action Required |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Physics Failure | CRITICAL | Entity positions, velocities, collision geometry, last 10 frames of state | Immediate investigation, may indicate fundamental physics bug |\n| Collision Resolution Timeout | ERROR | Overlapping entities, attempted resolution vectors, geometry map | Review collision algorithm, check for edge case geometry |\n| Input Desynchronization | WARNING | Hardware vs software input state, recent input history | Monitor frequency, may indicate platform-specific input issues |\n| Performance Degradation | INFO | Frame times, system load, active entity count | Track trends, optimize if degradation becomes frequent |\n| Memory Pressure | WARNING | Object creation/destruction rates, GC frequency, heap size | Consider object pooling, optimize memory allocation patterns |\n| Entity State Inconsistency | ERROR | Entity state before/after, state transition history | Validate state machine implementation |\n\n**Decision: Adaptive Logging System**\n- **Context**: Comprehensive error logging is essential for debugging but can impact game performance if too verbose, while insufficient logging makes edge cases impossible to diagnose\n- **Options Considered**:\n  1. Fixed logging level set by configuration\n  2. Dynamic logging based on error frequency\n  3. Performance-aware logging that reduces detail under load\n- **Decision**: Implement performance-aware logging with automatic detail reduction when frame rate drops below threshold\n- **Rationale**: Fixed logging levels cannot adapt to varying performance conditions, while frequency-based reduction may miss important but rare errors. Performance-aware logging maintains debugging capability while preserving game performance\n- **Consequences**: Provides detailed error information during normal operation while protecting frame rate during stress conditions, requires careful threshold tuning\n\nThe diagnostic system should also provide **real-time visualization** of error conditions through debug overlays that can be enabled during development. This includes collision boundary visualization, entity state displays, performance graphs, and input state indicators that help developers identify edge cases during testing.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Floating-Point Precision in Collision Detection**\nMany developers assume that floating-point calculations in collision detection are exact, leading to entities getting stuck at tile boundaries or slowly drifting through solid geometry. This occurs because repeated collision resolution calculations accumulate small rounding errors that can push entities into invalid positions. The solution is to implement `COLLISION_EPSILON` separation and round entity positions away from exact tile boundaries after collision resolution.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Clamping Delta Time During Performance Issues**\nWhen frame rates drop significantly, the physics system receives very large delta time values that can cause entities to move so far in a single frame that they bypass collision detection entirely. This creates tunneling behavior where players fall through the ground or pass through walls. Always clamp delta time to a maximum safe value (typically 33.33ms for 30 FPS minimum) and subdivide large updates into smaller steps.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Clearing Input Buffers Too Aggressively**\nSome implementations clear all input buffers immediately after any input is processed, which defeats the purpose of input buffering for responsive controls. Input buffers should only be cleared after the specific action has been successfully executed. For example, the jump buffer should only be cleared after jump velocity has been applied, not when the jump button is first detected.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Processing Entity Interactions in Non-Deterministic Order**\nWhen multiple entities interact in the same frame, processing them in different orders can lead to different outcomes, making the game behavior inconsistent between runs. This is particularly problematic for player-enemy interactions where the order of processing determines whether a stomp or damage occurs first. Always process interactions in a consistent order, such as by entity creation time or position sorting.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Handling Emergency Collision Resolution Failure**\nMost collision systems assume that geometric separation can always be calculated successfully, but complex scenarios with multiple overlapping entities can cause resolution algorithms to fail entirely. Without emergency fallback behavior, entities become permanently stuck inside collision geometry. Implement center-based separation as a last resort when geometric resolution fails.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Event Listeners in Entity Systems**\nJavaScript entities that register event listeners for collision detection, state changes, or input handling often forget to remove these listeners when the entity is destroyed. This causes memory leaks and can result in destroyed entities continuing to respond to events, leading to undefined behavior. Always implement explicit cleanup methods that remove all event listeners and references.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling and edge case management system requires careful integration with all game systems, prioritizing robustness over performance optimization in critical areas while maintaining real-time execution requirements.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Error Logging | `console.error()` with structured messages | Custom logging system with level filtering and performance monitoring |\n| Performance Monitoring | Manual frame time tracking with `performance.now()` | Comprehensive profiling with `Performance Observer API` |\n| Memory Management | Explicit object cleanup with manual reference clearing | Object pooling system with automatic lifecycle management |\n| State Validation | Simple bounds checking in update loops | Comprehensive state machine validation with invariant checking |\n| Input State Management | Direct hardware state polling | Event-driven input with state reconciliation |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\nsrc/\n  error-handling/\n    ErrorManager.js           ← centralized error handling and logging\n    PerformanceMonitor.js     ← frame rate and performance tracking\n    StateValidator.js         ← game state consistency checking\n    CollisionRecovery.js      ← emergency collision resolution\n    InputReconciliation.js    ← input state synchronization\n    DiagnosticOverlay.js      ← debug visualization tools\n  utils/\n    ObjectPool.js            ← object pooling for memory management\n    MathUtils.js             ← floating-point precision utilities\n    DebugUtils.js            ← development debugging helpers\n```\n\n**Core Error Manager Infrastructure (COMPLETE):**\n```javascript\n// ErrorManager.js -

verification approaches for physics behavior, collision accuracy, and gameplay feel with milestone checkpoints\n\nBuilding a 2D platformer engine presents unique testing challenges that differ fundamentally from traditional software testing. Think of testing a platformer like **quality assurance for a theme park ride** - you need to verify not just that the ride works mechanically, but that it feels safe, exciting, and responds predictably to rider behavior. Traditional unit tests can verify mathematical correctness, but platformer games require additional testing layers that validate physics behavior, timing-dependent interactions, and subjective gameplay feel.\n\nThe core testing challenge lies in the **temporal nature** of game systems. Unlike stateless functions that produce deterministic outputs, platformer mechanics involve continuous state changes over time, frame-rate dependent calculations, and complex interactions between multiple systems. A single frame of incorrect physics can compound into game-breaking behavior, while input timing differences measured in milliseconds can mean the difference between a responsive and frustrating control experience.\n\nThis testing strategy addresses verification across multiple dimensions: **mathematical correctness** of physics calculations, **temporal accuracy** of frame-rate independent systems, **interaction validity** between game entities, and **subjective quality** of gameplay feel. Each milestone introduces new testing requirements that build upon previous verification foundations.\n\n### Testing Philosophy and Approach\n\nThe platformer testing strategy employs a **layered verification approach** that mirrors the system architecture. Each layer validates different aspects of the engine, from low-level mathematical operations to high-level gameplay scenarios.\n\n**Mathematical Layer Testing** focuses on the correctness of individual calculations. Physics formulas, collision detection algorithms, and coordinate transformations must produce mathematically accurate results regardless of timing or system state. These tests verify that `GRAVITY * deltaTime` produces expected velocity changes, that AABB intersection tests correctly identify overlapping rectangles, and that world-to-grid coordinate conversions maintain precision.\n\n**Temporal Layer Testing** validates frame-rate independence and timing-dependent behaviors. These tests verify that physics simulation produces consistent results at different frame rates, that input buffering windows maintain their intended duration, and that animation systems advance frames at correct intervals regardless of rendering performance.\n\n**System Integration Testing** validates interactions between major engine components. These tests verify that the physics engine correctly updates entity positions, that the collision system properly resolves overlapping objects, and that the input system accurately communicates player intentions to the physics engine.\n\n**Gameplay Experience Testing** validates the subjective quality of game mechanics. These tests verify that jumping feels responsive, that movement has appropriate weight and momentum, and that collision resolution appears smooth rather than jarring. This layer requires both automated verification of measurable properties and manual validation of qualitative aspects.\n\n> **Decision: Automated vs Manual Testing Balance**\n> - **Context**: Platformer testing requires verification of both objective correctness and subjective feel\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Pure automated testing with numerical thresholds\n>   2. Pure manual testing through gameplay\n>   3. Hybrid approach with automated foundations and manual validation layers\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with 70% automated testing and 30% manual validation\n> - **Rationale**: Automated tests provide reliable verification of mathematical correctness and prevent regression, while manual testing validates gameplay feel aspects that cannot be quantified\n> - **Consequences**: Requires investment in both automated test infrastructure and structured manual testing protocols\n\n| Testing Approach | Coverage | Advantages | Disadvantages | Validation Method |\n|------------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Automated Unit Tests | Physics calculations, collision math, data structure operations | Fast execution, regression prevention, precise numerical validation | Cannot verify gameplay feel, limited temporal behavior validation | Assertion-based verification with numerical thresholds |\n| Automated Integration Tests | System interactions, state transitions, timing-dependent behaviors | Validates complex scenarios, catches integration bugs, reproducible | Difficult to set up, requires test harnesses, brittle to refactoring | Scenario-based verification with expected state outcomes |\n| Manual Gameplay Tests | Control responsiveness, visual smoothness, difficulty progression | Validates player experience, catches feel issues, intuitive evaluation | Time-intensive, subjective results, difficult to reproduce | Structured play sessions with evaluation criteria |\n\n### Physics System Testing\n\nPhysics system testing validates the mathematical foundation of all game movement. The physics engine serves as the **numerical backbone** of the platformer, where small calculation errors can cascade into major gameplay problems.\n\n**Gravity and Terminal Velocity Testing** verifies that falling objects behave according to the defined physics constants. Tests validate that entities accelerate downward at exactly `GRAVITY` pixels per second squared, that falling speed never exceeds `TERMINAL_VELOCITY`, and that gravity calculations remain consistent across different frame rates.\n\nThe core gravity test creates a `Player` entity at a known position, applies gravity for a measured time period, and verifies the final velocity and position match expected values. Delta time variations are tested by running identical scenarios at different simulated frame rates and comparing final outcomes.\n\n| Test Scenario | Initial Conditions | Expected Outcome | Validation Method | Pass Criteria |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Basic Gravity Application | Player at rest, no ground collision | Downward acceleration at `GRAVITY` rate | Velocity measurement after fixed time | `velocityY = GRAVITY * timeElapsed` within 0.1% tolerance |\n| Terminal Velocity Cap | Player falling for extended period | Velocity capped at `TERMINAL_VELOCITY` | Maximum velocity measurement | `velocityY <= TERMINAL_VELOCITY` always maintained |\n| Frame Rate Independence | Same scenario at 30fps vs 60fps | Identical final position after same elapsed time | Position comparison across frame rates | Position difference < 1 pixel after equivalent time |\n| Ground Collision Stop | Falling player contacts solid ground | Immediate velocity reset and position correction | Velocity and position after collision | `velocityY = 0` and `onGround = true` after ground contact |\n\n**Movement Physics Testing** validates horizontal movement with acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed constraints. Tests verify that player movement responds correctly to input, that momentum carries appropriately when input stops, and that movement calculations maintain precision over extended gameplay sessions.\n\nMovement tests create controlled input scenarios and measure resulting velocity and position changes. Acceleration curves are verified by measuring velocity at regular intervals during movement startup, while deceleration curves are validated by measuring velocity decay after input cessation.\n\n**Jump Mechanics Testing** represents the most complex physics validation due to the interaction between vertical impulse, gravity, and variable height mechanics. Tests must verify that jump initiation applies correct upward velocity, that variable height jumping produces predictable apex heights, and that jump interruption behaves consistently.\n\nJump testing employs **trajectory analysis** by recording player position over time and comparing actual flight paths to mathematical predictions. Variable height testing measures jump apex heights across different button hold durations and verifies the relationship follows expected curves.\n\n| Jump Test Type | Test Conditions | Measured Values | Expected Relationship | Validation Threshold |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Fixed Height Jump | Minimum button press duration | Maximum Y velocity, apex height, total air time | Mathematical trajectory calculation | Position within 2 pixels of predicted path |\n| Variable Height Jump | Button held for 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s intervals | Apex height for each duration | Linear or curved relationship based on design | Height difference matches intended scaling |\n| Jump Interruption | Button released at various trajectory points | Final apex height vs release point | Early release = lower apex | Apex reduction proportional to release timing |\n| Coyote Time Jump | Jump input 50ms after leaving platform edge | Jump execution success | Should allow jump within `COYOTE_TIME` window | Jump executes successfully within timing window |\n\n### Collision Detection and Resolution Testing\n\nCollision system testing validates the accuracy of overlap detection and the stability of collision resolution. Think of collision testing like **crash test validation** - you need to verify that the system handles both normal interactions and extreme edge cases without catastrophic failure.\n\n**AABB Collision Accuracy Testing** verifies that rectangle intersection calculations produce mathematically correct results across all possible overlap scenarios. Tests cover full overlap, partial overlap, edge contact, and no contact cases with entities of varying sizes and positions.\n\nCollision accuracy tests employ **exhaustive case coverage** by systematically testing intersection calculations across a grid of relative positions and sizes. Each test case verifies that the `intersectsAABB` function returns the correct boolean result and that calculated penetration depths match expected values.\n\n| Collision Scenario | Rectangle A Position/Size | Rectangle B Position/Size | Expected Result | Penetration Depth |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Full Overlap | (0,0,32,32) | (8,8,16,16) | True | B completely inside A |\n| Partial Overlap | (0,0,32,32) | (16,16,32,32) | True | 16x16 pixel overlap region |\n| Edge Contact | (0,0,32,32) | (32,0,32,32) | True (touching edges count) | 0 pixel penetration |\n| No Contact | (0,0,32,32) | (64,0,32,32) | False | No overlap |\n| Corner Contact | (0,0,32,32) | (32,32,32,32) | True (corner touching) | Single point contact |\n\n**Collision Resolution Testing** validates that overlapping entities are separated correctly and that the separation process maintains system stability. Resolution tests verify that entities are moved to valid non-overlapping positions, that separation direction follows collision geometry, and that resolution doesn't introduce new overlaps or invalid positions.\n\nResolution testing creates controlled overlap scenarios and verifies that the separation algorithm produces expected outcomes. Tests measure separation distances, validate final positions, and verify that resolved entities maintain correct spatial relationships.\n\n**Tile-based Collision Testing** validates entity interaction with the level geometry. These tests verify that moving entities correctly detect collisions with solid tiles, that collision resolution prevents entities from penetrating tile boundaries, and that one-way platforms allow upward passage while blocking downward movement.\n\nTile collision tests construct known level geometries and move entities through predictable paths while measuring collision detection and resolution results. Tests verify that entities stop at tile boundaries, slide along surfaces correctly, and handle internal corners without getting stuck.\n\n| Tile Collision Test | Level Geometry | Entity Movement | Expected Outcome | Validation Criteria |\n|--------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Wall Collision | Vertical wall of solid tiles | Horizontal movement toward wall | Entity stops at wall boundary | Final X position = wall edge minus entity width |\n| Floor Landing | Horizontal floor of solid tiles | Falling entity from above | Entity stops on floor surface | Final Y position = floor edge, `onGround = true` |\n| Slope Navigation | Diagonal tile arrangement | Horizontal movement across slope | Entity follows slope contour | Y position adjusts to maintain ground contact |\n| One-way Platform | Platform tiles with upward-only collision | Upward vs downward entity movement | Up passes through, down stops | Upward movement unblocked, downward movement blocked |\n\n### Input System Testing\n\nInput system testing validates the responsiveness and accuracy of player control interpretation. Think of input testing like **musical instrument validation** - the system must translate player intentions into game actions with precise timing and reliable consistency.\n\n**Input Buffering Testing** verifies that button presses are remembered for the correct duration and consumed appropriately. Tests validate that `wasKeyJustPressed` returns true within the `bufferDuration` window, that `consumeKeyPress` removes buffered inputs correctly, and that buffered inputs expire after their intended lifetime.\n\nInput buffer tests create controlled timing scenarios where button presses occur at specific intervals relative to input queries. Tests measure buffer state over time and verify that buffered inputs are available for exactly the intended duration.\n\n| Buffer Test Scenario | Button Press Timing | Query Timing | Expected Buffer State | Validation Method |\n|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Immediate Query | Press at frame 0 | Query at frame 0 | `wasKeyJustPressed = true` | Buffer contains fresh input |\n| Within Buffer Window | Press at frame 0 | Query at frame 3 (50ms later) | `wasKeyJustPressed = true` | Buffer retains input within window |\n| Buffer Expiration | Press at frame 0 | Query at frame 7 (150ms later) | `wasKeyJustPressed = false` | Buffer has expired input |\n| Input Consumption | Press at frame 0, consume at frame 1 | Query at frame 2 | `wasKeyJustPressed = false` | Consumed input no longer available |\n\n**Coyote Time Testing** validates that jump inputs are accepted for a brief period after leaving platform edges. Tests verify that the `coyoteTimer` tracks ground departure accurately, that jump inputs are accepted within the `COYOTE_TIME` window, and that coyote jumps apply the same physics as regular ground jumps.\n\nCoyote time tests create scenarios where the player moves off platform edges and attempts to jump at various intervals afterward. Tests measure whether jumps execute successfully and whether the resulting jump physics match ground-based jumps.\n\n**Jump Buffer Testing** validates that jump inputs are remembered when the player is airborne and executed automatically upon landing. Tests verify that jump inputs during airborne states are stored correctly, that stored jumps execute immediately upon ground contact, and that buffered jumps expire after the intended duration.\n\nJump buffer tests create airborne scenarios where jump inputs occur at various times before landing, then verify that the jump executes correctly upon ground contact.\n\n### Entity Interaction Testing\n\nEntity interaction testing validates the complex behaviors that emerge when different game objects affect each other. Think of entity testing like **choreography validation** - you need to verify that all the actors move correctly both individually and in relation to each other.\n\n**Player-Enemy Collision Testing** verifies the different outcomes based on collision direction and timing. Tests validate that side collisions damage the player, that stomp collisions defeat enemies, and that invulnerability periods prevent repeated damage.\n\nPlayer-enemy tests create controlled collision scenarios with known entity positions and velocities, then verify that the resulting state changes match expected behaviors. Tests measure damage application, invulnerability timer activation, and enemy defeat states.\n\n| Collision Type | Player Position/Velocity | Enemy Position/Velocity | Expected Outcome | State Changes |\n|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| Side Collision | Moving horizontally into enemy | Stationary or moving | Player takes damage, gains invulnerability | `player.health` decreases, `invulnerabilityTimer` > 0 |\n| Stomp Collision | Falling downward onto enemy | Ground-based enemy | Enemy defeated, player bounces | `enemy.defeated = true`, player gets upward velocity |\n| Invulnerable Contact | Any collision during invulnerability | Any enemy state | No damage taken | `player.health` unchanged, collision ignored |\n\n**Enemy AI Testing** validates patrol behaviors, boundary detection, and player interaction responses. Tests verify that enemies move between waypoints correctly, reverse direction at patrol boundaries, and respond appropriately to player proximity.\n\nAI testing employs **behavioral scenario validation** by creating known level layouts with defined patrol paths, then measuring enemy movement over time to verify it matches expected patterns.\n\n**Multi-Entity Scenarios** test complex interactions involving multiple entities simultaneously. These tests verify that collision resolution works correctly when multiple entities overlap, that AI behaviors don't interfere with each other, and that system performance remains stable with many active entities.\n\n### Performance and Stability Testing\n\nPerformance testing validates that the platformer engine maintains smooth gameplay under various load conditions and system configurations. Think of performance testing like **stress testing a bridge** - you need to verify that the system performs reliably not just under normal conditions, but when pushed to its operational limits.\n\n**Frame Rate Stability Testing** verifies that the game maintains consistent performance across different hardware capabilities and system loads. Tests measure frame time consistency, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that frame rate drops degrade gracefully without breaking game mechanics.\n\nFrame rate tests run identical gameplay scenarios while measuring frame timing statistics. Tests verify that 99% of frames complete within target timing thresholds and that performance degradation doesn't introduce physics instability or input lag.\n\n| Performance Test | Test Conditions | Measured Metrics | Target Performance | Degradation Limits |\n|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Entity Count Scaling | 1, 10, 50, 100 active entities | Average frame time, 99th percentile frame time | 16.67ms average (60fps) | <33.33ms 99th percentile (30fps minimum) |\n| Collision Complexity | Dense tile maps with many collision checks | Collision detection time per frame | <2ms collision processing | <5ms collision processing under load |\n| Rendering Load | Large levels with many visible tiles/sprites | Rendering time per frame | <4ms rendering time | <8ms rendering time under load |\n\n**Memory Usage Testing** validates that the engine manages memory efficiently without leaks or excessive allocation. Tests monitor memory consumption over extended play sessions and verify that entity creation and destruction maintain stable memory usage.\n\n**Physics Stability Testing** verifies that edge cases and extreme conditions don't break physics simulation. Tests create scenarios with high velocities, extreme positions, and unusual entity configurations to verify that the physics engine handles exceptional cases gracefully.\n\nPhysics stability tests employ **boundary condition validation** by creating scenarios at the limits of system parameters and verifying that the engine continues to function correctly or fails gracefully.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Testing Only Happy Path Scenarios**\nTesting only normal gameplay scenarios misses edge cases that cause production bugs. For example, testing jumping only when the player is clearly on solid ground misses cases where the player is at tile boundaries or on slopes. Edge case testing should include scenarios like jumping while partially off platform edges, landing on tile corners, or attempting actions during state transitions. Create test cases that specifically target boundary conditions and unusual input timing combinations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Frame Rate Variations in Tests**\nWriting tests that assume consistent frame rates produces validation that doesn't reflect real-world performance variations. For example, testing coyote time mechanics with fixed frame counts instead of elapsed time leads to timing-dependent bugs when frame rates fluctuate. All temporal testing must use delta time calculations and validate behavior across different simulated frame rates to ensure frame-rate independence.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Testing Input Timing Edge Cases**\nPlatformer controls depend heavily on precise input timing, but tests often check only discrete input states rather than timing relationships. For example, testing that jump input works when pressed doesn't verify that it works when pressed just before landing or just after leaving a platform. Input tests must specifically validate timing windows like jump buffering, coyote time, and input consumption.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overlooking Floating Point Precision Issues**\nPhysics calculations involve floating point arithmetic that can introduce small precision errors over time. Tests that use exact equality comparisons (`position === 100.0`) fail when calculations produce results like `99.99999`. All numerical comparisons in tests must use epsilon tolerance (`Math.abs(actual - expected) < COLLISION_EPSILON`) to account for floating point precision limitations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Testing Individual Systems in Isolation**\nTesting each game system separately misses integration bugs that occur when systems interact. For example, testing physics and collision systems independently doesn't catch issues where physics calculations assume collision resolution has completed, but collision resolution modifies entity state that affects subsequent physics calculations. Integration tests must validate complete update cycles with all systems working together.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe testing implementation provides both automated verification infrastructure and manual testing protocols that validate the platformer engine across all quality dimensions.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Test Framework | Built-in assertions with custom test runner | Jest or Mocha for comprehensive testing features |\n| Performance Monitoring | Manual timing measurements with `performance.now()` | Chrome DevTools Performance API integration |\n| Test Data Generation | Hard-coded test scenarios | Property-based testing with random scenario generation |\n| Visual Debugging | Console logging of test results | Canvas-based test visualization showing entity movements |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe testing infrastructure integrates with the main project structure while maintaining clear separation between production code and test validation:\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── src/\n│   ├── engine/\n│   │   ├── physics.js           ← production physics engine\n│   │   ├── collision.js         ← production collision system\n│   │   └── entities.js          ← production entity system\n│   └── game/\n│       ├── player.js            ← production player implementation\n│       └── enemies.js           ← production enemy implementation\n├── test/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   ├── physics-test.js      ← isolated physics testing\n│   │   ├── collision-test.js    ← collision algorithm testing\n│   │   └── input-test.js        ← input system testing\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   ├── movement-test.js     ← complete movement scenarios\n│   │   ├── combat-test.js       ← player-enemy interactions\n│   │   └── level-test.js        ← level loading and navigation\n│   ├── performance/\n│   │   ├── load-test.js         ← entity count scaling tests\n│   │   └── timing-test.js       ← frame rate stability tests\n│   └── manual/\n│       ├── gameplay-checklist.md ← structured manual testing protocol\n│       └── feel-testing-guide.md ← subjective quality validation\n├── test-utils/\n│   ├── test-framework.js        ← custom assertion and runner utilities\n│   ├── mock-entities.js         ← entity creation helpers for testing\n│   ├── test-levels.js           ← predefined level data for testing\n│   └── performance-monitor.js   ← timing and profiling utilities\n└── docs/\n    └── testing-strategy.md      ← this document\n```\n\n#### Test Framework Infrastructure\n\nComplete test framework implementation that provides assertion utilities, test organization, and result reporting:\n\n```javascript\n// test-utils/test-framework.js\nclass TestFramework {\n    constructor() {\n        this.tests = [];\n        this.results = {\n            passed: 0,\n            failed: 0,\n            errors: []\n        };\n    }\n\n    // Register a test case with description and test function\n    test(description, testFunction) {\n        this.tests.push({ description, testFunction });\n    }\n\n    // Assert that two values are approximately equal within epsilon tolerance\n    assertApproximatelyEqual(actual, expected, epsilon = 0.001, message = '') {\n        const difference = Math.abs(actual - expected);\n        if (difference > epsilon) {\n            throw new Error(`${message} Expected ${expected}, got ${actual}, difference ${difference} exceeds epsilon ${epsilon}`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Assert that a condition is true\n    assertTrue(condition, message = '') {\n        if (!condition) {\n            throw new Error(`${message} Expected true, got false`);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Assert that two objects have the same properties and values\n    assertObjectsEqual(actual, expected, message = '') {\n        const actualKeys = Object.keys(actual);\n        const expectedKeys = Object.keys(expected);\n        \n        if (actualKeys.length !== expectedKeys.length) {\n            throw new Error(`${message} Object key count mismatch.

Unlike static software systems, games are dynamic simulations where timing, precision, and interactions create emergent behaviors. A small error in physics calculations can cascade into game-breaking behavior - a player might fall through the floor, get stuck in walls, or experience jerky movement. This debugging guide provides systematic approaches to identify, diagnose, and fix the most common issues that arise when building a platformer engine.\n\nThe key insight is that platformer bugs often manifest as **temporal accuracy** problems - issues that only appear under specific timing conditions, frame rates, or interaction sequences. A system that works perfectly at 60fps might break catastrophically at 30fps, or a collision that resolves correctly in isolation might fail when multiple systems interact. This guide categorizes debugging by symptom patterns rather than system boundaries, since platformer issues frequently span multiple components.\n\n### Physics Simulation Issues\n\n**Mental Model**: Physics simulation bugs are like **mechanical clock malfunctions** - a tiny error in one gear affects the entire mechanism's timing and precision. In platformers, physics errors compound over time and create increasingly erratic behavior.\n\nThe most critical physics debugging skill is learning to **separate symptoms from root causes**. When a player clips through a platform, the visible symptom is penetration, but the root cause might be excessive velocity, insufficient collision checks, or incorrect delta time handling. Effective debugging requires understanding the chain of calculations that produce the visible behavior.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Approach | Fix Strategy |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Player falls through solid platforms | Delta time too large causing tunneling | Log `deltaTime` values and entity velocity | Implement `maxDeltaTime` clamping and sub-stepping |\n| Movement feels sluggish or stuttery | Frame rate dependency in physics calculations | Test at different frame rates (30fps, 144fps) | Convert all movement to velocity-based with delta time |\n| Player accelerates infinitely when holding movement key | Missing terminal velocity or friction | Monitor `velocityX` and `velocityY` over time | Add maximum velocity caps and friction coefficients |\n| Gravity feels too weak or strong | Incorrect gravity scaling with delta time | Compare gravity acceleration against expected values | Adjust `GRAVITY` constant and verify delta time multiplication |\n| Player bounces uncontrollably after collision | Collision resolution applying multiple corrections | Log collision resolution steps per frame | Implement collision resolution ordering and epsilon checks |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Delta Time Clamping**\nMany learners forget to clamp `deltaTime` to a maximum value, causing physics instability when frame rates drop. If a frame takes 100ms (10fps), applying full gravity for that duration creates massive velocity spikes that cause tunneling. Always clamp `deltaTime` to `maxDeltaTime` (typically 33.33ms for 30fps minimum) to maintain physics stability.\n\n**Debugging Physics with Trajectory Analysis**\n\nWhen physics behavior seems erratic, implement trajectory logging to trace entity movement over time:\n\n1. Create a debug log that records entity position, velocity, and applied forces each frame\n2. Export the trajectory data and plot it visually to identify patterns\n3. Look for sudden velocity spikes, position discontinuities, or oscillating behavior\n4. Cross-reference trajectory anomalies with frame rate drops or input events\n\n> **Design Insight**: Physics debugging is fundamentally about **temporal accuracy** - ensuring calculations produce consistent results regardless of frame rate. Every physics formula must account for variable delta time, and every force application must be frame-rate independent.\n\n### Collision Detection Problems\n\n**Mental Model**: Collision detection issues are like **security checkpoint failures** - they either let unauthorized entities through (false negatives) or stop legitimate passage (false positives). Both types of failures break the game world's physical laws.\n\nCollision bugs often manifest as **integration bugs** - errors that only appear when multiple collision checks interact. A single AABB test might work perfectly, but combining player-tile collision with player-enemy collision can create unexpected edge cases where collision responses conflict.\n\n| Symptom | Root Cause Analysis | Detection Method | Resolution |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Player gets stuck in corners where tiles meet | Corner clipping due to simultaneous X and Y collision | Place debug tiles in corner configurations | Implement separate X/Y axis collision resolution |\n| Player passes through thin platforms at high speed | Tunneling between collision check positions | Test with various velocity values and tile sizes | Add continuous collision detection or velocity clamping |\n| Player bounces off platforms they should land on | Collision normal calculation errors | Visualize collision normals and penetration vectors | Verify AABB collision resolution logic |\n| One-way platforms block player from below | Incorrect collision direction checking | Log collision direction and player velocity | Check vertical velocity direction before blocking |\n| Player clips into tiles and vibrates rapidly | Floating point precision errors in collision resolution | Monitor entity position values for sub-pixel drift | Implement `COLLISION_EPSILON` for minimum separation |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Collision Resolution Order**\nResolving X and Y collisions simultaneously can cause corner clipping. When a player hits a corner, both horizontal and vertical collision occur. If you resolve both simultaneously, the player might end up inside the tile geometry. Always resolve X-axis collision first, then Y-axis collision, treating each as a separate step.\n\n**AABB Collision Debugging Workflow**\n\nWhen collision detection fails, follow this systematic debugging approach:\n\n1. **Visualize Bounding Boxes**: Draw the actual `Rectangle` objects used for collision testing to verify they match entity visual representations\n2. **Log Collision Coordinates**: Record the exact world coordinates where collision occurs and the tile grid positions being tested\n3. **Trace Grid Conversion**: Verify `worldToGrid` and `gridToWorld` coordinate transformations with known test values\n4. **Test Boundary Conditions**: Specifically test collision at tile boundaries (x = 0, x = TILE_SIZE - 1) where rounding errors occur\n5. **Validate Tile Lookup**: Confirm `getTileAt` returns correct tile IDs for the collision coordinates\n\n> **Critical Debug Pattern**: When collision detection fails, the error is usually in coordinate space conversion. Platformers juggle three coordinate systems: world pixels, tile grid indices, and screen pixels. Bugs often occur at the boundaries between these systems.\n\n### Input System Malfunctions\n\n**Mental Model**: Input system problems are like **telephone game distortions** - the player's intention gets lost or corrupted as it passes through buffering, processing, and state management layers. The result is unresponsive or incorrectly interpreted controls.\n\nInput debugging requires understanding the distinction between **intent-based actions** (jumping, which should be buffered and consumed) and **state-based actions** (movement, which should be checked continuously). Mixing these patterns creates confusing control behavior where actions either don't register or register multiple times.\n\n| Input Symptom | System Analysis | Diagnostic Steps | Correction |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| Jump doesn't register despite key press | Input buffer overflow or timing window too small | Log `keyBuffer` contents and timing | Increase `bufferDuration` or check buffer consumption logic |\n| Double jumping occurs when player doesn't intend it | Key press registered multiple times or consumed incorrectly | Monitor `jumpBuffer` and `onGround` state changes | Ensure `consumeKeyPress` properly removes buffered input |\n| Movement stutters or stops randomly | Key state desynchronization between hardware and software | Compare `isKeyPressed` results with actual key state | Implement `reconcileInputState` to sync input manager |\n| Coyote time doesn't work consistently | Timer reset conditions or timing precision issues | Log `coyoteTimer` values and ground state transitions | Verify timer updates only when appropriate state changes |\n| Input lag or delayed response | Processing input at wrong point in game loop | Trace input processing order relative to physics update | Move input processing to beginning of game loop |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Input Buffering vs State Checking**\nMany learners incorrectly buffer movement input, causing movement to \"stick\" after releasing keys. Movement should use `isKeyPressed` for continuous state checking, while actions like jumping should use `wasKeyJustPressed` with buffering. Never buffer continuous actions - only discrete events.\n\n**Input System Debugging Protocol**\n\nWhen controls feel unresponsive or erratic:\n\n1. **Instrument Key Events**: Log every key press/release with timestamps to verify hardware input registration\n2. **Trace Buffer State**: Monitor input buffer contents each frame to identify timing window issues\n3. **Verify Consumption Logic**: Ensure buffered inputs are properly consumed and not processed multiple times\n4. **Test Frame Rate Independence**: Verify input responsiveness remains consistent at different frame rates\n5. **Validate State Transitions**: Check that player state changes correctly trigger input behavior changes\n\n### Entity Interaction Edge Cases\n\n**Mental Model**: Entity interactions are like **diplomatic negotiations** - multiple parties with different priorities and capabilities must reach agreements about shared space and resources. When the negotiation rules are unclear or contradictory, conflicts arise.\n\nEntity interaction bugs typically manifest as **cascade effects** where a small error in one interaction triggers increasingly severe problems. A player-enemy collision that resolves incorrectly might push the enemy into a wall, causing wall collision issues, which might trigger emergency separation logic that teleports the enemy to an invalid location.\n\n| Interaction Problem | Underlying Issue | Debug Investigation | Fix Implementation |\n|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Player dies when landing on enemy from above (should stomp) | Collision direction detection failure | Log contact normal vectors and relative velocities | Improve stomp detection window and velocity thresholds |\n| Enemy gets stuck at patrol boundaries | Boundary detection or direction reversal logic error | Monitor `patrolStartX`, `patrolEndX`, and `movingRight` state | Add epsilon tolerance for boundary detection |\n| Player passes through enemy without interaction | Collision detection disabled or entity positioning error | Verify entity `getBoundingBox` returns correct coordinates | Validate bounding box calculations and update order |\n| Invulnerability frames don't prevent damage | Timer management or collision check ordering | Track `invulnerabilityTimer` and damage application timing | Ensure damage checks occur after timer validation |\n| Enemy AI behaves erratically after player collision | State corruption during collision resolution | Monitor enemy state variables before and after collision | Implement state validation and recovery mechanisms |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stomp Detection Timing**\nStomp detection often fails because developers check collision direction at the wrong moment. The collision direction when entities first overlap might differ from the direction when collision is processed. Always calculate stomp based on relative velocity at the moment of contact, not the penetration direction during resolution.\n\n**Entity State Validation Framework**\n\nWhen entity interactions produce unexpected results:\n\n1. **Record Pre-Collision State**: Capture position, velocity, and state variables for all entities before collision processing\n2. **Trace Interaction Sequence**: Log the exact order of collision detection, response calculation, and state updates\n3. **Validate Post-Collision State**: Verify all entities remain in valid states after interaction processing\n4. **Test Boundary Interactions**: Specifically test entity interactions at level boundaries and platform edges\n5. **Monitor State Transitions**: Ensure entity state machines transition correctly during and after interactions\n\n### Performance and Frame Rate Issues\n\n**Mental Model**: Performance problems in platformers are like **traffic congestion** - small inefficiencies compound to create system-wide slowdowns. Unlike batch processing systems, games must maintain consistent frame timing, so even brief performance spikes cause visible stuttering.\n\nFrame rate debugging requires understanding the **spiral of death** phenomenon - when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, delta time increases, which often makes subsequent frames take even longer, creating a downward spiral that crashes the game.\n\n| Performance Symptom | Root Performance Issue | Measurement Approach | Optimization Strategy |\n|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Stuttering every few seconds | Garbage collection or memory allocation spikes | Profile memory allocation patterns | Implement object pooling for frequently created entities |\n| Frame rate drops in complex areas | Too many collision checks or rendering calls | Count collision tests and draw calls per frame | Add spatial indexing and viewport culling |\n| Spiral of death during frame drops | Physics simulation time exceeds frame budget | Monitor frame processing time vs target duration | Implement sub-stepping and calculation time budgets |\n| Input becomes unresponsive during lag | Input processing blocked by expensive operations | Profile game loop phase timing | Move expensive operations to separate threads or spread across frames |\n| Memory usage grows continuously | Entity cleanup or resource disposal failure | Track entity count and texture memory over time | Implement proper cleanup in entity removal and level transitions |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Frame Rate Dependency**\nMany performance optimizations inadvertently introduce frame rate dependency. For example, reducing physics update frequency to improve performance can make gameplay feel different at various frame rates. Always verify that optimizations maintain frame-rate independent behavior.\n\n**Performance Monitoring Implementation**\n\nEffective performance debugging requires continuous monitoring:\n\n1. **Frame Time Tracking**: Record the time spent in each game loop phase (input, physics, rendering) to identify bottlenecks\n2. **Memory Allocation Monitoring**: Track object creation and destruction to identify memory leaks or excessive allocations\n3. **Collision Check Counting**: Monitor the number of collision tests per frame to identify inefficient spatial queries\n4. **Delta Time Analysis**: Watch for excessive delta time values that indicate frame rate instability\n5. **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitor texture memory, entity counts, and other resource usage over gameplay sessions\n\n### Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation\n\n**Mental Model**: Error recovery in platformers is like **emergency medical response** - when critical systems fail, you need immediate stabilization to prevent complete system failure, followed by gradual restoration of normal function.\n\nPlatformer error recovery focuses on **graceful degradation** - maintaining core gameplay functionality while sacrificing secondary features. If collision detection fails, emergency separation prevents entities from remaining stuck inside walls. If physics becomes unstable, fallback to simpler movement calculations maintains basic playability.\n\n| Error Category | Emergency Response | Immediate Stabilization | Long-term Recovery |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Entity Stuck in Geometry | `emergencyEntitySeparation` to move entity to valid position | Disable movement until position validated | Reset entity to last known good position or checkpoint |\n| Physics Instability | Clamp velocity to safe maximum values | Reduce physics complexity temporarily | Identify and fix source of instability |\n| Input System Failure | Switch to simplified direct key polling | Buffer critical actions only | Reinitialize input system and restore full functionality |\n| Collision System Corruption | Use simplified bounding box collision only | Disable complex collision features | Rebuild collision state from level data |\n| Memory Exhaustion | Emergency garbage collection and resource cleanup | Reduce entity count and disable non-essential effects | Implement better resource management |\n\n**Automated Error Recovery Protocol**\n\nImplement systematic error detection and recovery:\n\n1. **Boundary Condition Monitoring**: Continuously check that entities remain within valid world boundaries\n2. **State Validation**: Verify critical game state remains consistent (player health ≥ 0, position within level bounds)\n3. **Performance Threshold Monitoring**: Detect when frame times exceed critical thresholds and trigger simplification\n4. **Resource Usage Limits**: Automatically trigger cleanup when memory or entity counts approach limits\n5. **Fallback System Activation**: Provide simplified versions of critical systems that can replace failed components\n\n> **Design Principle**: Error recovery should be **invisible to players when possible**. Emergency entity separation should be imperceptible, performance simplification should maintain gameplay feel, and fallback systems should preserve core game mechanics even if visual fidelity suffers.\n\n### Systematic Debugging Methodology\n\n**Mental Model**: Systematic debugging is like **scientific experimentation** - you form hypotheses about the cause of observed behavior, design controlled tests to validate or refute those hypotheses, and iteratively narrow down the root cause through evidence-based reasoning.\n\nThe key to effective platformer debugging is **reproducing problems consistently**. Many platformer bugs are timing-dependent or emerge from complex interactions, making them difficult to reproduce reliably. Developing techniques for consistent reproduction is essential for systematic diagnosis.\n\n**Reproduction Strategy Framework**\n\n| Bug Category | Reproduction Approach | Controlled Variables | Success Metrics |\n|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Physics Anomalies | Create test levels with specific geometry configurations | Frame rate, input timing, entity starting positions | Bug occurs consistently with same inputs |\n| Collision Failures | Design minimal test cases isolating specific collision scenarios | Entity velocities, collision geometries, approach angles | Collision behavior is predictable and repeatable |\n| Input Issues | Script automated input sequences with precise timing | Key press duration, release timing, frame boundaries | Input response matches expected behavior |\n| Performance Problems | Create stress test scenarios with known entity counts | Entity count, level complexity, active systems | Performance metrics remain within acceptable bounds |\n| Integration Bugs | Test system combinations in isolation before integration | Active systems, interaction types, update order | Each system works correctly alone and together |\n\n**Debugging Tool Implementation**\n\nEffective platformer debugging requires specialized tools built into the game:\n\n1. **Visual Debug Overlays**: Display bounding boxes, velocity vectors, and collision normals directly on the game screen\n2. **Frame-by-Frame Stepping**: Allow pausing and single-step execution to examine exact frame-by-frame behavior\n3. **State Inspector**: Show real-time values of critical variables (position, velocity, timers, state machine states)\n4. **Event Logging**: Record sequences of input events, collision events, and state changes for later analysis\n5. **Performance Profiler**: Display real-time frame timing, collision check counts, and memory usage\n\n> **Critical Debugging Insight**: The most valuable debugging information is **temporal context** - understanding not just what state the system is in, but how it reached that state. Always log the sequence of events leading up to a problem, not just the problem state itself.\n\n### Integration Testing and System Interactions\n\n**Mental Model**: Integration testing for platformers is like **orchestra rehearsal** - each instrument (system) might sound perfect in isolation, but creating harmony requires careful coordination of timing, dynamics, and interaction patterns.\n\nIntegration bugs in platformers often manifest as **emergent behaviors** - complex patterns that arise from simple system interactions but weren't explicitly programmed. A player bouncing between enemies while coyote time is active might trigger unexpected state transitions that break game logic.\n\n**Integration Test Categories**\n\n| System Combination | Critical Test Scenarios | Expected Behavior | Failure Modes |\n|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| Physics + Collision | Player moving at maximum velocity hits corner tile | Smooth collision resolution without clipping | Corner clipping, velocity spikes, position teleporting |\n| Input + Physics | Jump pressed during coyote time while falling | Jump executes normally with proper velocity | Double jump, failed jump, or movement interruption |\n| Entity + Collision | Enemy patrol reaches boundary while player collides | Enemy direction reversal, player collision response | Enemy stuck, player pushed through geometry |\n| Animation + Physics | Player lands while jump animation active | Animation transitions to landing, physics state updates | Animation desync, state machine conflicts |\n| Camera + Collision | Player collision pushes them outside camera deadzone | Camera follows smoothly without jarring movement | Camera snapping, boundary violations |\n\n**System Boundary Testing**\n\nThe most critical integration tests focus on **system boundaries** - the interfaces where one system hands control to another:\n\n1. **Input to Physics Handoff**: Verify input events correctly trigger physics state changes without timing conflicts\n2. **Physics to Collision Transition**: Ensure physics updates and collision resolution maintain consistent entity state\n3. **Collision to Animation Interface**: Confirm collision events properly trigger animation state transitions\n4. **Entity to Level Interaction**: Validate entity behaviors work correctly across different level geometries\n5. **Performance to Gameplay Balance**: Ensure performance optimizations don't compromise gameplay mechanics\n\n### Common Platform-Specific Issues\n\nDifferent platforms and environments introduce unique debugging challenges that affect platformer behavior:\n\n**Browser Environment Issues**\n\n| Browser Problem | Manifestation | Diagnosis | Workaround |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------|\n| Inconsistent frame timing | Stuttering when browser tab loses focus | Monitor `requestAnimationFrame` timing | Implement visibility API handling |\n| Touch input conflicts | Phantom jumps on touch devices | Log touch events vs keyboard events | Separate touch and keyboard input processing |\n| Canvas rendering precision | Blurry sprites or alignment issues | Check pixel ratio and canvas scaling | Implement pixel-perfect rendering adjustments |\n| Memory limitations | Gradual performance degradation | Monitor heap usage over time | Implement aggressive resource cleanup |\n| Audio context restrictions | Sound effects fail to play | Check browser audio policy compliance | Implement user interaction audio unlocking |\n\n**Development vs Production Disparities**\n\nMany platformer bugs only appear in production environments due to different performance characteristics, network conditions, or optimization settings:\n\n1. **Minification Issues**: Variable renaming might break reflection-based systems or debug logging\n2. **Resource Loading Timing**: Assets might load in different orders, affecting initialization sequences\n3. **Performance Profile Changes**: Optimized builds might have different frame timing characteristics\n4. **Error Handling Differences**: Development error reporting might mask issues that surface in production\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe debugging infrastructure for a platformer requires both real-time monitoring tools and post-mortem analysis capabilities. The tools should be lightweight enough to run during development without affecting gameplay performance, but comprehensive enough to capture the complex timing and interaction patterns that characterize platformer bugs.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Debug Overlay | Canvas 2D text

Extensions\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Beyond core milestones - potential enhancements that extend the basic platformer engine into a more sophisticated game development framework\n\nThink of the current platformer engine as a **solid foundation** - like a well-built house with strong bones, working plumbing, and reliable electrical systems. The core systems (physics, collision, input, rendering) provide everything needed for a functional 2D platformer, but there's tremendous potential to transform this foundation into something much more powerful and expressive.\n\nFuture extensions fall into several categories: **advanced physics simulation** that adds richness to player movement and environmental interaction, **visual effects systems** that enhance player feedback and game juice, **content creation tools** that enable rapid level design and iteration, **performance optimizations** that allow for larger and more complex game worlds, and **gameplay mechanics** that expand the types of experiences possible within the platformer framework.\n\nThe key insight when considering extensions is **architectural compatibility** - each enhancement should build upon the existing systems without requiring fundamental rewrites. This modular approach allows developers to add complexity incrementally, testing and refining each new capability before moving to the next enhancement.\n\n> **Design Principle: Progressive Enhancement**\n> Each extension should be additive rather than transformative. The core engine should remain fully functional even if advanced features are disabled or removed. This ensures that learners can implement extensions in any order and always maintain a working game.\n\n### Advanced Physics Simulation\n\nThe current physics engine provides solid velocity-based movement with gravity and collision resolution, but real-world platformers often employ more sophisticated physics simulation to create richer gameplay experiences. Advanced physics extensions can be categorized into **enhanced movement mechanics**, **environmental physics**, and **particle-based simulation**.\n\n**Enhanced Movement Mechanics** extend the basic player physics with additional movement options and constraints. Wall sliding allows players to slide down vertical surfaces at reduced speed, creating new traversal possibilities and adding strategic depth to level design. Wall jumping enables players to leap between parallel surfaces, requiring precise timing and creating exciting vertical challenges. Dashing provides burst movement in any direction, often with temporary invulnerability or collision changes.\n\nThe wall sliding mechanic requires detecting when the player is pressed against a vertical surface while falling. The physics system must distinguish between normal collision resolution (stopping horizontal movement) and wall sliding conditions (allowing controlled downward movement). This involves checking for sustained input toward the wall combined with downward velocity and contact with a vertical surface.\n\n| Wall Sliding State | Input Conditions | Physics Behavior | Duration Limits |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Not Sliding | No wall contact or no input toward wall | Normal falling physics | N/A |\n| Initial Contact | Input toward wall + wall collision + falling | Transition to sliding physics | Immediate |\n| Sliding Active | Sustained input toward wall + wall contact | Reduced falling speed (300px/s vs 600px/s) | No time limit |\n| Sliding Exit | Input released or wall contact lost | Return to normal physics | Immediate transition |\n\n**Environmental Physics** introduces interactive elements that respond to physics simulation. Moving platforms require careful coordination between platform movement and player movement to prevent issues like the player sliding off due to friction simulation. One-way platforms already exist in the basic collision system, but enhanced versions might include platforms that activate/deactivate based on player actions or timer conditions.\n\nWind zones modify player movement by applying additional acceleration in specific directions. This creates areas where normal movement rules change, requiring players to adapt their strategies. The implementation involves defining rectangular regions with associated force vectors that apply additional acceleration to entities within their boundaries.\n\nSprings and bounce pads provide high-velocity launch mechanics, often overriding normal velocity constraints like terminal velocity. These elements require special collision handling that sets specific velocity values rather than just resolving penetration.\n\n| Environmental Element | Trigger Condition | Physics Effect | Implementation Complexity |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| Moving Platform | Player standing on platform | Add platform velocity to player | Medium - requires velocity transfer |\n| Wind Zone | Player within defined rectangle | Apply constant acceleration | Low - simple force application |\n| Spring/Bounce Pad | Player collision from above | Set upward velocity to fixed value | Low - velocity override on collision |\n| Conveyor Belt | Player ground contact | Apply horizontal acceleration | Medium - requires surface friction modification |\n\n**Particle-Based Simulation** adds visual richness and can provide gameplay mechanics. Dust particles when landing or wall sliding provide player feedback about surface interaction. Debris from destroyed blocks adds satisfying destruction effects. Water or lava simulation using particle systems can create hazardous areas with realistic fluid behavior.\n\nThe particle system requires its own update and rendering pipeline, separate from the main entity system. Particles typically have simplified physics (position, velocity, lifetime) and are managed in large batches for performance reasons. The key architectural decision is whether particles interact with the collision system (expensive but realistic) or remain purely visual (efficient but limited).\n\n> **Decision: Particle Interaction Model**\n> - **Context**: Particles could be purely visual effects or interactive physics objects\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Visual-only particles with no collision\n>   2. Full physics particles with collision detection\n>   3. Hybrid system with optional physics interaction\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid system with physics interaction flag per particle type\n> - **Rationale**: Allows visual-only particles for performance while enabling gameplay-relevant particles when needed\n> - **Consequences**: More complex particle system but maximum flexibility for different use cases\n\n### Visual Effects and Animation Enhancements\n\nThe current rendering system provides basic sprite animation and camera management, but modern 2D platformers rely heavily on **visual effects** to communicate game state, provide player feedback, and create engaging presentation. Visual enhancements fall into **advanced animation systems**, **particle effects**, **lighting and shaders**, and **screen effects**.\n\n**Advanced Animation Systems** extend beyond simple flip-book animation to include procedural animation, blend trees, and state-driven animation. Procedural animation allows for dynamic responses to game state - for example, the player's idle animation might change based on health level, or walking animation speed might scale with actual movement velocity.\n\nAnimation blend trees enable smooth transitions between different animation states. Instead of jarring cuts between running and idle animations, blend trees can interpolate between keyframes to create fluid motion. This requires storing multiple animation states simultaneously and calculating weighted averages of sprite positions or frame indices.\n\nState-driven animation connects the animation system directly to entity state machines. The player's animation controller monitors the player's physics state (grounded, falling, jumping) and input state (moving left, moving right, idle) to automatically select appropriate animations. This eliminates the need for manual animation triggering throughout the gameplay code.\n\n| Animation Enhancement | Input Requirements | Output Behavior | Performance Impact |\n|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Procedural Idle | Health value, time elapsed | Varying idle animation based on condition | Low - simple parameter modification |\n| Velocity-Scaled Walking | Current movement speed | Walking animation rate matches movement | Low - frame timing adjustment |\n| Animation Blending | Two animation states + blend weight | Interpolated frames between animations | Medium - requires frame interpolation |\n| State-Driven Control | Entity state machine + input state | Automatic animation selection | Low - simple state mapping |\n\n**Particle Effects** enhance visual feedback for player actions, environmental interactions, and special effects. Jump dust clouds provide satisfying feedback when the player lands after a jump. Wall slide sparks communicate surface interaction. Collect sparkles make item pickup feel rewarding. Death explosions provide dramatic feedback for enemy defeats.\n\nThe particle effects system extends the basic particle simulation with **effect templates** that define common particle behaviors. A jump dust effect template might specify 5-8 particles with initial upward and outward velocities, brown/gray colors, short lifetimes (0.3-0.5 seconds), and gradual size reduction over time.\n\nEffect triggering integrates with the existing game systems through event-based communication. When the physics system detects a landing collision, it can emit a \"player landed\" event that the particle system receives and responds to by spawning the appropriate dust effect at the landing location.\n\n**Lighting and Shaders** add atmospheric depth and can provide gameplay mechanics. Simple lighting simulation using color overlays can create day/night cycles or underground/surface distinctions. Dynamic lighting around torches or player-carried light sources creates exploration mechanics where visibility affects gameplay.\n\nIn a 2D context, lighting is typically implemented through **multiplicative color overlays** rather than full 3D lighting calculations. The base level is rendered normally, then lighting information is applied as color multipliers. Dark areas use darker multipliers (0.3, 0.3, 0.3) while lit areas remain normal (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).\n\nShader effects can add visual polish without requiring complex 3D graphics knowledge. Simple fragment shaders can create water wave distortion, screen-space lighting effects, or damage flash effects. Modern web browsers support WebGL shaders, making these effects accessible even in JavaScript implementations.\n\n**Screen Effects** provide game state communication and dramatic moments. Screen shake during explosions or heavy landings adds impact feedback. Color grading or desaturation during low health creates tension. Slow-motion effects during precise timing moments enhance difficulty and drama.\n\nScreen shake implementation involves temporarily offsetting the camera position by small random amounts. The shake intensity decreases over time, creating a natural falloff. The key is ensuring the shake feels responsive to player actions rather than random or distracting.\n\n| Screen Effect | Trigger Event | Visual Behavior | Duration |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Impact Shake | Enemy stomp, explosion collision | Random camera offset, decreasing intensity | 0.3-0.5 seconds |\n| Damage Flash | Player takes damage | Red color overlay, fade out | 0.1 seconds |\n| Slow Motion | Entering bullet-time or precision mode | Reduced game speed, audio pitch down | Until player input |\n| Death Desaturation | Player health reaches zero | Gradual color desaturation | 1-2 seconds |\n\n### Level Editor and Content Creation Tools\n\nThe current level system loads static tile data from files, but game development benefits enormously from **real-time level editing tools** that enable rapid iteration and testing. Level editor functionality can be integrated directly into the game engine or provided as separate tooling, with trade-offs between convenience and complexity.\n\n**In-Game Level Editing** allows developers to modify levels while the game is running, immediately testing changes without reloading or recompiling. This approach provides instant feedback but requires careful separation between editor functionality and gameplay systems. The editor mode might pause normal game physics while allowing camera movement and tile placement.\n\nIn-game editing requires extending the input system to handle editor-specific controls. Mouse input for tile placement, keyboard shortcuts for different tile types, and modifier keys for copy/paste or selection operations. The challenge is ensuring editor controls don't interfere with normal gameplay input when editor mode is disabled.\n\nThe tile placement system needs **grid snapping** to align placed tiles with the existing tilemap structure. This involves converting mouse coordinates to tile grid coordinates using the same `worldToGrid` conversion used by the collision system. Visual feedback showing the currently selected tile position helps users understand where tiles will be placed.\n\n| Editor Operation | Input Method | System Requirements | Data Changes |\n|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Tile Placement | Mouse click on grid position | Coordinate conversion, collision update | Modify tiles array at grid coordinates |\n| Tile Deletion | Right-click or delete key | Selection detection, validation | Set tile to empty (ID 0) |\n| Tile Selection | Mouse drag or shift-click | Rectangle selection logic | Maintain selection state |\n| Copy/Paste | Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V with selection | Clipboard storage, position offset | Duplicate tile patterns |\n\n**Asset Management** becomes crucial as level complexity increases. The editor needs systems for organizing tile sets, managing sprite atlases, and handling level-specific assets like background images or special effect definitions. This often involves file system integration for loading and saving asset files.\n\nLevel validation ensures that created levels are playable and don't contain impossible situations. Basic validation might check that the player start position is on solid ground, that all areas are reachable, and that checkpoint positions are valid. Advanced validation could simulate player movement to verify that all intended paths are actually traversable.\n\n**External Level Editor** provides more sophisticated editing capabilities at the cost of requiring separate tooling. External editors can offer features like multi-layer editing, advanced selection tools, scripting support, and asset management interfaces that would be complex to implement within the game engine itself.\n\nThe external editor approach requires defining a **level format specification** that both the editor and game engine understand. This format needs to handle not just tile data but also entity placement, checkpoint locations, special zones (like wind areas), and metadata like level name and completion requirements.\n\n> **Decision: Level Editor Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Need efficient level creation and iteration workflow for content development\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. In-game editor with runtime modification capabilities\n>   2. External standalone editor with import/export workflow\n>   3. Web-based editor with real-time preview integration\n> - **Decision**: In-game editor with file export capabilities\n> - **Rationale**: Provides immediate testing feedback while maintaining simple deployment and dependency management\n> - **Consequences**: Some advanced editing features may be limited, but rapid iteration workflow is optimized\n\n### Performance Optimization Extensions\n\nThe current engine architecture prioritizes clarity and learning over maximum performance, but real games often require optimization to handle larger levels, more entities, or target lower-end hardware. Performance extensions focus on **spatial optimization**, **rendering efficiency**, **memory management**, and **computational optimization**.\n\n**Spatial Optimization** addresses the fact that collision detection currently checks every entity against every tile, which scales poorly as level size increases. Spatial indexing techniques like **quad-trees** or **spatial hash grids** can dramatically reduce collision detection overhead by organizing entities and tiles into spatial regions.\n\nA spatial hash grid divides the game world into fixed-size cells (typically larger than individual tiles) and maintains lists of entities within each cell. When checking collisions for an entity, the system only needs to test against other entities in the same cell and adjacent cells. This reduces collision checks from O(n²) to approximately O(n) for well-distributed entities.\n\nThe quad-tree approach recursively subdivides space into four quadrants, with each node containing entities that fit within its bounds. Entities that span multiple regions are stored in parent nodes. This approach adapts better to uneven entity distribution but requires more complex insertion and removal logic.\n\n| Spatial Structure | Memory Overhead | Query Performance | Update Performance | Best Use Case |\n|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Brute Force | Minimal | O(n²) | O(1) | Small entity counts (<50) |\n| Hash Grid | Medium | O(1) average | O(1) | Evenly distributed entities |\n| Quad-tree | High | O(log n) | O(log n) | Clustered or sparse entities |\n| R-tree | High | O(log n) | O(log n) | Large, irregular shaped entities |\n\n**Rendering Efficiency** optimizations focus on reducing draw calls and GPU state changes. The current sprite rendering system draws each entity individually, but **sprite batching** can group multiple sprites using the same texture atlas into single draw calls.\n\nSprite batching requires collecting all sprites that share the same texture, sorting them by depth or rendering order, then submitting them as a single batch of vertices to the graphics system. This is particularly effective for tile rendering, where hundreds of tiles might use the same texture atlas.\n\nViewport culling becomes essential for large levels. Instead of rendering every tile and entity in the level, the rendering system should calculate which elements are actually visible within the camera bounds and skip rendering for off-screen elements. The camera's `getVisibleTiles` method provides the foundation for this optimization.\n\nLevel-of-detail (LOD) systems can render distant or less important elements with reduced quality. For example, background tiles might use smaller textures when viewed from far away, or complex animations might run at reduced frame rates when entities are far from the player.\n\n**Memory Management** optimizations address garbage collection pressure and memory usage patterns. The current entity system creates and destroys objects frequently, which can cause garbage collection stutters that interrupt smooth gameplay.\n\nObject pooling maintains pre-allocated pools of commonly used objects (entities, particles, collision results) and reuses them instead of creating new instances. When an enemy is defeated, instead of destroying the enemy object, it's returned to a pool for reuse when spawning new enemies.\n\nAsset streaming allows loading and unloading level sections dynamically as the player moves through the world. This enables much larger game worlds without requiring all assets to be loaded simultaneously. The challenge is predicting which assets will be needed soon and preloading them before they're required.\n\n**Computational Optimization** focuses on algorithm efficiency and reducing unnecessary calculations. The physics update loop currently processes every entity every frame, but many optimizations are possible.\n\nSleeping entities that haven't moved recently can skip physics updates until something interacts with them. This is particularly effective for enemies that spend most of their time in idle patrol loops or environmental elements that only activate when the player approaches.\n\nTemporal optimization spreads expensive calculations across multiple frames. Instead of updating all enemy AI every frame, the system might update one-third of enemies each frame, ensuring each enemy gets updated every three frames but reducing per-frame computational load.\n\nFixed-point arithmetic can improve performance and ensure deterministic behavior across different hardware. Instead of floating-point coordinates, the system uses integer coordinates with an implicit decimal scale (e.g., 1000 units = 1 pixel). This eliminates floating-point precision issues and can be faster on some hardware.\n\n### Advanced Gameplay Mechanics\n\nThe core platformer engine supports basic movement, jumping, and enemy interaction, but many successful platformers incorporate additional mechanics that create unique gameplay experiences. Advanced mechanics fall into **power-up systems**, **collectibles and progression**, **interactive objects**, and **special movement abilities**.\n\n**Power-Up Systems** temporarily or permanently modify player capabilities. Temporary power-ups might increase jump height, provide invulnerability, or enable special abilities like double-jumping or wall-running. Permanent upgrades unlock new areas by providing abilities like higher jumps or breaking specific block types.\n\nPower-up implementation requires extending the player entity with an **ability state system** that tracks active power-ups, their remaining durations, and their effects on player physics. This involves modifying physics calculations based on active power-ups and providing visual feedback about power-up status.\n\nThe double-jump power-up serves as a good example. It requires tracking whether the player has used their ground jump, their air jump, or both. The jump input handling must check both ground state and available air jumps. Power-up collection sets a flag enabling double-jump capability.\n\n| Power-Up Type | Duration | Physics Modification | Implementation Complexity |\n|---------------|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Speed Boost | 10 seconds | Increase horizontal acceleration by 50% | Low - modify movement constants |\n| High Jump | 15 seconds | Increase jump velocity from 400 to 600 | Low - modify jump constants |\n| Double Jump | Permanent | Allow second jump while airborne | Medium - track jump state |\n| Wall Run | Permanent | Enable wall sliding and wall jumping | High - new physics behaviors |\n\n**Collectibles and Progression** provide goals beyond level completion and can gate access to new areas or abilities. Basic collectibles like coins or gems might unlock bonus levels or provide extra lives. Key items enable progression by unlocking doors or providing necessary abilities.\n\nCollectible tracking requires persistent storage across level transitions and game sessions. The save system must track which collectibles have been obtained in each level and maintain counters for cumulative collectibles like coins.\n\nAchievement systems can provide additional goals and replay incentive. Achievements might require collecting all items in a level, completing levels within time limits, or demonstrating mastery of specific mechanics. The achievement system needs to monitor game events and trigger unlock conditions.\n\n**Interactive Objects** expand environmental possibilities beyond static platforms. Switches might open doors, activate moving platforms, or disable hazards. Pushable blocks create puzzle elements where players must arrange objects to access new areas. Destructible terrain adds action elements and can hide secret areas.\n\nSwitch systems require **state management** that persists within a level session. When a switch is activated, it must communicate with its connected objects to trigger appropriate changes. This can be implemented through event systems or direct object references depending on complexity needs.\n\nPushable blocks require physics integration where player movement can impart velocity to specific objects. This involves modifying collision resolution to transfer velocity rather than just preventing penetration. The blocks need their own collision detection against level geometry and other entities.\n\n**Special Movement Abilities** dramatically expand player capabilities and enable new level design possibilities. Ledge grabbing allows players to hang from platform edges and climb up, requiring detection of specific collision conditions and new input handling for climbing actions.\n\nDash abilities provide burst movement in any direction, often with limited uses that recharge over time or when touching ground. Dash implementation requires temporarily overriding normal physics constraints and providing invulnerability or modified collision behavior during the dash.\n\nGrappling hooks or swinging mechanics introduce complex physics simulation involving rope constraints and pendulum motion. These systems require understanding of constraint-based physics and careful tuning to feel responsive rather than realistic.\n\n> **Design Insight: Mechanical Complexity**\n> Each additional gameplay mechanic multiplies the complexity of level design and testing. A platformer with run, jump, wall-slide, dash, and grapple abilities has hundreds of possible movement combinations that level designers must consider. Start with one additional mechanic and fully explore its possibilities before adding more.\n\n### Content Creation Pipeline Extensions\n\nAs the platformer grows in scope and sophistication, the **content creation pipeline** becomes increasingly important. Extensions in this area focus on **automated testing**, **content validation**, **asset pipeline optimization**, and **collaboration tools**.\n\n**Automated Testing** for gameplay mechanics ensures that changes to physics or collision systems don't break existing content. Automated tests can simulate player input sequences and verify expected outcomes - for example, ensuring that a specific jump sequence successfully traverses a challenging level section.\n\nPhysics regression testing captures current behavior as reference and detects unintended changes. When modifying gravity constants or collision resolution, automated tests verify that existing levels remain completable and that player movement still feels correct.\n\nPerformance regression testing monitors frame rates and memory usage to detect optimization regressions. As new features are added, automated performance tests ensure that frame rates remain stable and memory usage doesn't grow excessively.\n\n**Content Validation** tools help detect common level design problems before they reach players. Accessibility validation might check that levels don't require precise timing that excludes players with motor difficulties. Difficulty curve validation could analyze the spacing and intensity of challenges to ensure appropriate progression.\n\nPlaytesting automation can simulate different player skill levels by varying input timing precision and decision-making speed. This helps identify level sections that are too difficult for novice players or too trivial for experienced players.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe future extensions described above represent a roadmap for growing the basic platformer engine into a sophisticated game development framework. However, implementing all extensions simultaneously would be overwhelming and counterproductive. Instead, extensions should be prioritized based on **immediate gameplay needs**, **learning objectives**, and **technical dependencies**.\n\n#### Extension Priority Matrix\n\n| Extension Category | Learning Value | Implementation Difficulty | Player Impact | Recommended Order |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Advanced Animation | High | Low | High | 1st - Build on existing animation system |\n| Particle Effects | Medium | Medium | High | 2nd - Enhances visual feedback |\n| In-Game Level Editor | High | Medium | Medium | 3rd - Accelerates content creation |\n| Spatial Optimization | High | High | Low (until scale requires it) | 4th - Performance becomes critical |\n| Power-Up Systems | Medium | Medium | High | 5th - Expands gameplay possibilities |\n| Lighting Effects | Low | High | Medium | 6th - Polish rather than core functionality |\n\n#### Technology Recommendations for JavaScript Implementation\n\n| Extension | Simple Approach | Advanced Approach |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Particle System | Array of objects with position/velocity | WebGL point sprites with instancing |\n| Spatial Indexing | Hash grid with Map objects | Optimized quad-tree with object pooling |\n| Level Editor | HTML form controls overlaid on canvas | Full ImGui-style in-canvas interface |\n| Animation Blending | Linear interpolation between frames | Cubic spline interpolation with easing |\n| Shader Effects | Canvas 2D composite operations | WebGL fragment shaders |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure for Extensions\n\n```\nplatformer-engine/\n  src/\n    core/                    ← existing core systems\n      physics.js\n      collision.js\n      entity.js\n    extensions/              ← new extension modules\n      particles/\n        ParticleSystem.js\n        ParticleEffect.js\n        effects/             ← predefined effect templates\n          jumpDust.js\n          wallSlideParticles.js\n      animation/\n        AnimationBlender.js\n        StateDriver.js\n      editor/\n        LevelEditor.js\n        EditorInput.js\n        EditorUI.js\n      optimization/\n        SpatialGrid.js\n        EntityPool.js\n      powerups/\n        PowerUpManager.js\n        powerup-types/       ← individual power-up implementations\n          DoubleJump.js\n          SpeedBoost.js\n```\n\n#### Extension Integration Pattern\n\nEach extension should follow a consistent integration pattern that minimizes impact on existing systems:\n\n```javascript\n// Extension base class providing common integration points\nclass GameExtension {\n    constructor(engine) {\n        this.engine = engine;\n        this.enabled = false;\n    }\n    \n    // Called during engine initialization\n    initialize() {\n        // TODO: Set up extension-specific systems\n        // TODO: Register event listeners for engine events\n        // TODO: Initialize any required data structures\n    }\n    \n    // Called each frame during update phase\n    update(deltaTime) {\n        if (!this.enabled) return;\n        // TODO: Process extension-specific logic\n        // TODO: Update extension state\n    }\n    \n    // Called each frame during render phase\n    render(renderer, camera) {\n        if (!this.enabled) return;\n        // TODO: Render extension-specific visuals\n        // TODO: Handle any UI elements\n    }\n    \n    // Called during engine cleanup\n    cleanup() {\n        // TODO: Release resources\n        // TODO: Unregister event listeners\n    }\n    \n    enable() { this.enabled = true; }\n    disable() { this.enabled = false; }\n}\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints for Extensions\n\n**Particle System Extension Checkpoint:**\n- Implement basic particle spawning and rendering\n- Create jump dust effect that triggers on player landing\n- Verify particles respect camera viewport and don't render off-screen\n- Expected behavior: Dust cloud appears at player feet when landing from jump\n- Performance check: 100+ particles should maintain 60fps\n\n**Level Editor Extension Checkpoint:**\n- Implement tile placement with mouse click\n- Add tile selection palette with different tile types\n- Enable saving and loading modified levels\n- Expected behavior: Click to place tiles, changes persist after save/reload\n- Validation: Placed tiles have correct collision behavior\n\n**Animation Enhancement Checkpoint:**\n- Implement state-driven animation selection\n- Add smooth transitions between idle and walking animations\n- Create velocity-scaled walking animation\n- Expected behavior: Animation automatically changes based on player state\n- Polish check: No jarring animation cuts during state transitions\n\n#### Common Extension Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Extension System Coupling**\nExtensions that directly modify core engine code create maintenance nightmares and prevent modular development. Each extension should interact with core systems through well-defined interfaces and event systems rather than modifying engine internals.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Performance Extension Premature Optimization**\nImplementing spatial optimization or advanced rendering techniques before they're actually needed wastes development time and adds complexity without benefit. Profile actual performance bottlenecks before adding optimization extensions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Feature Creep in Extensions**\nExtensions can easily grow beyond their intended scope, particularly level editors which can become complex applications in their own right. Define clear boundaries for each extension and resist the temptation to add \"just one more feature.\"\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Extension Dependency Chains**\nWhen extensions depend on other extensions, the system becomes fragile and difficult to maintain. Design extensions to be as independent as possible, with clear documentation of any dependencies.\n\nThe future extensions outlined in this section transform the basic platformer engine into a comprehensive game development framework. However, the most successful approach is **incremental enhancement** - implementing one extension completely before moving to the next, ensuring each addition truly improves the development experience before adding complexity.\n\nEach extension should be evaluated not just on its technical merit, but on how it serves the broader goal of creating engaging platformer experiences. The best extensions are those that either significantly improve the player experience or dramatically reduce the effort required to create compelling content.\n\n\n## Glossary\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones - provides essential terminology definitions used throughout the entire platformer engine implementation\n\nUnderstanding 2D platformer development requires mastering a specialized vocabulary that bridges game design, physics simulation, and software engineering. This glossary serves as a **technical dictionary** for the domain-specific language used throughout the platformer engine design. Think of it as learning the professional vocabulary of a new field - each term represents a precise concept that prevents miscommunication and ensures consistent understanding across all system components.\n\nThe terminology in this glossary falls into several categories: game physics concepts that differ from real-world physics, input handling patterns specific to responsive game controls, collision detection algorithms optimized for tile-based environments, rendering techniques for 2D graphics, and performance optimization strategies for real-time systems. Mastering these terms enables clear communication about complex technical concepts and facilitates deeper understanding of the underlying systems.\n\n### Core Game Development Terminology\n\n**Delta time** represents the elapsed time since the last frame update, measured in seconds as a floating-point value. This fundamental concept enables frame-rate independence by scaling all time-based calculations by the actual time elapsed rather than assuming a fixed frame duration. Delta time prevents the spiral of death where slow frames cause larger time steps, leading to even slower frames in a cascading failure.\n\n**Frame-rate independence** ensures consistent behavior across different display refresh rates and system performance levels. A game running at 30fps should exhibit identical physics behavior to the same game running at 144fps, with movement distances and animation speeds remaining proportional to real-world time rather than frame count.\n\n**Theatrical physics** describes game physics systems that prioritize feel and responsiveness over realistic simulation. Unlike scientific physics engines that model real-world forces accurately, theatrical physics implements simplified rules designed to create satisfying player experiences. Examples include instant direction changes that would require impossible acceleration in reality, or gravity that applies differently during jumping versus falling.\n\n**Terminal velocity** sets the maximum falling speed limit to prevent objects from accelerating infinitely under constant gravity. This parameter balances realistic acceleration with gameplay constraints, ensuring falling doesn't become uncontrollable while maintaining responsive physics feedback.\n\n**Spiral of death** occurs when frame processing time exceeds the target frame duration, causing increasingly large delta time values that make subsequent frames even slower. This cascading performance failure can render a game unplayable as physics calculations compound exponentially.\n\n### Input System Terminology\n\n**Input buffering** captures and temporarily stores button press events within a time window, allowing responsive controls even when the press occurs slightly before the game state would normally allow the action. This technique bridges the gap between human reaction timing and precise game state requirements.\n\n**Jump buffering** specifically remembers jump button presses for a short duration before landing, automatically executing the jump when the player touches the ground. This creates more responsive jumping controls by accommodating the natural tendency to press jump slightly before reaching a platform.\n\n**Coyote time** allows players to initiate jumps for a brief period after leaving a platform edge, named after the cartoon character who runs off cliffs but doesn't fall until looking down. This grace period compensates for the imprecision of human timing and creates more forgiving platforming controls.\n\n**Intent-based actions** represent discrete player intentions like jumping or attacking that should be buffered when input occurs at suboptimal timing. These actions have clear start and end points and benefit from input forgiveness systems.\n\n**State-based actions** encompass continuous player control like movement direction that should be checked directly each frame. These actions reflect ongoing player intent rather than discrete commands and don't require buffering.\n\n### Collision Detection and Physics Terminology\n\n**AABB** (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) defines rectangular collision boundaries aligned with coordinate axes, simplifying intersection testing through efficient min/max coordinate comparisons. AABB collision detection forms the foundation for most 2D platformer collision systems due to its computational efficiency and intuitive behavior.\n\n**Penetration resolution** separates overlapping objects after collision detection identifies an intersection. This process determines the minimum movement required to separate objects while preserving logical positioning and preventing objects from becoming permanently stuck within each other.\n\n**Collision epsilon** establishes a minimum separation distance that accounts for floating-point precision limitations. Objects separated by distances smaller than epsilon are considered touching, preventing oscillation caused by tiny numerical errors in collision calculations.\n\n**Tunneling** occurs when fast-moving entities pass completely through collision geometry between frames without detection. This artifact results from discrete collision checking that only tests positions at frame boundaries rather than continuous collision along movement paths.\n\n**Corner clipping** happens when entities moving diagonally become stuck at tile intersections due to simultaneous collision on both axes. Proper collision resolution handles X and Y axes separately to prevent this common pathfinding issue.\n\n### Entity and AI Terminology\n\n**Stomp detection** determines when a player successfully defeats an enemy by landing on top, typically requiring downward velocity and contact from above. This mechanic distinguishes between harmful side collisions and beneficial top-down defeats.\n\n**Patrol AI** implements simple back-and-forth enemy movement between defined waypoints. This fundamental AI pattern provides predictable enemy behavior that players can learn and exploit strategically.\n\n**Invulnerability frames** grant temporary damage immunity after taking a hit, preventing rapid successive damage and providing visual feedback through sprite flickering or color changes. This mechanic balances challenge with fairness in collision-dense scenarios.\n\n### Level Design and Architecture Terminology\n\n**Tilemap** organizes level geometry as a 2D grid of tile IDs, where each ID references a specific tile type with associated visual and collision properties. This structure enables efficient level storage, editing, and collision detection through discrete grid-based calculations.\n\n**Collision geometry** represents the physical boundaries derived from tile data that determine where entities can and cannot move. This geometry may differ from visual tile appearance, allowing decorative elements that don't affect gameplay and invisible barriers for game design purposes.\n\n**Checkpoint** establishes save points for player respawn after death, storing position and potentially game state information. Checkpoints balance challenge with progression by limiting setback distance while maintaining meaningful consequences for failure.\n\n**Spatial indexing** organizes game objects by location for efficient proximity queries and collision detection. This optimization prevents the need to check every object against every other object by partitioning space into regions that can be queried selectively.\n\n**Coordinate conversion** transforms between world pixels and tile grid positions, enabling efficient collision queries against the tile-based level structure. This conversion bridges the gap between precise entity positioning and discrete tile-based collision detection.\n\n### Rendering and Animation Terminology\n\n**Flip-book animation** creates motion illusion through sequential sprite frames displayed at consistent intervals. This traditional animation technique forms the basis for character movement, environmental effects, and visual feedback systems in 2D games.\n\n**Texture atlas** combines multiple sprite frames into a single image file, reducing draw calls and memory usage through batch rendering optimization. Frame coordinates within the atlas enable efficient sprite selection without texture switching overhead.\n\n**Sprite batching** groups multiple sprites sharing the same texture into single draw calls, dramatically improving rendering performance for scenes with many similar objects like particles, tiles, or repeated environmental elements.\n\n**Viewport culling** skips rendering of objects outside the visible screen area, conserving processing power for complex scenes. This optimization becomes critical for large levels with many entities and detailed tile-based backgrounds.\n\n**Pixel-perfect positioning** rounds coordinates to integer values, preventing sub-pixel sprite positioning that causes visual blurriness in pixel art games. This technique maintains crisp visual presentation but requires careful coordinate management.\n\n### Camera and View Management Terminology\n\n**Deadzone** defines a screen region where the player can move without triggering camera adjustment. This creates stable viewing areas that prevent constant camera motion while maintaining the player's position within the frame.\n\n**Look-ahead** offsets the camera in the movement direction to show more area ahead of the player. This anticipatory positioning helps players see upcoming obstacles and plan their movement more effectively.\n\n**Boundary constraints** prevent the camera from showing areas outside the defined level bounds, avoiding empty space or undefined regions that would break visual immersion.\n\n**Coordinate transformation** converts between world space coordinates and screen space coordinates, enabling proper entity positioning relative to camera movement and viewport dimensions.\n\n### Performance and Optimization Terminology\n\n**Graceful degradation** maintains core functionality while sacrificing secondary features when system performance degrades. This approach prioritizes essential gameplay systems over visual enhancements or convenience features during performance stress.\n\n**Delta time clamping** limits maximum time steps to prevent physics instability during performance hiccups or frame rate drops. This technique prevents large time deltas from causing entities to move impossibly far in a single update.\n\n**Object pooling** reuses allocated objects to reduce garbage collection overhead, particularly important for frequently created and destroyed entities like particles, projectiles, or temporary effects.\n\n**Temporal optimization** spreads expensive calculations across multiple frames to maintain consistent frame rates. Non-critical operations can be distributed over time rather than performed entirely within single frame updates.\n\n### Error Handling and Robustness Terminology\n\n**Emergency collision recovery** provides fallback separation techniques when normal collision resolution fails to separate overlapping entities. This safety net prevents entities from becoming permanently stuck in invalid positions.\n\n**Input desynchronization** occurs when the input system's internal state diverges from actual hardware input state, causing missed presses or phantom inputs. Recovery mechanisms re-establish synchronization between software state and hardware reality.\n\n**Cascade effect** describes how small errors amplify into game-breaking behavior through system interactions. Understanding cascade potential helps prioritize error handling for systems with high downstream impact.\n\n**Boundary condition validation** tests system behavior at parameter limits and edge cases where normal operation might fail. This validation prevents undefined behavior when values approach or exceed expected ranges.\n\n**Integration bugs** arise from unexpected interactions between correctly implemented individual systems. These emergent failures require testing complete system combinations rather than isolated component validation.\n\n### Advanced Features and Extensions Terminology\n\n**Progressive enhancement** adds features in layers that don't break existing functionality, enabling modular development where advanced capabilities build upon stable foundations without compromising core systems.\n\n**State-driven animation** automatically selects appropriate animation sequences based on entity state rather than requiring explicit animation management. This approach simplifies animation coordination and ensures visual consistency with gameplay state.\n\n**Effect templates** provide predefined particle behavior patterns that can be instantiated with different parameters, enabling rich visual effects without requiring unique implementation for each variation.\n\n**Extension integration pattern** establishes consistent approaches for adding modular functionality to the core engine, enabling third-party enhancements or experimental features without compromising system stability.\n\n**Content validation** implements automated checking of level design quality, detecting common design problems like unreachable areas, impossible jumps, or missing collision geometry before runtime errors occur.\n\n### Testing and Verification Terminology\n\n**Trajectory analysis** records and analyzes entity movement paths over time to verify physics accuracy and detect anomalies in movement behavior. This technique helps validate frame-rate independence and collision resolution correctness.\n\n**Temporal accuracy** ensures correct timing behavior in frame-rate independent systems by validating that time-based calculations produce consistent results across different frame rates and delta time variations.\n\n**Performance degradation** monitoring tracks system performance over time to detect memory leaks, algorithmic inefficiencies, or resource accumulation that gradually reduces game performance.\n\n**Milestone checkpoints** provide concrete verification steps for each development phase, establishing clear success criteria and debugging guidance when systems don't behave as expected.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe terminology in this glossary directly corresponds to concepts implemented throughout the platformer engine. Understanding these terms enables more effective use of the technical documentation and facilitates communication about complex game development concepts.\n\n#### Terminology Usage Guidelines\n\n| Category | When to Use | Example Context |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Physics Terms | Describing movement, collision, or time-based systems | \"Apply delta time scaling to prevent spiral of death\" |\n| Input Terms | Discussing control responsiveness and player interaction | \"Implement jump buffering with 100ms window for coyote time\" |\n| Collision Terms | Explaining intersection testing and resolution logic | \"Use AABB detection with penetration resolution and collision epsilon\" |\n| Rendering Terms | Describing visual systems and performance optimization | \"Batch sprites from texture atlas with viewport culling\" |\n| AI Terms | Implementing enemy behavior and interaction systems | \"Create patrol AI with stomp detection and invulnerability frames\" |\n\n#### Common Terminology Mistakes\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Confusing Delta Time with Frame Rate**\nMany developers incorrectly assume delta time and frame rate are interchangeable concepts. Delta time represents elapsed duration (in seconds), while frame rate represents frequency (frames per second). Using frame rate for scaling calculations creates frame-rate dependent behavior that breaks on different hardware.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mixing Physics Terminology**\nUsing real-world physics terminology inappropriately in game contexts can create confusion. \"Acceleration\" in theatrical physics often means instant velocity changes, while in real physics it requires time integration. Always specify whether discussing realistic physics simulation or game-specific theatrical physics.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Overloading \"Collision\" Terms**\nThe term \"collision\" encompasses detection (testing for intersection), response (determining what happens), and resolution (separating overlapping objects). Using \"collision\" generically without specifying which phase creates ambiguous technical discussions.\n\n#### Terminology Cross-References\n\nUnderstanding how terminology connects across systems helps build comprehensive mental models:\n\n- **Input buffering** enables **coyote time** and **jump buffering** for responsive controls\n- **Delta time** enables **frame-rate independence** and prevents **spiral of death**\n- **AABB collision** requires **penetration resolution** to handle **tunneling** and **corner clipping**\n- **Spatial indexing** optimizes **collision detection** for **tilemap** systems\n- **Viewport culling** improves **sprite batching** performance in **texture atlas** rendering\n- **State-driven animation** coordinates with **entity system** state for **flip-book animation**\n\nThis interconnected terminology forms a coherent technical vocabulary that enables precise discussion of platformer engine implementation details. Mastering these terms facilitates deeper understanding of system relationships and design patterns throughout game development.\n"}
