The key architectural challenge is orchestrating these security mechanisms in the correct order while maintaining usability and performance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section provides foundational context for all milestones (1-5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The challenge of safely executing untrusted code represents one of the most fundamental problems in computer security. Whether running user-submitted scripts, processing uploaded files, or executing third-party plugins, systems must balance functionality with security. Traditional approaches to this problem have significant limitations that make them unsuitable for many modern use cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-high-security-prison\">Mental Model: The High Security Prison</h3>\n<p>Think of a process sandbox like a <strong>high-security prison designed to contain dangerous inmates</strong>. Just as a maximum-security facility uses multiple layers of containment—perimeter walls, guard towers, internal barriers, restricted movement, limited resources, and constant monitoring—a robust process sandbox must employ multiple security mechanisms that work together to prevent escape.</p>\n<p>In this analogy, the <strong>untrusted code is the dangerous prisoner</strong> who cannot be trusted to follow rules and will actively attempt to break out. A single security measure, like a simple fence, is insufficient because prisoners are clever and motivated. They might dig tunnels (exploit filesystem paths), bribe guards (exploit setuid binaries), impersonate staff (privilege escalation), or exhaust prison resources (denial of service attacks).</p>\n<p>The <strong>defense-in-depth approach</strong> mirrors how real prisons operate. Even if an inmate bypasses one security layer—say, they pick a cell lock—they still face additional barriers: locked corridor doors, guard checkpoints, perimeter walls, and external monitoring. Each layer has a different mechanism of action: physical barriers, human oversight, technological detection, and resource constraints.</p>\n<p>Similarly, our process sandbox employs multiple complementary security primitives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Namespaces</strong> act like the prison&#39;s <strong>separate wings and buildings</strong>, creating isolated views where the prisoner believes they&#39;re in a different facility entirely</li>\n<li><strong>Filesystem isolation</strong> serves as <strong>restricted movement areas</strong>, limiting which locations the prisoner can access</li>\n<li><strong>Seccomp filtering</strong> functions like <strong>strict rule enforcement</strong>, blocking specific dangerous actions entirely</li>\n<li><strong>Cgroups</strong> operate as <strong>resource rationing</strong>, preventing any single prisoner from consuming all available food, water, or electricity</li>\n<li><strong>Capability dropping</strong> resembles <strong>privilege revocation</strong>, removing special permissions that could enable escape or harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key insight is that <strong>security layers must be independent and non-bypassable</strong>. If the prisoner finds a way around one restriction, the others still contain them. This redundancy is not wasteful—it&#39;s essential for high-assurance security.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsecurity-layers.svg\" alt=\"Defense in Depth Security Layers\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-sandboxing-approaches\">Existing Sandboxing Approaches</h3>\n<p>Before designing our process sandbox, we must understand existing approaches and their limitations. Each represents different trade-offs between security, performance, and complexity.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Security Level</th>\n<th>Performance Overhead</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Resource Usage</th>\n<th>Typical Use Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Virtual Machines</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>High (10-30%)</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>High (GB RAM)</td>\n<td>Cloud isolation, OS-level sandboxing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Containers</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Medium (5-15%)</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Medium (MB RAM)</td>\n<td>Application packaging, microservices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Language Sandboxes</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Low (1-5%)</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Low (KB RAM)</td>\n<td>Browser scripts, embedded scripting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Isolation</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Low (1-3%)</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Low (KB RAM)</td>\n<td>Plugin systems, code execution services</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"virtual-machines\">Virtual Machines</h4>\n<p>Virtual machines provide the <strong>strongest isolation</strong> by running untrusted code in a completely separate operating system instance. The hypervisor creates hardware-level isolation between the guest and host systems. Even if untrusted code achieves complete compromise of the guest OS, it remains contained within the virtual machine boundaries.</p>\n<p>However, VMs have significant drawbacks for many use cases. They require <strong>substantial resource overhead</strong>—typically hundreds of megabytes of RAM and multiple CPU seconds for startup. This makes them impractical for short-lived tasks or high-frequency operations. Additionally, VM management introduces operational complexity around disk images, network configuration, and snapshot management.</p>\n<p>VMs excel for <strong>long-running workloads</strong> where the startup cost can be amortized, such as cloud computing instances or development environments. They&#39;re less suitable for rapid code execution services or embedded sandboxing within applications.</p>\n<h4 id=\"system-containers\">System Containers</h4>\n<p>Technologies like Docker provide <strong>OS-level virtualization</strong> using Linux namespaces and cgroups. Containers share the host kernel but present isolated userspace environments. This approach offers better performance than VMs while maintaining strong isolation boundaries.</p>\n<p>Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes have made containers the standard for <strong>application deployment and scaling</strong>. However, containers have limitations for untrusted code execution. The shared kernel creates potential attack surfaces through system call interfaces. Container escape vulnerabilities, while rare, can provide full host system access.</p>\n<p>Containers work well for <strong>packaging and isolating trusted applications</strong> but may not provide sufficient security guarantees for truly untrusted code. They also carry overhead from container runtime systems and image management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"language-sandboxes\">Language Sandboxes</h4>\n<p>Many programming languages provide built-in sandboxing mechanisms. JavaScript&#39;s same-origin policy, Java&#39;s security manager, and Python&#39;s restricted execution modes attempt to limit code capabilities at the language runtime level.</p>\n<p>Language sandboxes offer <strong>excellent performance</strong> since they operate within the same process as the host application. They enable fine-grained control over API access and can sandbox code with minimal overhead.</p>\n<p>However, language sandboxes have fundamental limitations. They depend entirely on the <strong>correctness of the runtime implementation</strong>. Bugs in the interpreter or compiler can create bypass opportunities. Additionally, they typically cannot prevent resource exhaustion attacks or protect against vulnerabilities in native libraries.</p>\n<p>Language sandboxes work well for <strong>limited scripting scenarios</strong> where performance is critical and the threat model is moderate, such as browser-based applications or configuration scripting.</p>\n<h4 id=\"process-isolation\">Process Isolation</h4>\n<p>Process-level sandboxing uses operating system primitives to isolate untrusted code within separate processes. This approach leverages the OS kernel&#39;s built-in security boundaries while avoiding the overhead of full virtualization.</p>\n<p>Process sandboxes can achieve <strong>strong security guarantees</strong> by combining multiple OS-level isolation mechanisms. They provide better performance than VMs while offering more robust security than language sandboxes. The kernel enforces isolation boundaries, making them less dependent on userspace code correctness.</p>\n<p>The main challenge with process sandboxes is <strong>complexity of configuration</strong>. Properly configuring multiple security mechanisms requires deep understanding of OS internals and careful attention to interaction effects between different isolation layers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: No single sandboxing approach is universally superior. The choice depends on specific requirements around security assurance, performance constraints, operational complexity, and resource availability. Process-level sandboxing occupies a sweet spot for many applications requiring strong security with reasonable performance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"linux-security-primitives-overview\">Linux Security Primitives Overview</h3>\n<p>Linux provides several powerful security primitives that can be combined to create robust process sandboxes. Each primitive addresses different aspects of the isolation problem and operates through different kernel mechanisms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"namespaces-resource-view-isolation\">Namespaces: Resource View Isolation</h4>\n<p>Linux <strong>namespaces</strong> provide isolated views of global system resources. When a process runs in a namespace, it sees a filtered or virtualized view of system state that can be completely different from the host system&#39;s view.</p>\n<p>Think of namespaces as <strong>alternate reality generators</strong>. Just as science fiction depicts parallel universes where the same location contains different buildings and inhabitants, namespaces present alternative views where the same system appears to contain different processes, files, or network interfaces.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Namespace Type</th>\n<th>Isolates</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n<th>Example Use</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PID</td>\n<td>Process IDs and process tree</td>\n<td>Prevents process enumeration and signaling</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process sees itself as PID 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount</td>\n<td>Filesystem mount points</td>\n<td>Restricts filesystem access</td>\n<td>Private /tmp directory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network</td>\n<td>Network interfaces and routing</td>\n<td>Blocks network access</td>\n<td>Isolated network stack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTS</td>\n<td>Hostname and domain name</td>\n<td>Prevents hostname disclosure</td>\n<td>Custom hostname inside sandbox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User</td>\n<td>User and group IDs</td>\n<td>Maps privileged IDs to unprivileged</td>\n<td>Root inside maps to nobody outside</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPC</td>\n<td>System V IPC objects</td>\n<td>Isolates shared memory and semaphores</td>\n<td>Private message queues</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Namespaces are created using the <code>clone()</code> system call with special flags, or applied to existing processes with <code>unshare()</code>. The kernel maintains separate namespace instances and translates resource references based on the calling process&#39;s namespace membership.</p>\n<p>The <strong>security value</strong> of namespaces comes from their ability to make system resources invisible or inaccessible to sandboxed processes. A process in a PID namespace cannot signal or inspect processes outside its namespace, even if it somehow learns their PIDs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"seccomp-system-call-filtering\">Seccomp: System Call Filtering</h4>\n<p>The <strong>seccomp</strong> (secure computing) mechanism allows processes to restrict which system calls they can make. Seccomp-BPF extends this with Berkeley Packet Filter programs that can examine system call arguments and make fine-grained filtering decisions.</p>\n<p>Think of seccomp as a <strong>strict gatekeeper</strong> at the kernel boundary. Every time the sandboxed process wants to make a system call—the equivalent of requesting a service from the kernel—the seccomp filter examines the request. Like a bouncer at an exclusive club, it can allow entry, deny access, or even call security (kill the process) if the request is inappropriate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Filter Action</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n<th>When to Use</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ALLOW</td>\n<td>Permit system call</td>\n<td>Safe operations like read/write</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ERRNO</td>\n<td>Return error code</td>\n<td>Operations that should fail gracefully</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TRAP</td>\n<td>Send signal to process</td>\n<td>Debugging or custom handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KILL</td>\n<td>Terminate process immediately</td>\n<td>Dangerous operations like ptrace</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Seccomp filters are <strong>immutable once installed</strong> and inherited by child processes. This prevents sandboxed code from removing its own restrictions. The BPF program runs in kernel space with minimal overhead, making filtering very efficient.</p>\n<p>The <strong>security benefit</strong> is preventing sandboxed processes from using dangerous system calls that could enable privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system manipulation. Even if other isolation layers are bypassed, seccomp provides a kernel-enforced backstop.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cgroups-resource-limiting\">Cgroups: Resource Limiting</h4>\n<p><strong>Control groups (cgroups)</strong> provide hierarchical resource management and accounting. They allow setting limits on CPU time, memory usage, I/O bandwidth, and process counts for groups of processes.</p>\n<p>Think of cgroups as a <strong>resource allocation department</strong> in a large organization. Just as departments get budget allocations for different expense categories—travel, equipment, personnel—cgroups assign resource quotas to process groups. When a group tries to exceed its allocation, the system either throttles the usage or denies the request entirely.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Controller</th>\n<th>Limits</th>\n<th>Enforcement Mechanism</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>RAM and swap usage</td>\n<td>OOM kill or throttling</td>\n<td>Prevents memory exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>Processing time and cycles</td>\n<td>Scheduling priority reduction</td>\n<td>Limits CPU consumption</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PID</td>\n<td>Maximum process count</td>\n<td>Fork failures</td>\n<td>Prevents fork bombs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O</td>\n<td>Disk read/write bandwidth</td>\n<td>Request queuing</td>\n<td>Controls storage impact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Cgroups organize processes into a <strong>hierarchy</strong> where resource limits are inherited and can be subdivided. The kernel enforces limits automatically—processes cannot bypass or negotiate around their assigned quotas.</p>\n<p>The <strong>security value</strong> comes from preventing resource exhaustion attacks. Without cgroups, a sandboxed process could consume all available memory, CPU time, or disk bandwidth, creating denial-of-service conditions that affect the entire host system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"capabilities-privilege-subdivision\">Capabilities: Privilege Subdivision</h4>\n<p>Traditional Unix systems have a binary privilege model: processes run either as root (with all privileges) or as regular users (with limited privileges). Linux <strong>capabilities</strong> subdivide root privileges into discrete units that can be granted independently.</p>\n<p>Think of capabilities as <strong>security clearance levels</strong> in a classified environment. Instead of having just &quot;classified&quot; and &quot;unclassified&quot; access, organizations have specific clearances like &quot;secret communications,&quot; &quot;top secret weapons,&quot; and &quot;compartmentalized intelligence.&quot; Each clearance grants access to specific resources without providing universal access.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Capability</th>\n<th>Privilege Granted</th>\n<th>Typical Use</th>\n<th>Security Risk if Granted</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>CAP_NET_RAW</td>\n<td>Raw network socket access</td>\n<td>Network diagnostics</td>\n<td>Network sniffing, spoofing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</td>\n<td>System administration</td>\n<td>Mount operations</td>\n<td>Full system compromise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CAP_SETUID</td>\n<td>Change user ID</td>\n<td>Process privilege changes</td>\n<td>Privilege escalation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</td>\n<td>Process tracing and debugging</td>\n<td>Debuggers, profilers</td>\n<td>Process memory access</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Processes can <strong>drop capabilities</strong> permanently, preventing future privilege escalation even if vulnerabilities are exploited. The <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag ensures that execve() cannot grant additional privileges.</p>\n<p>The <strong>security benefit</strong> is implementing the principle of least privilege. Sandboxed processes can run with minimal capabilities, reducing the impact of successful exploits. Even if an attacker achieves code execution, they inherit the restricted capability set.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Principle</strong>: These four primitives are complementary, not redundant. Namespaces control <em>what</em> processes can see, seccomp controls <em>what</em> they can do, cgroups control <em>how much</em> they can consume, and capabilities control <em>how privileged</em> their actions can be. Effective sandboxing requires orchestrating all four mechanisms in the correct sequence with appropriate configurations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Common Integration Challenges:</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ordering Dependencies</strong>\nThe sequence of applying security mechanisms matters critically. For example, capabilities must be configured before entering certain namespaces, and seccomp filters must be installed before dropping the privileges needed to configure them. Incorrect ordering can result in partially-configured sandboxes or setup failures.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Privilege Requirements</strong>\nMany security operations require elevated privileges to configure but should not grant those privileges to the sandboxed process. This creates a bootstrapping problem where the sandbox setup process needs careful privilege management to avoid granting unnecessary capabilities to the final sandboxed environment.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resource Cleanup</strong>\nFailed sandbox creation can leave orphaned namespaces, cgroup entries, or other kernel resources. Proper error handling must ensure cleanup of partially-configured sandboxes to prevent resource leaks and security inconsistencies.</p>\n<p>The next sections will explore how to architect a system that properly orchestrates these primitives while avoiding these common pitfalls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides practical guidance for

ready to begin Milestone 1 (Process Namespaces). The skeleton code provides the structure you&#39;ll fill in, and the utility functions handle common operations you&#39;ll need throughout the implementation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-non-goals\">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section provides foundational context for all milestones (1-5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The success of any process sandbox depends on clearly defining what it must accomplish, what performance characteristics it should maintain, and equally importantly, what threats and use cases it explicitly does not address. This section establishes the boundaries and expectations for our defense-in-depth process sandbox, ensuring that both implementers and users understand the system&#39;s capabilities and limitations.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Security Contract</strong></p>\n<p>Think of these goals as a security contract between the sandbox system and its users. Just as a legal contract specifies what services will be provided, under what conditions, and what circumstances void the agreement, our goals define the security guarantees we provide, the performance characteristics users can expect, and the attack scenarios that fall outside our protection model. This contract helps users make informed decisions about when and how to deploy the sandbox, while giving implementers clear success criteria for each milestone.</p>\n<p>The process sandbox operates under the principle of <strong>defense-in-depth</strong>, where multiple independent security mechanisms work together to contain untrusted code. Each layer provides specific security guarantees, and the combination of all layers creates a robust isolation environment that can withstand various attack vectors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-goals\">Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>The functional goals define the core security and usability requirements that the process sandbox must satisfy. These goals directly map to the security mechanisms implemented across our five milestones and establish the fundamental capabilities that users can rely upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Isolation and Resource Visibility Control</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must create complete isolation of the sandboxed process&#39;s view of system resources, making it appear as if the process is running on a dedicated system while actually sharing hardware with the host. This isolation prevents untrusted code from discovering information about other processes, users, network configuration, or system topology that could be used for reconnaissance or lateral movement.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Isolation Type</th>\n<th>Mechanism</th>\n<th>Security Guarantee</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process Tree</td>\n<td>PID namespace</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process sees itself as PID 1 with no parent processes visible</td>\n<td>Check <code>/proc</code> entries from inside sandbox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hostname/Domain</td>\n<td>UTS namespace</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process cannot determine real hostname or domain information</td>\n<td>Compare <code>hostname</code> output inside vs outside</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Stack</td>\n<td>Network namespace</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process has no network interfaces except loopback</td>\n<td>Check <code>ip addr</code> and <code>netstat</code> output</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem View</td>\n<td>Mount namespace + chroot</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process sees only minimal filesystem with no host paths</td>\n<td>Verify host directories are inaccessible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User/Group IDs</td>\n<td>User namespace</td>\n<td>Sandboxed process maps to unprivileged user on host system</td>\n<td>Check effective UID/GID mappings</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This isolation must be complete and tamper-proof. The sandboxed process should have no mechanism to discover that it&#39;s running in a container or to gather information about the host system&#39;s configuration, running processes, or network topology.</p>\n<p><strong>Filesystem Security and Access Control</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must provide a secure filesystem environment that prevents both data exfiltration and system compromise. This involves creating a minimal root filesystem with only essential binaries and libraries, while ensuring that the sandboxed process cannot access any host filesystem paths or sensitive system directories.</p>\n<p>The filesystem isolation must prevent common container escape techniques such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traversing symbolic links that point outside the sandbox</li>\n<li>Accessing host filesystem through <code>/proc/*/root</code> or similar pseudo-filesystem entries</li>\n<li>Mounting host filesystems using privileged system calls</li>\n<li>Writing to system directories that could affect host system behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Filesystem Component</th>\n<th>Configuration</th>\n<th>Security Purpose</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Root Directory</td>\n<td>Read-only minimal filesystem</td>\n<td>Prevents tampering with system binaries</td>\n<td>chroot or pivot_root</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Writable Areas</td>\n<td>tmpfs mounts at <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/var/tmp</code></td>\n<td>Provides scratch space without host persistence</td>\n<td>Memory-backed filesystems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device Access</td>\n<td>Restricted <code>/dev</code> with minimal device nodes</td>\n<td>Prevents access to hardware devices</td>\n<td>Bind mount with filtered device list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Info</td>\n<td>Read-only <code>/proc</code> mount</td>\n<td>Allows process introspection within namespace</td>\n<td>Mount with <code>hidepid</code> option</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Config</td>\n<td>No access to <code>/etc</code>, <code>/sys</code>, <code>/boot</code></td>\n<td>Prevents system configuration discovery</td>\n<td>Excluded from chroot environment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>System Call Restriction and Argument Filtering</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must implement comprehensive system call filtering using seccomp-BPF to prevent dangerous operations while allowing legitimate computation. This filtering operates at two levels: blocking entire classes of system calls that should never be needed by sandboxed code, and filtering arguments of allowed system calls to prevent abuse.</p>\n<p>The system call whitelist must be minimal but sufficient for basic computation, file I/O within the sandbox, and memory management. The filter must be architecture-aware, handling differences in system call numbers between x86_64, ARM, and other platforms.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>System Call Category</th>\n<th>Policy</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process Management</td>\n<td>Block dangerous calls</td>\n<td>Prevent privilege escalation and system interference</td>\n<td><code>ptrace</code>, <code>clone</code> with namespace flags, <code>unshare</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem</td>\n<td>Allow within sandbox only</td>\n<td>Enable legitimate I/O while preventing host access</td>\n<td>Allow <code>open</code>/<code>read</code>/<code>write</code>, block <code>mount</code>/<code>umount</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network</td>\n<td>Block all network calls</td>\n<td>Prevent network-based attacks and data exfiltration</td>\n<td>Block <code>socket</code>, <code>connect</code>, <code>bind</code>, <code>sendto</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kernel Interface</td>\n<td>Block kernel modification</td>\n<td>Prevent system configuration changes</td>\n<td>Block <code>sysctl</code>, <code>kexec_load</code>, <code>init_module</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handling</td>\n<td>Allow basic signals only</td>\n<td>Enable process control without system interference</td>\n<td>Allow <code>sigaction</code> for SIGTERM/SIGINT, block <code>kill</code> with system PIDs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Resource Consumption Control</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must enforce strict resource limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks against the host system. These limits must be configurable but have safe defaults that prevent runaway processes from consuming all available system resources.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Type</th>\n<th>Limit Mechanism</th>\n<th>Default Limit</th>\n<th>Enforcement Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>cgroups memory controller</td>\n<td>64MB resident set size</td>\n<td>Kill process group when limit exceeded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU Time</td>\n<td>cgroups CPU controller</td>\n<td>10% of one CPU core</td>\n<td>Throttle process when quota exceeded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Count</td>\n<td>cgroups PID controller</td>\n<td>32 total processes</td>\n<td>Block <code>fork</code>/<code>clone</code> when limit reached</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Descriptors</td>\n<td><code>setrlimit</code> RLIMIT_NOFILE</td>\n<td>64 open files</td>\n<td>Return EMFILE when limit reached</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk I/O</td>\n<td>cgroups I/O controller</td>\n<td>10MB/s read/write bandwidth</td>\n<td>Throttle I/O operations when limit exceeded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk Space</td>\n<td>Filesystem quotas on tmpfs</td>\n<td>16MB total scratch space</td>\n<td>Return ENOSPC when quota exhausted</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Privilege Minimization</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must operate with the minimum privileges necessary for its functionality, dropping all Linux capabilities that are not essential for basic process execution. This implements the principle of least privilege to reduce the attack surface if other security mechanisms are bypassed.</p>\n<p>The capability dropping must occur after all privileged setup operations are complete but before executing the untrusted code. The process must also set the <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag to prevent privilege escalation through setuid binaries or other mechanisms.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Capability Category</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>All capabilities</td>\n<td>Drop from effective, permitted, inheritable sets</td>\n<td>Minimal privilege principle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bounding set</td>\n<td>Clear all capabilities</td>\n<td>Prevent capability inheritance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ambient set</td>\n<td>Clear all capabilities</td>\n<td>Prevent ambient capability grants</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No-new-privs flag</td>\n<td>Set to 1</td>\n<td>Block future privilege escalation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"non-functional-goals\">Non-Functional Goals</h3>\n<p>The non-functional goals establish performance, resource usage, and operational requirements that ensure the sandbox is practical for real-world deployment. These goals balance security with usability, ensuring that the sandbox&#39;s security mechanisms don&#39;t create unacceptable overhead or operational complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance and Latency Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox creation and initialization process must complete quickly enough to support interactive use cases and batch processing workflows.

This enables use cases such as parallel test execution, multi-tenant development environments, and batch job processing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource</th>\n<th>Host Impact</th>\n<th>Scaling Target</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory per Sandbox</td>\n<td>Under 16MB host memory overhead</td>\n<td>Support 64 concurrent sandboxes on 4GB system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Descriptors</td>\n<td>Under 8 FDs per sandbox</td>\n<td>Work within typical system limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cgroup Hierarchy</td>\n<td>One cgroup per sandbox</td>\n<td>Clean up cgroups on sandbox termination</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Namespace Resources</td>\n<td>Namespace FDs held only during setup</td>\n<td>Release namespace references after setup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Operational Simplicity</strong></p>\n<p>The sandbox must be deployable and manageable with minimal operational complexity.

Think of this system as a high-security facility with multiple independent checkpoints: even if one security mechanism fails, the others continue to protect the host system. Each security layer operates independently but must be carefully coordinated to avoid conflicts and ensure proper initialization order.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"System Architecture Overview\"></p>\n<p>The architecture centers around a <strong>Sandbox Orchestrator</strong> that coordinates five specialized security components. This orchestrator acts as the conductor of a security orchestra, ensuring each component plays its part at precisely the right moment in the sandbox creation sequence. The orchestrator maintains both configuration state (what the sandbox should look like) and runtime state (tracking active resources that need cleanup).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsecurity-layers.svg\" alt=\"Defense in Depth Security Layers\"></p>\n<p>The security layers form concentric rings of protection around the untrusted process. The outermost layer (namespaces) provides the broadest isolation by changing the process&#39;s view of system resources. Moving inward, filesystem isolation restricts file access, seccomp filters system calls at the kernel boundary, cgroups limit resource consumption, and capability dropping removes dangerous privileges. This layered approach ensures that exploiting the sandbox requires defeating multiple independent security mechanisms simultaneously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-responsibilities\">Component Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The process sandbox divides security responsibilities among six primary components, each with clearly defined ownership boundaries and interfaces. This separation allows each component to focus on a specific aspect of security while maintaining clean integration points.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Resources Managed</th>\n<th>Key Dependencies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Sandbox Orchestrator</strong></td>\n<td>Coordinates all security components and manages sandbox lifecycle</td>\n<td>Process state, cleanup handlers, error reporting</td>\n<td>All other components</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Namespace Manager</strong></td>\n<td>Creates isolated views of system resources</td>\n<td>PID, mount, network, UTS, user namespaces</td>\n<td>clone() system call, root privileges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Filesystem Isolator</strong></td>\n<td>Provides minimal isolated filesystem environment</td>\n<td>Root filesystem, mount points, file permissions</td>\n<td>Mount namespace, chroot/pivot_root</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Seccomp Filter</strong></td>\n<td>Restricts allowed system calls using BPF programs</td>\n<td>BPF filter programs, system call whitelist</td>\n<td>prctl() system call, BPF compiler</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cgroup Manager</strong></td>\n<td>Enforces resource limits on CPU, memory, I/O</td>\n<td>Cgroup hierarchies, controller limits</td>\n<td>Cgroup filesystem, root privileges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Capability Dropper</strong></td>\n<td>Removes dangerous Linux capabilities</td>\n<td>Process capability sets, user/group IDs</td>\n<td>capset() system call, privilege flags</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"sandbox-orchestrator-responsibilities\">Sandbox Orchestrator Responsibilities</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Sandbox Orchestrator</strong> serves as the central coordinator and maintains the master state for each sandbox instance. It owns the <code>sandbox_config_t</code> structure containing user-specified settings and the <code>sandbox_state_t</code> structure tracking runtime resources. The orchestrator&#39;s primary responsibilities include validating configuration parameters, calling security components in the correct sequence, handling initialization failures with proper cleanup, and providing a unified error reporting interface.</p>\n<p>The orchestrator must handle complex error scenarios where some security mechanisms succeed while others fail. For example, if namespace creation succeeds but filesystem isolation fails, the orchestrator must properly clean up the created namespaces before returning an error. This requires maintaining detailed cleanup state and implementing rollback logic for partial failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Orchestrator Function</th>\n<th>Input Parameters</th>\n<th>Return Value</th>\n<th>Side Effects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_init()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t*</code></td>\n<td>Allocates configuration with defaults</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_free()</code></td>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t*</code></td>\n<td>void</td>\n<td>Deallocates configuration memory</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sandbox_state_init()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_state_t*</code></td>\n<td>Allocates runtime state structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>create_sandbox()</code></td>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t*</code>, <code>sandbox_state_t*</code></td>\n<td>int (error code)</td>\n<td>Creates child process, applies all security layers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cleanup_sandbox()</code></td>\n<td><code>sandbox_state_t*</code></td>\n<td>void</td>\n<td>Releases namespaces, cgroups, kills processes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>check_root_privileges()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>int (boolean)</td>\n<td>Checks for required root privileges</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"security-component-interface-pattern\">Security Component Interface Pattern</h4>\n<p>Each security component follows a consistent interface pattern that simplifies orchestration and error handling. Every component provides initialization, application, and cleanup functions that can be called independently. This pattern allows the orchestrator to apply security mechanisms incrementally and handle failures at any stage.</p>\n<p>The component interface pattern ensures that each security layer can be tested in isolation and that new security mechanisms can be added without modifying existing components. Each component validates its own preconditions (such as required privileges or kernel features) and reports specific error codes that help with debugging.</p>\n<h3 id=\"security-layer-ordering\">Security Layer Ordering</h3>\n<p>The sequence of applying security mechanisms is critical to the sandbox&#39;s effectiveness and stability. Applying these layers in the wrong order can result in privilege escalation vulnerabilities, resource leaks, or complete sandbox initialization failure. The ordering requirements stem from dependencies between security mechanisms and the way Linux kernel security checks interact.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Some security mechanisms require privileges that other mechanisms remove. For example, creating cgroups requires root privileges, but capability dropping removes those privileges. The ordering must ensure that privilege-requiring operations happen before capability dropping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The correct initialization sequence follows a specific pattern based on privilege requirements and resource dependencies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Privilege Verification</strong> - Check for required root privileges before attempting any security operations</li>\n<li><strong>Process Forking</strong> - Create the child process that will become the sandboxed environment</li>\n<li><strong>Namespace Creation</strong> - Establish isolated views of system resources while retaining privileges</li>\n<li><strong>Filesystem Setup</strong> - Configure isolated filesystem environment using mount namespace</li>\n<li><strong>Cgroup Configuration</strong> - Set resource limits while still having cgroup management privileges</li>\n<li><strong>Seccomp Installation</strong> - Install system call filter as late as possible to avoid blocking required setup calls</li>\n<li><strong>Capability Dropping</strong> - Remove dangerous privileges as the final step before executing user code</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Apply Seccomp Filter Last Among Security Mechanisms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Seccomp filters can block system calls required by other security setup operations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Apply seccomp first (maximum protection), apply seccomp in middle (balanced), apply seccomp last (compatibility)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Apply seccomp filter just before capability dropping and program execution</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Many security setup operations require system calls that should be blocked during normal execution (like mount, setrlimit, prctl). Applying seccomp too early would block legitimate setup operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Brief window where setup code runs without system call filtering, but all other security layers are active. Setup code is trusted and minimal.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"namespace-creation-dependencies\">Namespace Creation Dependencies</h4>\n<p>Namespace creation must happen early because other security mechanisms depend on namespace isolation. The mount namespace must exist before filesystem isolation can configure bind mounts and chroot environments. The PID namespace should be created before cgroup assignment to ensure proper process hierarchy tracking.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Namespace Type</th>\n<th>Must Create Before</th>\n<th>Reason</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>User</td>\n<td>All other namespaces</td>\n<td>Provides privilege mapping for other namespace operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PID</td>\n<td>Cgroup assignment</td>\n<td>Ensures cgroup sees correct process hierarchy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount</td>\n<td>Filesystem isolation</td>\n<td>Required for chroot and bind mount operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network</td>\n<td>Seccomp filter</td>\n<td>Some seccomp filters check network-related system calls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTS</td>\n<td>Program execution</td>\n<td>Hostname isolation should be established before user code runs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"privilege-dropping-timing\">Privilege Dropping Timing</h4>\n<p>Capability dropping must be the last security operation because it removes privileges required by other security mechanisms. Once capabilities are dropped, the process cannot create new namespaces, configure cgroups, or perform other privileged operations. The <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag must be set before loading seccomp filters, but this doesn&#39;t remove existing capabilities.</p>\n<p>The privilege dropping sequence within its own phase also matters: first change supplementary groups, then primary group, then user ID, then drop capabilities. This order prevents the process from being unable to complete privilege changes due to insufficient permissions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resource-limit-application-order\">Resource Limit Application Order</h4>\n<p>Cgroup limits should be applied after namespace creation but before program execution to ensure the resource limits apply to the correct process hierarchy. Memory limits must be set before the program starts to prevent initial memory allocation from exceeding limits. CPU limits can be applied at any time but are most effective when set before the program begins executing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Configure Cgroups After Namespaces But Before Seccomp</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Cgroup operations require various system calls and file system access that might be restricted</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Configure cgroups first (early protection), configure cgroups after everything (late application), configure cgroups mid-sequence (balanced)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Configure cgroups after namespace creation but before seccomp filter installation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Cgroup setup requires file system operations that seccomp might block, but cgroups should be active before user code runs. Namespaces must exist first to provide proper isolation context.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Resource limits are active during seccomp installation and capability dropping, providing protection against resource exhaustion during these phases.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h3>\n<p>The codebase organization reflects the component-based architecture and supports incremental development through the milestone sequence.

Think of the data model as the <strong>sandbox&#39;s memory</strong> - it stores everything the system needs to know about what the sandbox should look like (configuration) and what it actually looks like at any moment in time (runtime state). Just as a construction foreman needs blueprints (configuration) and progress tracking sheets (runtime state) to build a house, the sandbox orchestrator needs structured data to create and manage isolated execution environments.</p>\n<p>The data model serves two critical purposes in the sandbox architecture. First, it provides a <strong>declarative configuration interface</strong> that allows users to specify their isolation requirements without understanding the underlying Linux primitives. Second, it maintains <strong>runtime state tracking</strong> that enables proper resource cleanup and monitoring throughout the sandbox lifecycle. This separation between desired state (configuration) and actual state (runtime) follows established patterns from container orchestration systems and ensures the sandbox can recover gracefully from failures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"System Architecture Overview\"></p>\n<p>The complexity of the sandbox data model stems from the need to coordinate multiple independent Linux security mechanisms. Each security layer - namespaces, filesystem isolation, seccomp filtering, resource limits, and capability management - requires its own configuration parameters and runtime state tracking. The challenge lies in designing structures that are both comprehensive enough to support all security features and simple enough for users to understand and configure correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sandbox-configuration\">Sandbox Configuration</h3>\n<p>The <strong>sandbox configuration</strong> represents the declarative specification of how a sandbox should be constructed. Think of it as the <strong>architectural blueprint</strong> for the security prison - it specifies the cell dimensions (resource limits), the permitted activities (allowed system calls), the view from the windows (namespace configuration), and the items allowed inside (filesystem access). Unlike imperative commands that describe how to build something, the configuration describes what the end result should look like, leaving the implementation details to the sandbox orchestrator.</p>\n<p>The configuration structure must balance several competing concerns. It needs to be comprehensive enough to support all security features while remaining simple enough for typical use cases. It must provide sensible defaults that work out of the box while allowing advanced users to customize every aspect of the security policy. Most importantly, it must be validated early to prevent configuration errors from causing runtime failures after expensive setup work has already been performed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuration-structure-design\">Configuration Structure Design</h4>\n<p>The primary configuration structure, <code>sandbox_config_t</code>, encapsulates all parameters needed to create a sandbox instance. This structure follows the principle of <strong>explicit over implicit</strong> - every security-relevant setting is explicitly specified rather than inferred from context. This approach prevents subtle security bugs that can arise when default behaviors change or when configurations are applied in unexpected environments.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Default Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>program_path</code></td>\n<td><code>char*</code></td>\n<td>Absolute path to executable that will run inside sandbox</td>\n<td>Must be specified, no default</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>program_args</code></td>\n<td><code>char**</code></td>\n<td>Null-terminated array of command-line arguments</td>\n<td>Empty array if not specified</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>chroot_path</code></td>\n<td><code>char*</code></td>\n<td>Path to directory that becomes the new root filesystem</td>\n<td>Uses minimal built-in rootfs if NULL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>memory_limit</code></td>\n<td><code>unsigned long</code></td>\n<td>Maximum memory in bytes that sandbox can allocate</td>\n<td>64MB default limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cpu_percent</code></td>\n<td><code>unsigned int</code></td>\n<td>Percentage of one CPU core (0-100) available to sandbox</td>\n<td>10% default allocation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>enable_network</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Boolean flag controlling network namespace isolation</td>\n<td>0 (disabled) for maximum isolation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>allowed_syscalls</code></td>\n<td><code>char**</code></td>\n<td>Null-terminated array of permitted system call names</td>\n<td>Minimal safe set if not specified</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The configuration structure intentionally uses simple C types rather than complex nested structures. This design choice reflects the reality that sandbox configuration is often driven by external configuration files, command-line arguments, or environment variables. Simple types make serialization, validation, and debugging significantly easier than deeply nested object hierarchies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resource-limit-configuration\">Resource Limit Configuration</h4>\n<p>Resource limits represent one of the most critical aspects of sandbox configuration because they directly impact system stability. Think of resource limits as the <strong>power grid</strong> for the sandbox prison - they determine how much electricity (CPU), water (memory), and other utilities each cell can consume. Without proper limits, a malicious or buggy program can consume all available resources and impact other processes on the system.</p>\n<p>The memory limit specification uses bytes rather than more convenient units like megabytes to avoid ambiguity about binary versus decimal multipliers. A limit of <code>67108864</code> bytes is unambiguous, while &quot;64MB&quot; could mean either 64 * 1000 * 1000 or 64 * 1024 * 1024 bytes depending on interpretation. This precision matters because memory limits are enforced by the kernel with byte-level accuracy.</p>\n<p>CPU limit configuration uses percentage of a single core rather than absolute CPU time to make the configuration portable across different hardware. A sandbox configured for &quot;10% of one core&quot; will behave consistently whether running on a dual-core laptop or a 32-core server. The cgroup implementation translates this percentage into appropriate period and quota values for kernel enforcement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: Resource limits must be specified in kernel-native units to avoid translation errors and ensure consistent enforcement. The configuration layer provides the abstraction, but the underlying values must match exactly what the kernel expects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"system-call-allowlist-configuration\">System Call Allowlist Configuration</h4>\n<p>The system call allowlist represents the <strong>security checkpoint</strong> for all kernel interactions from the sandboxed process. Think of it as the <strong>customs office</strong> at a border crossing - every request to cross from userspace into kernel space must be explicitly approved based on a predetermined list of acceptable operations. The allowlist approach follows the security principle of <strong>default deny</strong> - anything not explicitly permitted is automatically forbidden.</p>\n<p>System call names are used in the configuration rather than numeric values to improve readability and avoid architecture-specific differences. The same system call can have different numbers on x86_64 versus ARM64, but the name remains constant. The sandbox implementation translates names to numbers during seccomp filter compilation based on the runtime architecture.</p>\n<p>The configuration supports both positive allowlists (specifying permitted calls) and negative blocklists (specifying forbidden calls), though the default behavior favors allowlists for security. A typical configuration might include essential calls like <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>exit</code>, and <code>exit_group</code> while excluding dangerous operations like <code>ptrace</code>, <code>mount</code>, or <code>kexec_load</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: System Call Configuration Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to specify which system calls the sandboxed process can make while keeping configuration readable and architecture-independent</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Numeric system call IDs in configuration</li>\n<li>String names translated to numbers at runtime</li>\n<li>Predefined named policies (strict, moderate, permissive)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: String names with runtime translation to numbers</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Names are architecture-independent, human-readable, and maintainable. Translation overhead is acceptable since it happens once during sandbox setup.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires system call name-to-number translation logic and architecture detection, but improves configuration portability and debuggability.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"filesystem-configuration\">Filesystem Configuration</h4>\n<p>Filesystem configuration determines what files and directories the sandboxed process can access. Think of this as designing the <strong>floor plan</strong> of the security prison - it specifies which rooms (directories) exist, what furniture (files) they contain, and whether the doors have locks (permissions). The filesystem configuration must balance security isolation with providing enough functionality for the sandboxed program to operate correctly.</p>\n<p>The <code>chroot_path</code> configuration specifies the directory that becomes the new root filesystem for the sandboxed process. This directory must contain a complete minimal Linux filesystem with essential directories like <code>/bin</code>, <code>/lib</code>, <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and <code>/tmp</code>. The sandbox orchestrator validates this structure during configuration parsing to ensure the sandboxed process won&#39;t fail due to missing dependencies.</p>\n<p>When <code>chroot_path</code> is NULL, the sandbox uses a built-in minimal root filesystem constructed in memory using tmpfs. This default behavior provides a secure baseline that works for simple programs without requiring users to construct their own root filesystem. The built-in filesystem includes only essential files and directories needed for basic program execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"runtime-state\">Runtime State</h3>\n<p>The <strong>runtime state</strong> captures the dynamic information about a running sandbox instance. Think of runtime state as the <strong>security control room</strong> for the prison - it contains all the monitors, switches, and communication channels needed to observe and control the sandbox throughout its lifecycle. While configuration represents the desired state, runtime state represents the actual current state of all security mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Runtime state differs fundamentally from configuration in that it contains <strong>handles and references to kernel objects</strong> rather than parameters and settings. Namespace file descriptors, process IDs, and cgroup paths are all kernel-managed resources that must be properly tracked and cleaned up. The runtime state structure serves as the sandbox&#39;s <strong>resource inventory</strong> - it knows exactly what kernel resources are allocated and ensures they are properly released when the sandbox terminates.</p>\n<p>The complexity of runtime state management stems from the <strong>temporal dependencies</strong> between different security layers. Namespaces must be created before processes can be moved into them. Cgroups must be configured before processes are added to them. Capabilities must be dropped after all other setup is complete. The runtime state tracks not just what resources exist, but what order they were created in and what dependencies exist between them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"process-and-namespace-tracking\">Process and Namespace Tracking</h4>\n<p>Process tracking represents the core of runtime state management because the sandboxed process is the central entity around which all other security mechanisms revolve. Think of the process as the <strong>prisoner</strong> in the security analogy - the runtime state must know where the prisoner is, what cell they&#39;re in, and how to communicate with or terminate them if necessary.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Lifecycle</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>child_pid</code></td>\n<td><code>pid_t</code></td>\n<td>Process ID of the sandboxed process</td>\n<td>Set after fork, cleared after wait</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>namespace_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int[6]</code></td>\n<td>File descriptors for each namespace type</td>\n<td>Created during namespace setup, closed during cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cgroup_path</code></td>\n<td><code>char*</code></td>\n<td>Filesystem path to sandbox&#39;s cgroup directory</td>\n<td>Allocated during cgroup creation, freed during cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cleanup_needed</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Boolean flag indicating whether cleanup is required</td>\n<td>Set to 1 during setup, cleared after successful cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The namespace file descriptor array stores handles to each namespace type in a fixed order: PID, mount, network, UTS, user, and IPC namespaces. These file descriptors allow the parent process to manipulate namespaces even after the sandboxed process has started executing. For example, the parent might need to configure network interfaces in the network namespace or add additional mount points to the mount namespace.</p>\n<p>Namespace file descriptors are obtained by opening files in <code>/proc/[pid]/ns/</code> after creating the namespaces but before the sandboxed process calls exec. Once the exec call completes, the original process image is replaced and the namespace setup code is no longer running, making these file descriptors the only way for the parent to access the namespaces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Resource Management</strong>: Namespace file descriptors must be closed by the parent process during cleanup to prevent file descriptor leaks. Each unclosed namespace file descriptor prevents the kernel from fully cleaning up the namespace even after all processes in it have terminated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"namespace-state-tracking\">Namespace State Tracking</h4>\n<p>The namespace state structure provides detailed tracking of namespace creation and initialization status. Think of this as the <strong>facility status board</strong> in a control room - it shows exactly which isolation chambers are operational and which are still under construction.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Valid Values</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>pid_ns_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for PID namespace</td>\n<td>-1 if not created, valid fd if active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>mount_ns_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for mount namespace</td>\n<td>-1 if not created, valid fd if active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>net_ns_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for network namespace</td>\n<td>-1 if not created, valid fd if active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>uts_ns_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for UTS namespace</td>\n<td>-1 if not created, valid fd if active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>user_ns_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for user namespace</td>\n<td>-1 if not created, valid fd if active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>initialized</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Boolean indicating all namespaces ready</td>\n<td>0 during setup, 1 when complete</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The namespace state structure enables partial cleanup in failure scenarios. If namespace creation fails partway through the process, the cleanup code can examine each file descriptor to determine which namespaces were successfully created and need to be cleaned up. This prevents resource leaks when errors occur during sandbox initialization.</p>\n<p>The <code>initialized</code> flag serves as a <strong>consistency marker</strong> that indicates whether the namespace setup process completed successfully. The sandbox orchestrator sets this flag only after all namespaces have been created and their file descriptors have been stored. This flag prevents the sandboxed process from starting execution before the security isolation is fully established.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cleanup-resource-tracking\">Cleanup Resource Tracking</h4>\n<p>Cleanup resource tracking ensures that all kernel resources allocated during sandbox creation are properly released when the sandbox terminates. Think of this as the <strong>maintenance checklist</strong> that facility staff use when closing down a section of the prison - every lock must be checked, every utility must be turned off, and every resource must be accounted for.</p>\n<p>The <code>cleanup_needed</code> flag provides a <strong>fail-safe mechanism</strong> that ensures cleanup occurs even if the normal termination path is interrupted. This flag is set to 1 as soon as any kernel resources are allocated and cleared to 0 only after all resources have been successfully released. If the parent process receives a signal or encounters an unexpected error, it can check this flag to determine whether cleanup is necessary.</p>\n<p>Cgroup path tracking presents unique challenges because cgroups are managed through the filesystem interface rather than file descriptors. The <code>cgroup_path</code> field stores the full filesystem path to the sandbox&#39;s cgroup directory, which must be removed during cleanup to prevent accumulation of empty cgroup directories over time. The cleanup process must also handle the case where processes are still running in the cgroup, which prevents directory removal until all processes have been terminated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Cleanup Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to ensure all kernel resources are properly released when sandbox terminates, even in failure scenarios</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Manual cleanup calls at each exit point</li>\n<li>Cleanup flag with centralized cleanup function</li>\n<li>Reference counting for each resource type</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Cleanup flag with centralized cleanup function</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Centralized cleanup reduces code duplication and ensures consistent cleanup behavior. The flag approach is simpler than reference counting while still providing safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: All exit paths must call the cleanup function, but resource management is centralized and easier to verify for correctness.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-validation-and-defaults\">Configuration Validation and Defaults</h3>\n<p>Configuration validation ensures that sandbox parameters are valid and consistent before expensive setup operations begin. Think of validation as the <strong>blueprints review process</strong> before construction starts - it&#39;s much cheaper to catch design problems on paper than to discover them after pouring the foundation. The validation process checks individual parameter values, relationships between parameters, and system compatibility.</p>\n<p>Individual parameter validation checks that each configuration value is within acceptable bounds and formats. Memory limits must be positive and within system limits. CPU percentages must be between 0 and 100. File paths must be absolute and accessible. System call names must be recognized on the current architecture. These checks prevent runtime failures that would waste resources and potentially leave the system in an inconsistent state.</p>\n<p>Relationship validation ensures that configuration parameters are mutually compatible. For example, if network access is disabled, any configuration that depends on network connectivity should be flagged as invalid. If the chroot path is specified but doesn&#39;t contain required directories, the validation should detect this before attempting sandbox creation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Type</th>\n<th>Check Performed</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory Limit</td>\n<td>Value &gt; 0 and &lt; system memory</td>\n<td>Zero or negative limit</td>\n<td>Use default 64MB limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU Percentage</td>\n<td>Value between 0 and 100</td>\n<td>Out of range value</td>\n<td>Use default 10% limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Program Path</td>\n<td>File exists and is executable</td>\n<td>Missing or non-executable</td>\n<td>Return configuration error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chroot Path</td>\n<td>Directory exists with required subdirs</td>\n<td>Missing directory structure</td>\n<td>Use built-in minimal rootfs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Calls</td>\n<td>All names valid on current architecture</td>\n<td>Unrecognized system call name</td>\n<td>Return configuration error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Default value assignment provides a secure baseline for unconfigured parameters. The defaults are chosen to prioritize security over performance - it&#39;s better to have a sandbox that runs slowly but securely than one that runs quickly but allows privilege escalation. Users who need higher performance can explicitly configure more permissive settings after understanding the security implications.</p>\n<p>The default system call allowlist includes only the most essential operations needed for basic program execution: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>exit_group</code>, <code>brk</code>, <code>mmap</code>, <code>munmap</code>, <code>mprotect</code>, and <code>rt_sigreturn</code>. This minimal set allows simple programs to run while blocking dangerous operations like process creation, file system modification, or network access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-flow-and-state-transitions\">Data Flow and State Transitions</h3>\n<p>The sandbox data model supports a clear flow from initial configuration through runtime execution to final cleanup. Think of this as the <strong>prisoner processing pipeline</strong> - there are distinct stages with specific hand-off points and validation checkpoints between each stage. Understanding this flow is crucial for implementing robust error handling and resource management.</p>\n<p>The configuration phase begins with parsing user input and ends with a validated <code>sandbox_config_t</code> structure. During this phase, all user-provided values are validated, defaults are applied for missing parameters, and system compatibility is verified. No kernel resources are allocated during configuration parsing, making this phase fast and reversible.</p>\n<p>The initialization phase creates kernel resources and populates the <code>sandbox_state_t</code> structure. This phase includes namespace creation, filesystem setup, cgroup configuration, and other resource-intensive operations. Each step in initialization updates the runtime state structure to track what resources have been allocated, enabling partial cleanup if later steps fail.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Resources Allocated</th>\n<th>Failure Recovery</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Parse Config</td>\n<td>User input</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Simple error return</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Validate Config</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t</code></td>\n<td>Validated config</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Simple error return</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initialize</td>\n<td>Config + empty state</td>\n<td>Populated <code>sandbox_state_t</code></td>\n<td>Namespaces, cgroups, processes</td>\n<td>Cleanup allocated resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Execute</td>\n<td>State + config</td>\n<td>Running sandbox</td>\n<td>None (resources already allocated)</td>\n<td>Terminate and cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleanup</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_state_t</code></td>\n<td>Clean system</td>\n<td>None (resources released)</td>\n<td>Force cleanup if needed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The execution phase monitors the running sandbox and handles communication between the parent supervisor and the sandboxed process. During this phase, the configuration is read-only and the runtime state changes only to reflect the current status of the sandboxed process (running, terminated, etc.).</p>\n<p>The cleanup phase releases all kernel resources tracked in the runtime state structure. This phase must be robust enough to handle partial failures - if some resources cannot be released immediately (e.g., because processes are still running), the cleanup process must retry or escalate to more forceful termination methods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Configuration Pointer Ownership</strong>\nA common mistake is unclear ownership of string pointers in the configuration structure. Fields like <code>program_path</code> and <code>chroot_path</code> point to memory that may be allocated by different parts of the system (command-line parsing, configuration file reading, etc.). If the configuration structure doesn&#39;t properly manage this memory, it can lead to double-free errors or memory leaks. The solution is to make the configuration structure own all its string data by copying values during initialization and freeing them during destruction.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Namespace File Descriptor Leaks</strong>\nNamespace file descriptors are easy to leak because they remain valid even after all processes in the namespace have terminated. Unlike process IDs which become invalid when processes exit, namespace file descriptors keep the namespace alive indefinitely. Always close these file descriptors in the cleanup function and set them to -1 to prevent accidental reuse.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Partial Cleanup State</strong>\nRuntime state structures can be left in inconsistent states if cleanup is interrupted or fails partway through. For example, if the parent process is killed while cleaning up cgroups, some resources may be released while others remain allocated. Design the cleanup function to be <strong>idempotent</strong> - calling it multiple times should be safe and should eventually clean up all resources.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Configuration Validation Race Conditions</strong>\nValidating configuration at parse time doesn&#39;t guarantee that the same validation will hold at execution time. For example, checking that a chroot directory exists during configuration parsing doesn&#39;t prevent the directory from being deleted before sandbox creation. Critical validations must be repeated during the initialization phase when resources are actually being allocated.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Integer Overflow in Resource Limits</strong>\nMemory and resource limits are often specified in human-readable units (MB, GB) but stored in bytes. Converting &quot;1GB&quot; to bytes requires multiplication by 1073741824, which can overflow 32-bit integers. Always use appropriate integer types (<code>unsigned long</code> or <code>uint64_t</code>) for byte-based limits and validate that conversions don&#39;t overflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The data model implementation requires careful attention to memory management, error handling, and resource lifecycle management. The structures serve as the foundation for all sandbox operations, so bugs in the data model can cascade throughout the entire system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology Recommendations</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Configuration Parsing</td>\n<td>Manual string parsing with <code>strtol</code>/<code>strtoul</code></td>\n<td>JSON parsing with <code>cjson</code> library</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String Management</td>\n<td>Fixed-size buffers with <code>strncpy</code></td>\n<td>Dynamic allocation with <code>strdup</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Handling</td>\n<td>Integer return codes</td>\n<td>Structured error objects</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Management</td>\n<td>Manual <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> with cleanup functions</td>\n<td>Memory pools or smart pointers</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h4>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>sandbox/\n  include/\n    sandbox.h                 ← public API and data structures\n  src/\n    config.c                  ← configuration management\n    state.c                   ← runtime state management\n    cleanup.c                 ← resource cleanup utilities\n  tests/\n    test_config.c             ← configuration validation tests\n    test_state.c              ← state management tests</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"configuration-management-infrastructure\">Configuration Management Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>The configuration management code handles parsing, validation, and memory management for sandbox configuration structures.

By leveraging Linux namespaces, this component creates isolated views of system resources that make the sandboxed process believe it exists in its own private universe, completely separate from the host system. This isolation is so convincing that a process running inside the sandbox sees itself as process ID 1 in its own system, with its own network stack, filesystem mounts, and even hostname—all while being just another process on the host system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-separate-universes\">Mental Model: Separate Universes</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of Linux namespaces as creating parallel universes for processes. Imagine you have a magic mirror that shows a completely different reality to anyone looking into it. From the host system&#39;s perspective, the sandboxed process is just another process with a regular PID, using the normal filesystem, and sharing the same network interfaces. But from inside the sandbox, the process sees itself as the only important process (PID 1), living on a system with its own private filesystem and isolated network stack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This &quot;separate universe&quot; effect is achieved through the kernel&#39;s namespace mechanism, which maintains multiple independent views of the same underlying system resources. When a process is created in a new namespace, the kernel essentially creates a new mapping table for that category of resource. For example, in a new PID namespace, the kernel maintains a separate process ID mapping where the first process gets PID 1, even though it might be PID 23847 from the host&#39;s perspective.</p>\n<p>The power of this approach lies in its completeness—the sandboxed process cannot even discover that other realities exist. It cannot see host processes, cannot access host mount points, and cannot communicate over the host&#39;s network interfaces. This isolation occurs at the kernel level, making it extremely difficult for malicious code to break out of the sandbox through normal system call interfaces.</p>\n<p>Consider a concrete scenario: when a sandboxed process calls <code>getpid()</code>, the kernel consults the PID namespace mapping and returns 1. When it calls <code>ps aux</code> to list processes, the kernel only shows processes within the same PID namespace. When it attempts to connect to network addresses, the kernel routes those requests through the network namespace&#39;s isolated network stack, which by default has no external connectivity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"namespace-types-and-usage\">Namespace Types and Usage</h3>\n<p>Linux provides several types of namespaces, each isolating a different category of system resource. The process sandbox leverages five key namespace types to create comprehensive isolation. Understanding each namespace type and its security benefits is crucial for implementing effective sandbox isolation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Namespace Type</th>\n<th>System Resource</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n<th>Implementation Challenge</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PID</td>\n<td>Process IDs and process tree</td>\n<td>Hides host processes, prevents process manipulation attacks</td>\n<td>Requires proper /proc mounting, zombie reaping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount</td>\n<td>Filesystem mount points</td>\n<td>Isolates filesystem view, prevents unauthorized file access</td>\n<td>Complex mount propagation, dependency resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network</td>\n<td>Network interfaces, routing tables, firewalls</td>\n<td>Blocks network access, prevents network-based attacks</td>\n<td>Interface creation, connectivity management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTS</td>\n<td>Hostname and domain name</td>\n<td>Isolates system identity, prevents information leakage</td>\n<td>Minimal complexity, mainly cosmetic isolation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User</td>\n<td>User and group IDs</td>\n<td>Maps root inside container to unprivileged user outside</td>\n<td>Most complex, requires careful UID/GID mapping</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>PID Namespace Isolation</strong> provides process-level security by creating an isolated process tree where the sandboxed process becomes PID 1. This isolation prevents the sandboxed process from discovering, signaling, or manipulating host processes. The sandboxed process cannot use <code>kill</code>, <code>ptrace</code>, or other process control system calls to affect processes outside its namespace. Additionally, the isolated process tree means that when the sandbox terminates, all child processes are automatically cleaned up since they lose their parent process.</p>\n<p>The PID namespace also affects the <code>/proc</code> filesystem, which must be mounted separately within the namespace to reflect the isolated process view. Without proper <code>/proc</code> mounting, tools like <code>ps</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>pidof</code> will either fail or show incorrect information from the host namespace.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Namespace Isolation</strong> creates an independent filesystem view by providing a separate mount table. This isolation prevents the sandboxed process from accessing host mount points, even if it knows their paths. The sandbox can have its own <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and other critical directories without affecting or being affected by the host system.</p>\n<p>Mount namespaces support different propagation modes that control how mount and unmount events propagate between namespaces. The sandbox uses private propagation to ensure that mount changes within the sandbox do not affect the host system. This isolation extends to preventing access to sensitive host directories like <code>/root</code>, <code>/home</code>, and system configuration directories.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Namespace Isolation</strong> provides complete network isolation by creating a separate network stack with its own interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules. By default, a new network namespace contains only a loopback interface, effectively cutting off all external network access. This isolation prevents network-based attacks, data exfiltration, and unauthorized communication.</p>\n<p>The network namespace can be selectively configured to allow specific types of network access if required. This might involve creating virtual network interfaces, setting up network address translation, or configuring specific firewall rules. However, the default configuration provides maximum security by denying all network access.</p>\n<p><strong>UTS Namespace Isolation</strong> isolates the system hostname and domain name, preventing the sandboxed process from discovering or modifying the host system&#39;s identity. While this provides minimal security benefit compared to other namespaces, it contributes to the overall isolation illusion and prevents information leakage that might aid in fingerprinting or reconnaissance attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>User Namespace Isolation</strong> provides the most complex but potentially most valuable isolation by mapping user and group IDs between the host and sandbox. This mapping allows a process to have root privileges (UID 0) inside the sandbox while running as an unprivileged user outside the sandbox. This isolation dramatically reduces the impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities within the sandbox.</p>\n<p>User namespace mapping requires careful configuration of UID and GID mappings in <code>/proc/PID/uid_map</code> and <code>/proc/PID/gid_map</code> files. These mappings define how user and group IDs translate between the namespace and the host system. Incorrect mapping can either break functionality or compromise security.</p>\n<h3 id=\"namespace-creation-and-ordering\">Namespace Creation and Ordering</h3>\n<p>Creating namespaces in the correct sequence is critical for both functionality and security. The kernel imposes certain ordering constraints, and the sandbox&#39;s security model depends on establishing isolation layers in a specific order. The namespace creation algorithm must handle these dependencies while providing comprehensive error handling and cleanup.</p>\n<p>The namespace creation process follows this carefully orchestrated sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Verify Root Privileges</strong>: Check that the calling process has sufficient privileges to create namespaces. Most namespace creation requires <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> capability or root privileges. The process should verify these privileges early to provide clear error messages rather than cryptic system call failures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create User Namespace First</strong>: If using user namespaces, create them before any other namespaces. User namespaces are special because they can grant capabilities needed for creating other namespaces, even to non-root processes. Creating the user namespace first establishes the privilege context for subsequent namespace creation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Set Up UID/GID Mappings</strong>: Immediately after creating the user namespace, configure the UID and GID mappings by writing to <code>/proc/self/uid_map</code> and <code>/proc/self/gid_map</code>. These mappings must be established before creating other namespaces that depend on user identity checks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create PID Namespace</strong>: Create the PID namespace to establish process isolation. The PID namespace affects process creation and signaling, so it should be established before creating the actual sandboxed process. Note that the creating process does not enter the PID namespace—only its children will be in the new namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Mount Namespace</strong>: Create the mount namespace to establish filesystem isolation. This namespace affects all subsequent filesystem operations, including the mounting of <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and other special filesystems that other namespaces might require.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create Network Namespace</strong>: Create the network namespace to establish network isolation. Network namespaces are relatively independent but should be created before UTS namespaces for consistency and to ensure network-related hostname resolution works correctly within the isolated environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create UTS Namespace</strong>: Create the UTS namespace last among the isolation namespaces. UTS namespaces have few dependencies and primarily provide cosmetic isolation, making them safe to create at any point in the sequence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Validate Namespace Creation</strong>: After creating all namespaces, validate that they were created successfully by checking namespace file descriptors and reading namespace identifiers from <code>/proc/self/ns/</code> entries. This validation catches subtle failures that might not be immediately apparent.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The algorithm must handle partial failures gracefully. If namespace creation fails at any step, the process should clean up any successfully created namespaces and return to the original namespace context. This cleanup prevents resource leaks and ensures the system remains in a consistent state.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Algorithm: Namespace Creation Sequence\n\nInput: namespace_state_t* ns_state (structure to track namespace file descriptors)\nOutput: SANDBOX_SUCCESS or appropriate error code\n\n1.

Each decision involves trade-offs between security, complexity, performance, and compatibility that must be carefully evaluated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use unshare() vs clone() for Namespace Creation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Linux provides two primary mechanisms for creating namespaces: the <code>unshare()</code> system call that moves the calling process into new namespaces, and the <code>clone()</code> system call that creates a new process in new namespaces. The choice affects process creation flow and error handling complexity.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Use <code>unshare()</code> to create namespaces then <code>fork()</code> to create sandboxed process</li>\n<li>Use <code>clone()</code> with namespace flags to create process and namespaces atomically</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach using <code>unshare()</code> for some namespaces and <code>clone()</code> for others</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use <code>unshare()</code> followed by <code>fork()</code> for namespace creation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: The <code>unshare()</code> approach provides better error handling and cleanup capabilities. If namespace creation fails, the parent process remains in the original namespaces and can clean up resources. The <code>clone()</code> approach creates the process and namespaces atomically, making error recovery more complex since the child process might be created even if some namespaces fail. Additionally, <code>unshare()</code> allows for step-by-step namespace creation with validation at each step.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: This approach requires two separate system calls (<code>unshare()</code> then <code>fork()</code>) instead of one atomic <code>clone()</code> call. However, it provides cleaner error handling, better logging of namespace creation failures, and allows for partial namespace creation if needed for testing or debugging.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Error Handling</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Atomic Creation</th>\n<th>Resource Cleanup</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>unshare() + fork()</td>\n<td>Excellent - parent can recover</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Simple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>clone() with flags</td>\n<td>Limited - child handles errors</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Complex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid approach</td>\n<td>Complex - depends on namespace</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Partial</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: User Namespace Mapping Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: User namespaces require explicit UID and GID mappings between the host and container. These mappings determine what user and group identities the sandboxed process sees versus what identities it has on the host system. Incorrect mappings can compromise security or break functionality.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Map container root (UID 0) to host process UID with single mapping</li>\n<li>Create comprehensive mapping covering multiple UIDs and GIDs</li>\n<li>Skip user namespaces entirely and rely on other isolation mechanisms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Map container root (UID 0) to host process UID with single identity mapping</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Single identity mapping provides maximum security by ensuring the sandboxed process has no privileges outside the namespace, regardless of what UID it believes it has inside. Comprehensive mappings increase complexity and potential attack surface. Skipping user namespaces entirely misses a valuable security layer that allows other namespace creation without root privileges.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Sandboxed processes can run as root inside the container while being unprivileged outside. This approach limits functionality for applications that need multiple user identities but provides strong security guarantees. File ownership and permissions must be carefully managed since files created inside the sandbox will appear owned by the mapped host UID.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mapping Strategy</th>\n<th>Security</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Functionality</th>\n<th>Root Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single identity</td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Limited</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple mappings</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Full</td>\n<td>Sometimes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No user namespace</td>\n<td>Poor</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Full</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Namespace File Descriptor Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Linux namespaces can be referenced through file descriptors obtained from <code>/proc/PID/ns/</code> entries.

File descriptors also prevent namespace destruction if all processes exit unexpectedly. The resource cost of keeping a few file descriptors open is minimal compared to the operational benefits.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The sandbox must carefully manage file descriptor cleanup to prevent resource leaks. File descriptors must be closed when the sandbox terminates.

This approach follows the principle of least privilege while maintaining functionality. Falling back to root privilege checking ensures compatibility with systems where user namespaces might be disabled.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: The sandbox can be used by non-root users on systems with user namespace support, improving security.

These pitfalls often manifest as subtle bugs that only appear under specific conditions or with certain workloads, making them particularly dangerous for security-critical systems.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting SIGCHLD Handling in PID Namespaces</strong></p>\n<p>When creating PID namespaces, the first process in the namespace (PID 1) takes on special responsibilities similar to the init process on a normal system. One critical responsibility is reaping zombie child processes. If the sandbox creates child processes that terminate, they become zombies unless properly reaped by their parent.</p>\n<p>In a PID namespace, the PID 1 process must handle <code>SIGCHLD</code> signals and call <code>wait()</code> or <code>waitpid()</code> to clean up terminated children. Failure to do this results in zombie processes accumulating within the namespace, potentially exhausting process limits and causing resource leaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Zombie processes consume kernel resources (process table entries) and can eventually exhaust the system&#39;s process limit. In a sandbox environment, this can be exploited as a denial-of-service attack where malicious code creates many short-lived processes to exhaust resources.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Install a <code>SIGCHLD</code> signal handler that calls <code>waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG)</code> in a loop to reap all available zombie children. Alternatively, use <code>signalfd()</code> or <code>sigwaitinfo()</code> for synchronous signal handling that integrates better with event loops.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Mounting /proc in New PID Namespace</strong></p>\n<p>After creating a PID namespace, the <code>/proc</code> filesystem still reflects the host system&#39;s process view unless explicitly remounted. Many programs and system tools rely on <code>/proc</code> to discover running processes, system information, and resource usage. Without proper <code>/proc</code> mounting, these tools show incorrect information or fail entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Programs inside the sandbox see host system processes through <code>/proc</code>, breaking the isolation illusion and potentially revealing sensitive information about the host system. Additionally, process management tools like <code>ps</code> and <code>top</code> show incorrect information, making debugging and monitoring difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: After entering the new mount and PID namespaces but before executing the sandboxed program, mount a new <code>proc</code> filesystem: <code>mount(&quot;proc&quot;, &quot;/proc&quot;, &quot;proc&quot;, 0, NULL)</code>. Ensure the mount point exists and is properly cleaned up when the sandbox terminates.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect User Namespace UID/GID Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>User namespace mapping requires writing specific formats to <code>/proc/self/uid_map</code> and <code>/proc/self/gid_map</code> files. The format is strict: &quot;inside-id outside-id length&quot; with specific whitespace requirements. Incorrect format, invalid ranges, or permission issues cause mapping failures that can compromise security or functionality.</p>\n<p>Common mapping errors include: writing mappings after creating other namespaces (mappings must be written immediately), using incorrect UID ranges, forgetting to map GID in addition to UID, and not handling the single-write requirement (mappings can only be written once per namespace).</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Failed UID/GID mapping can leave the process without proper user identity, cause file permission issues, or in worst cases, grant unintended privileges. The process might not be able to access files it should own or might retain privileges it should have dropped.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Write UID and GID mappings immediately after creating the user namespace. Use the exact format: <code>printf(&quot;0 %d 1&quot;, getuid())</code> for single-identity mapping. Check write return values and handle errors explicitly. Test mappings by reading back the files and verifying the process&#39;s effective UID/GID.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Namespace Creation Without Proper Error Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Namespace creation can fail for various reasons: insufficient privileges, kernel features disabled, resource exhaustion, or policy restrictions. Failing to handle these errors properly can leave the process in an inconsistent state with partial namespace isolation, compromising security.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Partial namespace creation might give a false sense of security while leaving attack vectors open. For example, if PID namespace creation succeeds but network namespace creation fails, the sandboxed process has process isolation but retains network access, potentially allowing data exfiltration.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Check the return value of every <code>unshare()</code> call and handle failures appropriately. If any namespace creation fails, clean up successfully created namespaces and return to the original state. Provide clear error messages indicating which specific namespace creation failed and why. Test namespace creation under various failure conditions to ensure robust error handling.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Namespace Setup</strong></p>\n<p>Namespace creation involves multiple system calls that must be coordinated carefully. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads attempt namespace operations simultaneously, when the parent and child processes interact during setup, or when namespace file descriptors are accessed concurrently.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Race conditions can lead to processes ending up in wrong namespaces, namespace file descriptors becoming invalid, or cleanup operations failing. These issues are particularly dangerous because they might only manifest under specific timing conditions, making them difficult to detect during testing.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores when namespace operations might be accessed concurrently. Ensure parent-child process synchronization during namespace setup using mechanisms like pipes or signals. Avoid sharing namespace file descriptors between threads without proper synchronization.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Handling Nested Namespace Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p>Some systems or container environments already run inside namespaces, creating nested namespace scenarios. Creating namespaces within existing namespaces can have unexpected restrictions, capability requirements, or behavior differences. Additionally, some security policies explicitly prevent nested namespace creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Nested namespace creation might fail silently or create namespaces with different isolation properties than expected. Security policies might prevent namespace creation entirely, causing the sandbox to fail in production environments where it worked during development.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Detect existing namespace contexts by comparing namespace identifiers in <code>/proc/self/ns/</code> with <code>/proc/1/ns/</code>. Provide clear error messages when nested namespace creation is attempted but not supported. Test the sandbox in various deployment environments, including containers and systems with restrictive security policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The namespace isolation component requires careful orchestration of Linux system calls and proper resource management.

While namespace isolation provides the container for our security boundaries, filesystem isolation defines what the sandboxed process can actually see and access within those boundaries. This component transforms a potentially dangerous process that expects full system access into one that operates within a carefully crafted minimal environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ffilesystem-layout.svg\" alt=\"Isolated Filesystem Layout\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-fake-building\">Mental Model: The Fake Building</h3>\n<p>Understanding filesystem isolation requires thinking about it like constructing a <strong>fake building</strong> for a movie set. When filming a scene that takes place in a hospital, the production team doesn&#39;t need to build an actual functioning hospital—they only need to construct the rooms and corridors that will appear on camera, fill them with convincing props, and ensure the actors can&#39;t accidentally wander off the set into the real world.</p>\n<p>Similarly, filesystem isolation creates a <strong>convincing but minimal environment</strong> that contains everything the sandboxed process expects to find (essential binaries, libraries, device files) while ensuring it cannot escape to access the real host filesystem. The sandboxed process believes it&#39;s running on a complete Linux system, but it&#39;s actually operating within a carefully constructed façade that contains only what it needs and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Just as a movie set has controlled entry and exit points, <strong>chroot</strong> or <strong>pivot_root</strong> operations define the boundaries of this fake environment. The process can explore freely within its artificial world, but the walls are designed to be impenetrable—it cannot climb out of its confined space to reach the production equipment (real host system) beyond the set.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that <strong>most processes don&#39;t actually need access to the entire filesystem hierarchy</strong>. A typical application might only need access to its own executable, a few shared libraries, basic device files like <code>/dev/null</code>, and a temporary scratch space. By providing exactly these resources and nothing more, we create an environment that&#39;s functionally complete for the application but severely limited from an attacker&#39;s perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"minimal-root-filesystem-construction\">Minimal Root Filesystem Construction</h3>\n<p>Building the minimal root filesystem requires understanding <strong>exactly what components are necessary</strong> for the sandboxed process to function while excluding everything that could be exploited for privilege escalation or information disclosure. This construction process involves identifying dependencies, creating directory structures, and populating the environment with only essential files.</p>\n<p>The foundation of any Linux filesystem environment consists of several <strong>critical directory structures</strong> that processes expect to find. The <code>/bin</code> directory must contain essential executables that the sandboxed process might invoke, such as <code>/bin/sh</code> if the process needs to spawn shell commands. The <code>/lib</code> and <code>/lib64</code> directories house shared libraries that executables depend on—these are discovered by analyzing the dynamic linking requirements of all binaries included in the sandbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Library dependency resolution</strong> represents one of the most complex aspects of minimal filesystem construction. Every executable and shared library can depend on additional libraries, creating a dependency tree that must be fully resolved to avoid runtime failures. The <code>ldd</code> command reveals immediate dependencies, but this analysis must be performed recursively since dependencies can have their own dependencies. Dynamic linking also involves the runtime linker itself (typically <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> on x86_64 systems), which must be present and functional.</p>\n<p>The <code>/dev</code> directory requires careful population with <strong>device files that applications commonly expect</strong>. Most processes assume they can access <code>/dev/null</code> for discarding output, <code>/dev/zero</code> for obtaining null bytes, <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code> for entropy, and <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code>, <code>/dev/stderr</code> for standard I/O operations. However, dangerous device files like <code>/dev/mem</code> (direct memory access) or <code>/dev/kmem</code> (kernel memory) must be explicitly excluded to prevent privilege escalation.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration and data files</strong> represent another category that requires selective inclusion. Many applications expect to find configuration files in <code>/etc</code>, such as <code>/etc/passwd</code> for user information, <code>/etc/group</code> for group definitions, or <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> for DNS resolution. However, these files should be created specifically for the sandbox environment rather than copied from the host system, as host configuration files might contain sensitive information or references to resources outside the sandbox.</p>\n<p>The minimal filesystem construction process follows a <strong>systematic approach</strong> to ensure completeness while maintaining security:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Analyze the target executable</strong> using <code>ldd</code> and similar tools to identify all shared library dependencies</li>\n<li><strong>Create the essential directory structure</strong> with appropriate permissions: <code>/bin</code>, <code>/lib</code>, <code>/lib64</code>, <code>/dev</code>, <code>/proc</code>, <code>/tmp</code>, <code>/etc</code></li>\n<li><strong>Copy required executables</strong> to <code>/bin</code>, ensuring they have appropriate permissions (typically 755) and are owned by root</li>\n<li><strong>Recursively copy all library dependencies</strong> to <code>/lib</code> and <code>/lib64</code>, following the same ownership and permission patterns as the host system</li>\n<li><strong>Create essential device files</strong> using <code>mknod</code> with appropriate major and minor numbers, limiting to safe devices only</li>\n<li><strong>Generate minimal configuration files</strong> in <code>/etc</code> with sandbox-specific content that doesn&#39;t expose host information</li>\n<li><strong>Set up temporary and writable areas</strong> that the process can use for scratch space without affecting the host system</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>size optimization</strong> of the minimal filesystem becomes critical when running multiple sandbox instances. Each sandbox requires its own filesystem copy to maintain isolation, so minimizing the size reduces memory usage and creation time. This optimization involves identifying which libraries are truly necessary versus those that are transitively included but never used, and potentially using static linking for simple executables to eliminate library dependencies entirely.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Directory</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Considerations</th>\n<th>Typical Contents</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>/bin</code></td>\n<td>Essential executables</td>\n<td>Include only necessary binaries</td>\n<td><code>sh</code>, target executable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/lib</code>, <code>/lib64</code></td>\n<td>Shared libraries</td>\n<td>Resolve all dependencies</td>\n<td><code>libc.so.6</code>, <code>ld-linux.so.2</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/dev</code></td>\n<td>Device files</td>\n<td>Include only safe devices</td>\n<td><code>null</code>, <code>zero</code>, <code>random</code>, <code>urandom</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/etc</code></td>\n<td>Configuration files</td>\n<td>Create sandbox-specific configs</td>\n<td><code>passwd</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>hosts</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/tmp</code></td>\n<td>Temporary storage</td>\n<td>Writable, size-limited</td>\n<td>Empty directory with 1777 permissions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/proc</code></td>\n<td>Process information</td>\n<td>Mount read-only when possible</td>\n<td>Kernel-provided filesystem</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"chroot-vs-pivot-root-decision\">Chroot vs Pivot Root Decision</h3>\n<p>The choice between <strong>chroot</strong> and <strong>pivot_root</strong> for filesystem isolation represents a fundamental architectural decision that affects both security robustness and implementation complexity. Both mechanisms change the apparent root directory for processes, but they operate through different principles and provide different levels of isolation guarantees.</p>\n<p><strong>Chroot</strong> operates by changing the root directory reference for a process and its children without affecting the underlying mount namespace structure. When a process calls <code>chroot(&quot;/new/root&quot;)</code>, the kernel updates the process&#39;s root directory pointer, making all absolute paths resolve relative to the new location. However, the old root filesystem remains mounted and potentially accessible through various escape mechanisms, particularly if the process has sufficient privileges or can manipulate file descriptors that point outside the chroot environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pivot_root</strong>, conversely, operates at the mount namespace level by atomically swapping two mount points—making the new root the actual root of the mount namespace while moving the old root to a specified location within the new hierarchy. This approach provides stronger isolation because it actually changes the mount namespace structure rather than just adjusting process-level path resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use pivot_root for filesystem isolation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need robust filesystem isolation that prevents sandbox escape attempts while maintaining clean separation from host filesystem</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: chroot-only approach, pivot_root with old root cleanup, hybrid approach using both mechanisms</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement pivot_root with immediate cleanup of old root references</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Pivot_root provides stronger security guarantees by actually restructuring the mount namespace rather than relying on path resolution changes.

The process begins by creating the minimal root filesystem in a temporary location, then setting up a new mount namespace where pivot_root can operate safely. The old root must be moved to a location within the new root hierarchy before being unmounted and removed to prevent any references from persisting.</p>\n<p><strong>Security implications</strong> of this choice extend beyond simple path resolution. Chroot environments can be escaped through various mechanisms: processes with sufficient privileges can create device files to access raw disk devices, file descriptors opened before the chroot can provide access to external files, and /proc filesystem entries can potentially be traversed to reach the original root. Pivot_root eliminates most of these vectors by actually restructuring the filesystem view rather than layering path resolution changes on top of the existing structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Error handling complexity</strong> differs significantly between approaches. Chroot failures are typically straightforward—either the target directory exists and is accessible, or the operation fails. Pivot_root failures can be more complex, involving mount namespace state, filesystem busy conditions, or cleanup of partially completed operations. The implementation must handle these failure modes gracefully while ensuring that failed sandbox creation doesn&#39;t leave mount artifacts on the host system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mount-management\">Mount Management</h3>\n<p>Effective mount management ensures that the sandbox filesystem contains necessary kernel-provided filesystems while preventing escape vectors through filesystem traversal or mount manipulation. The sandbox requires access to <strong>pseudo-filesystems</strong> like <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and <code>/sys</code> for normal operation, but these mounts must be configured to prevent information disclosure and privilege escalation.</p>\n<p><strong>Proc filesystem mounting</strong> provides essential process and system information that applications frequently require. However, the standard <code>/proc</code> mount reveals extensive information about the host system, including all running processes, kernel configuration, and system resource usage. The sandbox implementation must mount <code>/proc</code> within the isolated filesystem while ensuring that the <strong>PID namespace isolation</strong> from Milestone 1 limits the visible process information to only processes within the same namespace.</p>\n<p>The <code>/proc</code> mount also contains sensitive entries that can be exploited for container escape, particularly <code>/proc/*/root</code> symlinks that point to the root directory of arbitrary processes. If a sandboxed process can access <code>/proc/1/root</code> (assuming PID 1 exists outside the sandbox), it might be able to traverse back to the host filesystem. <strong>Proper PID namespace isolation</strong> prevents this by ensuring that external processes are not visible within the sandbox&#39;s <code>/proc</code> view.</p>\n<p><strong>Dev filesystem population</strong> requires creating device files that applications expect while excluding dangerous devices that could enable privilege escalation. The sandbox needs basic devices like <code>/dev/null</code>, <code>/dev/zero</code>, and <code>/dev/random</code>, but it must not include devices like <code>/dev/mem</code> or <code>/dev/kmem</code> that provide raw system access. Rather than mounting the host&#39;s <code>/dev</code> directly, the implementation creates a new tmpfs mount at <code>/dev</code> and populates it with only the necessary device files.</p>\n<p><strong>Tmpfs mounts</strong> provide writable storage areas within the sandbox without affecting the host filesystem. These mounts are backed by memory and swap space rather than persistent storage, ensuring that any modifications made by the sandboxed process are automatically cleaned up when the sandbox terminates. Common tmpfs mount points include <code>/tmp</code> for temporary files and potentially <code>/var</code> or application-specific directories that need write access.</p>\n<p>The <strong>mount sequence</strong> must be carefully ordered to avoid conflicts and ensure proper layering of filesystem views:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create and mount the new root filesystem</strong> using bind mounts or copying files to a tmpfs</li>\n<li><strong>Set up pivot_root preparation</strong> by creating the old root directory within the new root</li>\n<li><strong>Execute pivot_root operation</strong> to swap the root filesystem</li>\n<li><strong>Mount /proc within the new root</strong> to provide process information within the PID namespace</li>\n<li><strong>Create and populate /dev</strong> as a tmpfs with necessary device files</li>\n<li><strong>Mount additional tmpfs filesystems</strong> for writable areas like <code>/tmp</code></li>\n<li><strong>Unmount and remove the old root</strong> to complete the isolation</li>\n<li><strong>Apply mount options</strong> like read-only, noexec, nosuid, nodev where appropriate</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Mount option security</strong> plays a crucial role in preventing various attack vectors. The <code>noexec</code> option prevents execution of binaries from specific mount points, which is particularly important for writable areas like <code>/tmp</code>. The <code>nosuid</code> option prevents set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits from taking effect, limiting privilege escalation attempts. The <code>nodev</code> option prevents device files from being interpreted as such, even if they have the correct major and minor numbers.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mount Point</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Options</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Security Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>/</code></td>\n<td>tmpfs or bind</td>\n<td>ro, nodev</td>\n<td>Root filesystem</td>\n<td>Read-only prevents modification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/proc</code></td>\n<td>proc</td>\n<td>ro, nosuid, nodev, noexec</td>\n<td>Process information</td>\n<td>Limited by PID namespace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/dev</code></td>\n<td>tmpfs</td>\n<td>rw, nosuid, noexec</td>\n<td>Device files</td>\n<td>Manually populated with safe devices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/tmp</code></td>\n<td>tmpfs</td>\n<td>rw, noexec, nosuid, nodev</td>\n<td>Temporary storage</td>\n<td>Prevent execution and privilege escalation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>/var/tmp</code></td>\n<td>tmpfs</td>\n<td>rw, noexec, nosuid, nodev</td>\n<td>Application temp</td>\n<td>Size-limited scratch space</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Bind mount restrictions</strong> prevent the sandboxed process from accessing sensitive host filesystem locations even if it manages to create new mount points. The implementation must ensure that no bind mounts provide access to locations like <code>/etc/shadow</code>, <code>/proc</code> from the host mount namespace, or any directory containing sensitive files. This restriction is typically enforced by ensuring that the sandbox root filesystem is completely separate from the host filesystem rather than layering access controls on top of host directories.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The filesystem isolation component requires several critical architectural decisions that balance security, performance, and maintainability. These decisions affect how the sandbox creates, manages, and cleans up filesystem environments across multiple concurrent instances.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use tmpfs-backed sandbox filesystems with COW optimization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need isolated filesystem for each sandbox instance while minimizing memory usage and creation time for multiple concurrent sandboxes</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Directory copying per sandbox, tmpfs with full file copying, COW filesystem overlays, shared read-only base with per-instance writable layers</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement tmpfs-based sandboxes with copy-on-write overlays for shared components</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Tmpfs provides automatic cleanup and memory-backed performance, while COW overlays allow sharing of common files (libraries, binaries) across multiple sandbox instances, significantly reducing memory footprint</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires overlay filesystem support in kernel, increases implementation complexity, but provides excellent scalability for multiple concurrent sandboxes</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Filesystem lifecycle management</strong> determines how sandbox filesystems are created, maintained, and destroyed throughout the sandbox lifetime. The implementation must handle creation failures gracefully, ensure proper cleanup even when sandboxed processes terminate unexpectedly, and provide isolation between concurrent sandbox instances sharing the same host system.</p>\n<p>The <strong>creation process</strong> begins with establishing a new mount namespace (provided by the namespace isolation component) and then constructing the minimal filesystem within that namespace. This construction can follow several strategies: copying files from a template directory, extracting from a prepared archive, or assembling from shared components using overlay mounts. Each approach offers different trade-offs between creation time, memory usage, and customization flexibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Template-based creation</strong> involves preparing a complete minimal filesystem template during sandbox initialization and then copying or bind-mounting this template for each new sandbox instance. This approach provides fast startup times since the dependency resolution and file copying is done once during initialization rather than for each sandbox. However, it requires more disk space and doesn&#39;t allow for per-sandbox customization of the filesystem contents.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Implement read-only base with per-sandbox writable overlays</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Balance between sharing common components across sandboxes while allowing per-instance modifications and maintaining strict isolation</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Complete filesystem copying, shared read-only base, overlay filesystems, union mounts</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Create shared read-only base filesystem with per-sandbox tmpfs overlays for writable areas</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maximizes sharing of common files (executables, libraries) while ensuring complete isolation for writable areas. Tmpfs overlays provide automatic cleanup and prevent persistent storage of sandbox modifications</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful management of overlay mount points and cleanup, but provides optimal memory efficiency and strong isolation guarantees</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Writable area management</strong> addresses the need for sandboxed processes to create temporary files, modify application state, or generate output while preventing these modifications from affecting other sandbox instances or persisting beyond the sandbox lifetime. The implementation uses <strong>tmpfs mounts</strong> for writable areas, ensuring that all modifications are memory-backed and automatically cleaned up when the sandbox terminates.</p>\n<p>The overlay approach requires <strong>careful mount point management</strong> to ensure that writable areas are properly isolated while shared areas remain accessible. The implementation creates tmpfs mounts at specific locations (<code>/tmp</code>, <code>/var/tmp</code>, potentially application-specific directories) and uses bind mounts or overlay filesystems to compose the final filesystem view that the sandboxed process observes.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleanup and resource management</strong> becomes critical when running multiple sandbox instances concurrently. Each sandbox creates mount points, temporary directories, and potentially overlay filesystems that must be properly cleaned up to prevent resource leaks. The cleanup process must handle cases where the sandboxed process terminates cleanly, crashes unexpectedly, or becomes unresponsive.</p>\n<p>The <strong>cleanup sequence</strong> follows a specific order to avoid conflicts and ensure complete resource deallocation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Terminate the sandboxed process</strong> if it&#39;s still running</li>\n<li><strong>Unmount all tmpfs and overlay mounts</strong> in reverse order of creation</li>\n<li><strong>Remove temporary directories</strong> created for the sandbox instance</li>\n<li><strong>Clean up any bind mounts</strong> that were created for the sandbox</li>\n<li><strong>Verify that all resources are freed</strong> and log any cleanup failures for debugging</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Architecture Aspect</th>\n<th>Chosen Approach</th>\n<th>Alternative</th>\n<th>Trade-off Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Base filesystem</td>\n<td>Shared read-only template</td>\n<td>Per-sandbox copying</td>\n<td>Memory efficiency for concurrent instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Writable areas</td>\n<td>Per-sandbox tmpfs overlays</td>\n<td>Shared writable space</td>\n<td>Complete isolation between instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Library sharing</td>\n<td>Shared base with COW</td>\n<td>Individual copies</td>\n<td>Reduced memory footprint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleanup strategy</td>\n<td>Automatic tmpfs cleanup</td>\n<td>Manual file deletion</td>\n<td>Guaranteed cleanup even on crashes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount namespace</td>\n<td>Per-sandbox isolation</td>\n<td>Shared with restrictions</td>\n<td>Complete filesystem isolation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Performance optimization</strong> considerations affect how the filesystem isolation component handles concurrent sandbox creation and teardown. Creating a new sandbox involves multiple filesystem operations (mounting, copying, device file creation) that can become a bottleneck when launching many sandboxes simultaneously. The implementation should pre-compute as much as possible and use efficient copying mechanisms like hard links where security permits.</p>\n<p><strong>Error recovery mechanisms</strong> ensure that partially created sandbox filesystems don&#39;t leave artifacts on the host system. If sandbox creation fails partway through the process, the cleanup logic must be able to identify and remove any mount points, temporary directories, or other resources that were created before the failure. This requires maintaining state about what resources have been allocated and ensuring that the cleanup code can handle incomplete resource sets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Filesystem isolation implementation involves several complex interactions between mount namespaces, file permissions, and process privileges that create opportunities for subtle but dangerous mistakes. Understanding these common pitfalls helps avoid security vulnerabilities and operational issues that can compromise the entire sandbox system.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Library Dependency Resolution</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations fail to properly resolve all shared library dependencies, leading to runtime failures when the sandboxed process attempts to load missing libraries. This issue often manifests intermittently because some libraries are loaded only when specific code paths are executed, making the problem difficult to detect during initial testing.</p>\n<p>The root cause typically involves <strong>incomplete recursive dependency analysis</strong>. Using <code>ldd</code> on the main executable reveals immediate dependencies, but those libraries may themselves depend on additional libraries that are loaded dynamically. For example, <code>libc.so.6</code> might depend on <code>ld-linux.so.2</code>, and various libraries might require plugins or modules that are loaded at runtime based on configuration or feature usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: The sandboxed process fails with &quot;cannot open shared object file&quot; errors, often occurring only when specific features are used rather than immediately at startup.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement recursive dependency scanning that follows the entire dependency tree, use tools like <code>objdump -p</code> to examine dynamic section requirements, and consider using <code>strace</code> on the target executable in a non-sandboxed environment to identify all libraries actually loaded during typical operation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient /dev Device Population</strong></p>\n<p>Sandboxed processes frequently fail because they cannot access expected device files in <code>/dev</code>, but the symptoms often appear as generic I/O errors rather than clearly indicating missing devices. Applications assume that standard devices like <code>/dev/null</code>, <code>/dev/zero</code>, and <code>/dev/urandom</code> are always available, and their absence can cause unexpected behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical devices</strong> that are commonly required include <code>/dev/null</code> (for output redirection), <code>/dev/zero</code> (for memory mapping), <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code> (for entropy), and the standard I/O devices (<code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code>, <code>/dev/stderr</code>). Missing any of these can cause applications to fail in non-obvious ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: Applications fail with permission denied errors when attempting I/O operations, random number generation fails, or processes hang when trying to access entropy sources.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Create a comprehensive device population function that creates all standard devices with correct major/minor numbers and permissions. Use <code>ls -la /dev</code> on the host system to identify the correct device parameters, but be selective about which devices to include.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// Essential devices with major/minor numbers and permissions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> device_spec {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    char</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> *</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">name;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    mode_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> mode;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    dev_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> device_number;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">};</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">static</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> device_spec essential_devices</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">[]</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"/dev/null\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, S_IFCHR </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">|</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">666</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">makedev</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">3</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)},</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"/dev/zero\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, S_IFCHR </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">|</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">666</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">makedev</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">5</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)},</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"/dev/random\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, S_IFCHR </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">|</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">444</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">makedev</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">8</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)},</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    {</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"/dev/urandom\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, S_IFCHR </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">|</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> 0</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">444</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">makedev</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">1</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">, </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">9</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">)},</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    // ... additional devices</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">};</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mount Point Cleanup Race Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>Improper cleanup of mount points can lead to resource leaks, permission errors, or in severe cases, interference between different sandbox instances. The cleanup process must handle cases where mount points are busy, processes are still accessing mounted filesystems, or the cleanup itself is interrupted.</p>\n<p><strong>Race conditions</strong> commonly occur when the sandboxed process is still running when cleanup begins, when multiple threads are accessing the filesystem simultaneously, or when the cleanup process itself fails partway through the sequence. These races can leave orphaned mount points that consume system resources and potentially interfere with subsequent sandbox creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: Mount points remain visible in <code>/proc/mounts</code> after sandbox termination, &quot;device busy&quot; errors during cleanup, or mounting failures in subsequent sandboxes due to existing mount points.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement a robust cleanup sequence that first ensures all processes using the mount points have terminated, then unmounts in reverse order of creation, and finally verifies that all mount points have been successfully removed.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate /proc Mount Security</strong></p>\n<p>Mounting <code>/proc</code> within the sandbox without proper consideration of PID namespace isolation can leak information about host processes or provide escape vectors through <code>/proc</code> entries that reference external resources.

If the sandboxed process can see processes outside its PID namespace, these entries provide potential escape routes.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: The sandboxed process can see host processes in <code>/proc</code>, can traverse <code>/proc/*/root</code> to access the host filesystem, or can access <code>/proc/sys</code> entries that should be restricted.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Ensure that PID namespace isolation is properly configured before mounting <code>/proc</code>, consider mounting <code>/proc</code> read-only, and potentially use mount options or bind mounts to restrict access to sensitive <code>/proc</code> subdirectories.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Writable Area Permission Confusion</strong></p>\n<p>Incorrect permissions on writable areas can either prevent legitimate application operation or provide unintended privilege escalation opportunities.

Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section corresponds to Milestone 3 (Seccomp System Call Filtering) and builds upon the namespace and filesystem isolation from Milestones 1-2, providing system call-level restrictions that will be enhanced by resource limits (Milestone 4) and capability dropping (Milestone 5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The system call filtering component represents the third layer in our defense-in-depth sandbox architecture. While namespace isolation creates separate views of system resources and filesystem isolation restricts access to files and directories, system call filtering operates at the most fundamental level—controlling which kernel operations the sandboxed process can invoke. This component uses Linux&#39;s <strong>seccomp</strong> (secure computing) mechanism with Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs to create a kernel-enforced whitelist of permitted system calls.</p>\n<p>Think of seccomp as installing a strict security checkpoint between user space and kernel space. Every time the sandboxed process attempts to invoke a system call—whether to open a file, allocate memory, or communicate over a network—the seccomp filter program examines the request and decides whether to allow it, block it, or terminate the process entirely. This filtering happens at the kernel level, making it impossible for malicious code to bypass through clever programming tricks or exploits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-strict-gatekeeper\">Mental Model: The Strict Gatekeeper</h3>\n<p>Understanding seccomp requires thinking about the fundamental boundary between user space and kernel space in Linux systems. Every program runs in user space, which provides a safe, virtualized environment with limited privileges. When a program needs to perform privileged operations—reading files, allocating memory, creating network connections—it must request these services from the kernel through <strong>system calls</strong>.</p>\n<p>Imagine the kernel as a high-security government building, and system calls as different types of access requests. Normally, any program with appropriate permissions can enter through various doors: the &quot;file access&quot; entrance, the &quot;network communication&quot; lobby, the &quot;process creation&quot; wing. Each system call represents a different way to enter the kernel and request services.</p>\n<p>Now imagine installing an extremely strict gatekeeper at every entrance to this building. This gatekeeper has been given a detailed list of who is allowed through which doors, under what circumstances, and with what identification. The gatekeeper doesn&#39;t just check identity—they inspect every detail of each access request: which door the visitor wants to use, what they&#39;re carrying, where they claim to be going, and what they intend to do once inside.</p>\n<p>This is exactly how seccomp-BPF works. The <strong>BPF filter program</strong> acts as the gatekeeper, examining every system call attempt. For each system call, the filter can inspect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>system call number</strong> (which &quot;door&quot; they&#39;re trying to use)</li>\n<li>The <strong>arguments</strong> passed to the system call (what they&#39;re &quot;carrying&quot;)</li>\n<li>The <strong>architecture</strong> of the calling process (their &quot;identification type&quot;)</li>\n<li>Other <strong>process characteristics</strong> available in the seccomp context</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on this inspection, the gatekeeper makes one of several decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW</strong>: &quot;You&#39;re on the approved list—go right in&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO</strong>: &quot;Access denied—here&#39;s an error code explaining why&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</strong>: &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to be here at all—security breach!&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_TRAP</strong>: &quot;Hold on—let me call the supervisor to handle this special case&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key insight is that this gatekeeper operates at the kernel level, not in user space. Once a seccomp filter is installed and the <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag is set, there&#39;s no way for the sandboxed process to remove or bypass the filter. Even if an attacker gains complete control of the sandboxed process, they&#39;re still constrained by the system call restrictions enforced by the kernel itself.</p>\n<p>This creates a powerful security boundary that complements our namespace and filesystem isolation. An attacker might find ways to escape chroot or manipulate filesystem paths, but they still cannot invoke forbidden system calls like <code>ptrace</code> (for debugging other processes), <code>mount</code> (for manipulating filesystems), or <code>socket</code> (for creating network connections) if these are blocked by the seccomp filter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bpf-filter-program-design\">BPF Filter Program Design</h3>\n<p>Berkeley Packet Filter programs provide the mechanism for implementing sophisticated system call filtering logic. Originally designed for high-performance network packet filtering, BPF has evolved into a general-purpose kernel programming interface. In the context of seccomp, BPF programs examine system call invocations and return decisions about whether to allow or block them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fseccomp-filter-flow.svg\" alt=\"Seccomp BPF Filter Evaluation\"></p>\n<p>A <strong>BPF filter program</strong> consists of a sequence of instructions that operate on a virtual machine within the kernel. This virtual machine provides a safe execution environment where filter programs can examine data without risking kernel stability. The BPF instruction set includes arithmetic operations, comparison operations, memory access operations, and control flow operations, but is deliberately constrained to ensure that programs always terminate and cannot cause kernel crashes.</p>\n<p>When a system call occurs, the kernel creates a <strong>seccomp data structure</strong> containing information about the system call attempt. This structure includes the system call number, the architecture identifier, and all six system call arguments. The BPF program receives a pointer to this data structure and can examine any fields within it to make filtering decisions.</p>\n<p>The fundamental structure of a seccomp BPF program follows this pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Architecture Validation</strong>: First, check that the system call comes from the expected architecture (x86_64, ARM, etc.). Different architectures use different system call numbers for the same operations, so this validation prevents bypass attempts using alternative architectures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>System Call Number Extraction</strong>: Load the system call number from the seccomp data structure and use it as the primary filtering criterion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Whitelist Comparison</strong>: Compare the system call number against a list of permitted operations. This typically involves a series of conditional jumps that either allow the system call or continue to the next check.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Argument-Level Filtering</strong>: For system calls that require additional scrutiny, examine the arguments to apply more sophisticated filtering rules. For example, an <code>openat</code> system call might be allowed only when opening files under specific directory paths.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Default Action</strong>: If no explicit allow rule matches, apply the default action—typically either returning an error or killing the process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The BPF instruction format uses a compact representation where each instruction contains an operation code, addressing information, and immediate values or jump offsets. Instructions can perform operations like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BPF_LD</strong>: Load data from the seccomp structure</li>\n<li><strong>BPF_JMP</strong>: Conditional or unconditional jumps for control flow</li>\n<li><strong>BPF_ALU</strong>: Arithmetic and logical operations on loaded values</li>\n<li><strong>BPF_RET</strong>: Return a seccomp action code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Building effective BPF programs requires understanding both the instruction set and the data layout of the seccomp structure. The seccomp data provides access to system call information through fixed offsets, allowing BPF programs to load and examine specific fields efficiently.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>BPF Program Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Key Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Architecture Check</td>\n<td>Prevent bypass via alternative architectures</td>\n<td>Must handle x86_64, ARM64, etc. based on target</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Call Lookup</td>\n<td>Primary filtering by system call number</td>\n<td>Requires architecture-specific syscall mappings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Argument Examination</td>\n<td>Fine-grained filtering based on parameters</td>\n<td>Limited to simple comparisons and ranges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return Action</td>\n<td>Decision about allowing or blocking call</td>\n<td>ALLOW, ERRNO, KILL, or TRAP actions available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Program Validation</td>\n<td>Kernel verification of BPF safety</td>\n<td>Must prove termination and memory safety</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>One critical aspect of BPF program design is <strong>performance optimization</strong>. Since every system call triggers BPF program execution, inefficient filters can significantly impact application performance. Well-designed programs place the most common system calls early in the decision tree and use jump tables rather than linear searches when possible. However, premature optimization should be avoided—clarity and correctness take precedence over micro-optimizations in most sandbox scenarios.</p>\n<p>The kernel imposes several <strong>safety constraints</strong> on BPF programs that influence their design. Programs must be provably terminating (no infinite loops), cannot access arbitrary kernel memory (only the provided seccomp structure), and cannot perform operations that might compromise kernel stability. The kernel&#39;s BPF verifier analyzes every program before allowing its installation, rejecting programs that violate these safety properties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-call-whitelist-strategy\">System Call Whitelist Strategy</h3>\n<p>Developing an effective system call whitelist requires balancing security restrictions with functional requirements. The challenge lies in identifying the minimal set of system calls necessary for the sandboxed application to operate while blocking all operations that could be used for malicious purposes. This decision significantly impacts both the security posture and the compatibility of the sandbox.</p>\n<p>The <strong>whitelist approach</strong> forms the foundation of secure system call filtering. Rather than attempting to blacklist dangerous operations (which inevitably misses newly discovered attack vectors), a whitelist explicitly enumerates every permitted operation. This approach follows the <strong>principle of least privilege</strong>—start with no permissions and grant only the minimum access required for legitimate functionality.</p>\n<p>Constructing an effective whitelist begins with <strong>profiling the target application</strong> to understand its system call usage patterns. This involves running representative workloads under <code>strace</code> or similar tracing tools to capture the complete set of system calls invoked during normal operation. The profiling process must cover all code paths, including error handling routines and initialization sequences, to avoid missing essential system calls.</p>\n<p>However, raw profiling data typically reveals many more system calls than actually necessary. Modern C libraries like glibc implement high-level functions using multiple system calls and may use different implementation strategies depending on kernel version or runtime conditions. For example, file operations might use either <code>open</code> or <code>openat</code>, and memory allocation might invoke <code>brk</code>, <code>mmap</code>, or <code>mmap2</code> depending on allocation size and system configuration.</p>\n<p>The whitelist construction process involves several refinement steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Essential System Calls</strong>: Start with fundamental operations required for any meaningful program execution—memory management (<code>brk</code>, <code>mmap</code>, <code>munmap</code>), process lifecycle (<code>exit</code>, <code>exit_group</code>), and basic I/O (<code>read</code>, <code>write</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application-Specific Operations</strong>: Add system calls required by the specific application being sandboxed. Web servers need socket operations, file processors need filesystem access, computational applications need mathematical libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Library Dependencies</strong>: Include system calls required by shared libraries used by the application. This often includes dynamic linking operations (<code>mmap</code> for library loading), locale processing (<code>open</code> for locale data), and runtime configuration (<code>access</code> for configuration file checks).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling Paths</strong>: Ensure that error conditions don&#39;t trigger forbidden system calls. For example, failed memory allocations might trigger alternative allocation strategies that use different system calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Platform Variations</strong>: Account for differences between kernel versions, distributions, and architectures. System call numbers and availability vary significantly across platforms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>System Call Category</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Security Considerations</th>\n<th>Inclusion Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory Management</td>\n<td><code>brk</code>, <code>mmap</code>, <code>munmap</code>, <code>madvise</code></td>\n<td>Required for basic operation, low risk</td>\n<td>Always include with argument restrictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Operations</td>\n<td><code>open</code>, <code>openat</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>close</code></td>\n<td>High risk if unrestricted</td>\n<td>Include with path-based filtering when possible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Control</td>\n<td><code>fork</code>, <code>clone</code>, <code>execve</code>, <code>wait4</code></td>\n<td>Very high risk, enables privilege escalation</td>\n<td>Exclude unless absolutely necessary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Operations</td>\n<td><code>socket</code>, <code>connect</code>, <code>sendto</code>, <code>recvfrom</code></td>\n<td>High risk, enables data exfiltration</td>\n<td>Exclude for offline processing, restrict for network services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Information</td>\n<td><code>getpid</code>, <code>getuid</code>, <code>uname</code>, <code>clock_gettime</code></td>\n<td>Generally safe, information disclosure</td>\n<td>Include with minimal restrictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handling</td>\n<td><code>sigaction</code>, <code>sigprocmask</code>, <code>sigreturn</code></td>\n<td>Required for proper error handling</td>\n<td>Include but monitor for abuse</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Architecture-specific considerations</strong> add significant complexity to whitelist development. Linux supports multiple processor architectures, each with its own system call numbering scheme. The same logical operation (like reading a file) uses different system call numbers on x86_64 versus ARM64. Additionally, some architectures provide multiple system calls for similar operations—for example, x86_64 has both <code>open</code> and <code>openat</code> system calls, while newer architectures only provide <code>openat</code>.</p>\n<p>Modern seccomp filtering addresses this by requiring <strong>architecture validation</strong> as the first step in every BPF program. The filter must explicitly check the architecture field in the seccomp data and either handle each supported architecture separately or reject calls from unexpected architectures entirely. This prevents attackers from bypassing filters by switching to alternative architectures or using compatibility layers.</p>\n<p>The <strong>glibc complexity problem</strong> represents one of the most challenging aspects of whitelist development. The GNU C Library implements standard library functions using various system calls, and its implementation strategy can change between versions or based on runtime conditions. For example, <code>malloc()</code> might use <code>brk()</code> for small allocations and <code>mmap()</code> for large ones, but the threshold and exact behavior depend on glibc configuration and heap state.</p>\n<p>To address glibc complexity, many sandbox implementations adopt a <strong>learning mode</strong> approach. They initially run the target application with permissive logging to capture all attempted system calls, then iteratively refine the whitelist based on observed behavior. This process must be repeated across different environments and workloads to ensure comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The most secure whitelist is often not the most restrictive one. A whitelist that&#39;s too restrictive will force developers to add exceptions or disable filtering entirely, ultimately reducing security. The goal is finding the minimal set that reliably supports legitimate application behavior while blocking meaningful attack vectors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"argument-level-filtering\">Argument-Level Filtering</h3>\n<p>While system call number filtering provides a foundation for sandbox security, many attacks exploit legitimate system calls with malicious arguments rather than using forbidden operations entirely. <strong>Argument-level filtering</strong> extends seccomp protection by examining the parameters passed to allowed system calls and applying additional restrictions based on their values. This approach enables much more sophisticated security policies that can distinguish between safe and dangerous uses of the same system call.</p>\n<p>Consider the <code>openat</code> system call, which opens files and directories. Blocking <code>openat</code> entirely would prevent the sandboxed process from reading any files, making most applications non-functional. However, allowing unrestricted <code>openat</code> enables attackers to access sensitive system files, escape chroot restrictions, or open device files for privilege escalation. Argument-level filtering resolves this dilemma by examining the path parameter and allowing only access to safe locations.</p>\n<p>The <strong>seccomp data structure</strong> provides access to all system call arguments through fixed offsets. Each system call can accept up to six arguments, stored as 64-bit values in the seccomp context. BPF programs can load these arguments and apply various filtering operations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Exact Value Matching</strong>: Compare arguments against specific allowed values. For example, restrict file descriptors to standard input/output/error (0, 1, 2).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Range Checking</strong>: Verify that numeric arguments fall within acceptable ranges. Memory allocation sizes, signal numbers, and priority values often have safe operational ranges.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bitmask Validation</strong>: Check that flag arguments contain only permitted bit combinations. Many system calls accept flag parameters that control behavior—filtering can ensure only safe flag combinations are used.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pointer Validation</strong>: Limited validation of pointer arguments, typically checking for null pointers or obvious invalid values (though comprehensive pointer validation requires kernel cooperation).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, argument-level filtering faces significant <strong>technical limitations</strong> that constrain its effectiveness. BPF programs operate in kernel space but cannot safely dereference user space pointers. This means that string arguments (like file paths) cannot be directly examined by the filter program. The BPF program can check whether a pointer is null and validate its numeric value, but cannot inspect the string content it points to.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Filtering Technique</th>\n<th>Applicable Argument Types</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Exact Value Match</td>\n<td>Integers, flags, file descriptors</td>\n<td>High for specific values</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Range Validation</td>\n<td>Sizes, counts, priorities</td>\n<td>Medium for preventing extremes</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bitmask Filtering</td>\n<td>Flag combinations, permissions</td>\n<td>High for controlling behavior</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pointer Null Check</td>\n<td>All pointer types</td>\n<td>Low but prevents crashes</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String Content Filtering</td>\n<td>File paths, names</td>\n<td>Very high but not directly possible</td>\n<td>High (requires kernel cooperation)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This limitation has led to the development of <strong>hybrid filtering approaches</strong> that combine BPF-based argument filtering with user space policy enforcement. The seccomp filter handles straightforward numeric validation, while more complex string-based policies are implemented through other mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>User Space Helpers</strong>: The BPF program can return <code>SECCOMP_RET_TRAP</code>, which triggers a signal handler in user space. The signal handler can examine string arguments and decide whether to allow the operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Seccomp Notify Extension</strong>: Modern kernels support <code>SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF</code>, which suspends the system call and notifies a supervisor process. The supervisor can examine all arguments, including string content, and decide whether to allow, modify, or deny the operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Path-Based Restrictions</strong>: Combine seccomp filtering with filesystem isolation. Rather than trying to filter file paths in BPF, use chroot or mount namespaces to ensure that all accessible paths are safe.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these limitations, argument-level filtering provides valuable security benefits for numeric parameters. Consider these practical examples:</p>\n<p><strong>File Descriptor Validation</strong>: Many attacks involve manipulating file descriptors to access unexpected files. A seccomp filter can restrict file operations to known-safe descriptors. For example, a log processing application might only be allowed to read from file descriptor 3 (the input log) and write to file descriptor 4 (the output file).</p>\n<p><strong>Signal Number Restriction</strong>: The <code>kill</code> system call allows sending signals to processes, but many signals can be used maliciously. Argument filtering can restrict signal sending to safe signals like <code>SIGTERM</code> while blocking dangerous ones like <code>SIGSTOP</code> or <code>SIGKILL</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory Protection Flags</strong>: The <code>mmap</code> system call accepts protection flags that control whether memory regions are readable, writable, or executable. Argument filtering can block requests for executable memory regions, preventing certain code injection attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Socket Domain Restrictions</strong>: If network access is required, socket creation can be restricted to specific domains and types. For example, allow only <code>AF_INET</code> TCP sockets while blocking <code>AF_UNIX</code> domain sockets that might bypass other restrictions.</p>\n<p>The implementation of argument-level filtering requires careful attention to <strong>system call ABI details</strong>. Different architectures pass arguments in different ways, and the seccomp data structure reflects the raw argument values as received by the kernel. This may include pointer values, packed structures, or encoded flags that require specific interpretation logic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Security Principle</strong>: Argument-level filtering is most effective when used to restrict the scope of allowed operations rather than trying to distinguish between safe and unsafe string content. Use it to limit numeric parameters to safe ranges and combine it with other isolation mechanisms for comprehensive protection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The design of an effective seccomp filtering system involves several critical decisions that significantly impact both security effectiveness and implementation complexity. These architectural choices must balance security goals with practical considerations like performance, maintainability, and compatibility across different environments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Whitelist vs Blacklist Filtering Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: System call filtering can either explicitly allow safe operations (whitelist) or explicitly block dangerous operations (blacklist). This fundamental choice affects the entire security model and determines how new system calls and attack vectors are handled.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li><strong>Blacklist Approach</strong>: Block known dangerous system calls, allow everything else</li>\n<li><strong>Whitelist Approach</strong>: Allow only known safe system calls, block everything else</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid Approach</strong>: Use whitelists for core functionality, blacklists for specific dangerous operations</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement pure whitelist filtering with comprehensive application profiling</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Blacklist approaches inevitably miss new attack vectors and fail-open when encountering unknown system calls. Whitelists provide stronger security guarantees by defaulting to denial and requiring explicit justification for each permitted operation. While more difficult to implement correctly, whitelists offer better long-term security properties.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires extensive profiling and testing to identify all necessary system calls. May break applications that use uncommon system calls or evolve over time. However, provides strong security guarantees and fails-safe when encountering unexpected operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Filtering Strategy</th>\n<th>Security Strength</th>\n<th>Implementation Effort</th>\n<th>Maintenance Burden</th>\n<th>Compatibility Risk</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Blacklist Only</td>\n<td>Low - misses new attacks</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>High - requires tracking new threats</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whitelist Only</td>\n<td>High - fails safe</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Medium - requires app profiling</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hybrid Model</td>\n<td>Medium - complex interactions</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>Very High - dual complexity</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: BPF Program Compilation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: BPF filter programs can be written as raw instruction arrays, generated from higher-level descriptions, or compiled from domain-specific languages.

However, the architecture must be explicitly validated to prevent bypass attacks using alternative architectures or compatibility layers.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Limits deployment flexibility but reduces complexity and testing burden. Architecture validation prevents certain bypass techniques but requires updates when adding platform support.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>filter installation and lifecycle management</strong> represents another crucial architectural decision. Seccomp filters are inherited across fork operations but cannot be removed once installed. This creates constraints around when and how filters are applied within the sandbox creation sequence.</p>\n<p>The optimal filter installation strategy coordinates with other sandbox components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Pre-Namespace Installation</strong>: Install seccomp filters before creating namespaces to ensure filtering applies to namespace creation operations themselves. However, this prevents the filter from utilizing namespace-based path restrictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Post-Filesystem Installation</strong>: Install filters after filesystem isolation is complete, allowing argument-level filtering to assume chroot restrictions are already active. This simplifies filter logic but allows unrestricted system calls during sandbox setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Staged Installation</strong>: Use multiple filter installations at different stages, with progressively restrictive policies. Initial filters allow setup operations, final filters enforce strict runtime restrictions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sandbox implementation adopts a <strong>staged installation</strong> approach that balances security and functionality. During the sandbox creation phase, a permissive filter allows necessary setup operations while blocking obviously dangerous calls like <code>ptrace</code> and <code>mount</code>. After filesystem isolation and other setup is complete, a strict runtime filter replaces the permissive one.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Installation Stage</th>\n<th>Allowed Operations</th>\n<th>Security Focus</th>\n<th>Implementation Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Initial Setup</td>\n<td>Namespace creation, filesystem operations, resource setup</td>\n<td>Prevent obvious attacks during setup</td>\n<td>Permissive but blocks dangerous operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transition Phase</td>\n<td>Final setup operations, privilege dropping</td>\n<td>Prepare for strict filtering</td>\n<td>Brief window with intermediate restrictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Runtime Operation</td>\n<td>Application-specific whitelist only</td>\n<td>Maximum restriction</td>\n<td>Permanent strict filtering</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Performance optimization</strong> considerations influence several architectural decisions. While BPF programs execute very efficiently, system call filtering still adds overhead to every kernel transition. The filter design must minimize this impact through several strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Early Exit Optimization</strong>: Place the most frequently used system calls early in the filter decision tree to minimize instruction execution for common operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Jump Table Organization</strong>: Use structured jump patterns rather than linear searches when checking system call numbers against large whitelists.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Argument Validation Ordering</strong>: Perform expensive argument validation only after confirming the system call number is allowed and likely to be used.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, premature optimization should be avoided. The primary goals are correctness and security—performance optimization should only be applied to filters that demonstrably impact application performance under realistic workloads.</p>\n<p>The <strong>error handling strategy</strong> for seccomp violations significantly affects both security and debuggability. When a sandboxed process attempts a forbidden system call, the filter can respond in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</strong>: Immediately terminate the process with SIGKILL</li>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO</strong>: Return a specific error code to the caller</li>\n<li><strong>SECCOMP_RET_TRAP</strong>: Trigger a signal handler for custom processing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The choice between these responses involves trade-offs between security and operational considerations. Killing processes provides the strongest security guarantee but makes debugging difficult and may cause data loss. Returning errors allows graceful handling but may enable attackers to probe the filter and adapt their approach.</p>\n<p>The implementation uses a <strong>differentiated response strategy</strong> based on the severity of the violation. Attempts to use obviously malicious system calls like <code>ptrace</code> result in immediate process termination, while attempts to access forbidden files return appropriate error codes. This approach provides strong protection against serious attacks while maintaining reasonable debuggability for legitimate application issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Implementing effective seccomp filtering involves numerous subtle technical challenges that frequently trip up developers, even those experienced with Linux systems programming. Understanding these common mistakes helps avoid security vulnerabilities and implementation problems that could compromise the entire sandbox.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS Before Filter Installation</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most critical mistakes is installing seccomp filters without first setting the <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag. This flag prevents the process from gaining additional privileges through setuid binaries, file capabilities, or other privilege escalation mechanisms. The kernel requires this flag to be set before allowing unprivileged processes to install seccomp filters.</p>\n<p>Without <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code>, seccomp filter installation will fail with <code>EACCES</code> even when running as root, because the kernel cannot guarantee that the filter will remain effective if the process later gains additional privileges. This requirement ensures that seccomp filtering cannot be bypassed through privilege escalation.</p>\n<p>The correct implementation sequence must call <code>prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0)</code> before any <code>prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &amp;filter)</code> operation. This flag setting is irreversible and inherited by child processes, ensuring that the security restriction cannot be removed later.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Architecture-Specific System Call Number Confusion</strong></p>\n<p>System call numbers vary significantly between processor architectures, and using the wrong numbers can create massive security holes. For example, <code>__NR_open</code> has different values on x86_64 versus ARM64, and some system calls exist on one architecture but not others. A filter that works correctly on x86_64 might inadvertently allow dangerous operations on ARM64 if it uses wrong system call numbers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some 64-bit architectures provide compatibility layers for 32-bit applications, which use entirely different system call numbering schemes. An attacker might attempt to bypass filtering by using 32-bit system call interfaces even on 64-bit systems.</p>\n<p>The solution requires explicit architecture validation as the first step in every BPF program. The filter must check the <code>arch</code> field in the seccomp data and either handle each supported architecture correctly or reject calls from unexpected architectures. Never assume that system call numbers are portable between architectures.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Essential glibc System Calls</strong></p>\n<p>Modern C library implementations use many more system calls than application developers typically realize. Functions like <code>malloc()</code>, <code>printf()</code>, and even simple arithmetic operations may trigger unexpected system calls for memory management, locale processing, or dynamic linking. Missing any of these essential calls can cause applications to crash or behave unpredictably.</p>\n<p>The most problematic cases involve system calls that are used only in specific circumstances—error handling paths, memory pressure situations, or particular input patterns. An application might work fine during normal testing but fail in production when these edge cases are encountered.</p>\n<p>Comprehensive system call profiling is essential, but it must cover all possible execution paths. Use tools like <code>strace -f</code> to trace all system calls during extensive testing, including error conditions, resource exhaustion scenarios, and various input types. Additionally, understand that different glibc versions may use different implementation strategies, requiring testing across target environments.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect BPF Program Termination and Validation</strong></p>\n<p>BPF programs must be provably terminating—the kernel&#39;s BPF verifier will reject programs that might contain infinite loops or unbounded recursion. However, developers often create inadvertent infinite loops through incorrect jump logic or fail to handle all possible code paths properly.</p>\n<p>Common BPF validation failures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unreachable Code</strong>: Instructions that cannot be reached through any execution path</li>\n<li><strong>Uninitialized Register Access</strong>: Attempting to use registers that might not contain valid values</li>\n<li><strong>Infinite Loop Potential</strong>: Jump patterns that could theoretically loop forever</li>\n<li><strong>Invalid Memory Access</strong>: Attempting to access data outside the provided seccomp structure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The BPF verifier&#39;s error messages can be cryptic and difficult to debug. The best approach is to build BPF programs incrementally, testing each addition with the kernel verifier. Use systematic patterns for jump logic and ensure every execution path reaches a valid return instruction.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Testing of Filter Edge Cases</strong></p>\n<p>Seccomp filters often work correctly for normal application behavior but fail when applications encounter unusual conditions or use less common system call patterns. These edge cases can create security vulnerabilities or operational failures that only manifest in production environments.</p>\n<p>Critical edge cases to test include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Signal Handling</strong>: Ensure signal delivery and handling works correctly with filtering active</li>\n<li><strong>Thread Creation</strong>: Verify that threading libraries can function with the restricted system call set</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Pressure</strong>: Test behavior when system memory is low and allocation strategies change</li>\n<li><strong>File Descriptor Exhaustion</strong>: Check that applications handle file descriptor limits gracefully</li>\n<li><strong>Network Timeouts</strong>: For network applications, verify timeout and error handling works correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The testing strategy should include both positive tests (verifying allowed operations work) and negative tests (confirming forbidden operations are blocked). Negative tests are particularly important because they verify the security properties of the filter.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Filter Bypass Through Alternative System Call Interfaces</strong></p>\n<p>Linux provides multiple ways to accomplish many operations, and attackers may attempt to bypass filters by using alternative system call interfaces. For example, file operations can be performed using <code>open</code>, <code>openat</code>, <code>creat</code>, or even <code>memfd_create</code> depending on the specific requirements.</p>\n<p>Similarly, memory mapping can be accomplished through <code>mmap</code>, <code>mmap2</code>, or <code>mremap</code>, and process creation might use <code>fork</code>, <code>vfork</code>, <code>clone</code>, or <code>clone3</code>. A filter that blocks <code>open</code> but allows <code>openat</code> might be trivially bypassed.</p>\n<p>The solution requires understanding the complete family of system calls related to each operation and either allowing all safe variants or blocking all potentially dangerous ones. This often involves studying the kernel source code and glibc implementation to understand which system calls are actually used in different scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Argument Validation Complexity and Limitations</strong></p>\n<p>Argument-level filtering appears more powerful than it actually is due to fundamental limitations in what BPF programs can safely examine. Developers often attempt to implement sophisticated string validation or complex data structure inspection that cannot be safely performed in kernel space.</p>\n<p>Remember that BPF programs cannot dereference user space pointers, cannot call kernel functions, and have very limited stack space. Attempting to validate file paths, examine structure contents, or perform complex calculations will either fail BPF verification or create security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Focus argument validation on simple numeric checks—ranges, exact values, and bitmasks. Use other isolation mechanisms like filesystem namespaces and chroot for complex policy enforcement rather than trying to implement everything in BPF.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Filter Installation Timing and Inheritance</strong></p>\n<p>The timing of seccomp filter installation relative to other sandbox setup operations critically affects both security and functionality. Installing filters too early can prevent necessary sandbox setup operations, while installing them too late allows a window where dangerous operations are permitted.</p>\n<p>Additionally, seccomp filters are inherited by child processes but cannot be removed once installed. This inheritance behavior affects how the sandbox manages multi-process applications and may require careful coordination between parent and child processes.</p>\n<p>Plan the filter installation sequence carefully, potentially using multiple filter stages with progressively stricter policies. Document the security properties of each stage and ensure that the transition between stages cannot be exploited.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>Building a robust seccomp filtering system requires careful attention to BPF program construction, system call profiling, and proper integration with the overall sandbox architecture.

Hints:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BPF Instruction Management</strong>: Use static arrays for BPF instructions when the filter is known at compile time. For dynamic filters, allocate instruction arrays with <code>malloc()</code> and ensure proper cleanup. The kernel copies the filter during installation, so temporary arrays can be freed afterward.</p>\n<p><strong>System Call Number Portability</strong>: Always use <code>__NR_syscallname</code> macros from <code>&lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;</code> rather than hardcoded numbers. These macros provide architecture-specific values and are the only reliable way to ensure portability.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Handling for prctl()</strong>: The <code>prctl()</code> system call returns specific error codes that indicate different failure modes. <code>EINVAL</code> suggests invalid arguments or BPF program format, <code>EACCES</code> indicates missing <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code>, and <code>EFAULT</code> suggests memory access problems with the filter array.</p>\n<p><strong>BPF Program Size Limits</strong>: The kernel imposes limits on BPF program size and complexity. Keep programs under 4096 instructions and minimize jump complexity. If whitelist size approaches limits, consider splitting into multiple filters or using more efficient instruction patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone Checkpoint:</strong></p>\n<p>After implementing basic seccomp filtering, verify the implementation with these tests:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Basic Installation Test</strong>: Create a minimal filter that allows only <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>exit_group</code>. Install the filter and verify a simple program can print a message and exit normally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Whitelist Enforcement Test</strong>: Create a test program that attempts both allowed and forbidden system calls. Verify that allowed calls succeed and forbidden calls either return appropriate errors or terminate the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Architecture Validation Test</strong>: Verify that the BPF program correctly validates architecture and rejects calls from unexpected architectures (this is difficult to test directly but can be verified through BPF program inspection).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Application Compatibility Test</strong>: Run a realistic application (like a simple file processing tool) with comprehensive system call profiling to ensure the whitelist covers all necessary operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Expected behavior: Applications should run normally with appropriate whitelists but fail quickly and safely when attempting forbidden operations. The filter should be transparent for normal operation while providing strong security boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Debugging Tips:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Cause</th>\n<th>How to Diagnose</th>\n<th>Fix</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>prctl() fails with EACCES</td>\n<td>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS not set</td>\n<td>Check process flags in /proc/self/status</td>\n<td>Call prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS) before filter installation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Application crashes immediately</td>\n<td>Missing essential system calls</td>\n<td>Run with strace to identify blocked calls</td>\n<td>Add required syscalls to whitelist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BPF program installation fails</td>\n<td>Invalid instruction format</td>\n<td>Use kernel BPF verifier error messages</td>\n<td>Review instruction generation and program structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filter allows forbidden operations</td>\n<td>Incorrect syscall numbers or logic</td>\n<td>Test with known forbidden calls</td>\n<td>Verify architecture-specific syscall numbers</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id=\"resource-limit-component\">Resource Limit Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section corresponds to Milestone 4 (Resource Limits with Cgroups) and builds upon the isolation mechanisms from Milestones 1-3, adding resource control to prevent resource exhaustion attacks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The resource limit component provides the fourth layer of our defense-in-depth strategy, addressing resource-based attacks that can occur even within isolated namespaces and restricted system calls. While namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, and seccomp filtering control <strong>what</strong> a sandboxed process can access, cgroups control <strong>how much</strong> of each system resource the process can consume. This distinction is crucial because a compromised process might attempt to exhaust system resources as a denial-of-service attack or to trigger out-of-memory conditions that could lead to privilege escalation opportunities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-resource-allocation-department\">Mental Model: The Resource Allocation Department</h3>\n<p>Think of cgroups as a <strong>bureaucratic resource allocation department</strong> within the Linux kernel. Just as a corporate IT department tracks and limits how much computing resources, storage quota, and network bandwidth each department can use, cgroups create accounting ledgers and enforcement policies for system resources on a per-process-group basis.</p>\n<p>In this analogy, the <strong>cgroup hierarchy</strong> represents the organizational chart of departments and sub-departments. Each department (cgroup) has its own resource budget allocated by the parent department. The <strong>cgroup controllers</strong> are like specialized accounting divisions - the memory controller tracks RAM usage like a facilities manager tracking office space, the CPU controller manages processor time like a project manager allocating developer hours, and the I/O controller monitors disk bandwidth like a network administrator managing traffic quotas.</p>\n<p>When a sandboxed process attempts to consume resources, it&#39;s like an employee making a resource request. The appropriate controller checks the current usage against the allocated budget. If the request would exceed the limit, the controller acts like a strict department head - it either denies the request (returning ENOMEM for memory), throttles the resource allocation (CPU time slicing), or queues the request until resources become available (I/O bandwidth limiting).</p>\n<p>This mental model helps explain why cgroups are hierarchical (departments can have sub-departments with smaller budgets), why limits are enforced at allocation time rather than after the fact (good accounting prevents overspending), and why different controllers operate independently (different types of resources require different accounting methods).</p>\n<p>The key insight is that cgroups provide <strong>proactive resource governance</strong> rather than reactive monitoring. They prevent resource exhaustion before it happens, rather than detecting it after the system is already under stress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cgroup-controllers-and-limits\">Cgroup Controllers and Limits</h3>\n<p>The cgroups subsystem provides several <strong>controllers</strong>, each responsible for managing a specific type of system resource. Our sandbox leverages four primary controllers that address the most common resource exhaustion attack vectors: memory consumption, CPU utilization, process proliferation, and I/O bandwidth abuse.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Controller</th>\n<th>Resource Managed</th>\n<th>Primary Limits</th>\n<th>Attack Vector Prevented</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>memory</td>\n<td>RAM and swap usage</td>\n<td>memory.limit_in_bytes, memory.soft_limit_in_bytes</td>\n<td>Memory exhaustion, OOM conditions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cpu</td>\n<td>Processor time allocation</td>\n<td>cpu.cfs_quota_us, cpu.cfs_period_us</td>\n<td>CPU starvation, busy loops</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pids</td>\n<td>Process and thread count</td>\n<td>pids.max</td>\n<td>Fork bombs, process exhaustion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>blkio</td>\n<td>Block device I/O</td>\n<td>blkio.throttle.read_bps_device, blkio.throttle.write_bps_device</td>\n<td>I/O flooding, disk thrashing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>memory controller</strong> operates by tracking page allocations and maintaining running totals of resident memory usage. When a sandboxed process requests memory allocation (through malloc, mmap, or stack growth), the kernel consults the memory cgroup&#39;s current usage against its configured limit. If the allocation would exceed the limit, the kernel triggers the Out of Memory (OOM) killer specifically within that cgroup, terminating processes within the sandbox without affecting the host system.</p>\n<p>Memory limits are configured through two primary mechanisms: <strong>hard limits</strong> that trigger immediate OOM killing when exceeded, and <strong>soft limits</strong> that allow temporary exceedances but prioritize reclaiming memory from processes that exceed their soft allocation. For sandbox environments, hard limits provide more predictable behavior since they create deterministic boundaries that cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.</p>\n<p>The <strong>CPU controller</strong> uses the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) bandwidth control mechanism to allocate processor time. Rather than setting absolute CPU percentages, it configures quotas and periods - for example, a quota of 50,000 microseconds within a period of 100,000 microseconds effectively limits the cgroup to 50% of one CPU core. This approach scales properly across systems with different numbers of CPU cores and provides more granular control than simple percentage-based limiting.</p>\n<p>CPU throttling operates by tracking the cumulative CPU time consumed by all processes within the cgroup during each scheduling period. When the quota is exhausted, all processes in the cgroup are removed from the scheduler&#39;s run queue until the next period begins. This creates predictable CPU allocation that prevents CPU starvation attacks while maintaining fair scheduling for legitimate workloads.</p>\n<p>The <strong>PID controller</strong> provides a simple but critical safeguard against fork bomb attacks. By setting <code>pids.max</code> to a reasonable value (typically 32-128 processes for most sandbox workloads), it prevents malicious code from creating thousands of processes that could exhaust the system&#39;s process table or memory resources. The PID controller tracks both processes and threads, preventing attackers from circumventing limits by using threads instead of processes.</p>\n<p>The <strong>block I/O controller</strong> manages disk bandwidth by setting per-device read and write limits measured in bytes per second. This prevents sandboxed processes from saturating disk I/O channels with large read or write operations that could impact host system performance. I/O throttling is implemented through request queuing - when a process exceeds its bandwidth allocation, additional I/O requests are queued and processed at the configured rate limit.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Limit Type</th>\n<th>Configuration Parameter</th>\n<th>Typical Sandbox Value</th>\n<th>Enforcement Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory Hard Limit</td>\n<td>memory.limit_in_bytes</td>\n<td>64MB - 256MB</td>\n<td>OOM kill on exceed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU Quota</td>\n<td>cpu.cfs_quota_us / cpu.cfs_period_us</td>\n<td>10% - 50% of one core</td>\n<td>Throttle scheduling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Count</td>\n<td>pids.max</td>\n<td>32 - 128 processes</td>\n<td>EAGAIN on fork()</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Read Bandwidth</td>\n<td>blkio.throttle.read_bps_device</td>\n<td>10MB/s - 100MB/s</td>\n<td>Queue excess requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Write Bandwidth</td>\n<td>blkio.throttle.write_bps_device</td>\n<td>5MB/s - 50MB/s</td>\n<td>Queue excess requests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"cgroup-hierarchy-management\">Cgroup Hierarchy Management</h3>\n<p>Cgroups organize resources through a <strong>hierarchical filesystem interface</strong> mounted at <code>/sys/fs/cgroup</code>. This hierarchy reflects resource inheritance relationships - child cgroups inherit resource limits from their parents and can further subdivide allocated resources among their own children. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for properly isolating sandbox instances from each other and from the host system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fcgroup-hierarchy.svg\" alt=\"Cgroup Hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>The filesystem interface means that creating and configuring cgroups involves standard filesystem operations: creating directories establishes new cgroups, writing to special files configures limits, and reading from these files monitors current usage. This design provides a uniform interface for cgroup management that integrates well with existing system administration tools and scripts.</p>\n<p>For sandbox environments, we typically create a dedicated hierarchy structure that isolates all sandbox instances under a common parent cgroup while providing individual resource allocation for each sandbox instance:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>/sys/fs/cgroup/\n├── sandbox-parent/                    ← Common parent for all sandboxes\n│   ├── memory.limit_in_bytes         ← Total memory pool for all sandboxes\n│   ├── cpu.cfs_quota_us              ← Total CPU allocation for sandbox system\n│   └── instance-&lt;uuid&gt;/              ← Individual sandbox instance\n│       ├── memory.limit_in_bytes     ← Per-instance memory limit\n│       ├── cpu.cfs_quota_us          ← Per-instance CPU quota\n│       ├── pids.max                  ← Per-instance process limit\n│       └── cgroup.procs              ← Process membership file</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This hierarchical structure provides several important benefits. First, it enables <strong>resource isolation between sandbox instances</strong> - one sandbox cannot consume resources allocated to another sandbox, even if both are running on the same host. Second, it provides <strong>aggregate resource control</strong> - the parent cgroup can limit the total resources consumed by the entire sandbox system, preventing it from impacting other host services. Third, it simplifies <strong>cleanup and management</strong> - removing the parent directory recursively cleans up all child cgroups automatically.</p>\n<p>Cgroup creation requires careful attention to the <strong>order of operations</strong>. The kernel automatically creates certain control files when a cgroup directory is created, but these files only become writable after the appropriate controllers are enabled in the parent cgroup&#39;s <code>cgroup.subtree_control</code> file. This means the controller enablement must propagate down the hierarchy before child cgroups can configure their limits.</p>\n<p>Process membership in cgroups is managed through the <code>cgroup.procs</code> file, which contains the PID of every process currently assigned to that cgroup. Writing a PID to this file moves the process into the cgroup, automatically removing it from its previous cgroup. This mechanism provides <strong>atomic process migration</strong> that ensures every process belongs to exactly one cgroup for each controller type at any given time.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hierarchy Level</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Configuration Responsibilities</th>\n<th>Cleanup Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Root Cgroup</td>\n<td>System-wide defaults</td>\n<td>Enable controllers for descendants</td>\n<td>N/A (persistent)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sandbox Parent</td>\n<td>Aggregate sandbox limits</td>\n<td>Total resource pool, controller enablement</td>\n<td>Remove after all instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instance Cgroup</td>\n<td>Per-sandbox limits</td>\n<td>Individual resource quotas, process membership</td>\n<td>Remove after process termination</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The hierarchical nature also enables <strong>resource limit inheritance and override patterns</strong>. A parent cgroup can set conservative default limits that apply to all children, while individual child cgroups can set more restrictive limits based on their specific workload requirements. However, child cgroups cannot exceed the resource allocations of their parents - the kernel enforces this constraint automatically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limit-enforcement-and-monitoring\">Limit Enforcement and Monitoring</h3>\n<p>Cgroup limit enforcement operates through <strong>kernel-level resource accounting</strong> that intercepts resource allocation requests at the point they occur. This proactive enforcement model prevents resource exhaustion attacks by denying excessive resource requests before they can impact system stability, rather than attempting to reclaim resources after problems have already occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory limit enforcement</strong> occurs during page allocation operations within the kernel memory management subsystem. When a process requests additional memory through system calls like <code>brk()</code>, <code>mmap()</code>, or during page fault handling, the kernel checks the requesting process&#39;s memory cgroup usage against its configured limits. If the allocation would exceed the hard limit, the kernel immediately returns ENOMEM to the requesting process and may invoke the OOM killer to terminate processes within the cgroup to free memory.</p>\n<p>The OOM killer behavior within cgroups is <strong>scope-limited</strong> to the violating cgroup, meaning it only considers processes within the same cgroup as candidates for termination. This provides important isolation guarantees - a memory-exhausting sandbox cannot trigger OOM killing of host processes or processes in other sandboxes. The kernel selects OOM victims based on a scoring algorithm that considers memory usage, process age, and OOM adjustment values.</p>\n<p><strong>CPU limit enforcement</strong> integrates with the kernel&#39;s process scheduler to implement <strong>bandwidth throttling</strong>. The CFS scheduler tracks the cumulative CPU time consumed by all processes within a cgroup during each scheduling period (typically 100 milliseconds). When the configured quota is exhausted, all processes in the cgroup are removed from the scheduler&#39;s run queues and cannot be scheduled for execution until the next period begins.</p>\n<p>This enforcement mechanism provides <strong>guaranteed CPU isolation</strong> between cgroups while maintaining fair scheduling within each cgroup. Processes within a throttled cgroup continue to compete fairly with each other for their allocated CPU time, but cannot consume CPU cycles beyond their quota regardless of system load or availability of idle CPU time.</p>\n<p><strong>Process limit enforcement</strong> occurs at <code>fork()</code> and <code>clone()</code> system call sites within the kernel. Before creating a new process or thread, the kernel increments the PID cgroup&#39;s process count and checks it against the configured maximum. If the limit would be exceeded, the system call fails with EAGAIN, preventing the process creation. This provides immediate feedback to applications that attempt to create excessive numbers of processes.</p>\n<p><strong>I/O bandwidth enforcement</strong> operates through the block layer&#39;s request queuing mechanism. When processes issue read or write requests that would exceed their configured bandwidth limits, the block I/O scheduler places these requests in a throttling queue and processes them at the configured rate. This creates <strong>smooth I/O rate limiting</strong> that prevents I/O flooding while allowing processes to make progress at their allocated bandwidth.</p>\n<p>Resource monitoring capabilities provide real-time visibility into resource consumption patterns and limit violations. Each cgroup controller exposes usage statistics through filesystem interfaces that can be polled programmatically or monitored by system administration tools.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Monitoring File</th>\n<th>Information Provided</th>\n<th>Usage Pattern</th>\n<th>Alert Thresholds</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>memory.usage_in_bytes</td>\n<td>Current memory consumption</td>\n<td>Poll every 1-5 seconds</td>\n<td>&gt;90% of limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>memory.failcnt</td>\n<td>Count of allocation failures</td>\n<td>Check after process termination</td>\n<td>Any non-zero value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cpu.stat</td>\n<td>CPU time and throttling events</td>\n<td>Poll every 5-30 seconds</td>\n<td>High throttle ratio</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pids.current</td>\n<td>Current process/thread count</td>\n<td>Poll when fork() fails</td>\n<td>Approaching pids.max</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>blkio.throttle.io_service_bytes</td>\n<td>I/O bytes transferred</td>\n<td>Poll every 10-60 seconds</td>\n<td>Sustained limit hitting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The design and implementation of cgroup resource limiting requires several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact security effectiveness, performance characteristics, and operational complexity.

By choosing moderate defaults, hybrid cgroup version support, and essential controller enablement, the system provides strong resource exhaustion protection while remaining usable for a wide variety of legitimate applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Resource limit implementation with cgroups involves several subtle failure modes that can compromise security effectiveness or system stability. Understanding these pitfalls and their prevention strategies is essential for building reliable sandbox systems.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Permission Management</strong></p>\n<p>Cgroup operations require specific privileges that vary between cgroups v1 and v2, and many developers underestimate the permission requirements for cgroup management. Simply running as root is insufficient - the process needs appropriate capabilities and must handle permission delegation correctly for child processes.</p>\n<p>In cgroups v1, writing to controller-specific files like <code>memory.limit_in_bytes</code> requires root privileges, but the process also needs write access to <code>cgroup.procs</code> to add processes to the cgroup. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where the sandbox launcher needs root privileges to set up limits, but the sandboxed process should run with dropped privileges.</p>\n<p>The common mistake is attempting to configure cgroup limits from within the sandboxed process after privileges have been dropped. This fails because the process no longer has sufficient privileges to write to cgroup control files. The correct approach is to configure all cgroup settings from the privileged parent process before spawning the sandboxed child.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Configure all cgroup limits and settings from the privileged launcher process before spawning the sandboxed child. Use file descriptor passing or other IPC mechanisms to communicate cgroup paths to child processes that need to monitor their resource usage but not modify limits.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Controller Enablement Propagation</strong></p>\n<p>Cgroups v2 requires explicit controller enablement in parent cgroups before child cgroups can use those controllers. Many developers forget that controller availability propagates down the hierarchy - if a controller is not enabled in a parent cgroup&#39;s <code>cgroup.subtree_control</code>, child cgroups cannot use that controller even if it&#39;s available at the system level.</p>\n<p>This creates confusing error conditions where attempting to write to <code>memory.max</code> in a child cgroup fails with &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; even when running as root, because the memory controller was never enabled in the parent cgroup. The error messages are often misleading and don&#39;t clearly indicate the controller enablement issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Implement systematic controller enablement that propagates from the root cgroup down to the target cgroup level. Check <code>cgroup.controllers</code> to verify available controllers and write to <code>cgroup.subtree_control</code> to enable controllers for child cgroups before creating those children.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Process Migration</strong></p>\n<p>Moving processes into cgroups involves writing PIDs to <code>cgroup.procs</code>, but this operation is racy - the process might exit between the time you obtain its PID and when you write it to the cgroup file. This is particularly problematic when trying to move short-lived processes or when the target process is already under resource pressure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, multi-threaded processes require special handling because individual threads cannot be moved to different cgroups independently. Attempting to write a thread ID (TID) to <code>cgroup.procs</code> results in moving the entire process including all its threads.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Perform process migration immediately after fork() but before exec() when the child process is still under parent control. Use the <code>cgroup.threads</code> interface (cgroups v2) when thread-level granularity is needed, but understand the additional complexity and limitations this introduces.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resource Limit Calculation Errors</strong></p>\n<p>Resource limits require careful calculation to account for system architecture differences and kernel accounting overhead. Memory limits specified in bytes may not account for kernel memory overhead, page alignment requirements, or memory used by shared libraries that may be charged to the cgroup.</p>\n<p>CPU limits using CFS quotas are specified in microseconds and require understanding the relationship between quota and period values. A common mistake is setting CPU quotas without considering the number of available CPU cores - setting a 100,000 microsecond quota with a 100,000 microsecond period limits the cgroup to 100% of one CPU core, not 100% of system CPU capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Always specify memory limits with headroom above the expected application memory usage (typically 20-30% overhead). For CPU limits, explicitly calculate quotas relative to desired percentage of total system CPU capacity. Test resource limits under realistic workload conditions to verify they provide adequate resources for legitimate operations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Cleanup and Resource Leaks</strong></p>\n<p>Cgroup cleanup requires careful ordering to avoid resource leaks and permission errors. Attempting to remove a cgroup directory while processes are still assigned to it fails, but processes may continue running even after the parent process exits if they&#39;ve daemonized or been inherited by init.</p>\n<p>The cleanup process must also handle hierarchical dependencies - child cgroups must be removed before their parents, and all processes must be terminated or migrated before cgroup removal. Failing to clean up cgroups properly leads to resource leaks where system resources remain allocated to non-existent sandbox instances.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Implement systematic cleanup that first terminates all processes in the cgroup (using SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL), waits for process exit, then removes child cgroups before parent cgroups. Use <code>find /sys/fs/cgroup -name &quot;*sandbox*&quot; -type d</code> to identify leaked cgroups during development and testing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cgroups Version Detection Failures</strong></p>\n<p>Systems may support both cgroups v1 and v2 simultaneously, with different controllers available through each interface. Simply checking for the existence of <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/unified</code> is insufficient to determine v2 availability - the system may have v2 mounted but with limited controller support.</p>\n<p>Detection logic must verify not only that cgroups v2 is available, but that the required controllers (memory, CPU, PID, I/O) are available and can be enabled for the sandbox hierarchy. Fallback logic must gracefully handle scenarios where some controllers are only available through v1 interfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Implement comprehensive version detection that checks controller availability in both v1 and v2 interfaces. Create capability matrices that map required functionality to available controller interfaces. Test detection logic on systems with different cgroup configurations including hybrid setups.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The cgroup resource management component bridges the gap between Linux kernel resource control mechanisms and practical sandbox resource limiting.

After establishing namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, and resource limits, we must address one critical remaining attack vector: <strong>privilege escalation</strong>. Even within a heavily restricted environment, a process running with unnecessary Linux capabilities retains pathways to break out of the sandbox or cause system-wide damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-security-clearance-system\">Mental Model: The Security Clearance System</h3>\n<p>Think of Linux capabilities as a <strong>government security clearance system</strong>. In traditional Unix systems, processes are either &quot;civilians&quot; (regular users) or &quot;generals&quot; (root with unlimited power). This binary model creates a dangerous situation: any process that needs even one privileged operation must be granted the equivalent of top-secret clearance, giving it access to far more than it actually requires.</p>\n<p>Linux capabilities solve this problem by subdividing root&#39;s omnipotent powers into specific, granular permissions—like specialized security clearances in a military organization. Instead of giving someone &quot;access to everything classified,&quot; you can grant specific clearances: &quot;authorized to access network configuration files,&quot; &quot;permitted to bind to privileged ports,&quot; or &quot;allowed to modify process scheduling.&quot; Each capability represents a different type of security clearance that can be granted or revoked independently.</p>\n<p>Just as a military organization follows the principle of least privilege—granting only the minimum clearance level needed for each job—our sandbox must systematically drop all capabilities except those absolutely essential for the sandboxed workload. A document editor doesn&#39;t need network administration capabilities, and a computational task doesn&#39;t need the ability to mount filesystems.</p>\n<p>The complexity arises from Linux&#39;s sophisticated capability inheritance model. When a process spawns children or executes new programs, different rules govern which security clearances transfer automatically, which must be explicitly granted, and which are permanently revoked. Understanding these inheritance patterns is crucial for maintaining security across process boundaries and preventing accidental privilege escalation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"capability-sets-and-inheritance\">Capability Sets and Inheritance</h3>\n<p>Linux implements capabilities through five distinct capability sets that govern how privileges are managed and inherited across process execution boundaries. Each set serves a specific role in the overall security model, and understanding their interactions is essential for safely dropping privileges.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Capability Set</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Inheritance Behavior</th>\n<th>Security Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Effective</strong></td>\n<td>Currently active privileges</td>\n<td>Reset on exec, must be explicitly activated</td>\n<td>Controls what the process can do right now</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Permitted</strong></td>\n<td>Maximum possible privileges</td>\n<td>Inherited based on file capabilities and other sets</td>\n<td>Upper bound for effective capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Inheritable</strong></td>\n<td>Privileges that can transfer to child processes</td>\n<td>Preserved across exec if file allows</td>\n<td>Determines what children can potentially inherit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Bounding</strong></td>\n<td>System-wide privilege ceiling</td>\n<td>Cannot be raised, only lowered</td>\n<td>Prevents any process from gaining specific capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ambient</strong></td>\n<td>Simplified inheritance for unprivileged processes</td>\n<td>Automatically becomes effective after exec</td>\n<td>Provides easier capability management for non-root</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>effective set</strong> contains capabilities that are currently active and usable by the process. These are the actual privileges the process can exercise at any given moment. When a process calls a privileged operation, the kernel checks this set to determine authorization. The effective set can be modified during runtime by adding capabilities from the permitted set or removing capabilities entirely.</p>\n<p>The <strong>permitted set</strong> represents the maximum capabilities the process could potentially activate. Think of this as a pool of available privileges that the process can draw from to populate its effective set. The permitted set cannot be expanded beyond its current contents, but capabilities can be permanently dropped from it. This set plays a crucial role during exec operations, as it determines what privileges survive the transition to a new program.</p>\n<p>The <strong>inheritable set</strong> controls which capabilities can be passed to child processes during exec operations. However, inheritance is not automatic—it depends on complex interactions with the target executable&#39;s file capabilities and the ambient set. This set is preserved across exec boundaries but only becomes active in the child if specific conditions are met.</p>\n<p>The <strong>bounding set</strong> functions as a system-wide capability ceiling. No process can acquire capabilities that are not present in the bounding set, regardless of file capabilities or inheritance rules. Dropping capabilities from the bounding set is a one-way operation that affects the current process and all its descendants, making it a powerful tool for permanent privilege reduction.</p>\n<p>The <strong>ambient set</strong> provides a simplified inheritance mechanism designed for unprivileged processes. Capabilities in the ambient set automatically become effective in child processes after exec, eliminating the need for complex file capability configurations. However, ambient capabilities pose security risks if not carefully managed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Capability Dropping Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to determine which capability sets to modify and in what order to achieve maximum security while maintaining functionality</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Drop only from effective set (preserves potential for re-elevation)</li>\n<li>Drop from all sets simultaneously (may cause unexpected failures)</li>\n<li>Systematic dropping: bounding → ambient → inheritable → permitted → effective</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use systematic dropping with verification at each step</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach provides defense in depth by creating multiple barriers to privilege escalation while allowing us to detect issues early in the process</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex implementation but maximum security assurance and better debugging capability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The capability inheritance algorithm during exec operations follows intricate rules that combine file capabilities, process capabilities, and security policies. When a process executes a new program, the kernel calculates the new capability sets using formulas that consider the current process capabilities, the target file&#39;s capabilities, and various security flags.</p>\n<p>For unprivileged processes (non-root), the inheritance calculation is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>New permitted = (current inheritable &amp; file inheritable) | (file permitted &amp; capability bounding set)</li>\n<li>New effective = file effective ? new permitted : empty set</li>\n<li>New inheritable = current inheritable &amp; file inheritable</li>\n<li>New ambient = current ambient if program allows, otherwise empty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These inheritance rules create several security implications that our sandbox must address. Most critically, any capabilities left in the inheritable set could potentially transfer to child processes if they execute programs with matching file capabilities. Similarly, capabilities remaining in the ambient set automatically become effective in child processes, creating a straightforward privilege escalation path.</p>\n<h3 id=\"privilege-dropping-algorithm\">Privilege Dropping Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The process of safely dropping Linux capabilities requires careful orchestration of multiple operations in a specific sequence. The order of operations is critical because certain steps are irreversible, and incorrect sequencing can leave the process in an inconsistent security state or cause legitimate operations to fail unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>The complete privilege dropping algorithm proceeds through several phases, each with specific verification steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Capability Assessment Phase</strong>: The first step involves querying the current process capabilities across all five capability sets. This assessment provides a baseline for verification and helps identify which capabilities are currently active. The <code>capget</code> system call retrieves the current capability state, which we store for comparison after each dropping operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bounding Set Reduction Phase</strong>: We begin by dropping capabilities from the bounding set because this operation creates a permanent ceiling that cannot be raised. Each capability not explicitly required for the sandboxed workload is removed using the <code>prctl</code> system call with <code>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</code>. This operation requires <code>CAP_SETPCAP</code> capability, so it must be performed before dropping that capability from our own sets.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Ambient Set Clearing Phase</strong>: The ambient capability set is cleared entirely because these capabilities automatically become effective in child processes. The <code>prctl</code> system call with <code>PR_CAP_AMBIENT</code> and <code>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL</code> removes all ambient capabilities in a single operation. This prevents child processes from inheriting unexpected privileges.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User and Group Transition Phase</strong>: Before dropping the remaining capability sets, we transition to the target user and group identities. This step is crucial because changing user ID typically clears many capability sets automatically. The sequence is: <code>setgid</code>, <code>setgroups</code>, then <code>setuid</code>. Each operation must be verified to ensure it succeeded.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Inheritable Set Clearing Phase</strong>: The inheritable capability set is cleared to prevent any capabilities from transferring to child processes through the inheritance mechanism. This operation uses <code>capset</code> system call to explicitly set the inheritable set to empty.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Permitted Set Reduction Phase</strong>: Capabilities are removed from the permitted set, leaving only those absolutely necessary for the sandboxed workload. This step requires careful analysis of the target program&#39;s requirements, as dropping essential capabilities will cause the program to fail when it attempts privileged operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Effective Set Minimization Phase</strong>: Finally, the effective capability set is reduced to match the permitted set or further restricted based on immediate needs. This set can be modified during runtime, so we set it to the minimum required for program startup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>No New Privileges Flag</strong>: The <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag is set using <code>prctl</code> to prevent the process and its children from gaining privileges through exec operations, even if they execute setuid programs or programs with file capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each phase includes verification steps to ensure the operations succeeded and the process is in the expected security state. The verification process re-reads the capability sets and compares them against expected values, providing immediate detection of any failures in the privilege dropping process.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight in capability dropping is that it&#39;s a one-way operation with complex interdependencies. Once capabilities are dropped from certain sets, they cannot be recovered, making verification at each step essential for debugging and security assurance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The algorithm must also handle several edge cases and error conditions. If the target program requires capabilities that were accidentally dropped, the error typically manifests as <code>EPERM</code> errors when the program attempts privileged operations. The algorithm includes rollback provisions for non-critical failures, but certain operations like bounding set modifications cannot be undone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-new-privileges-flag\">No New Privileges Flag</h3>\n<p>The <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag represents a fundamental security mechanism that prevents privilege escalation through exec operations. This flag creates an irreversible security boundary that blocks several common attack vectors used to escape from restricted environments.</p>\n<p>When <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> is set, the kernel prevents the process and all its descendants from gaining privileges in several ways. First, it disables the setuid and setgid bits on executable files. Normally, when a process executes a setuid program, the effective user ID changes to the file&#39;s owner, potentially granting additional privileges. With <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> set, these bits are ignored, and the process continues running with its current credentials.</p>\n<p>Second, the flag prevents file capabilities from granting new privileges during exec operations. File capabilities are extended attributes that can grant specific Linux capabilities to processes executing a program. Without the no-new-privs flag, a restricted process could potentially execute a program with file capabilities to regain privileges. The flag ensures that exec operations cannot increase the process&#39;s capability sets beyond their current contents.</p>\n<p>Third, certain Linux Security Modules (LSMs) like AppArmor and SELinux respect the no-new-privs flag and may apply additional restrictions. These systems can implement more permissive policies for processes that have committed to not gaining new privileges, creating a trust boundary that enables more flexible security policies.</p>\n<p>The flag also interacts with seccomp filters in important ways. When <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> is set, unprivileged processes can install seccomp filters that would otherwise require <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code>. This interaction is particularly relevant for our sandbox because it ensures that the seccomp restrictions cannot be bypassed through privilege escalation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Privilege Escalation Vector</th>\n<th>Without NO_NEW_PRIVS</th>\n<th>With NO_NEW_PRIVS</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Setuid executables</td>\n<td>Process gains file owner&#39;s privileges</td>\n<td>Setuid bit ignored, no privilege change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Setgid executables</td>\n<td>Process gains file group&#39;s privileges</td>\n<td>Setgid bit ignored, no privilege change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File capabilities</td>\n<td>Process can gain capabilities from file</td>\n<td>File capabilities cannot increase process caps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LSM transitions</td>\n<td>May allow privilege-granting transitions</td>\n<td>LSM policies may provide additional restrictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seccomp installation</td>\n<td>Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN for unprivileged</td>\n<td>Allows unprivileged seccomp filter installation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The timing of setting <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> within our privilege dropping algorithm is crucial. It should be set after the process has transitioned to its target user ID and dropped most capabilities, but before executing the final target program. Setting it too early might interfere with necessary privilege operations during sandbox setup. Setting it too late leaves a window where privilege escalation might be possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: NO_NEW_PRIVS Timing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Determining when to set PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS in the capability dropping sequence</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Set immediately after fork (blocks all privilege operations)</li>\n<li>Set after user transition but before capability dropping (may interfere with capability operations)  </li>\n<li>Set after capability dropping but before exec (optimal security/functionality balance)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Set after complete capability dropping, immediately before exec</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Ensures all necessary privilege operations complete successfully while preventing privilege escalation in the target program</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Maximum compatibility with target programs while maintaining strong privilege escalation prevention</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The no-new-privs flag cannot be unset once it&#39;s enabled, making it a permanent commitment for the process and all its descendants. This irreversible nature provides strong security guarantees but requires careful consideration of the target program&#39;s requirements. Some legitimate programs may fail if they depend on setuid operations or file capabilities for normal functionality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decisions\">Architecture Decisions</h3>\n<p>The capability management component requires several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact both security effectiveness and implementation complexity. These decisions must balance maximum privilege reduction against practical usability and compatibility with diverse sandboxed workloads.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Minimum Required Capabilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Determining the absolute minimum set of capabilities that sandboxed processes need to function</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Drop all capabilities (maximum security, high compatibility risk)</li>\n<li>Retain common capabilities like CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (moderate security, better compatibility)</li>\n<li>Configurable capability whitelist based on workload type (complex but flexible)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Configurable whitelist with secure defaults dropping all capabilities</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Different sandboxed programs have vastly different requirements; flexibility allows optimization while secure defaults protect against misconfiguration</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful analysis of each workload&#39;s needs but provides maximum security when properly configured</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The minimum capability set decision proves particularly challenging because Linux capabilities are not well-documented from an application perspective. Many programs don&#39;t clearly specify which capabilities they require, leading to trial-and-error discovery processes. Our architecture addresses this by providing a capability discovery mode that logs attempted privileged operations, helping administrators identify necessary capabilities through testing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Capability</th>\n<th>Common Use Cases</th>\n<th>Security Risk</th>\n<th>Recommended Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>CAP_CHOWN</code></td>\n<td>Change file ownership</td>\n<td>Medium - can manipulate file permissions</td>\n<td>Drop unless file management needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code></td>\n<td>Bypass file permission checks</td>\n<td>High - can access any file</td>\n<td>Drop unless specific access patterns required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_SETUID</code></td>\n<td>Change user ID</td>\n<td>High - enables privilege escalation</td>\n<td>Always drop after user transition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_SETGID</code></td>\n<td>Change group ID</td>\n<td>Medium - enables group privilege escalation</td>\n<td>Always drop after group transition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</code></td>\n<td>Bind to privileged ports (&lt;1024)</td>\n<td>Medium - can impersonate system services</td>\n<td>Drop unless network service needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code></td>\n<td>Many administrative operations</td>\n<td>Critical - effectively equivalent to root</td>\n<td>Always drop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code></td>\n<td>Trace other processes</td>\n<td>Critical - can access process memory</td>\n<td>Always drop</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Capability Verification Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: How to verify that capability dropping succeeded and the process is in the expected security state</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Trust system call return values (fast but unreliable)</li>\n<li>Re-read capabilities after each operation (thorough but slow)</li>\n<li>Final verification only (balanced approach)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Verification after each major phase with detailed logging</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Capability operations can fail silently or partially; immediate verification enables precise error diagnosis and security assurance</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Slightly higher overhead but dramatically improved security confidence and debugging capability</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verification strategy implementation maintains a shadow copy of expected capability sets and compares them against actual kernel state after each modification. This approach catches several classes of errors: partial failures where some capabilities are dropped but others remain, kernel version incompatibilities that cause operations to be ignored, and race conditions where other processes modify our capabilities unexpectedly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Capability Drop Failure Handling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: How to respond when capability dropping operations fail</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Continue with reduced security (dangerous but functional)</li>\n<li>Abort sandbox creation entirely (secure but may impact availability)</li>\n<li>Retry with progressively relaxed requirements (complex fallback logic)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Abort sandbox creation with detailed error reporting</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Security boundaries must be absolute; partial security provides false confidence and unknown attack surface</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Some workloads may fail to start, but security guarantees are maintained and administrators receive clear guidance for resolution</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The failure handling strategy extends beyond simple abortion to include comprehensive diagnostic information. When capability operations fail, the system logs the current state of all capability sets, the attempted operation, the specific error code, and recommendations for resolution. This detailed error reporting significantly reduces the debugging burden for administrators trying to configure appropriate capability whitelists.</p>\n<p>The capability management component also implements several performance optimizations that don&#39;t compromise security. Capability queries are batched where possible to reduce system call overhead. The verification process uses efficient bit manipulation to compare capability sets rather than iterating through individual capabilities. Error paths are optimized for fast failure detection to minimize the impact on sandbox creation performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Capability management presents several subtle pitfalls that frequently trap developers implementing process sandboxes. These mistakes often result in security vulnerabilities, unexpected program failures, or difficult-to-diagnose runtime issues.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect Operation Ordering</strong></p>\n<p>Many developers attempt to drop capabilities before completing necessary privileged operations, causing the privilege dropping process itself to fail. For example, calling <code>setuid()</code> before dropping <code>CAP_SETUID</code> from the bounding set will succeed, but attempting to drop <code>CAP_SETUID</code> from the bounding set after calling <code>setuid()</code> may fail because the process no longer has the necessary privileges to modify capability sets.</p>\n<p>The correct sequence must complete all privileged operations that require specific capabilities before dropping those capabilities from any set. This includes operations like changing user/group IDs, setting up cgroups, modifying namespaces, and installing seccomp filters. A common mistake is forgetting that some operations require capabilities that aren&#39;t immediately obvious—for example, certain cgroup operations may require <code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code> to write to cgroup control files.</p>\n<p>To avoid this pitfall, create a comprehensive checklist of all privileged operations your sandbox performs and identify the capabilities each operation requires. Perform all operations before beginning the capability dropping sequence, and verify each operation&#39;s success before proceeding to the next phase.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ambient Capability Oversight</strong></p>\n<p>Ambient capabilities are often overlooked because they&#39;re a relatively recent addition to Linux and don&#39;t appear in older documentation. Developers frequently remember to drop capabilities from the traditional four sets (effective, permitted, inheritable, bounding) but leave ambient capabilities intact. This creates a significant security vulnerability because ambient capabilities automatically become effective in child processes.</p>\n<p>Even if a process successfully drops all capabilities from its effective and permitted sets, any capabilities remaining in the ambient set will be granted to child processes after exec operations. This means a sandboxed process could spawn a child that has more privileges than the parent, completely defeating the purpose of capability dropping.</p>\n<p>The solution requires explicitly clearing the ambient capability set using <code>prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT, PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL)</code>. This operation should be performed early in the privilege dropping sequence, ideally immediately after assessing current capabilities but before beginning other dropping operations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Capability Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations fail to comprehensively assess which capabilities a target program actually requires, leading to either security vulnerabilities (retaining unnecessary capabilities) or functionality failures (dropping required capabilities). This assessment is complicated by the fact that most programs don&#39;t document their capability requirements, and the requirements may vary based on configuration or runtime behavior.</p>\n<p>A partial assessment might identify obvious requirements like <code>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</code> for programs that bind to privileged ports, but miss subtle requirements like <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code> for programs that need to traverse directories with restrictive permissions. These subtle requirements often only manifest under specific conditions, making them difficult to discover through casual testing.</p>\n<p>To address this pitfall, implement a systematic capability discovery process. Run the target program in a test environment with capability auditing enabled, exercise all program functionality, and log any capability-related failures. Use tools like <code>filecap</code> and <code>getcap</code> to identify file capabilities that the program might depend on. Document the discovered requirements and validate them through comprehensive testing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Programs</strong></p>\n<p>Capability operations affect the entire process, including all threads, but the timing of these operations can create race conditions in multi-threaded programs. If the sandbox process creates threads before dropping capabilities, those threads might perform privileged operations concurrently with capability dropping, leading to inconsistent security states or unexpected failures.</p>\n<p>For example, if one thread is dropping <code>CAP_NET_ADMIN</code> while another thread is attempting to configure network interfaces, the network configuration might succeed or fail depending on the exact timing of the operations. This creates non-deterministic behavior that&#39;s difficult to debug and may leave the sandbox in an unexpected security state.</p>\n<p>The solution requires careful coordination of capability dropping with thread management. Ensure that capability dropping occurs before creating any threads that might perform privileged operations, or implement explicit synchronization to prevent privileged operations during capability transitions. Consider using the <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag early in the process to prevent threads from gaining new privileges even if capability dropping is delayed.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Verification Logic Errors</strong></p>\n<p>Capability verification logic often contains subtle bugs that can mask security vulnerabilities or cause false alarms. Common errors include incorrect bit manipulation when checking capability sets, endianness issues when reading capability data structures, and failure to account for kernel version differences in capability representation.</p>\n<p>One particularly common mistake is assuming that capability numbers are consistent across all Linux architectures and kernel versions. Capability constants like <code>CAP_NET_ADMIN</code> have the same numeric values across systems, but the internal kernel representation and the format returned by <code>capget()</code> can vary. This can cause verification logic to incorrectly interpret capability sets or fail to detect security issues.</p>\n<p>Implement capability verification using well-tested libraries like <code>libcap</code> rather than raw system calls where possible. When using raw system calls is necessary, carefully validate the verification logic against known capability states and test on multiple kernel versions and architectures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The capability management component requires careful integration of Linux-specific system calls with robust error handling and verification logic. The implementation must handle the complex interactions between different capability sets while providing clear diagnostics for debugging capability-related issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology

This is not merely about calling functions in order; it requires deep understanding of how Linux security primitives interact, what state each component needs from its predecessors, and how to handle the complex cleanup required when things go wrong.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-security-assembly-line\">Mental Model: The Security Assembly Line</h3>\n<p>Think of sandbox creation as a <strong>sophisticated assembly line</strong> in a high-security facility. Each station on the line adds another layer of protection to the product (the untrusted process). The line supervisor (orchestration component) ensures that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each station receives exactly what it needs from previous stations</li>\n<li>No station begins work until prerequisites are complete</li>\n<li>If any station fails, the entire assembly line stops and reverses all completed work</li>\n<li>The final product meets all security specifications before leaving the facility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just as an assembly line has quality control checkpoints, our sandbox orchestration includes validation steps that verify each security layer is properly configured before proceeding to the next.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sandbox-creation-sequence\">Sandbox Creation Sequence</h3>\n<p>The sandbox creation follows a <strong>strictly ordered sequence</strong> where each step depends on the successful completion of its predecessors. This ordering is not arbitrary—it reflects the fundamental dependencies between Linux security mechanisms and the need to establish isolation before applying restrictions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/sandbox/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsandbox-creation-flow.svg\" alt=\"Sandbox Creation Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The creation sequence must handle both the <strong>happy path</strong> (successful creation) and multiple <strong>failure scenarios</strong> where partial setup must be cleanly reversed. The orchestration component maintains detailed state about what has been configured, enabling precise cleanup even when failures occur in the middle of the sequence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-by-step-creation-algorithm\">Step-by-Step Creation Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The sandbox creation follows this precise algorithm, where each step represents a <strong>point of no return</strong> that requires specific cleanup if subsequent steps fail:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Privilege Verification</strong>: The orchestration component first verifies that the calling process has sufficient privileges (typically root or specific capabilities) to perform all required operations. This early check prevents partial setup followed by privilege-related failures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Configuration Validation</strong>: The <code>sandbox_config_t</code> structure is validated for consistency and completeness. This includes verifying that file paths exist, resource limits are reasonable, and the syscall whitelist contains required system calls for basic operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>State Initialization</strong>: A new <code>sandbox_state_t</code> structure is allocated and initialized to track all resources that will need cleanup. This includes namespace file descriptors, cgroup paths, and process identifiers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Initial Process Fork</strong>: The orchestration performs the first <code>fork()</code> operation to create the child process that will become the sandboxed process. The parent retains the ability to configure the child&#39;s environment before it begins execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Namespace Creation</strong>: The child process creates all required namespaces using <code>clone()</code> or <code>unshare()</code> system calls. This establishes the fundamental isolation boundaries that all subsequent security layers will rely upon.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User Namespace Setup</strong>: If user namespaces are enabled, the orchestration configures UID and GID mappings to provide privilege separation. This step must occur before certain other namespace operations that require mapped privileges.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Filesystem Isolation</strong>: The filesystem isolation component creates the minimal root filesystem and performs <code>chroot()</code> or <code>pivot_root()</code> to establish the new root directory. This physically limits what files the sandboxed process can access.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Resource Limit Application</strong>: The cgroup component creates the necessary cgroup hierarchy and applies memory, CPU, and I/O limits. The sandboxed process is added to the appropriate cgroups before it begins execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>System Call Filter Installation</strong>: The seccomp-BPF filter is compiled and installed, restricting which system calls the sandboxed process can make. This step occurs late in the sequence because the sandbox setup itself requires many privileged system calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Capability Dropping</strong>: All unnecessary Linux capabilities are dropped, and the <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> flag is set to prevent privilege escalation. This represents the final hardening step before execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Program Execution</strong>: The <code>exec()</code> system call replaces the sandboxed process image with the target program. At this point, all security restrictions are active and cannot be circumvented.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Fork-Then-Configure vs Configure-Then-Fork</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to decide whether to fork first and then configure the child, or configure the current process and then fork</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Fork early and configure child from parent</li>\n<li>Configure current process then fork configured child</li>\n<li>Use clone() with all flags at once</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Fork early and configure child from parent</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This approach provides better error handling (parent can clean up failed child), maintains parent privileges for configuration, and allows parent to monitor child throughout setup</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires IPC between parent and child during setup, but provides superior error recovery and monitoring capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Creation Step</th>\n<th>Prerequisites</th>\n<th>Failure Recovery</th>\n<th>Critical Resources</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Privilege Verification</td>\n<td>Process must be root or have CAP_SYS_ADMIN</td>\n<td>No cleanup needed</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Validation</td>\n<td>Valid config structure</td>\n<td>Free allocated memory</td>\n<td>Configuration object</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>State Initialization</td>\n<td>Valid configuration</td>\n<td>Free state structure</td>\n<td>State tracking object</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Fork</td>\n<td>Sufficient process limits</td>\n<td>None (fork failed)</td>\n<td>Child process</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Namespace Creation</td>\n<td>Forked child process</td>\n<td>Terminate child process</td>\n<td>Namespace file descriptors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem Isolation</td>\n<td>Mount namespace active</td>\n<td>Unmount all sandbox mounts</td>\n<td>Mount points, directories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Cgroup controllers available</td>\n<td>Remove from cgroups, delete hierarchy</td>\n<td>Cgroup directories</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Call Filtering</td>\n<td>No conflicting seccomp filters</td>\n<td>Cannot be undone</td>\n<td>BPF program</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capability Dropping</td>\n<td>Process in target user namespace</td>\n<td>Cannot be undone</td>\n<td>Process capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Program Execution</td>\n<td>All security layers configured</td>\n<td>Terminate sandbox process</td>\n<td>Running program</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"sandboxed-process-lifecycle\">Sandboxed Process Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>The sandboxed process experiences a <strong>well-defined lifecycle</strong> with clear state transitions and specific responsibilities for the orchestration component at each stage.

The orchestration component must carefully manage these transitions to prevent resource leaks and security violations.</p>\n<p><strong>Created → Configuring</strong>: This transition occurs when the child process begins applying security restrictions. The parent process monitors the child&#39;s configuration progress and maintains the ability to terminate the child if configuration fails or hangs.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuring → Running</strong>: The most critical transition, where the sandbox becomes fully isolated and begins executing untrusted code. Once this transition completes, the sandboxed process can no longer be reconfigured—all security policies are immutable.</p>\n<p><strong>Running → Terminating</strong>: This transition can be triggered by several events: normal program completion, security policy violations, resource limit exceeded, or external termination requests. The orchestration component must distinguish between these causes for proper logging and response.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminating → Cleaned Up</strong>: The cleanup phase requires careful reversal of the creation sequence, removing the process from cgroups, cleaning up mount points, and closing namespace file descriptors. The orchestration component tracks which resources need cleanup to avoid double-free errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight is that once a sandbox enters the Running state, security policies become immutable. This is why the configuration phase must be completely successful before allowing program execution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"communication-channels\">Communication Channels</h3>\n<p>The orchestration of a complex sandbox requires <strong>reliable communication channels</strong> between the parent supervisor and the child sandbox process. These channels serve multiple purposes: coordinating the configuration sequence, monitoring sandbox health, and providing a controlled interface for legitimate interactions with the outside world.</p>\n<h4 id=\"parent-child-coordination-channel\">Parent-Child Coordination Channel</h4>\n<p>During the configuration phase, the parent and child processes must coordinate their activities to ensure proper timing and error handling.

The parent process needs visibility into sandbox behavior without compromising isolation.</p>\n<p>The monitoring channel uses <strong>signal-based communication</strong> combined with <code>procfs</code> inspection to gather information about the sandbox state.

Attackers may exploit socket buffer overflows, file descriptor passing, or credential passing mechanisms to escape isolation.\n<strong>Fix</strong>: Use unidirectional communication where possible, with signals from child to parent and procfs inspection by parent.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking on Child Communication</strong>\nIf the parent process blocks indefinitely waiting for child responses, a misbehaving sandbox can cause denial of service by simply not responding to coordination messages.\n<strong>Fix</strong>: Implement timeouts for all coordination operations and terminate non-responsive sandboxes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Information Leakage Through Error Messages</strong>\nDetailed error messages sent from sandbox to parent may leak information about the host system&#39;s configuration or internal state.\n<strong>Fix</strong>: Use standardized error codes instead of free-form error messages, and sanitize any diagnostic information before transmission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-flow-example\">Integration Flow Example</h3>\n<p>To illustrate how all components work together, consider a complete sandbox creation scenario for executing a simple untrusted Python script:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Setup</strong>: The orchestration component receives a request to execute <code>untrusted_script.py</code> with a memory limit of 64MB, CPU limit of 10%, and network access disabled.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Configuration Validation</strong>: The orchestrator verifies that Python interpreter exists in the minimal rootfs, memory limit is reasonable, and the syscall whitelist includes Python&#39;s requirements (<code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>mmap</code>, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Creation</strong>: The orchestrator forks, creating parent (PID 1000) and child (PID 1001) processes. The child will become the sandbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Namespace Setup</strong>: Child 1001 creates PID, mount, network, and UTS namespaces. From child&#39;s perspective, it becomes PID 1 in its own PID namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Filesystem Preparation</strong>: Child 1001 performs <code>chroot()</code> to <code>/sandbox/python-minimal/</code>, which contains only Python interpreter, required libraries, and the target script. Host filesystem becomes completely inaccessible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cgroup Assignment</strong>: Parent 1000 creates cgroup <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/sandbox-1001/</code> and configures memory.limit_in_bytes=67108864 (64MB) and cpu.cfs_quota_us=10000 (10% CPU). Child 1001 is added to this cgroup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Seccomp Filter</strong>: Child 1001 installs BPF filter allowing only: <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>mmap</code>, <code>munmap</code>, <code>exit_group</code>, <code>rt_sigaction</code>, and <code>brk</code>. All other syscalls will terminate the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Capability Dropping</strong>: Child 1001 drops all capabilities and sets <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS=1</code>, preventing any privilege escalation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Program Execution</strong>: Child 1001 executes <code>execve(&quot;/usr/bin/python3&quot;, [&quot;python3&quot;, &quot;untrusted_script.py&quot;])</code>.

Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section applies to all milestones (1-5), providing error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms for namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability management.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The robustness of a process sandbox depends not just on its security mechanisms, but on how gracefully it handles failures, resource exhaustion, and edge cases. A production sandbox system must anticipate and recover from dozens of failure modes while maintaining security boundaries even during error conditions. This section explores the systematic approach to error detection, classification, recovery, and cleanup that ensures the sandbox remains both secure and reliable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-emergency-response-system\">Mental Model: The Emergency Response System</h3>\n<p>Think of sandbox error handling like a hospital emergency response system. Just as hospitals have protocols for every type of medical emergency—cardiac arrest, trauma, poisoning—a sandbox must have specific responses for every type of system failure. The emergency response system has three key characteristics that apply directly to sandbox error handling:</p>\n<p><strong>Triage and Classification</strong>: Emergency rooms immediately classify patients by severity and type of condition to determine treatment priority. Similarly, the sandbox must classify errors by severity (fatal vs recoverable) and component (namespace vs cgroup vs seccomp) to determine the appropriate response strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Containment and Stabilization</strong>: Medical teams first stabilize the patient and prevent the condition from worsening before attempting curative treatment. The sandbox must first contain failures—preventing resource leaks, zombie processes, or security breaches—before attempting recovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Documentation and Learning</strong>: Hospitals maintain detailed incident reports to improve future responses. The sandbox logs detailed error information not just for debugging, but to identify patterns that indicate systemic issues requiring architectural changes.</p>\n<p>This mental model emphasizes that error handling is not just &quot;catch and log&quot;—it requires systematic preparation, immediate containment, and long-term improvement based on failure analysis.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-failure-modes\">Common Failure Modes</h3>\n<p>The process sandbox encounters failures across multiple dimensions: system call failures during setup, resource exhaustion during execution, and permission errors during cleanup. Understanding these failure modes and their cascading effects is crucial for building robust error detection and recovery mechanisms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"system-call-failures\">System Call Failures</h4>\n<p>System call failures represent the most fundamental class of errors in sandbox creation, as every security mechanism depends on kernel operations that can fail for various reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace Creation Failures</strong> occur when the kernel cannot create the requested namespace isolation. The <code>clone()</code> system call with namespace flags can fail due to kernel limits, insufficient memory, or disabled namespace support. More subtly, the kernel enforces per-user limits on namespace creation—the <code>CLONE_NEWUSER</code> flag fails when a user exceeds their maximum namespace count, typically 32 per user. Network namespace creation fails when the system has exhausted network namespace slots or when network controllers are not available.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Operation Failures</strong> represent another critical failure mode during filesystem isolation setup. The <code>mount()</code> system call can fail due to incorrect filesystem types, missing mount points, insufficient permissions, or kernel module loading failures. Bind mounts fail when source paths do not exist or when mount propagation settings conflict. The <code>pivot_root()</code> operation fails when the old and new root filesystems are on the same mount point or when processes still hold references to the old root.</p>\n<p><strong>Cgroup Management Failures</strong> occur when the kernel cannot create cgroup hierarchies or configure resource limits. Cgroup creation fails when hierarchies are full, when controllers are not available, or when the cgroup filesystem is not mounted. Setting resource limits fails when values exceed system maximums or when processes are already consuming more resources than the new limits allow.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Mode</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Immediate Effect</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>clone()</code> ENOMEM</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Fork failure</td>\n<td>Release memory, retry with fewer namespaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>clone()</code> EINVAL</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Invalid namespace flags</td>\n<td>Detect kernel support, fallback configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>mount()</code> ENOENT</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Missing mount point</td>\n<td>Create directory, retry mount</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>mount()</code> EPERM</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Permission denied</td>\n<td>Check capabilities, escalate privileges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pivot_root()</code> EINVAL</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Invalid filesystem state</td>\n<td>Verify mount setup, fix mount points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cgroup creation ENOSPC</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>No cgroup slots</td>\n<td>Clean up unused cgroups, retry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource limit EINVAL</td>\n<td>Return value check</td>\n<td>Invalid limit value</td>\n<td>Validate limits, use system defaults</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Seccomp Filter Installation Failures</strong> can occur when BPF programs are malformed, when the process already has incompatible seccomp filters, or when the kernel does not support required BPF features. The <code>prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)</code> call fails with <code>EINVAL</code> when the BPF program contains invalid instructions or when filter size exceeds kernel limits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: System call failures often cascade—a failed namespace creation can prevent subsequent mount operations, which then causes seccomp setup to operate in an unexpected environment. The error handling strategy must account for these dependencies and either fail fast or adapt the configuration to work with partial setup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"resource-exhaustion-attacks\">Resource Exhaustion Attacks</h4>\n<p>Resource exhaustion represents a class of failures where the sandboxed process or the sandbox infrastructure itself consumes excessive system resources, potentially affecting host system stability.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory Exhaustion</strong> can occur at multiple levels within the sandbox system. The sandboxed process can exceed its cgroup memory limit, triggering the OOM (Out of Memory) killer within the cgroup. More dangerously, the sandbox creation process itself can exhaust system memory when creating large numbers of concurrent sandboxes or when namespace setup requires significant kernel memory allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Process ID Exhaustion</strong> happens when sandboxed processes spawn children faster than the PID cgroup limit allows, or when the system-wide PID limit is approached. This can cause legitimate processes to fail to fork, creating denial-of-service conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>File Descriptor Exhaustion</strong> occurs when sandboxed processes open files or sockets faster than they close them, eventually hitting per-process or system-wide file descriptor limits. This is particularly problematic for network-enabled sandboxes that can open many socket connections.</p>\n<p><strong>Disk Space Exhaustion</strong> can happen when sandboxes write to tmpfs mounts faster than space is reclaimed, or when log files from sandbox activity grow without bounds. Tmpfs mounts backed by system memory can trigger OOM conditions when they grow too large.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Type</th>\n<th>Exhaustion Trigger</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>Process exceeds cgroup limit</td>\n<td>Cgroup memory.events counter</td>\n<td>Terminate process group</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>System OOM condition</td>\n<td>Monitor /proc/meminfo</td>\n<td>Suspend new sandbox creation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PIDs</td>\n<td>Process fork() fails</td>\n<td>Cgroup pids.events counter</td>\n<td>Kill oldest child processes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Descriptors</td>\n<td>open() returns EMFILE</td>\n<td>Monitor /proc/pid/fd count</td>\n<td>Close unused descriptors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disk Space</td>\n<td>write() returns ENOSPC</td>\n<td>Monitor tmpfs usage</td>\n<td>Clean temporary files</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Sockets</td>\n<td>socket() returns EMFILE</td>\n<td>Network namespace socket count</td>\n<td>Close idle connections</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Resource exhaustion often occurs gradually and then suddenly. Monitoring systems must track resource usage trends and implement proactive throttling before hard limits trigger emergency termination. Reactive-only approaches result in poor user experience and potential security issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"permission-and-privilege-errors\">Permission and Privilege Errors</h4>\n<p>Permission errors occur when the sandbox system lacks the necessary privileges to perform required operations, or when privilege transitions fail during sandbox setup or cleanup.</p>\n<p><strong>Insufficient Privileges During Setup</strong> is the most common cause of sandbox creation failure. Creating namespaces requires <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code>, mounting filesystems requires <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code>, and managing cgroups typically requires root privileges. The error handling must detect these permission failures and either escalate privileges through appropriate mechanisms (setuid binaries, systemd services) or gracefully degrade functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Privilege Dropping Failures</strong> can occur when the capability dropping sequence is performed in the wrong order or when processes attempt to drop capabilities they do not possess. The interaction between user namespace mappings and capability inheritance creates complex failure modes where capabilities appear available but cannot be effectively used or dropped.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleanup Permission Failures</strong> happen when the privileged sandbox orchestrator process lacks permissions to clean up resources created by child processes. This is particularly problematic with user namespaces, where processes running as different mapped UIDs create resources that the parent process cannot remove.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Permission Error</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Detection</th>\n<th>Resolution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>EPERM</code> on <code>clone()</code></td>\n<td>Missing <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code></td>\n<td>System call return code</td>\n<td>Check effective capabilities</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EPERM</code> on <code>mount()</code></td>\n<td>Missing mount capability</td>\n<td>System call return code</td>\n<td>Verify filesystem permissions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EPERM</code> on cgroup write</td>\n<td>Incorrect cgroup ownership</td>\n<td>File write failure</td>\n<td>Fix cgroup permissions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EPERM</code> on capability drop</td>\n<td>Invalid capability state</td>\n<td><code>prctl()</code> failure</td>\n<td>Verify current capability set</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>EPERM</code> on cleanup</td>\n<td>Mismatched ownership</td>\n<td>File operation failure</td>\n<td>Use appropriate cleanup privileges</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"cleanup-and-resource-management\">Cleanup and Resource Management</h3>\n<p>Proper cleanup and resource management in a process sandbox requires systematic tracking of all allocated resources and careful attention to cleanup ordering, especially when dealing with interdependent Linux kernel resources like namespaces, mounts, and cgroups.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resource-tracking-and-lifecycle-management\">Resource Tracking and Lifecycle Management</h4>\n<p>The sandbox system must maintain comprehensive tracking of all resources allocated during sandbox creation to ensure proper cleanup even when failures occur partway through setup. This requires a <strong>resource tracking registry</strong> that records each successful resource allocation and provides cleanup handlers for each resource type.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace File Descriptor Management</strong> involves tracking namespace file descriptors obtained through <code>/proc/self/ns/</code> entries. These file descriptors pin namespaces in memory even after the creating process exits, preventing kernel cleanup until the descriptors are closed. The tracking system must record namespace file descriptors in the <code>sandbox_state_t</code> structure and ensure they are closed during cleanup.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Point Tracking</strong> requires maintaining a list of all mount operations performed during filesystem isolation setup. Mounts must be unmounted in reverse order of creation to handle dependencies correctly—child mounts must be unmounted before parent mounts to avoid <code>EBUSY</code> errors. The system tracks mount points in a linked list through the <code>mount_entry</code> structure, allowing cleanup traversal in LIFO order.</p>\n<p><strong>Cgroup Hierarchy Management</strong> involves tracking created cgroup directories and ensuring that all processes are terminated before attempting to remove cgroup nodes. Cgroups cannot be removed while they contain processes, so cleanup must first terminate all processes in the cgroup, wait for process exit, and then remove the hierarchy from leaf nodes toward the root.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Type</th>\n<th>Allocation Tracking</th>\n<th>Cleanup Dependencies</th>\n<th>Cleanup Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Namespace FDs</td>\n<td><code>namespace_state_t.pid_ns_fd</code> array</td>\n<td>Close before process exit</td>\n<td><code>close()</code> system call</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount Points</td>\n<td><code>mount_entry</code> linked list</td>\n<td>Unmount children first</td>\n<td><code>umount2()</code> with <code>MNT_DETACH</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cgroup Dirs</td>\n<td><code>cgroup_state_t.cgroup_path</code></td>\n<td>Kill processes first</td>\n<td>Remove directory tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process IDs</td>\n<td><code>cgroup_state_t.managed_pids</code> array</td>\n<td>Send SIGTERM, then SIGKILL</td>\n<td><code>kill()</code> system call</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Temporary Files</td>\n<td>Track in global file list</td>\n<td>Remove before parent dirs</td>\n<td><code>unlink()</code> system call</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device Nodes</td>\n<td>Track created devices</td>\n<td>Remove after unmounting</td>\n<td><code>unlink()</code> special files</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"cleanup-ordering-and-dependencies\">Cleanup Ordering and Dependencies</h4>\n<p>The order of resource cleanup operations is critical for avoiding cleanup failures and ensuring that interdependent resources are released in the correct sequence. The cleanup sequence must handle the dependency relationships between different resource types while being robust to partial failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Termination First</strong> represents the fundamental principle of sandbox cleanup. All sandboxed processes must be terminated before attempting to clean up other resources, as running processes can hold references to namespaces, mount points, and cgroup resources that prevent their removal. The termination sequence uses escalating signals: <code>SIGTERM</code> for graceful shutdown, followed by <code>SIGKILL</code> after a timeout period.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount Point Cleanup Ordering</strong> follows a specific hierarchy where bind mounts and overlay mounts are unmounted before their underlying filesystems. Special filesystems like <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and <code>/sys</code> within the sandbox namespace are unmounted before unmounting the root filesystem. The <code>umount2()</code> call with <code>MNT_DETACH</code> flag performs lazy unmounting that handles some ordering dependencies automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace Cleanup Dependencies</strong> require understanding that mount namespaces must be cleaned up before PID namespaces, and network namespaces can be cleaned up independently. Closing namespace file descriptors allows kernel garbage collection, but the kernel may delay actual cleanup until all references are released.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Cleanup Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Resource cleanup can fail partially, leaving the system in an inconsistent state with leaked resources</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Best-effort cleanup vs. mandatory cleanup vs. cleanup with retries</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement cleanup with retries and best-effort fallback</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Some cleanup operations may temporarily fail due to timing issues (processes still exiting), but permanent failures should not prevent other resources from being cleaned up</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables robust cleanup that handles transient failures while preventing cascading cleanup failures</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The cleanup algorithm follows this specific ordering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Signal Process Termination</strong>: Send <code>SIGTERM</code> to all processes in the sandbox cgroup</li>\n<li><strong>Wait with Timeout</strong>: Wait up to 5 seconds for graceful process termination</li>\n<li><strong>Force Kill</strong>: Send <code>SIGKILL</code> to any remaining processes</li>\n<li><strong>Wait for Process Exit</strong>: Wait for all PIDs to be reaped by parent processes</li>\n<li><strong>Unmount Filesystems</strong>: Unmount all tracked mount points in reverse order</li>\n<li><strong>Close Namespace FDs</strong>: Close all namespace file descriptors to release references</li>\n<li><strong>Remove Cgroup Hierarchy</strong>: Remove cgroup directories from leaf to root</li>\n<li><strong>Clean Temporary Files</strong>: Remove temporary directories and files created during setup</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"error-recovery-during-cleanup\">Error Recovery During Cleanup</h4>\n<p>Cleanup operations can themselves fail, creating the possibility of resource leaks and requiring recovery strategies that handle partial cleanup failures gracefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Retry Logic for Transient Failures</strong> handles cleanup operations that fail due to timing issues, such as attempting to unmount filesystems while processes are still exiting. The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff with a maximum retry count to handle transient failures without infinite loops.</p>\n<p><strong>Best-Effort Cleanup for Permanent Failures</strong> ensures that permanent failures in one cleanup operation do not prevent other resources from being cleaned up. For example, if a mount point cannot be unmounted due to busy processes, the cleanup continues with other mount points and cgroup removal, logging the failure for administrative attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Leak Detection and Reporting</strong> involves checking for successful completion of each cleanup operation and maintaining counters of leaked resources. This information is logged for monitoring systems and can trigger alerts when resource leaks exceed acceptable thresholds.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleanup Failure</th>\n<th>Retry Strategy</th>\n<th>Fallback Action</th>\n<th>Leak Detection</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Mount umount EBUSY</td>\n<td>Retry 3 times with 1s delay</td>\n<td>Log warning, continue</td>\n<td>Check /proc/mounts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cgroup rmdir ENOTEMPTY</td>\n<td>Retry after killing processes</td>\n<td>Mark for admin cleanup</td>\n<td>Check cgroup.procs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process kill ESRCH</td>\n<td>No retry needed</td>\n<td>Process already gone</td>\n<td>Check /proc/pid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File unlink ENOENT</td>\n<td>No retry needed</td>\n<td>File already removed</td>\n<td>No leak possible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Namespace close EBADF</td>\n<td>No retry needed</td>\n<td>FD already closed</td>\n<td>No leak possible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Pitfall: Blocking on Failed Cleanup</strong>\nA common mistake is making cleanup operations synchronous and blocking when they fail. This can cause the sandbox orchestrator to hang indefinitely if kernel resources are in inconsistent states. Instead, implement cleanup with timeouts and continue with other operations even if some cleanup steps fail. Use asynchronous cleanup monitoring to retry failed operations in the background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"monitoring-and-health-checks\">Monitoring and Health Checks</h3>\n<p>Effective sandbox monitoring requires continuous observation of sandboxed process health, resource consumption patterns, and security boundary integrity. The monitoring system must detect both gradual degradation and sudden failures while providing actionable information for both automated recovery and human intervention.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sandbox-health-detection\">Sandbox Health Detection</h4>\n<p>Sandbox health encompasses multiple dimensions: process liveness, security boundary integrity, resource consumption patterns, and communication channel functionality. Each dimension requires specific monitoring approaches and failure detection thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Liveness Monitoring</strong> tracks whether sandboxed processes are running, responsive, and behaving within expected parameters. This involves monitoring process existence through PID tracking, responsiveness through communication channel heartbeats, and behavioral patterns through system call monitoring. The monitoring system maintains process state in the <code>sandbox_lifecycle_state_t</code> enumeration and transitions between states based on observed behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Boundary Integrity Checks</strong> verify that namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, and capability limitations remain in effect throughout sandbox execution. These checks involve periodic verification that processes cannot access restricted resources, that namespace views remain isolated, and that seccomp filters continue blocking forbidden system calls.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Consumption Pattern Analysis</strong> monitors resource usage trends to detect both gradual resource leaks and sudden consumption spikes that might indicate malicious behavior or process malfunction. This includes tracking memory usage growth rates, file descriptor accumulation, and process creation patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Dimension</th>\n<th>Monitoring Method</th>\n<th>Check Frequency</th>\n<th>Failure Threshold</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process Existence</td>\n<td>Check /proc/pid</td>\n<td>Every 1 second</td>\n<td>Process not found</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Responsiveness</td>\n<td>Heartbeat ping</td>\n<td>Every 5 seconds</td>\n<td>No response in 15s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Usage</td>\n<td>Read cgroup memory.usage</td>\n<td>Every 2 seconds</td>\n<td>&gt;90% of limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU Usage</td>\n<td>Read cgroup cpu.stat</td>\n<td>Every 5 seconds</td>\n<td>&gt;100% sustained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Descriptors</td>\n<td>Count /proc/pid/fd entries</td>\n<td>Every 10 seconds</td>\n<td>&gt;80% of limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Activity</td>\n<td>Monitor namespace traffic</td>\n<td>Every 1 second</td>\n<td>Unexpected connections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Call Pattern</td>\n<td>Audit log analysis</td>\n<td>Continuous</td>\n<td>Blocked syscall attempts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"misbehaving-process-detection\">Misbehaving Process Detection</h4>\n<p>Detecting and responding to misbehaving sandboxed processes requires understanding both resource-based misbehavior (consuming excessive resources) and security-based misbehavior (attempting to violate sandbox boundaries).</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Abuse Detection</strong> identifies processes that consume resources in patterns inconsistent with their expected workload. This includes detecting memory leaks through monotonically increasing memory usage, CPU abuse through sustained high CPU utilization, and I/O abuse through excessive disk or network activity. The detection system uses sliding window analysis to distinguish between legitimate bursts and sustained abuse patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Violation Detection</strong> monitors attempts to breach sandbox security boundaries, including seccomp filter violations (blocked system calls), capability escalation attempts, and filesystem access violations. These violations are typically logged by kernel security mechanisms, but the monitoring system must aggregate and analyze these logs to detect coordinated attacks or persistent probing behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication Protocol Violations</strong> occur when sandboxed processes fail to follow expected communication patterns with the sandbox orchestrator. This includes sending malformed messages, failing to respond to control messages, or attempting to establish unauthorized communication channels.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Misbehavior Response Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Misbehaving processes can affect both sandbox security and system stability, requiring immediate response</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate termination vs. graduated response vs. resource throttling</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement graduated response with escalating severity</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Immediate termination may interrupt legitimate work during temporary resource spikes, while graduated response allows distinction between malicious behavior and temporary resource needs</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more complex monitoring logic but provides better user experience and more precise security enforcement</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The misbehavior detection algorithm uses a <strong>three-tier response system</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 1: Warning and Throttling</strong> responds to minor resource violations or single security boundary probes by logging warnings and applying resource throttling. CPU throttling reduces the process&#39;s CPU quota, memory pressure applies swap pressure, and I/O throttling reduces bandwidth allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 2: Process Suspension</strong> responds to repeated violations or sustained resource abuse by suspending the offending process using <code>SIGSTOP</code>. This prevents further resource consumption while preserving process state for analysis or user intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Tier 3: Process Termination</strong> responds to severe violations, persistent abuse after throttling, or security boundary breach attempts by terminating the entire sandbox process tree using <code>SIGKILL</code>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Misbehavior Type</th>\n<th>Detection Criteria</th>\n<th>Tier 1 Response</th>\n<th>Tier 2 Response</th>\n<th>Tier 3 Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory Growth</td>\n<td>10% increase in 60s</td>\n<td>Apply memory pressure</td>\n<td>Suspend process</td>\n<td>Kill on OOM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU Abuse</td>\n<td>&gt;95% CPU for 30s</td>\n<td>Reduce CPU quota</td>\n<td>Suspend process</td>\n<td>Kill after 2 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fork Bomb</td>\n<td>10+ processes in 5s</td>\n<td>Block new forks</td>\n<td>Suspend all processes</td>\n<td>Kill process tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Descriptor Leak</td>\n<td>FD count doubles</td>\n<td>Close unused FDs</td>\n<td>Suspend process</td>\n<td>Kill and cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Flooding</td>\n<td>&gt;1000 packets/sec</td>\n<td>Apply bandwidth limit</td>\n<td>Suspend process</td>\n<td>Kill and block</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seccomp Violations</td>\n<td>5+ blocked syscalls</td>\n<td>Log and monitor</td>\n<td>Suspend process</td>\n<td>Kill on 10+ attempts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"automated-recovery-and-escalation\">Automated Recovery and Escalation</h4>\n<p>The monitoring system must not only detect problems but also implement automated recovery strategies and escalate to human operators when automated responses are insufficient.</p>\n<p><strong>Automatic Restart Policies</strong> handle transient failures by restarting failed sandboxes according to configurable policies. The restart logic distinguishes between failures that warrant restart (resource exhaustion, temporary system issues) and failures that should not be retried (security violations, configuration errors). Restart attempts use exponential backoff to prevent resource thrashing.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Adjustment and Healing</strong> responds to resource pressure by automatically adjusting resource limits within acceptable bounds. If a sandbox consistently approaches memory limits but otherwise behaves properly, the system can increase memory allocation up to configured maximums. Similarly, CPU quotas can be adjusted based on workload patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Escalation Triggers and Notifications</strong> activate when automated responses are insufficient or when patterns suggest systemic issues requiring human attention.

Strategy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section applies to all milestones (1-5), providing comprehensive testing approaches for namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability management</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Testing a process sandbox requires a fundamentally different approach than testing typical application code. The sandbox&#39;s primary purpose is to <strong>contain and restrict</strong> rather than to provide functionality, which means our tests must verify that operations fail correctly rather than succeed. Think of testing a process sandbox like <strong>quality assurance for a maximum-security prison</strong> - we&#39;re not just checking that the doors lock, but that every possible escape route has been blocked, every privilege has been properly restricted, and every resource limit is actively enforced.</p>\n<p>The challenge lies in the fact that security mechanisms often work by <strong>preventing observable behavior</strong> rather than producing it. A successful seccomp filter kills processes before they can report what happened. A properly configured cgroup silently throttles CPU usage. A correctly dropped capability makes system calls fail with cryptic error codes. Our testing strategy must account for these &quot;negative&quot; behaviors while ensuring that legitimate operations still function correctly within the restricted environment.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the defense-in-depth architecture means that <strong>multiple security layers interact</strong> in complex ways. A test might pass when only namespaces are active but fail when seccomp filtering is added, or resource limits might behave differently when capabilities have been dropped. Our testing approach must validate not just individual components but their interactions and the emergent security properties of the complete system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-testing-approach\">Unit Testing Approach</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Security Component Laboratory</strong></p>\n<p>Think of unit testing security components like <strong>running controlled experiments in separate laboratory chambers</strong>. Each test isolates a single security mechanism (namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, capabilities) and subjects it to precisely controlled conditions to verify it behaves correctly. Just as a laboratory experiment controls all variables except the one being studied, our unit tests activate only the security layer under test while mocking or bypassing the others.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that security components have <strong>dual responsibilities</strong>: they must block malicious operations while allowing legitimate ones. Every unit test must therefore verify both the &quot;deny&quot; path and the &quot;allow&quot; path. A namespace test that only checks isolation without verifying that permitted operations still work is incomplete and may hide bugs that break legitimate functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Component-Level Test Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Each security component requires a distinct testing approach tailored to its specific isolation mechanism and failure modes. The following table outlines the core test categories for each component:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Primary Test Focus</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Criteria</th>\n<th>Special Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Namespace Isolation</td>\n<td>Resource view separation</td>\n<td>Isolated process sees different PIDs, mounts, network</td>\n<td>Host system resources remain visible</td>\n<td>Requires root privileges, cleanup of namespaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem Isolation</td>\n<td>Filesystem access restriction</td>\n<td>Only sandbox root and permitted paths accessible</td>\n<td>Host filesystem paths remain accessible</td>\n<td>Requires mount/unmount operations, dependency tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seccomp Filtering</td>\n<td>System call restriction</td>\n<td>Allowed syscalls succeed, forbidden syscalls killed</td>\n<td>Forbidden syscalls succeed or wrong error code</td>\n<td>Architecture-specific syscall numbers, BPF compilation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Resource consumption control</td>\n<td>Limits enforced when exceeded</td>\n<td>Unlimited resource consumption possible</td>\n<td>Time-dependent behavior, requires resource pressure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capability Management</td>\n<td>Privilege restriction</td>\n<td>Privileged operations fail after dropping</td>\n<td>Privileged operations succeed after dropping</td>\n<td>Order-dependent operations, ambient capability interactions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Namespace Isolation Unit Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Namespace testing focuses on verifying that each namespace type creates the expected isolated view of system resources. The fundamental challenge is that namespace isolation is only visible from inside the namespace, requiring tests to fork child processes and examine their environment.</p>\n<p>The namespace test suite must verify isolation for each namespace type:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>PID Namespace Tests</strong>: Fork a child process in a new PID namespace and verify it sees itself as PID 1, cannot see host processes in <code>/proc</code>, and can only signal processes within its namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mount Namespace Tests</strong>: Create a new mount namespace, perform mount operations, and verify they are not visible from the host namespace while confirming the child can access its own mounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Network Namespace Tests</strong>: Create a network namespace and verify the child process has no network interfaces except loopback, cannot connect to external services, and cannot see host network configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>UTS Namespace Tests</strong>: Modify hostname within a UTS namespace and confirm changes are isolated from the host system while remaining visible within the namespace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User Namespace Tests</strong>: Map user IDs within a user namespace and verify the mapping is enforced for file system operations and process ownership while maintaining isolation from host user management.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each test requires careful orchestration of parent-child communication to verify isolation properties:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Phase</th>\n<th>Parent Process Actions</th>\n<th>Child Process Actions</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Setup</td>\n<td>Create namespace with <code>create_namespaces()</code></td>\n<td>Enter namespace via <code>setns()</code></td>\n<td>Check namespace inode numbers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Isolation</td>\n<td>Modify host resources</td>\n<td>Attempt to observe host changes</td>\n<td>Verify child sees unchanged state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Containment</td>\n<td>Monitor host state</td>\n<td>Perform operations in namespace</td>\n<td>Verify host remains unaffected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleanup</td>\n<td>Clean up namespace file descriptors</td>\n<td>Exit normally</td>\n<td>Verify namespace is destroyed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Filesystem Isolation Unit Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Filesystem isolation testing must verify that the sandbox&#39;s filesystem view is both complete enough to function and restricted enough to prevent access to sensitive host resources. The tests must account for the complex interactions between chroot/pivot_root operations, mount namespaces, and bind mount restrictions.</p>\n<p>The core filesystem isolation tests include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Root Filesystem Restriction</strong>: Verify that processes cannot access paths outside the sandbox root, cannot traverse to parent directories, and cannot follow symlinks that escape the sandbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Essential Directory Population</strong>: Confirm that <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and <code>/sys</code> are properly mounted with appropriate restrictions, essential device files are accessible, and system information is available but filtered.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Mount Point Management</strong>: Test that temporary filesystems are correctly mounted, bind mounts are properly restricted, and all mounts are tracked for cleanup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Dependency Resolution</strong>: Verify that all required shared libraries are available within the sandbox, binary executables can load and run, and no missing dependencies prevent legitimate operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The filesystem test approach requires careful setup of test environments:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Environment</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Setup Requirements</th>\n<th>Cleanup Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Minimal Root</td>\n<td>Test basic chroot functionality</td>\n<td>Create directory tree, copy essential binaries</td>\n<td>Remove temporary directory tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Library Test Root</td>\n<td>Test dependency resolution</td>\n<td>Copy full library dependencies</td>\n<td>Clean up library cache, temporary files</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device Node Test</td>\n<td>Test <code>/dev</code> population</td>\n<td>Create device nodes, set permissions</td>\n<td>Remove created devices, restore permissions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount Test Environment</td>\n<td>Test mount management</td>\n<td>Prepare test mount points</td>\n<td>Unmount all test mounts, remove directories</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Seccomp Filtering Unit Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Seccomp filter testing requires verifying that BPF programs correctly identify and block forbidden system calls while allowing permitted ones. The challenge is that seccomp violations terminate the process, requiring careful test orchestration to capture and verify the termination behavior.</p>\n<p>The seccomp test methodology involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>BPF Program Generation</strong>: Test that syscall whitelists generate correct BPF instruction sequences, handle architecture-specific syscall numbers properly, and produce valid filter programs that load without errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Allowed Syscall Verification</strong>: Install the filter and verify that whitelisted syscalls complete successfully, return expected values, and do not trigger filter violations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Forbidden Syscall Detection</strong>: Attempt forbidden syscalls and verify they result in process termination, appropriate exit codes, and no side effects on system state.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Argument-Level Filtering</strong>: Test filters that examine syscall arguments, verify that parameter-based restrictions work correctly, and confirm that argument validation prevents bypass attempts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The seccomp testing approach requires managing child processes that may be killed by the filter:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Parent Actions</th>\n<th>Child Actions</th>\n<th>Expected Outcome</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Whitelist Compliance</td>\n<td>Fork child, wait for exit</td>\n<td>Install filter, call allowed syscalls</td>\n<td>Child exits normally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blacklist Violation</td>\n<td>Fork child, expect SIGKILL</td>\n<td>Install filter, call forbidden syscall</td>\n<td>Child killed by kernel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Argument Filtering</td>\n<td>Fork child, monitor exit code</td>\n<td>Install filter, call syscall with bad args</td>\n<td>Child killed or errno returned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filter Bypass Attempt</td>\n<td>Monitor system state</td>\n<td>Try various bypass techniques</td>\n<td>All attempts fail, no system impact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Resource Limit Unit Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Cgroup resource limit testing must verify that limits are correctly applied and enforced under resource pressure. These tests require generating controlled resource consumption to trigger limit enforcement and observing the system&#39;s response.</p>\n<p>The resource limit test categories include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Memory Limit Enforcement</strong>: Allocate memory beyond the configured limit and verify the process is terminated by the OOM killer, memory usage is capped at the limit, and other processes remain unaffected.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>CPU Limit Enforcement</strong>: Generate CPU load and verify that usage is throttled to the configured percentage, other processes receive fair scheduling, and limits are maintained over time.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Count Limits</strong>: Fork processes beyond the PID limit and verify new forks fail with appropriate error codes, existing processes continue running, and the limit is enforced consistently.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>I/O Bandwidth Limits</strong>: Generate disk I/O load and verify throughput is capped at configured rates, I/O operations are throttled appropriately, and limits apply to all file operations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Resource limit testing requires careful coordination of resource consumption:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource Type</th>\n<th>Load Generation Method</th>\n<th>Measurement Approach</th>\n<th>Verification Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Memory</td>\n<td>Allocate increasing buffer sizes</td>\n<td>Monitor <code>/proc/*/status</code> RSS</td>\n<td>Allocation fails or process killed at limit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU</td>\n<td>Busy loop with configurable intensity</td>\n<td>Monitor CPU usage via cgroup stats</td>\n<td>Usage throttled to configured percentage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Count</td>\n<td>Fork bomb with controlled rate</td>\n<td>Count processes in cgroup</td>\n<td>Fork fails when limit reached</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O Bandwidth</td>\n<td>Large file read/write operations</td>\n<td>Monitor I/O rates via iostat</td>\n<td>Throughput capped at limit</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Capability Management Unit Tests</strong></p>\n<p>Capability testing verifies that Linux capabilities are correctly dropped and that privilege escalation is prevented. The tests must account for the complex interactions between different capability sets and the various mechanisms for capability inheritance.</p>\n<p>The capability test framework must verify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Capability Dropping</strong>: Confirm that specified capabilities are removed from all capability sets, remaining capabilities are preserved correctly, and the bounding set prevents re-acquisition of dropped capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Privilege Operation Blocking</strong>: Attempt operations that require dropped capabilities and verify they fail with permission denied errors, no privileged side effects occur, and error handling is appropriate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>No New Privileges Enforcement</strong>: Verify that <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> prevents privilege escalation through exec, setuid binaries do not gain privileges, and capability inheritance is blocked correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User/Group Transition</strong>: Test that user and group changes occur in the correct order, capabilities are appropriately adjusted during transitions, and the final privilege state matches expectations.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The capability testing approach requires privilege verification at multiple stages:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Stage</th>\n<th>Capability Check</th>\n<th>Operation Test</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Initial State</td>\n<td>List all current capabilities</td>\n<td>Verify privileged operations work</td>\n<td>Full capability set available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>After Dropping</td>\n<td>Verify specific caps removed</td>\n<td>Confirm dropped operations fail</td>\n<td>Only whitelisted capabilities remain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>After No-New-Privs</td>\n<td>Check flag is set</td>\n<td>Attempt privilege escalation</td>\n<td>All escalation attempts fail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>After User Change</td>\n<td>Verify final capability state</td>\n<td>Test remaining privileges work</td>\n<td>Expected capabilities functional</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing\">Integration Testing</h3>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Complete Security System Rehearsal</strong></p>\n<p>Integration testing for a process sandbox is like <strong>conducting a full-scale security drill</strong> for a high-security facility. While unit tests examine individual security components in isolation (like testing each lock and sensor separately), integration tests activate the entire security system simultaneously and verify that all layers work together harmoniously. The goal is to ensure that the combination of namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability dropping creates a robust containment environment without unexpected interactions that could compromise security or break legitimate functionality.</p>\n<p>The critical insight is that security layers can interfere with each other in subtle ways. Namespace isolation might prevent seccomp filters from accessing required kernel information. Capability dropping might break cgroup management operations. Filesystem restrictions might prevent access to libraries needed for system call handling. Integration testing must uncover these interactions and verify that the orchestration sequence produces a stable, secure environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Realistic Workload Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Integration testing focuses on running realistic programs within the complete sandbox environment to verify that all security layers cooperate effectively. The test workloads should represent the types of programs the sandbox is designed to contain: computational tasks, file processing jobs, network services, and potentially malicious code that attempts various escape techniques.</p>\n<p>The integration test suite includes several categories of realistic workloads:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Workload Category</th>\n<th>Program Type</th>\n<th>Security Challenge</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Computational</td>\n<td>CPU-intensive calculations</td>\n<td>Resource limit enforcement</td>\n<td>Program completes within CPU limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Processing</td>\n<td>Read/write file operations</td>\n<td>Filesystem isolation + I/O limits</td>\n<td>Only sandbox files accessible, I/O throttled</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Information</td>\n<td>Query system resources</td>\n<td>Namespace isolation</td>\n<td>Only sandbox view visible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Operations</td>\n<td>Socket creation, connections</td>\n<td>Network namespace isolation</td>\n<td>Network access blocked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Privilege Escalation</td>\n<td>Setuid, capability manipulation</td>\n<td>Capability dropping + seccomp</td>\n<td>All escalation attempts fail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Memory/CPU/disk bombs</td>\n<td>Cgroup resource limits</td>\n<td>Resource consumption capped, no host impact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Multi-Process Workload Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Real-world programs often spawn child processes, creating additional complexity for sandbox management. Integration tests must verify that all child processes inherit the same security restrictions, resource limits are applied hierarchically, and process management operations work correctly within the sandbox environment.</p>\n<p>The multi-process testing approach examines several scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Fork and Exec Chains</strong>: Programs that spawn multiple child processes through fork and exec operations, verifying that each child inherits the complete security context and cannot escape through process manipulation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Communication</strong>: Parent and child processes that communicate through pipes, shared memory, or other IPC mechanisms, confirming that communication works within the sandbox but cannot reach external processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Tree Management</strong>: Programs that create complex process hierarchies, ensuring that resource limits apply to the entire tree and that process cleanup handles all descendants correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Signal Handling</strong>: Process groups that use signals for coordination, verifying that signal delivery works within the sandbox but cannot affect external processes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The multi-process test framework tracks process relationships and resource usage:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Process Pattern</th>\n<th>Verification Points</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simple Fork</td>\n<td>Parent forks one child</td>\n<td>Both processes in same cgroup, namespace</td>\n<td>Resource limits apply to both, isolation maintained</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exec Chain</td>\n<td>Process A execs B, B execs C</td>\n<td>Security context preserved across execs</td>\n<td>All execed processes have same restrictions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Tree</td>\n<td>Parent spawns multiple children</td>\n<td>Hierarchical resource accounting</td>\n<td>Tree-wide resource limits enforced</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPC Communication</td>\n<td>Processes share data via pipes</td>\n<td>Communication works, isolation maintained</td>\n<td>Internal IPC works, external blocked</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Performance Impact Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>Integration testing must verify that the security layers do not impose excessive performance overhead that would make the sandbox impractical for real workloads.

Known attacks include well-documented container escape techniques, privilege escalation exploits, and resource exhaustion attacks. Unexpected failure modes arise from the complex interactions between security layers and might include race conditions in cleanup code, edge cases in BPF filter evaluation, or resource accounting errors under extreme load.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace Escape Prevention Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Namespace isolation is often the first target for container escape attempts because it provides the most fundamental isolation layer. Security validation must verify that namespace boundaries cannot be crossed through any combination of system calls, filesystem operations, or resource manipulations.</p>\n<p>The namespace escape testing methodology systematically probes each namespace type for vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>PID Namespace Escape Tests</strong>: Attempt to access or manipulate processes outside the namespace through <code>/proc</code> traversal, process signaling, shared memory segments, and process tracing interfaces.

Guide</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section applies to all milestones (1-5), providing systematic debugging approaches for namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability management</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building a process sandbox requires orchestrating multiple complex Linux security mechanisms, each with their own failure modes and debugging challenges. The <strong>Mental Model: The Crime Scene Investigation</strong> - think of debugging a sandbox failure like being a detective at a crime scene. You need to systematically examine all the evidence (logs, process state, system calls, resource usage) to reconstruct what happened and identify the root cause. Just as a detective follows clues from the scene backwards to understand the sequence of events, sandbox debugging requires tracing symptoms back through the layers of security mechanisms to find where the failure originated.</p>\n<p>The debugging process becomes particularly challenging because sandbox failures often manifest as cryptic symptoms far removed from their root causes. A process that fails to start might be blocked by seccomp, missing library dependencies, insufficient capabilities, or resource limits. A process that starts but behaves incorrectly might be operating with an incomplete filesystem view, blocked system calls, or unexpected namespace isolation. The key to effective debugging is understanding how these security layers interact and developing systematic approaches to isolate which layer is causing the problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"symptom-based-diagnosis\">Symptom-Based Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>Effective sandbox debugging starts with systematic symptom analysis. Each type of failure produces characteristic symptoms that point toward specific security layers or configuration issues. Understanding these patterns allows developers to quickly narrow down the root cause rather than randomly checking all possible failure points.</p>\n<p>The following diagnostic matrix maps common symptoms to their most likely root causes, organized by the security layer most commonly responsible:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Root Cause</th>\n<th>Primary Layer</th>\n<th>Secondary Causes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process fails to start with &quot;No such file or directory&quot;</td>\n<td>Missing executable or libraries in sandbox filesystem</td>\n<td>Filesystem Isolation</td>\n<td>Mount namespace not properly initialized, chroot incomplete</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process starts but immediately exits with status 127</td>\n<td>Dynamic linker cannot find shared libraries</td>\n<td>Filesystem Isolation</td>\n<td>Incorrect library paths, missing ld.so cache</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process killed with SIGSYS signal</td>\n<td>Blocked system call by seccomp filter</td>\n<td>System Call Filtering</td>\n<td>Missing syscall in whitelist, architecture mismatch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process hangs during startup</td>\n<td>Blocked system call without error return</td>\n<td>System Call Filtering</td>\n<td>Filter returns ERRNO instead of allowing required syscall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process fails with &quot;Permission denied&quot; on file access</td>\n<td>Insufficient capabilities for operation</td>\n<td>Capability Management</td>\n<td>Missing CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE or other required capability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process cannot bind to network port</td>\n<td>Network namespace isolation or capability restriction</td>\n<td>Namespace Isolation</td>\n<td>Missing CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE or isolated network namespace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process killed by OOM killer</td>\n<td>Memory limit exceeded</td>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Cgroup memory limit too low, memory leak in sandboxed code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process throttled or slow performance</td>\n<td>CPU or I/O limits reached</td>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Cgroup CPU quota exhausted, I/O bandwidth throttling active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cannot create child processes</td>\n<td>Process limit exceeded</td>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Cgroup PID limit reached, fork bomb protection triggered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process sees wrong PID or hostname</td>\n<td>Namespace isolation incomplete</td>\n<td>Namespace Isolation</td>\n<td>PID or UTS namespace not created properly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mount operations fail</td>\n<td>Missing mount capabilities or wrong namespace</td>\n<td>Namespace Isolation</td>\n<td>CAP_SYS_ADMIN dropped, mount namespace not isolated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Device access fails</td>\n<td>Missing device nodes or permissions</td>\n<td>Filesystem Isolation</td>\n<td>/dev not populated, device files missing or wrong permissions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Process Startup Failures</strong> represent the most common category of sandbox problems. These typically manifest as immediate process termination with cryptic error codes. The key diagnostic approach involves systematically checking each prerequisite:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Executable existence</strong>: Verify the target program exists at the expected path within the sandbox filesystem</li>\n<li><strong>Library dependencies</strong>: Use <code>ldd</code> on the host to identify required shared libraries, then verify each exists in the sandbox</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic linker configuration</strong>: Ensure <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> or <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code> provides correct library search paths</li>\n<li><strong>File permissions</strong>: Check that executable has proper permissions and all parent directories are accessible</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>System Call Blocking</strong> symptoms require careful analysis of which operations are failing. The most reliable diagnostic approach uses <code>strace</code> to capture the exact system call that triggers the seccomp violation:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Process killed by SIGSYS at system call: openat()\nArguments: AT_FDCWD, &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, O_RDONLY</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This information immediately identifies whether the problem is a missing syscall in the whitelist (openat not allowed) or argument-level filtering (specific file path blocked).</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Exhaustion</strong> symptoms often appear as performance degradation before triggering hard limits. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring resource usage patterns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Memory exhaustion: Process RSS grows until hitting cgroup limit, then OOM killer activates</li>\n<li>CPU throttling: Process experiences intermittent delays as CPU quota is exhausted and restored</li>\n<li>I/O throttling: File operations become progressively slower as bandwidth limit is reached</li>\n<li>Process limits: Fork or clone operations fail with EAGAIN when PID limit is exceeded</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Namespace Isolation Issues</strong> typically manifest as processes seeing unexpected system state. The key diagnostic technique involves comparing the process&#39;s view of system resources with the expected isolated view:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PID namespace: Check if process sees itself as PID 1 and only sees processes in its namespace</li>\n<li>Mount namespace: Verify filesystem layout matches expected sandbox structure</li>\n<li>Network namespace: Confirm network interfaces, routing tables, and port bindings are isolated</li>\n<li>UTS namespace: Check hostname and domain name are isolated from host system</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical debugging insight is that symptoms often appear in one security layer but originate in another. A &quot;permission denied&quot; error might seem like a capability problem but actually result from seccomp blocking the underlying system call before capability checks occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-tools-and-techniques\">Debugging Tools and Techniques</h3>\n<p>Effective sandbox debugging requires a comprehensive toolkit of Linux debugging utilities, each specialized for examining different aspects of process isolation and security enforcement. The key principle is using the right tool for each security layer rather than relying on generic debugging approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace Inspection Tools</strong> provide visibility into the isolated views that sandboxed processes experience.

sandbox&#39;s filesystem view with expectations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mount verification</strong>: Use <code>findmnt</code> to confirm all required filesystems are mounted at correct locations</li>\n<li><strong>Path resolution</strong>: Trace file access attempts to see where path lookups fail</li>\n<li><strong>Permission analysis</strong>: Check that file permissions, ownership,

Many sandbox issues occur in child processes, so missing this flag can hide the actual problem. The <code>-T</code> flag shows time spent in each syscall, helping identify performance issues caused by resource throttling.</p>\n<p><strong>Seccomp Filter Analysis</strong> through system call tracing requires understanding how seccomp violations appear in trace output. When seccomp blocks a system call, it can either return an error code or kill the process, depending on the filter configuration:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code># Seccomp returning EPERM (error code)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, O_RDONLY) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)\n\n# Seccomp killing process (appears as signal)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;, O_RDONLY) = ?\n+++ killed by SIGSYS +++</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The key diagnostic technique involves comparing syscall traces between successful execution outside the sandbox versus failed execution inside the sandbox. Differences in syscall success/failure patterns immediately identify which operations are being blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Tracing Techniques</strong> help diagnose complex interaction issues between multiple security layers:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Technique</th>\n<th>Command</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Analysis Focus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Multi-process tracing</td>\n<td><code>strace -f -ff -o trace</code></td>\n<td>Separate log per process</td>\n<td>Child process failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time-based analysis</td>\n<td><code>strace -T -tt</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp each syscall</td>\n<td>Performance bottlenecks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal tracing</td>\n<td><code>strace -e signal=all</code></td>\n<td>Show signal delivery</td>\n<td>Seccomp kills, resource limits</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory mapping</td>\n<td><code>strace -e trace=mmap,munmap,mprotect</code></td>\n<td>Memory operations</td>\n<td>Library loading issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capability tracing</td>\n<td><code>strace -e trace=capget,capset</code></td>\n<td>Privilege changes</td>\n<td>Capability dropping problems</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Filter Development and Testing</strong> uses system call tracing to iteratively develop seccomp filters.

id=\"future-extensions\">Future Extensions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> This section applies to all milestones (1-5), exploring advanced enhancements and operational improvements that can be built upon the foundational sandbox implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process sandbox implementation represents a solid foundation for secure code execution, but the rapidly evolving landscape of Linux security features and operational requirements opens numerous opportunities for enhancement. These future extensions fall into three primary categories: advanced security features that leverage cutting-edge kernel capabilities, performance optimizations that improve sandbox efficiency and scalability, and management tooling that enables production deployment at scale.</p>\n<p>Understanding these potential extensions serves multiple purposes for learners. First, it demonstrates that security is never a completed project—new threats emerge, new kernel features become available, and operational requirements evolve. Second, it provides a roadmap for continued learning and skill development in systems security. Third, it illustrates how foundational knowledge of namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities serves as a springboard for understanding more sophisticated security mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The extensions presented here range from relatively straightforward enhancements that could be implemented immediately after completing the core milestones, to research-grade features that represent the cutting edge of container security. Each category addresses different aspects of the classic trade-off between security, performance, and usability that defines all practical security systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-security-features\">Advanced Security Features</h3>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-the-evolving-security-arsenal\">Mental Model: The Evolving Security Arsenal</h4>\n<p>Think of advanced security features as upgrading from a basic home security system to a state-of-the-art facility protection network. Your current sandbox is like having locks, an alarm system, and security cameras—effective and proven. Advanced features are like adding biometric access controls, AI-powered threat detection, motion sensors that can distinguish between authorized personnel and intruders, and automated response systems that can isolate threats before they spread. Each new capability adds another layer of sophisticated protection, but also introduces complexity in configuration, integration, and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>The landscape of Linux security features has expanded dramatically in recent years, driven by the growing adoption of containers and the increasing sophistication of attack vectors. While the foundational mechanisms of namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities remain essential, newer kernel features provide more granular control, better performance, and protection against attack classes that weren&#39;t well-understood when the original mechanisms were designed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"linux-security-modules-lsm-integration\">Linux Security Modules (LSM) Integration</h4>\n<p>Linux Security Modules represent a fundamental shift from discretionary access control to mandatory access control policies that can enforce security decisions regardless of process ownership or traditional Unix permissions. The most relevant LSMs for sandbox enhancement are SELinux, AppArmor, and the newer Landlock framework.</p>\n<p><strong>SELinux Integration</strong> provides label-based security that can enforce policies based on security contexts rather than user identity. In a sandbox context, SELinux can prevent sandboxed processes from accessing resources even if filesystem permissions would normally allow access. This creates an additional security layer that operates independently of namespace isolation and capability restrictions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>SELinux Feature</th>\n<th>Security Benefit</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Enforcement</td>\n<td>Process-resource access control</td>\n<td>High - requires policy development</td>\n<td>Medium - kernel policy evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multi-Level Security</td>\n<td>Information flow control</td>\n<td>Very High - complex classification</td>\n<td>Low - cached policy decisions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Role-Based Access</td>\n<td>Administrative separation</td>\n<td>Medium - role definition required</td>\n<td>Low - minimal runtime overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Confined Domains</td>\n<td>Process behavior restriction</td>\n<td>High - domain transition rules</td>\n<td>Medium - policy lookup overhead</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Landlock for Filesystem Access Control</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need finer-grained filesystem access control than mount namespaces alone provide, without the complexity of full SELinux policy development</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: SELinux type enforcement, AppArmor path-based restrictions, Landlock filesystem sandboxing</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement Landlock integration for filesystem access control</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Landlock provides programmatic access control without requiring system-wide policy configuration, offers better granularity than mount namespaces, and has lower complexity than SELinux</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables per-file access control within sandbox, requires kernel 5.13+, adds another security layer to coordinate with existing mechanisms</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Landlock Integration</strong> represents the most promising LSM enhancement for process sandboxes because it was specifically designed for application-level sandboxing. Unlike SELinux or AppArmor, which require system-wide policy configuration, Landlock allows individual applications to impose additional restrictions on themselves and their children.</p>\n<p>Landlock filesystem rules can restrict access to specific files or directories regardless of namespace configuration. This enables scenarios like allowing a sandboxed process to access <code>/etc/passwd</code> for user lookup while preventing access to <code>/etc/shadow</code>, even if both files are visible in the mount namespace. The programmatic nature of Landlock policies means they can be generated dynamically based on sandbox configuration rather than requiring pre-written policy files.</p>\n<p>The integration approach involves creating Landlock rulesets during sandbox initialization, after namespace creation but before dropping capabilities. This ensures the sandbox orchestrator retains the ability to call the Landlock system calls, but the sandboxed process inherits the restrictions without the ability to modify them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"seccomp-notify-and-user-mode-helper\">Seccomp Notify and User Mode Helper</h4>\n<p>Traditional seccomp filtering operates as a binary allow-or-deny decision made entirely in kernel space. The seccomp notify mechanism, introduced in Linux 5.0, enables a more sophisticated approach where filtered system calls can be intercepted and handled by a user space supervisor process.</p>\n<p><strong>Seccomp Notify Architecture</strong> creates a communication channel between the kernel&#39;s seccomp filter and a supervisor process. When a sandboxed process attempts a system call that matches a notify filter rule, the kernel suspends the sandboxed process and sends details about the system call to the supervisor through a file descriptor. The supervisor can then examine the system call arguments, potentially perform the operation on behalf of the sandboxed process with additional validation, and return either the successful result or an error code.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Notify Use Case</th>\n<th>Security Advantage</th>\n<th>Implementation Challenge</th>\n<th>Performance Consideration</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>File Access Mediation</td>\n<td>Path-based access control</td>\n<td>Complex path canonicalization</td>\n<td>Context switching overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Request Filtering</td>\n<td>Protocol-aware filtering</td>\n<td>Network protocol parsing</td>\n<td>Socket state management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPC Auditing</td>\n<td>Comprehensive communication logging</td>\n<td>Message format interpretation</td>\n<td>Audit data volume</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Quota Enforcement</td>\n<td>Dynamic limit adjustment</td>\n<td>Cross-process state tracking</td>\n<td>Lock contention management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This mechanism enables sophisticated policies like allowing <code>openat()</code> system calls only for files that match specific patterns, or permitting network connections only to pre-approved destinations. The supervisor can implement complex logic that would be impossible to express in a static BPF program, such as rate limiting, quota management, or integration with external policy engines.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Strategy</strong> involves modifying the BPF filter generation to include <code>SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF</code> return values for system calls that require mediation, creating a supervisor thread or process that handles the notification file descriptor, and implementing a policy engine that can make access control decisions based on system call arguments and current sandbox state.</p>\n<p>The supervisor process design presents interesting architectural choices. A threaded approach keeps the supervisor within the same process as the sandbox orchestrator, simplifying state sharing but creating potential attack surface if the supervisor is compromised. A separate process approach provides better isolation but requires more complex inter-process communication and state management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ebpf-and-advanced-monitoring\">eBPF and Advanced Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) represents a significant evolution beyond traditional seccomp BPF, enabling sophisticated monitoring and enforcement capabilities throughout the kernel. While seccomp BPF is limited to system call filtering, eBPF programs can be attached to numerous kernel events including network packet processing, filesystem operations, process scheduling, and memory management.</p>\n<p><strong>eBPF Integration Opportunities</strong> for sandbox enhancement include runtime security monitoring that tracks sandbox behavior patterns and detects anomalous activity, performance profiling that identifies resource usage patterns and optimization opportunities, and dynamic policy enforcement that can adapt security policies based on observed behavior.</p>\n<p>LSM hooks provide attachment points where eBPF programs can intercept and potentially modify security decisions made by the kernel. An eBPF program attached to the <code>security_file_permission</code> hook can implement custom file access policies, while programs attached to <code>security_task_create</code> can monitor process creation and enforce additional restrictions on child processes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>eBPF Program Type</th>\n<th>Monitoring Capability</th>\n<th>Security Enhancement</th>\n<th>Resource Overhead</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>LSM Hook Programs</td>\n<td>Security decision interception</td>\n<td>Dynamic policy enforcement</td>\n<td>Low - efficient JIT compilation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tracepoint Programs</td>\n<td>System event monitoring</td>\n<td>Anomaly detection</td>\n<td>Medium - event processing overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kprobe Programs</td>\n<td>Function call tracing</td>\n<td>Detailed behavior analysis</td>\n<td>High - frequent execution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Socket Filter Programs</td>\n<td>Network traffic analysis</td>\n<td>Protocol-specific filtering</td>\n<td>Medium - packet processing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The observability benefits of eBPF extend beyond security to performance optimization and debugging. eBPF programs can collect detailed metrics about system call latency, memory allocation patterns, and I/O behavior within the sandbox. This data enables identification of performance bottlenecks and validation that security restrictions are not causing unexpected performance degradation.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation Considerations</strong> include the requirement for specific kernel versions and configuration options, the complexity of eBPF program development and verification, and the need for careful resource management to prevent eBPF programs from impacting system performance. The eBPF verifier ensures program safety but requires understanding of eBPF programming constraints and kernel internals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hardware-security-features\">Hardware Security Features</h4>\n<p>Modern processors provide hardware-assisted security features that can enhance process isolation beyond what software mechanisms alone can achieve. Intel&#39;s Memory Protection Extensions (MPX), Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET), and Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK) offer hardware-level enforcement of memory safety and control flow integrity.</p>\n<p><strong>Intel MPK Integration</strong> enables fine-grained memory protection by associating memory regions with protection keys and allowing rapid switching of access permissions for those keys. In a sandbox context, MPK can provide an additional layer of memory isolation that operates independently of virtual memory protections and can be toggled with minimal overhead.</p>\n<p>The integration approach involves allocating separate protection keys for sandbox memory regions during process initialization, configuring initial access permissions that allow supervisor access but restrict sandboxed code, and potentially implementing dynamic permission switching based on execution context. This requires careful coordination with memory management and process lifecycle management to ensure keys are properly allocated and cleaned up.</p>\n<p><strong>ARM Pointer Authentication and Memory Tagging</strong> provide similar hardware-assisted security features on ARM platforms. Pointer authentication can detect return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented programming (JOP) attacks by cryptographically signing return addresses and function pointers. Memory tagging associates tags with memory allocations and pointers, enabling detection of use-after-free and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The heterogeneous nature of hardware security features across processor architectures requires careful abstraction layer design that can leverage available features without creating hard dependencies on specific hardware capabilities. The implementation should gracefully degrade when hardware features are not available while taking advantage of them when present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-optimizations\">Performance Optimizations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-the-assembly-line-optimization\">Mental Model: The Assembly Line Optimization</h4>\n<p>Think of performance optimizations as transforming a custom craft workshop into an efficient assembly line. Your current sandbox is like a skilled craftsperson who can create a custom security environment for each request, carefully measuring, cutting, and assembling each component. Performance optimizations are like introducing pre-cut materials, standardized templates, assembly jigs, and parallel workstations. The end result is the same high-quality product, but produced with dramatically higher throughput and lower resource consumption per unit.</p>\n<p>Performance optimization in security systems presents unique challenges because optimizations cannot compromise security properties. Every performance enhancement must be carefully analyzed to ensure it doesn&#39;t introduce security vulnerabilities or weaken the existing security model. This creates a constraint that doesn&#39;t exist in many other performance optimization contexts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"template-based-sandbox-creation\">Template-Based Sandbox Creation</h4>\n<p>The sandbox creation process involves numerous expensive operations: namespace creation, filesystem setup, cgroup configuration, and seccomp filter compilation. These operations are largely independent of the specific program being sandboxed, suggesting opportunities for template-based optimization.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandbox Templates</strong> involve pre-creating sandbox environments with common configurations and reusing them for multiple sandboxed processes. This approach amortizes the expensive setup operations across multiple sandbox instances and reduces the latency between sandbox request and program execution.</p>\n<p>The template approach requires careful design to maintain security isolation. Templates cannot share writable resources between instances, and each template instantiation must receive its own isolated namespace and filesystem view. The implementation strategy involves creating &quot;golden&quot; sandbox environments with read-only base configurations and using copy-on-write mechanisms to provide per-instance writable areas.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Template Component</th>\n<th>Reuse Strategy</th>\n<th>Isolation Mechanism</th>\n<th>Performance Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Base Filesystem</td>\n<td>Read-only mount with overlay</td>\n<td>Overlay filesystem per instance</td>\n<td>Eliminates filesystem construction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Namespace Configuration</td>\n<td>Clone from template namespace</td>\n<td>Namespace creation with CLONE_NEW* flags</td>\n<td>Reduces namespace setup time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seccomp Filter</td>\n<td>Compiled BPF program reuse</td>\n<td>Per-process filter installation</td>\n<td>Eliminates BPF compilation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cgroup Structure</td>\n<td>Shared cgroup hierarchy</td>\n<td>Per-instance cgroup directories</td>\n<td>Reduces cgroup creation overhead</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Container Image Integration</strong> extends the template concept by leveraging existing container image formats and tooling. Container images provide standardized mechanisms for packaging filesystem contents and metadata, enabling integration with existing container ecosystems while maintaining the enhanced security properties of the custom sandbox implementation.</p>\n<p>The integration approach involves implementing container image unpacking and mounting within the sandbox filesystem isolation component, adapting container image metadata to sandbox configuration parameters, and potentially supporting container registry integration for dynamic image retrieval.</p>\n<p>This integration enables use cases like sandboxing language-specific runtime environments (Node.js, Python, JVM) that are distributed as container images, while applying more restrictive security policies than typical container runtimes provide.</p>\n<h4 id=\"process-pool-management\">Process Pool Management</h4>\n<p>Creating new processes and configuring security restrictions involves significant overhead, particularly when sandboxes are used for short-lived tasks. Process pool management addresses this by maintaining a pool of pre-configured sandbox processes that can be rapidly assigned to new tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Pool Architecture</strong> involves creating a master pool manager that maintains multiple pre-initialized sandbox processes in a ready state, a task dispatcher that assigns incoming work to available processes from the pool, and a lifecycle manager that handles process recycling and replacement.</p>\n<p>The security implications require careful consideration. Pool processes must be reset to a clean state between tasks to prevent information leakage, and the pool manager must ensure that process failures don&#39;t compromise other pool members. The implementation strategy involves designing a task execution protocol that provides clean isolation between tasks and implementing process health monitoring to detect and replace unhealthy pool members.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pool Management Aspect</th>\n<th>Design Challenge</th>\n<th>Security Consideration</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process Initialization</td>\n<td>Balancing pool size with resource usage</td>\n<td>Limiting pool process capabilities</td>\n<td>Startup time amortization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Task Isolation</td>\n<td>Ensuring clean state between tasks</td>\n<td>Preventing information leakage</td>\n<td>Context switching overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure Recovery</td>\n<td>Detecting and replacing failed processes</td>\n<td>Maintaining pool security properties</td>\n<td>Recovery time impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Management</td>\n<td>Controlling total resource consumption</td>\n<td>Enforcing per-task and pool-wide limits</td>\n<td>Memory and CPU efficiency</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Task Execution Protocol</strong> design involves creating a communication mechanism between the pool manager and pool processes that can safely transmit task specifications and results. The protocol must prevent task data from being accessible to subsequent tasks and ensure that task failures don&#39;t compromise the pool process.</p>\n<p>The protocol implementation options include Unix domain sockets for high-performance local communication, shared memory with careful synchronization for bulk data transfer, and file descriptor passing for providing task-specific resource access. Each approach has different performance characteristics and security implications.</p>\n<h4 id=\"resource-sharing-and-deduplication\">Resource Sharing and Deduplication</h4>\n<p>Multiple sandbox instances often require similar resources, particularly when executing related tasks or using common runtime environments. Resource sharing and deduplication can significantly reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency while maintaining security isolation.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory Deduplication</strong> using kernel same-page merging (KSM) can identify identical memory pages across different sandbox processes and merge them into shared read-only pages. This is particularly effective for shared libraries, runtime environments, and static data that is identical across multiple sandbox instances.</p>\n<p>The security analysis requires ensuring that memory deduplication doesn&#39;t create information leakage channels. The KSM implementation provides copy-on-write semantics that prevent one process from observing modifications made by another process, but timing-based attacks might potentially infer information about shared memory usage patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Filesystem Layer Sharing</strong> extends the overlay filesystem approach to share common layers across multiple sandbox instances. When multiple sandboxes use similar base environments, the common portions can be shared while providing per-instance writable layers for modifications.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sharing Mechanism</th>\n<th>Resource Savings</th>\n<th>Security Risk</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Shared Library Memory</td>\n<td>High - common across all processes</td>\n<td>Low - read-only sharing</td>\n<td>Low - kernel KSM support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem Layer Sharing</td>\n<td>Medium - depends on commonality</td>\n<td>Medium - layer isolation required</td>\n<td>Medium - overlay management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seccomp Filter Sharing</td>\n<td>Low - filters are small</td>\n<td>Low - per-process installation</td>\n<td>Low - compiled program reuse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Namespace Sharing</td>\n<td>High - for network-isolated workloads</td>\n<td>High - requires network isolation</td>\n<td>High - complex namespace management</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The implementation strategy involves identifying sharing opportunities during sandbox configuration, implementing reference counting and lifecycle management for shared resources, and providing monitoring and debugging capabilities to understand sharing effectiveness and detect sharing-related issues.</p>\n<h4 id=\"asynchronous-operations-and-batching\">Asynchronous Operations and Batching</h4>\n<p>Many sandbox management operations can be performed asynchronously without impacting security properties. Asynchronous operation design can improve responsiveness and enable batching optimizations that reduce per-operation overhead.</p>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous Cleanup</strong> involves deferring resource cleanup operations that don&#39;t have immediate security implications to background tasks. Cgroup removal, filesystem unmounting, and namespace cleanup can often be performed after the sandboxed process has terminated without creating security risks.</p>\n<p>The design involves implementing a cleanup queue with background worker threads, prioritizing cleanup operations based on resource pressure and security sensitivity, and providing monitoring capabilities to ensure cleanup operations don&#39;t accumulate indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>Batched Configuration Updates</strong> can optimize scenarios where multiple sandbox instances require similar configuration changes. Cgroup limit updates, seccomp filter installations, and namespace configuration changes can potentially be batched to reduce system call overhead.</p>\n<p>The batching strategy requires careful analysis to ensure that batching doesn&#39;t delay critical security updates or create windows where security policies are inconsistently applied across related sandbox instances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"management-and-monitoring\">Management and Monitoring</h3>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-the-mission-control-center\">Mental Model: The Mission Control Center</h4>\n<p>Think of management and monitoring as building a mission control center for your sandbox fleet. Your current implementation is like a skilled pilot flying a single aircraft—effective for the immediate task but limited in scope. Management and monitoring systems are like air traffic control, flight tracking systems, communication networks, and automated response protocols that enable coordination of hundreds of aircraft simultaneously. They provide visibility into the entire operation, early warning of problems, and coordinated response capabilities that no single operator could manage manually.</p>\n<p>Production deployment of process sandboxes requires sophisticated management and monitoring capabilities that extend far beyond the core isolation mechanisms. These systems must provide operational visibility, automated response to failures, resource planning data, and security monitoring that can detect sophisticated attacks or policy violations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comprehensive-metrics-collection\">Comprehensive Metrics Collection</h4>\n<p>Effective sandbox management requires detailed metrics covering security events, performance characteristics, resource utilization, and operational health. The metrics collection system must balance comprehensive coverage with minimal performance impact on sandbox operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Metrics</strong> include tracking seccomp filter violations with detailed context about blocked system calls and their arguments, monitoring capability usage patterns to detect privilege escalation attempts, and recording namespace escape attempts or other container breakout behaviors.</p>\n<p>The metrics collection architecture involves implementing lightweight instrumentation throughout the sandbox components, designing efficient data aggregation mechanisms that can handle high-volume metric streams, and providing configurable retention and sampling policies to manage storage requirements.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metric Category</th>\n<th>Key Metrics</th>\n<th>Collection Method</th>\n<th>Storage Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Security Events</td>\n<td>Seccomp violations, capability usage, escape attempts</td>\n<td>Event-driven logging with structured data</td>\n<td>High - retain for audit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Utilization</td>\n<td>Memory, CPU, I/O consumption per sandbox</td>\n<td>Periodic sampling from cgroups</td>\n<td>Medium - time-series data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>Sandbox creation latency, operation throughput</td>\n<td>Request/response timing</td>\n<td>Medium - aggregated statistics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operational Health</td>\n<td>Process lifecycle events, error rates</td>\n<td>State change notifications</td>\n<td>Low - current status only</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Performance Metrics</strong> provide data for optimization decisions and capacity planning. Key metrics include sandbox creation and destruction latency, resource utilization efficiency, and throughput characteristics under various load patterns. These metrics enable identification of performance bottlenecks and validation that optimizations provide expected benefits.</p>\n<p>The collection system design involves implementing efficient metric aggregation that can handle high-frequency measurements, providing configurable metric retention policies that balance storage costs with analytical requirements, and ensuring that metrics collection doesn&#39;t significantly impact sandbox performance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"centralized-policy-management\">Centralized Policy Management</h4>\n<p>Production sandbox deployments often require consistent policy enforcement across multiple hosts and dynamic policy updates without service interruption. Centralized policy management provides the administrative capabilities needed for large-scale deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Distribution Architecture</strong> involves implementing a policy server that maintains canonical policy definitions, a distribution mechanism that ensures policy updates are consistently applied across all sandbox hosts, and a versioning system that enables rollback and audit trail maintenance.</p>\n<p>The policy management system must handle various policy types including seccomp filter specifications that define allowed system calls for different sandbox categories, resource limit templates that provide standard resource allocations for different workload types, and filesystem policy definitions that specify allowed file access patterns.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Policy Type</th>\n<th>Update Frequency</th>\n<th>Distribution Latency</th>\n<th>Rollback Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Seccomp Filters</td>\n<td>Low - security-driven updates</td>\n<td>Fast - security critical</td>\n<td>Immediate rollback capability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Limits</td>\n<td>Medium - capacity management</td>\n<td>Medium - operational impact</td>\n<td>Gradual rollback preferred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filesystem Policies</td>\n<td>Low - application-driven</td>\n<td>Medium - functionality impact</td>\n<td>Validation before rollback</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network Policies</td>\n<td>High - dynamic environments</td>\n<td>Fast - connectivity critical</td>\n<td>Automatic rollback on failure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Policy Validation and Testing</strong> capabilities ensure that policy updates don&#39;t break existing functionality or introduce security vulnerabilities. The validation system includes automated testing of new policies against representative workloads, staged deployment mechanisms that apply policy changes incrementally, and monitoring integration that detects policy-related issues after deployment.</p>\n<p>The implementation involves creating policy specification languages or configuration formats that can express complex security requirements, implementing policy compilation and optimization mechanisms that generate efficient runtime enforcement code, and providing policy simulation capabilities that can predict the impact of proposed policy changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"automated-incident-response\">Automated Incident Response</h4>\n<p>Large-scale sandbox deployments require automated response capabilities to handle security incidents, resource exhaustion, and operational failures without human intervention. Automated incident response systems can react to threats faster than human operators and provide consistent response policies across the entire deployment.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Incident Response</strong> involves implementing detection mechanisms for various attack patterns including container escape attempts, privilege escalation behaviors, and resource exhaustion attacks. The response system can automatically isolate affected sandbox instances, collect forensic data, and implement containment measures.</p>\n<p>The incident response architecture includes event correlation engines that can identify attack patterns across multiple sandbox instances, automated containment mechanisms that can isolate compromised sandbox instances without impacting others, and escalation policies that engage human operators when automated responses are insufficient.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Incident Type</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Automated Response</th>\n<th>Escalation Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Container Escape</td>\n<td>Namespace boundary violations</td>\n<td>Process termination and isolation</td>\n<td>Successful escape detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Cgroup limit violations</td>\n<td>Resource reallocation or throttling</td>\n<td>Sustained exhaustion patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anomalous Behavior</td>\n<td>Behavioral pattern analysis</td>\n<td>Increased monitoring and logging</td>\n<td>Patterns matching known attacks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Policy Violations</td>\n<td>Seccomp or capability violations</td>\n<td>Process termination and alerting</td>\n<td>Repeated violation attempts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Operational Incident Response</strong> handles non-security failures including host resource exhaustion, network connectivity issues, and software failures. The response system can implement failover mechanisms, automatic resource rebalancing, and service degradation strategies that maintain partial functionality during outages.</p>\n<p>The implementation strategy involves creating a rule engine that can process complex incident detection logic, implementing response action libraries that provide safe and tested incident response capabilities, and providing comprehensive logging and audit trails that enable post-incident analysis and system improvement.</p>\n<h4 id=\"integration-with-container-orchestration\">Integration with Container Orchestration</h4>\n<p>Modern deployment environments often involve container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, which provide additional management capabilities but may require integration with custom sandbox implementations. Integration strategies can leverage orchestration platform capabilities while maintaining enhanced security properties.</p>\n<p><strong>Kubernetes Integration</strong> involves implementing custom resource definitions (CRDs) that represent sandbox configurations and policies, developing operators that manage sandbox lifecycle within Kubernetes clusters, and implementing admission controllers that can enforce additional security policies beyond standard Kubernetes controls.</p>\n<p>The integration approach includes designing sandbox-aware scheduling policies that consider security requirements and resource isolation needs, implementing network policy integration that coordinates between Kubernetes network policies and sandbox network isolation, and providing monitoring integration that surfaces sandbox-specific metrics through standard Kubernetes monitoring systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Runtime Integration</strong> with container runtimes like containerd or CRI-O enables leveraging existing container management capabilities while applying enhanced security restrictions. This approach involves implementing runtime plugins or alternative runtime implementations that provide standard container runtime interfaces while using the custom sandbox security mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The integration strategy includes implementing OCI runtime specification compliance that enables integration with standard container tooling, providing image management integration that can work with existing container image workflows, and ensuring that enhanced security properties are preserved when integrating with standard container management systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The implementation of these advanced features requires careful planning and staged development to avoid introducing complexity that compromises the reliability and security of the core sandbox functionality.

technical terms and Linux-specific concepts used throughout the process sandbox implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process sandbox leverages numerous Linux-specific security primitives and kernel mechanisms that may be unfamiliar to developers new to systems programming or security engineering. This glossary provides comprehensive definitions of all technical terms, data structures, security concepts, and Linux kernel mechanisms used throughout the sandbox design and implementation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-technical-dictionary\">Mental Model: The Technical Dictionary</h3>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a <strong>technical dictionary for a specialized security domain</strong>. Just as learning a new language requires understanding vocabulary before constructing complex sentences, building a process sandbox requires mastering the terminology of Linux security primitives before orchestrating them into a complete defense system. Each term builds upon others, creating a hierarchy of concepts from basic Linux primitives to advanced security mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The terms are organized to reflect the conceptual layers of the sandbox: fundamental Linux concepts, security primitives, data structures, operational procedures, and debugging terminology. Understanding these definitions enables precise communication about sandbox behavior and systematic troubleshooting of security mechanisms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-linux-security-concepts\">Core Linux Security Concepts</h3>\n<p><strong>Process sandbox</strong>: An isolated execution environment created using operating system primitives that restricts an untrusted program&#39;s access to system resources. The sandbox combines multiple Linux security mechanisms including namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities to create defense-in-depth isolation. Unlike virtual machines which virtualize hardware, process sandboxes use kernel features to isolate processes while sharing the same kernel.</p>\n<p><strong>Defense-in-depth</strong>: A security strategy employing multiple independent layers of protection, where the failure of one security mechanism does not compromise the entire system. In the context of process sandboxing, this means combining namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and privilege dropping so that an attacker must bypass all layers to escape the sandbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace</strong>: A Linux kernel feature that provides isolated views of system resources, making processes believe they have exclusive access to resources that are actually shared. Each namespace type isolates a different category of system resource: PID namespaces isolate process trees, mount namespaces isolate filesystem views, network namespaces isolate network stacks, UTS namespaces isolate hostname and domain, user namespaces isolate user and group IDs, and cgroup namespaces isolate cgroup hierarchies.</p>\n<p><strong>Seccomp</strong>: A Linux kernel security feature that allows processes to restrict which system calls they can make through Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs. Seccomp operates at the kernel level, intercepting system calls before they execute and applying filtering rules. The most common mode, seccomp-BPF, enables complex filtering based on system call numbers, arguments, and calling process characteristics.</p>\n<p><strong>Cgroups</strong>: The Linux control groups subsystem that provides resource limiting, accounting, and isolation for collections of processes. Cgroups organize processes into hierarchical groups and apply resource controls through specialized controllers for memory, CPU time, process count, I/O bandwidth, and other resources. Both cgroups v1 and v2 are commonly deployed, with different interfaces and capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Capabilities</strong>: Linux&#39;s fine-grained privilege system that divides the traditional root privileges into distinct units that can be independently granted or revoked. Instead of running as either privileged (root) or unprivileged (user), processes can hold specific capabilities like <code>CAP_NET_ADMIN</code> for network configuration or <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> for process debugging while lacking other dangerous privileges.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filesystem-isolation-terminology\">Filesystem Isolation Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Chroot</strong>: A Linux operation that changes the apparent root directory for a process and its children, making the process unable to access files outside the new root hierarchy. While chroot provides basic filesystem isolation, it can be escaped by processes with sufficient privileges and is primarily useful as one layer of a multi-layered security approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Pivot_root</strong>: An atomic operation that swaps the root filesystem of a process, moving the old root to a specified location within the new root hierarchy. Unlike chroot, pivot_root operates on mounted filesystems and provides stronger isolation guarantees, making it the preferred mechanism for container and sandbox implementations.</p>\n<p><strong>Tmpfs</strong>: A memory-backed temporary filesystem that stores files in virtual memory instead of persistent storage. Tmpfs provides high-performance temporary storage that automatically disappears when unmounted, making it ideal for writable areas within otherwise read-only sandbox environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Mount namespace</strong>: A Linux namespace that provides each process group with an isolated view of filesystem mount points. Processes in different mount namespaces can mount and unmount filesystems independently without affecting other namespaces, enabling the creation of customized filesystem layouts for sandboxed processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Device files</strong>: Special files that provide interfaces to kernel drivers and hardware devices. Device files appear in the filesystem (typically under <code>/dev</code>) but reading or writing them communicates with kernel drivers rather than storing data on disk. Sandboxes must carefully control which device files are accessible to prevent hardware access and privilege escalation.</p>\n<p><strong>Overlay filesystem</strong>: A union filesystem that combines multiple directories into a single logical filesystem, typically with a read-only lower layer and a writable upper layer. Overlay filesystems enable efficient sandbox creation by providing each sandbox instance with a writable view of a shared read-only base system without duplicating files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-call-and-bpf-terminology\">System Call and BPF Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>BPF</strong>: Berkeley Packet Filter, originally designed for network packet filtering but extended to provide a safe in-kernel execution environment for various purposes including seccomp system call filtering. BPF programs are executed in a virtual machine within the kernel, providing security through static analysis and runtime restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Whitelist</strong>: An explicit list of allowed system calls that a sandboxed process may invoke. Whitelisting follows the security principle of default deny, where only explicitly permitted system calls are allowed and all others result in process termination or error returns. This contrasts with blacklisting approaches that attempt to enumerate dangerous system calls.</p>\n<p><strong>System call</strong>: The interface through which user-space programs request services from the kernel, such as reading files, allocating memory, or creating network connections. System calls represent the boundary between user and kernel space, making them a critical enforcement point for security policies in process sandboxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Argument-level filtering</strong>: Advanced seccomp filtering that examines not just the system call number but also the arguments passed to the system call. This enables policies like &quot;allow <code>open()</code> but only for files under <code>/tmp</code>&quot; or &quot;allow <code>socket()</code> but only for Unix domain sockets&quot; by inspecting system call parameters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"resource-management-terminology\">Resource Management Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Resource exhaustion</strong>: An attack pattern where malicious code attempts to consume excessive system resources (memory, CPU time, file descriptors, processes) to cause denial of service or trigger resource allocation failures that might lead to privilege escalation opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical filesystem</strong>: The tree-structured organization of cgroups where child cgroups inherit and are constrained by the resource limits of their parent cgroups. This hierarchy enables sophisticated resource management policies and delegation of administrative responsibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Controller</strong>: A cgroup subsystem that manages a specific type of resource, such as the memory controller for RAM usage limits, the CPU controller for processor time quotas, or the PID controller for process count restrictions. Each controller provides its own configuration files and enforcement mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Quota</strong>: A specific allocation of resource consumption permitted to a process or cgroup. Quotas can be absolute limits (maximum 64MB of memory) or relative shares (10% of CPU time) and are enforced by the kernel to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Bandwidth throttling</strong>: The technique of limiting the rate at which processes can consume resources, particularly I/O bandwidth. Throttling prevents sudden bursts of resource consumption from affecting system performance and enables predictable resource sharing among multiple sandboxes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"privilege-and-capability-terminology\">Privilege and Capability Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Effective set</strong>: The set of Linux capabilities that are currently active and can be used by a process. The effective set determines what privileged operations the process can actually perform at any given moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Permitted set</strong>: The maximum set of capabilities that a process may add to its effective set. The permitted set acts as a ceiling on the capabilities a process can activate, even if it possesses them in other sets.</p>\n<p><strong>Inheritable set</strong>: Capabilities that can be inherited by child processes when combined with the inheritable set of an executable file during <code>exec()</code>. The inheritable set provides controlled privilege transfer across process boundaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Bounding set</strong>: A system-wide or process-specific ceiling on capabilities that can be gained through any mechanism. The bounding set provides an ultimate limit on privilege escalation, even for processes that might otherwise gain capabilities through setuid executables or other means.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambient set</strong>: A simplified capability inheritance mechanism that allows unprivileged processes to retain specific capabilities across <code>exec()</code> boundaries without requiring special file attributes. Ambient capabilities automatically transfer to child processes when certain conditions are met.</p>\n<p><strong>No new privileges</strong>: A process flag set via <code>prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)</code> that prevents the process and its descendants from gaining additional privileges through any mechanism, including setuid executables, file capabilities, or SELinux transitions. This flag provides strong protection against privilege escalation attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Privilege dropping</strong>: The systematic process of removing unnecessary Linux capabilities and changing to a lower-privileged user account to minimize the attack surface if the sandboxed process is compromised. Proper privilege dropping follows a specific sequence to avoid accidentally retaining dangerous capabilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-structure-definitions\">Data Structure Definitions</h3>\n<p>The process sandbox employs numerous data structures to manage configuration, runtime state, and security mechanisms. Understanding these structures is essential for implementing and debugging the sandbox system.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Structure Name</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Key Fields</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>sandbox_config_t</code></td>\n<td>Configuration parameters for sandbox creation</td>\n<td><code>program_path</code>, <code>program_args</code>, <code>chroot_path</code>, <code>memory_limit</code>, <code>cpu_percent</code>, <code>enable_network</code>, <code>allowed_syscalls</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sandbox_state_t</code></td>\n<td>Runtime state and handles for active sandbox</td>\n<td><code>child_pid</code>, <code>namespace_fd[6]</code>, <code>cgroup_path</code>, <code>cleanup_needed</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>namespace_state_t</code></td>\n<td>File descriptors for namespace isolation</td>\n<td><code>pid_ns_fd</code>, <code>mount_ns_fd</code>, <code>net_ns_fd</code>, <code>uts_ns_fd</code>, <code>user_ns_fd</code>, <code>initialized</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fs_isolation_state_t</code></td>\n<td>Filesystem isolation configuration and state</td>\n<td><code>sandbox_root</code>, <code>old_root_path</code>, <code>mount_ns_fd</code>, <code>cleanup_needed</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cgroup_limits_t</code></td>\n<td>Resource limit specifications</td>\n<td><code>memory_limit_bytes</code>, <code>cpu_quota_us</code>, <code>cpu_period_us</code>, <code>pid_max</code>, <code>io_read_bps</code>, <code>io_write_bps</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cgroup_state_t</code></td>\n<td>Cgroup management and cleanup state</td>\n<td><code>cgroup_path</code>, <code>instance_id</code>, <code>version</code>, <code>available_controllers</code>, <code>managed_pids</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>error_context_t</code></td>\n<td>Comprehensive error reporting information</td>\n<td><code>error_code</code>, <code>severity</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>component</code>, <code>operation</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>sandbox_pid</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>health_check_result_t</code></td>\n<td>Individual health check outcome</td>\n<td><code>check_name</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>response_time_ms</code>, <code>last_check_time</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"process-lifecycle-and-state-management\">Process Lifecycle and State Management</h3>\n<p><strong>Orchestration</strong>: The coordination of multiple security components in the correct sequence to create a functional sandbox. Orchestration ensures that namespaces are created before filesystem isolation, that seccomp filters are applied before executing untrusted code, and that resource limits are configured before allowing process creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifecycle management</strong>: The systematic tracking of sandbox state from initial creation through final cleanup, including all intermediate states like configuration, execution, termination, and resource cleanup. Proper lifecycle management ensures that resources are allocated and deallocated correctly and that partial failures don&#39;t leave system resources in inconsistent states.</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination channel</strong>: Communication mechanisms between the parent supervisor process and sandboxed child processes, typically implemented using pipes, Unix domain sockets, or shared memory. Coordination channels enable status reporting, graceful shutdown signaling, and emergency termination commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource tracking</strong>: The maintenance of references to all allocated resources (file descriptors, mount points, cgroup hierarchies, temporary files) to ensure proper cleanup even in failure scenarios. Resource tracking prevents resource leaks that could accumulate over time and affect system stability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-and-validation-terminology\">Testing and Validation Terminology</h3>\n<p><strong>Unit testing</strong>: Testing individual security components in isolation to verify their specific functionality without dependencies on other components. Unit tests for sandbox components might verify that namespace creation succeeds, that seccomp filters block specific system calls, or that cgroup limits are properly enforced.</p>\n<p><strong>Integration testing</strong>: Testing the complete sandbox system with realistic workloads to verify that all security components work together correctly. Integration tests execute actual programs within sandboxes and verify that the expected isolation and resource constraints are maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Security validation</strong>: Systematic testing of attack scenarios and bypass attempts to verify that security mechanisms cannot be circumvented. Security validation includes testing known container escape techniques, privilege escalation attacks, and resource exhaustion scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Penetration testing</strong>: Comprehensive security testing that simulates real attacks against the sandbox system, including both automated tools and manual exploitation attempts. Penetration testing validates that the defense-in-depth approach successfully prevents sandbox escapes and privilege escalation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-and-diagnostics\">Debugging and Diagnostics</h3>\n<p><strong>Symptom-based diagnosis</strong>: A systematic debugging approach that maps observable failure symptoms to likely root causes and provides specific diagnostic steps. This approach is particularly valuable for complex systems like process sandboxes where failures can have multiple contributing factors.</p>\n<p><strong>System call tracing</strong>: The monitoring and recording of all system calls made by a process, typically using tools like <code>strace</code> or in-kernel tracing mechanisms. System call tracing is essential for debugging seccomp filter configurations and understanding process behavior within sandboxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Namespace inspection</strong>: The examination of namespace configurations and isolation effectiveness by comparing the view of system resources from inside and outside the sandbox. Namespace inspection typically involves examining <code>/proc</code> filesystem entries and namespace file descriptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource monitoring</strong>: The continuous or periodic measurement of resource consumption within cgroups to verify that resource limits are properly configured and enforced. Resource monitoring helps diagnose performance issues and validate resource limit effectiveness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-security-features\">Advanced Security Features</h3>\n<p><strong>LSM</strong>: Linux Security Module, a framework that enables additional mandatory access control systems to be integrated into the kernel. LSMs like SELinux, AppArmor, and Smack provide policy-based access controls that complement the capability and namespace-based protections of process sandboxes.</p>\n<p><strong>Landlock</strong>: A modern Linux Security Module that enables unprivileged processes to create fine-grained security sandboxes for themselves and their children. Landlock provides programmable access control for filesystem operations and integrates well with existing sandbox mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>eBPF</strong>: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter, a powerful in-kernel programming framework that enables safe execution of user-defined programs within the kernel. eBPF can be used for advanced security monitoring, custom system call filtering, and performance monitoring of sandboxed processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Seccomp notify</strong>: A modern seccomp feature that allows user-space programs to handle filtered system calls instead of simply allowing or denying them. Seccomp notify enables sophisticated policies like &quot;allow file access but log all operations&quot; or &quot;allow network access but restrict destinations.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-operational-terms\">Performance and Operational Terms</h3>\n<p><strong>Template-based optimization</strong>: A performance enhancement technique that pre-creates sandbox environments and reuses them for multiple executions. Templates reduce sandbox creation overhead by preparing common configurations and filesystem layouts in advance.</p>\n<p><strong>Process pool</strong>: A resource management technique that maintains a collection of pre-configured processes ready for immediate task assignment. Process pools reduce the latency of sandbox creation by avoiding the overhead of repeated process creation and configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory deduplication</strong>: An optimization technique that identifies and shares identical memory pages across multiple processes. In sandbox contexts, memory deduplication can significantly reduce memory overhead when running many similar sandbox instances.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics collection</strong>: The systematic gathering of operational and security data from sandbox instances for monitoring, alerting, and analysis purposes. Metrics collection typically includes resource usage statistics, security events, performance measurements, and operational health indicators.</p>\n<h3 id=\"error-handling-and-recovery\">Error Handling and Recovery</h3>\n<p><strong>Cleanup ordering</strong>: The specific sequence in which sandbox resources must be deallocated to handle dependencies correctly. For example, processes must be terminated before cgroups can be removed, and mount points must be unmounted before namespaces can be cleaned up.</p>\n<p><strong>Health monitoring</strong>: Continuous observation of sandbox operational status to detect failures, resource exhaustion, security violations, or other problems that require intervention. Health monitoring enables proactive response to issues before they cause complete sandbox failures.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated recovery</strong>: Systematic response to detected failures without requiring human intervention. Automated recovery might include restarting failed processes, recreating corrupted resources, or falling back to simpler configurations when advanced features fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Escalation</strong>: The process of triggering human attention when automated responses are insufficient to handle detected problems. Escalation policies define when and how operational staff should be notified of sandbox issues that require manual intervention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The process sandbox implementation relies on numerous Linux-specific system calls, kernel interfaces, and user-space utilities. Understanding how to correctly invoke these mechanisms and handle their error conditions is essential for building robust sandbox systems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"essential-system-calls-and-library-functions\">Essential System Calls and Library Functions</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Function/System Call</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Critical Parameters</th>\n<th>Common Pitfalls</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>clone()</code></td>\n<td>Create child process with namespace isolation</td>\n<td><code>CLONE_NEWPID</code>, <code>CLONE_NEWMNT</code>, <code>CLONE_NEWNET</code>, <code>CLONE_NEWUTS</code>, <code>CLONE_NEWUSER</code></td>\n<td>Forgetting <code>SIGCHLD</code> flag, insufficient privileges for user namespaces</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>unshare()</code></td>\n<td>Move calling process to new namespaces</td>\n<td>Namespace flags, timing relative to other operations</td>\n<td>Cannot unshare PID namespace from running process</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>mount()</code></td>\n<td>Mount filesystems and bind mounts</td>\n<td><code>MS_BIND</code>, <code>MS_RDONLY</code>, <code>MS_NOSUID</code>, <code>MS_NODEV</code>, <code>MS_NOEXEC</code></td>\n<td>Mount propagation, order dependencies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pivot_root()</code></td>\n<td>Atomically change root filesystem</td>\n<td>Old and new root paths, mount point requirements</td>\n<td>Requires mounted filesystems, complex setup sequence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>prctl()</code></td>\n<td>Set process attributes and security flags</td>\n<td><code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code>, <code>PR_SET_SECCOMP</code>, capability operations</td>\n<td>Operation ordering, irreversible changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>seccomp()</code></td>\n<td>Install BPF system call filters</td>\n<td>Filter programs, operation modes, flag combinations</td>\n<td>Architecture-specific syscall numbers, missing required calls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"file-structure-and-organization\">File Structure and Organization</h4>\n<p>The sandbox implementation should be organized into clearly separated modules that handle specific security mechanisms and can be tested independently:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>sandbox/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── sandbox-runner/\n│       └── main.c                    #

leverages multiple Linux security primitives (namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, capabilities) to create isolated execution environments for untrusted code. The key architectural challenge is orchestrating these security mechanisms in the correct order while maintaining usability and performance.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides foundational context for all milestones (1-5)\n\nThe challenge of safely executing untrusted code represents one of the most fundamental problems in computer security. Whether running user-submitted scripts, processing uploaded files, or executing third-party plugins, systems must balance functionality with security. Traditional approaches to this problem have significant limitations that make them unsuitable for many modern use cases.\n\n### Mental Model: The High Security Prison\n\nThink of a process sandbox like a **high-security prison designed to contain dangerous inmates**. Just as a maximum-security facility uses multiple layers of containment—perimeter walls, guard towers, internal barriers, restricted movement, limited resources, and constant monitoring—a robust process sandbox must employ multiple security mechanisms that work together to prevent escape.\n\nIn this analogy, the **untrusted code is the dangerous prisoner** who cannot be trusted to follow rules and will actively attempt to break out. A single security measure, like a simple fence, is insufficient because prisoners are clever and motivated. They might dig tunnels (exploit filesystem paths), bribe guards (exploit setuid binaries), impersonate staff (privilege escalation), or exhaust prison resources (denial of service attacks).\n\nThe **defense-in-depth approach** mirrors how real prisons operate. Even if an inmate bypasses one security layer—say, they pick a cell lock—they still face additional barriers: locked corridor doors, guard checkpoints, perimeter walls, and external monitoring. Each layer has a different mechanism of action: physical barriers, human oversight, technological detection, and resource constraints.\n\nSimilarly, our process sandbox employs multiple complementary security primitives:\n\n- **Namespaces** act like the prison's **separate wings and buildings**, creating isolated views where the prisoner believes they're in a different facility entirely\n- **Filesystem isolation** serves as **restricted movement areas**, limiting which locations the prisoner can access\n- **Seccomp filtering** functions like **strict rule enforcement**, blocking specific dangerous actions entirely\n- **Cgroups** operate as **resource rationing**, preventing any single prisoner from consuming all available food, water, or electricity\n- **Capability dropping** resembles **privilege revocation**, removing special permissions that could enable escape or harm\n\nThe key insight is that **security layers must be independent and non-bypassable**. If the prisoner finds a way around one restriction, the others still contain them. This redundancy is not wasteful—it's essential for high-assurance security.\n\n![Defense in Depth Security Layers](./diagrams/security-layers.svg)\n\n### Existing Sandboxing Approaches\n\nBefore designing our process sandbox, we must understand existing approaches and their limitations. Each represents different trade-offs between security, performance, and complexity.\n\n| Approach | Security Level | Performance Overhead | Complexity | Resource Usage | Typical Use Cases |\n|----------|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Virtual Machines | Very High | High (10-30%) | High | High (GB RAM) | Cloud isolation, OS-level sandboxing |\n| System Containers | High | Medium (5-15%) | Medium | Medium (MB RAM) | Application packaging, microservices |\n| Language Sandboxes | Medium | Low (1-5%) | Low | Low (KB RAM) | Browser scripts, embedded scripting |\n| Process Isolation | High | Low (1-3%) | Medium | Low (KB RAM) | Plugin systems, code execution services |\n\n#### Virtual Machines\n\nVirtual machines provide the **strongest isolation** by running untrusted code in a completely separate operating system instance. The hypervisor creates hardware-level isolation between the guest and host systems. Even if untrusted code achieves complete compromise of the guest OS, it remains contained within the virtual machine boundaries.\n\nHowever, VMs have significant drawbacks for many use cases. They require **substantial resource overhead**—typically hundreds of megabytes of RAM and multiple CPU seconds for startup. This makes them impractical for short-lived tasks or high-frequency operations. Additionally, VM management introduces operational complexity around disk images, network configuration, and snapshot management.\n\nVMs excel for **long-running workloads** where the startup cost can be amortized, such as cloud computing instances or development environments. They're less suitable for rapid code execution services or embedded sandboxing within applications.\n\n#### System Containers\n\nTechnologies like Docker provide **OS-level virtualization** using Linux namespaces and cgroups. Containers share the host kernel but present isolated userspace environments. This approach offers better performance than VMs while maintaining strong isolation boundaries.\n\nContainer orchestration platforms like Kubernetes have made containers the standard for **application deployment and scaling**. However, containers have limitations for untrusted code execution. The shared kernel creates potential attack surfaces through system call interfaces. Container escape vulnerabilities, while rare, can provide full host system access.\n\nContainers work well for **packaging and isolating trusted applications** but may not provide sufficient security guarantees for truly untrusted code. They also carry overhead from container runtime systems and image management.\n\n#### Language Sandboxes\n\nMany programming languages provide built-in sandboxing mechanisms. JavaScript's same-origin policy, Java's security manager, and Python's restricted execution modes attempt to limit code capabilities at the language runtime level.\n\nLanguage sandboxes offer **excellent performance** since they operate within the same process as the host application. They enable fine-grained control over API access and can sandbox code with minimal overhead.\n\nHowever, language sandboxes have fundamental limitations. They depend entirely on the **correctness of the runtime implementation**. Bugs in the interpreter or compiler can create bypass opportunities. Additionally, they typically cannot prevent resource exhaustion attacks or protect against vulnerabilities in native libraries.\n\nLanguage sandboxes work well for **limited scripting scenarios** where performance is critical and the threat model is moderate, such as browser-based applications or configuration scripting.\n\n#### Process Isolation\n\nProcess-level sandboxing uses operating system primitives to isolate untrusted code within separate processes. This approach leverages the OS kernel's built-in security boundaries while avoiding the overhead of full virtualization.\n\nProcess sandboxes can achieve **strong security guarantees** by combining multiple OS-level isolation mechanisms. They provide better performance than VMs while offering more robust security than language sandboxes. The kernel enforces isolation boundaries, making them less dependent on userspace code correctness.\n\nThe main challenge with process sandboxes is **complexity of configuration**. Properly configuring multiple security mechanisms requires deep understanding of OS internals and careful attention to interaction effects between different isolation layers.\n\n> **Key Insight**: No single sandboxing approach is universally superior. The choice depends on specific requirements around security assurance, performance constraints, operational complexity, and resource availability. Process-level sandboxing occupies a sweet spot for many applications requiring strong security with reasonable performance.\n\n### Linux Security Primitives Overview\n\nLinux provides several powerful security primitives that can be combined to create robust process sandboxes. Each primitive addresses different aspects of the isolation problem and operates through different kernel mechanisms.\n\n#### Namespaces: Resource View Isolation\n\nLinux **namespaces** provide isolated views of global system resources. When a process runs in a namespace, it sees a filtered or virtualized view of system state that can be completely different from the host system's view.\n\nThink of namespaces as **alternate reality generators**. Just as science fiction depicts parallel universes where the same location contains different buildings and inhabitants, namespaces present alternative views where the same system appears to contain different processes, files, or network interfaces.\n\n| Namespace Type | Isolates | Security Benefit | Example Use |\n|----------------|----------|------------------|-------------|\n| PID | Process IDs and process tree | Prevents process enumeration and signaling | Sandboxed process sees itself as PID 1 |\n| Mount | Filesystem mount points | Restricts filesystem access | Private /tmp directory |\n| Network | Network interfaces and routing | Blocks network access | Isolated network stack |\n| UTS | Hostname and domain name | Prevents hostname disclosure | Custom hostname inside sandbox |\n| User | User and group IDs | Maps privileged IDs to unprivileged | Root inside maps to nobody outside |\n| IPC | System V IPC objects | Isolates shared memory and semaphores | Private message queues |\n\nNamespaces are created using the `clone()` system call with special flags, or applied to existing processes with `unshare()`. The kernel maintains separate namespace instances and translates resource references based on the calling process's namespace membership.\n\nThe **security value** of namespaces comes from their ability to make system resources invisible or inaccessible to sandboxed processes. A process in a PID namespace cannot signal or inspect processes outside its namespace, even if it somehow learns their PIDs.\n\n#### Seccomp: System Call Filtering\n\nThe **seccomp** (secure computing) mechanism allows processes to restrict which system calls they can make. Seccomp-BPF extends this with Berkeley Packet Filter programs that can examine system call arguments and make fine-grained filtering decisions.\n\nThink of seccomp as a **strict gatekeeper** at the kernel boundary. Every time the sandboxed process wants to make a system call—the equivalent of requesting a service from the kernel—the seccomp filter examines the request. Like a bouncer at an exclusive club, it can allow entry, deny access, or even call security (kill the process) if the request is inappropriate.\n\n| Filter Action | Effect | When to Use |\n|---------------|--------|-------------|\n| ALLOW | Permit system call | Safe operations like read/write |\n| ERRNO | Return error code | Operations that should fail gracefully |\n| TRAP | Send signal to process | Debugging or custom handling |\n| KILL | Terminate process immediately | Dangerous operations like ptrace |\n\nSeccomp filters are **immutable once installed** and inherited by child processes. This prevents sandboxed code from removing its own restrictions. The BPF program runs in kernel space with minimal overhead, making filtering very efficient.\n\nThe **security benefit** is preventing sandboxed processes from using dangerous system calls that could enable privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system manipulation. Even if other isolation layers are bypassed, seccomp provides a kernel-enforced backstop.\n\n#### Cgroups: Resource Limiting\n\n**Control groups (cgroups)** provide hierarchical resource management and accounting. They allow setting limits on CPU time, memory usage, I/O bandwidth, and process counts for groups of processes.\n\nThink of cgroups as a **resource allocation department** in a large organization. Just as departments get budget allocations for different expense categories—travel, equipment, personnel—cgroups assign resource quotas to process groups. When a group tries to exceed its allocation, the system either throttles the usage or denies the request entirely.\n\n| Controller | Limits | Enforcement Mechanism | Security Benefit |\n|------------|--------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Memory | RAM and swap usage | OOM kill or throttling | Prevents memory exhaustion |\n| CPU | Processing time and cycles | Scheduling priority reduction | Limits CPU consumption |\n| PID | Maximum process count | Fork failures | Prevents fork bombs |\n| I/O | Disk read/write bandwidth | Request queuing | Controls storage impact |\n\nCgroups organize processes into a **hierarchy** where resource limits are inherited and can be subdivided. The kernel enforces limits automatically—processes cannot bypass or negotiate around their assigned quotas.\n\nThe **security value** comes from preventing resource exhaustion attacks. Without cgroups, a sandboxed process could consume all available memory, CPU time, or disk bandwidth, creating denial-of-service conditions that affect the entire host system.\n\n#### Capabilities: Privilege Subdivision\n\nTraditional Unix systems have a binary privilege model: processes run either as root (with all privileges) or as regular users (with limited privileges). Linux **capabilities** subdivide root privileges into discrete units that can be granted independently.\n\nThink of capabilities as **security clearance levels** in a classified environment. Instead of having just \"classified\" and \"unclassified\" access, organizations have specific clearances like \"secret communications,\" \"top secret weapons,\" and \"compartmentalized intelligence.\" Each clearance grants access to specific resources without providing universal access.\n\n| Capability | Privilege Granted | Typical Use | Security Risk if Granted |\n|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------|\n| CAP_NET_RAW | Raw network socket access | Network diagnostics | Network sniffing, spoofing |\n| CAP_SYS_ADMIN | System administration | Mount operations | Full system compromise |\n| CAP_SETUID | Change user ID | Process privilege changes | Privilege escalation |\n| CAP_SYS_PTRACE | Process tracing and debugging | Debuggers, profilers | Process memory access |\n\nProcesses can **drop capabilities** permanently, preventing future privilege escalation even if vulnerabilities are exploited. The `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag ensures that execve() cannot grant additional privileges.\n\nThe **security benefit** is implementing the principle of least privilege. Sandboxed processes can run with minimal capabilities, reducing the impact of successful exploits. Even if an attacker achieves code execution, they inherit the restricted capability set.\n\n> **Architecture Principle**: These four primitives are complementary, not redundant. Namespaces control *what* processes can see, seccomp controls *what* they can do, cgroups control *how much* they can consume, and capabilities control *how privileged* their actions can be. Effective sandboxing requires orchestrating all four mechanisms in the correct sequence with appropriate configurations.\n\n**Common Integration Challenges:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ordering Dependencies**\nThe sequence of applying security mechanisms matters critically. For example, capabilities must be configured before entering certain namespaces, and seccomp filters must be installed before dropping the privileges needed to configure them. Incorrect ordering can result in partially-configured sandboxes or setup failures.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Privilege Requirements**\nMany security operations require elevated privileges to configure but should not grant those privileges to the sandboxed process. This creates a bootstrapping problem where the sandbox setup process needs careful privilege management to avoid granting unnecessary capabilities to the final sandboxed environment.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Cleanup**\nFailed sandbox creation can leave orphaned namespaces, cgroup entries, or other kernel resources. Proper error handling must ensure cleanup of partially-configured sandboxes to prevent resource leaks and security inconsistencies.\n\nThe next sections will explore how to architect a system that properly orchestrates these primitives while avoiding these common pitfalls.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides practical guidance for understanding and working with Linux security primitives in preparation for building the process sandbox.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Approach | Advanced Approach |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|\n| System Calls | Direct syscalls with libc wrappers | Raw syscalls with custom wrappers |\n| Configuration | Command-line flags and environment variables | Structured config files (JSON/YAML) |\n| Error Handling | Simple perror() and exit() | Structured error codes with cleanup |\n| Logging | Printf to stderr | Structured logging with levels |\n| Testing | Manual verification scripts | Automated unit and integration tests |\n\n#### Development Environment Setup\n\nBefore implementing the sandbox, ensure your development environment supports the required kernel features:\n\n```c\n// Feature detection utility - save as check_features.c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <sys/syscall.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Check namespace support\n    if (syscall(SYS_unshare, 0) == -1 && errno != EINVAL) {\n        printf(\"ERROR: Namespace support not available\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    // Check seccomp support\n    if (syscall(SYS_seccomp, 0, 0, NULL) == -1 && errno != EINVAL) {\n        printf(\"ERROR: Seccomp support not available\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    \n    // Check cgroups v2 mount\n    if (access(\"/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers\", R_OK) != 0) {\n        printf(\"WARNING: Cgroups v2 not available, falling back to v1\\n\");\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"All required features available\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nCompile and run: `gcc -o check_features check_features.c && ./check_features`\n\n#### Essential Header Files and Includes\n\n```c\n// sandbox_common.h - Common includes and definitions\n#ifndef SANDBOX_COMMON_H\n#define SANDBOX_COMMON_H\n\n#define _GNU_SOURCE\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <sys/wait.h>\n#include <sys/mount.h>\n#include <sys/prctl.h>\n#include <sys/capability.h>\n#include <sys/syscall.h>\n#include <linux/seccomp.h>\n#include <linux/filter.h>\n#include <linux/sched.h>\n#include <sched.h>\n#include <signal.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Sandbox configuration structure\ntypedef struct {\n    char *program_path;

The skeleton code provides the structure you'll fill in, and the utility functions handle common operations you'll need throughout the implementation.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides foundational context for all milestones (1-5)\n\nThe success of any process sandbox depends on clearly defining what it must accomplish, what performance characteristics it should maintain, and equally importantly, what threats and use cases it explicitly does not address. This section establishes the boundaries and expectations for our defense-in-depth process sandbox, ensuring that both implementers and users understand the system's capabilities and limitations.\n\n**Mental Model: The Security Contract**\n\nThink of these goals as a security contract between the sandbox system and its users. Just as a legal contract specifies what services will be provided, under what conditions, and what circumstances void the agreement, our goals define the security guarantees we provide, the performance characteristics users can expect, and the attack scenarios that fall outside our protection model. This contract helps users make informed decisions about when and how to deploy the sandbox, while giving implementers clear success criteria for each milestone.\n\nThe process sandbox operates under the principle of **defense-in-depth**, where multiple independent security mechanisms work together to contain untrusted code. Each layer provides specific security guarantees, and the combination of all layers creates a robust isolation environment that can withstand various attack vectors.\n\n### Functional Goals\n\nThe functional goals define the core security and usability requirements that the process sandbox must satisfy. These goals directly map to the security mechanisms implemented across our five milestones and establish the fundamental capabilities that users can rely upon.\n\n**Process Isolation and Resource Visibility Control**\n\nThe sandbox must create complete isolation of the sandboxed process's view of system resources, making it appear as if the process is running on a dedicated system while actually sharing hardware with the host. This isolation prevents untrusted code from discovering information about other processes, users, network configuration, or system topology that could be used for reconnaissance or lateral movement.\n\n| Isolation Type | Mechanism | Security Guarantee | Verification Method |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Process Tree | PID namespace | Sandboxed process sees itself as PID 1 with no parent processes visible | Check `/proc` entries from inside sandbox |\n| Hostname/Domain | UTS namespace | Sandboxed process cannot determine real hostname or domain information | Compare `hostname` output inside vs outside |\n| Network Stack | Network namespace | Sandboxed process has no network interfaces except loopback | Check `ip addr` and `netstat` output |\n| Filesystem View | Mount namespace + chroot | Sandboxed process sees only minimal filesystem with no host paths | Verify host directories are inaccessible |\n| User/Group IDs | User namespace | Sandboxed process maps to unprivileged user on host system | Check effective UID/GID mappings |\n\nThis isolation must be complete and tamper-proof. The sandboxed process should have no mechanism to discover that it's running in a container or to gather information about the host system's configuration, running processes, or network topology.\n\n**Filesystem Security and Access Control**\n\nThe sandbox must provide a secure filesystem environment that prevents both data exfiltration and system compromise. This involves creating a minimal root filesystem with only essential binaries and libraries, while ensuring that the sandboxed process cannot access any host filesystem paths or sensitive system directories.\n\nThe filesystem isolation must prevent common container escape techniques such as:\n- Traversing symbolic links that point outside the sandbox\n- Accessing host filesystem through `/proc/*/root` or similar pseudo-filesystem entries\n- Mounting host filesystems using privileged system calls\n- Writing to system directories that could affect host system behavior\n\n| Filesystem Component | Configuration | Security Purpose | Implementation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Root Directory | Read-only minimal filesystem | Prevents tampering with system binaries | chroot or pivot_root |\n| Writable Areas | tmpfs mounts at `/tmp`, `/var/tmp` | Provides scratch space without host persistence | Memory-backed filesystems |\n| Device Access | Restricted `/dev` with minimal device nodes | Prevents access to hardware devices | Bind mount with filtered device list |\n| Process Info | Read-only `/proc` mount | Allows process introspection within namespace | Mount with `hidepid` option |\n| System Config | No access to `/etc`, `/sys`, `/boot` | Prevents system configuration discovery | Excluded from chroot environment |\n\n**System Call Restriction and Argument Filtering**\n\nThe sandbox must implement comprehensive system call filtering using seccomp-BPF to prevent dangerous operations while allowing legitimate computation. This filtering operates at two levels: blocking entire classes of system calls that should never be needed by sandboxed code, and filtering arguments of allowed system calls to prevent abuse.\n\nThe system call whitelist must be minimal but sufficient for basic computation, file I/O within the sandbox, and memory management. The filter must be architecture-aware, handling differences in system call numbers between x86_64, ARM, and other platforms.\n\n| System Call Category | Policy | Rationale | Examples |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Process Management | Block dangerous calls | Prevent privilege escalation and system interference | `ptrace`, `clone` with namespace flags, `unshare` |\n| Filesystem | Allow within sandbox only | Enable legitimate I/O while preventing host access | Allow `open`/`read`/`write`, block `mount`/`umount` |\n| Network | Block all network calls | Prevent network-based attacks and data exfiltration | Block `socket`, `connect`, `bind`, `sendto` |\n| Kernel Interface | Block kernel modification | Prevent system configuration changes | Block `sysctl`, `kexec_load`, `init_module` |\n| Signal Handling | Allow basic signals only | Enable process control without system interference | Allow `sigaction` for SIGTERM/SIGINT, block `kill` with system PIDs |\n\n**Resource Consumption Control**\n\nThe sandbox must enforce strict resource limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks against the host system. These limits must be configurable but have safe defaults that prevent runaway processes from consuming all available system resources.\n\n| Resource Type | Limit Mechanism | Default Limit | Enforcement Behavior |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Memory | cgroups memory controller | 64MB resident set size | Kill process group when limit exceeded |\n| CPU Time | cgroups CPU controller | 10% of one CPU core | Throttle process when quota exceeded |\n| Process Count | cgroups PID controller | 32 total processes | Block `fork`/`clone` when limit reached |\n| File Descriptors | `setrlimit` RLIMIT_NOFILE | 64 open files | Return EMFILE when limit reached |\n| Disk I/O | cgroups I/O controller | 10MB/s read/write bandwidth | Throttle I/O operations when limit exceeded |\n| Disk Space | Filesystem quotas on tmpfs | 16MB total scratch space | Return ENOSPC when quota exhausted |\n\n**Privilege Minimization**\n\nThe sandbox must operate with the minimum privileges necessary for its functionality, dropping all Linux capabilities that are not essential for basic process execution. This implements the principle of least privilege to reduce the attack surface if other security mechanisms are bypassed.\n\nThe capability dropping must occur after all privileged setup operations are complete but before executing the untrusted code. The process must also set the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag to prevent privilege escalation through setuid binaries or other mechanisms.\n\n| Capability Category | Action | Rationale |\n|---|---|---|\n| All capabilities | Drop from effective, permitted, inheritable sets | Minimal privilege principle |\n| Bounding set | Clear all capabilities | Prevent capability inheritance |\n| Ambient set | Clear all capabilities | Prevent ambient capability grants |\n| No-new-privs flag | Set to 1 | Block future privilege escalation |\n\n### Non-Functional Goals\n\nThe non-functional goals establish performance, resource usage, and operational requirements that ensure the sandbox is practical for real-world deployment. These goals balance security with usability, ensuring that the sandbox's security mechanisms don't create unacceptable overhead or operational complexity.\n\n**Performance and Latency Requirements**\n\nThe sandbox creation and initialization process must complete quickly enough to support interactive use cases and batch processing workflows. While perfect performance is not required for a learning-focused implementation, the overhead should be reasonable for typical workloads.\n\n| Performance Metric | Target | Measurement Method |\n|---|---|---|\n| Sandbox Creation Time | Under 100ms for basic setup | Time from `create_sandbox()` call to process exec |\n| Memory Overhead | Under 8MB additional RSS | Compare memory usage of sandboxed vs unsandboxed process |\n| CPU Overhead | Under 5% additional CPU time | Compare execution time of identical workloads |\n| I/O Overhead | Under 20% additional latency | Compare file read/write performance |\n| System Call Overhead | Under 10μs per filtered call | Measure seccomp filter evaluation time |\n\nThe performance targets recognize that security mechanisms inherently add overhead, but aim to keep this overhead low enough that the sandbox can be used for development, testing, and lightweight production workloads.\n\n**Resource Usage and Scalability**\n\nThe sandbox system itself must use system resources efficiently, allowing multiple sandbox instances to run concurrently on the same host without excessive resource consumption. This enables use cases such as parallel test execution, multi-tenant development environments, and batch job processing.\n\n| Resource | Host Impact | Scaling Target |\n|---|---|---|\n| Memory per Sandbox | Under 16MB host memory overhead | Support 64 concurrent sandboxes on 4GB system |\n| File Descriptors | Under 8 FDs per sandbox | Work within typical system limits |\n| cgroup Hierarchy | One cgroup per sandbox | Clean up cgroups on sandbox termination |\n| Namespace Resources | Namespace FDs held only during setup | Release namespace references after setup |\n\n**Operational Simplicity**\n\nThe sandbox must be deployable and manageable with minimal operational complexity. This includes clear configuration options, comprehensive error reporting, and automatic cleanup of system resources to prevent resource leaks.\n\n| Operational Aspect | Requirement | Implementation |\n|---|---|---|\n| Configuration | Single configuration struct | `sandbox_config_t` with sensible defaults |\n| Error Reporting | Clear error messages with context | Specific error codes and descriptive messages |\n| Resource Cleanup | Automatic cleanup on exit | `cleanup_sandbox()` function handles all resources |\n| Privilege Requirements | Clear documentation of root requirements | `check_root_privileges()` validation function |\n| Logging | Structured logging for troubleshooting | Log all security mechanism setup steps |\n\n**Compatibility and Portability**\n\nThe sandbox must work across common Linux distributions and kernel versions, while clearly documenting any specific requirements or limitations. This ensures that learners can complete the project on their development systems and that the resulting code is broadly applicable.\n\n| Compatibility Aspect | Requirement | Verification |\n|---|---|---|\n| Kernel Version | Linux 4.8+ (for modern cgroups and seccomp features) | Runtime kernel version check |\n| Distribution | Ubuntu 18.04+, RHEL 8+, Debian 10+ | Test on multiple distributions |\n| Architecture | x86_64 primary, ARM64 secondary | Architecture-specific seccomp filter generation |\n| Container Environment | Work inside Docker/Podman with privileged mode | Document container deployment requirements |\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nThe explicit non-goals clearly define the security threats and use cases that fall outside the scope of this process sandbox. These limitations help set realistic expectations and prevent misuse of the sandbox in scenarios where it cannot provide adequate protection.\n\n**Hardware and Side-Channel Attacks**\n\nThis process sandbox does not protect against attacks that exploit hardware vulnerabilities or side-channel information leakage. Such attacks require fundamentally different isolation mechanisms that operate below the operating system level.\n\n| Attack Class | Why Not Protected | Alternative Solutions |\n|---|---|---|\n| Spectre/Meltdown | Requires hardware-level isolation | Virtual machines with microcode updates |\n| Cache Timing Attacks | Processes share CPU caches | Hardware partitioning or trusted execution environments |\n| Power Analysis | Process sandbox cannot control hardware power states | Specialized secure hardware |\n| Memory Layout Discovery | ASLR bypass techniques may still work within sandbox | Additional memory protection mechanisms |\n\n**Kernel Privilege Escalation**\n\nThe sandbox cannot protect against vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel itself. If untrusted code can exploit a kernel vulnerability to gain privileged access, the sandbox's user-space isolation mechanisms can be bypassed.\n\n| Vulnerability Class | Limitation | Risk Mitigation |\n|---|---|---|\n| Kernel Buffer Overflows | System call filtering cannot prevent all kernel bugs | Keep kernel updated, use kernel hardening |\n| Use-After-Free in Kernel | Seccomp cannot prevent kernel memory corruption | Enable KASAN/KFENCE in development |\n| Race Conditions in Kernel | Namespace isolation doesn't fix kernel races | Kernel fuzzing and static analysis |\n| Device Driver Vulnerabilities | Hardware access restrictions don't cover all drivers | Minimize loaded kernel modules |\n\n> **Critical Limitation: Kernel Trust Boundary**\n> \n> The process sandbox operates entirely in user space and relies on the Linux kernel to enforce all security policies. Any vulnerability that allows untrusted code to execute with kernel privileges can completely bypass sandbox protections. This is an inherent limitation of operating system-level sandboxing.\n\n**Cryptographic and Protocol Security**\n\nThe sandbox does not provide any cryptographic protections or secure communication channels. It focuses purely on process isolation and resource control, leaving encryption and authentication to higher-level application protocols.\n\n| Security Function | Not Provided | Reason |\n|---|---|---|\n| Data Encryption | No encryption of sandbox filesystem or memory | Not a process isolation concern |\n| Authentication | No user authentication or access control | Assumes trusted operator deploying sandbox |\n| Secure Communication | No encrypted channels between host and sandbox | Communication design left to applications |\n| Key Management | No secure storage of cryptographic keys | Outside scope of process isolation |\n\n**High-Performance Computing Workloads**\n\nThe sandbox is designed for security rather than performance, and its resource restrictions and system call filtering make it unsuitable for high-performance computing applications that require direct hardware access or specialized system interfaces.\n\n| HPC Requirement | Sandbox Limitation | Impact |\n|---|---|---|\n| RDMA/InfiniBand Access | Network namespace blocks specialized networking | Cannot use high-performance interconnects |\n| GPU Compute | Device restrictions prevent GPU access | No CUDA or OpenCL computation |\n| Shared Memory IPC | IPC namespace isolation blocks shared memory | Cannot use MPI or similar frameworks |\n| Real-Time Scheduling | cgroups CPU limits interfere with RT scheduling | Cannot guarantee real-time deadlines |\n\n**Multi-Process Applications**\n\nWhile the sandbox can contain multiple processes within a single process tree, it is not designed for complex multi-process applications that require sophisticated inter-process communication or coordination across multiple sandbox instances.\n\n| Application Pattern | Limitation | Alternative Approach |\n|---|---|---|\n| Distributed Systems | Cannot coordinate across multiple sandbox instances | Use container orchestration platforms |\n| Database Systems | Shared memory and file locking restrictions | Deploy in full virtual machines |\n| Multi-Tenant Services | Single sandbox per tenant model only | Use application-level isolation |\n| Legacy Applications | May require system services not available in sandbox | Refactor for sandboxed environment |\n\n**Production-Grade Operational Features**\n\nThis sandbox implementation focuses on demonstrating security concepts rather than providing enterprise-ready operational features. Production deployments would require additional monitoring, management, and integration capabilities.\n\n| Operational Feature | Not Included | Production Alternative |\n|---|---|---|\n| Metrics and Monitoring | Basic error reporting only | Use container runtime with monitoring |\n| Log Aggregation | No centralized logging | Deploy with logging infrastructure |\n| Health Checks | No automated health monitoring | Implement application-specific health checks |\n| Auto-Scaling | No dynamic resource adjustment | Use orchestration platform auto-scaling |\n| Backup/Recovery | No state persistence mechanisms | Design stateless applications |\n\n> **Design Philosophy: Education Over Production**\n> \n> This process sandbox prioritizes educational value and conceptual clarity over production-readiness. The goal is to demonstrate how Linux security primitives work together to create isolation, not to build a production container runtime. Learners should understand these limitations when considering real-world applications.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis subsection provides practical guidance for implementing the goals and requirements defined above, with specific technology recommendations and code structure to support all project milestones.\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Implementation Hints**\n\n- Use `clone()` system call with `CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWNET | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWUSER` flags for namespace creation\n- Use `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0)` to prevent privilege escalation\n- Use `capset()` system call to drop Linux capabilities after capability header setup\n- Use `mount()` system call for filesystem operations, particularly `mount(\"none\", \"/proc\", \"proc\", MS_RDONLY, NULL)` for read-only proc\n- Use `chroot()` or `pivot_root()` for filesystem root changes - chroot is simpler but pivot_root is more secure\n- Use `/sys/fs/cgroup` filesystem for cgroup manipulation, creating directories and writing limit values to control files\n- Include error checking after every system call - most sandbox failures come from insufficient error handling\n\n**H. Milestone Checkpoints**\n\nAfter implementing each milestone, verify functionality with these concrete tests:\n\n| Milestone | Verification Command | Expected Behavior | Failure Symptoms |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 (Namespaces) | `./sandbox --program=/bin/ps aux` | Process list shows only sandbox processes, PID 1 is the target program | See host processes or incorrect PID numbering |\n| 2 (Filesystem) | `./sandbox --program=/bin/ls /` | Only minimal filesystem visible, no host directories | Can see `/home`, `/root`, or other host paths |\n| 3 (Seccomp) | `./sandbox --program=/bin/strace -e network /bin/echo` | Network system calls blocked, process killed on violation | Network calls succeed or process hangs |\n| 4 (Cgroups) | Run memory-intensive program with 64MB limit | Process killed when exceeding memory limit | Process consumes unlimited memory |\n| 5 (Capabilities) | `./sandbox --program=/bin/mount -t tmpfs none /tmp` | Mount operation fails due to dropped capabilities | Mount succeeds (capabilities not properly dropped) |\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides architectural foundation for all milestones (1-5)\n\nThe process sandbox architecture follows a **defense-in-depth** strategy, orchestrating multiple Linux security primitives to create layered isolation around untrusted code. Think of this system as a high-security facility with multiple independent checkpoints: even if one security mechanism fails, the others continue to protect the host system. Each security layer operates independently but must be carefully coordinated to avoid conflicts and ensure proper initialization order.\n\n![System Architecture Overview](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\nThe architecture centers around a **Sandbox Orchestrator** that coordinates five specialized security components. This orchestrator acts as the conductor of a security orchestra, ensuring each component plays its part at precisely the right moment in the sandbox creation sequence. The orchestrator maintains both configuration state (what the sandbox should look like) and runtime state (tracking active resources that need cleanup).\n\n![Defense in Depth Security Layers](./diagrams/security-layers.svg)\n\nThe security layers form concentric rings of protection around the untrusted process. The outermost layer (namespaces) provides the broadest isolation by changing the process's view of system resources. Moving inward, filesystem isolation restricts file access, seccomp filters system calls at the kernel boundary, cgroups limit resource consumption, and capability dropping removes dangerous privileges. This layered approach ensures that exploiting the sandbox requires defeating multiple independent security mechanisms simultaneously.\n\n### Component Responsibilities\n\nThe process sandbox divides security responsibilities among six primary components, each with clearly defined ownership boundaries and interfaces. This separation allows each component to focus on a specific aspect of security while maintaining clean integration points.\n\n| Component | Primary Responsibility | Resources Managed | Key Dependencies |\n|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **Sandbox Orchestrator** | Coordinates all security components and manages sandbox lifecycle | Process state, cleanup handlers, error reporting | All other components |\n| **Namespace Manager** | Creates isolated views of system resources | PID, mount, network, UTS, user namespaces | clone() system call, root privileges |\n| **Filesystem Isolator** | Provides minimal isolated filesystem environment | Root filesystem, mount points, file permissions | Mount namespace, chroot/pivot_root |\n| **Seccomp Filter** | Restricts allowed system calls using BPF programs | BPF filter programs, system call whitelist | prctl() system call, BPF compiler |\n| **Cgroup Manager** | Enforces resource limits on CPU, memory, I/O | Cgroup hierarchies, controller limits | Cgroup filesystem, root privileges |\n| **Capability Dropper** | Removes dangerous Linux capabilities | Process capability sets, user/group IDs | capset() system call, privilege flags |\n\n#### Sandbox Orchestrator Responsibilities\n\nThe **Sandbox Orchestrator** serves as the central coordinator and maintains the master state for each sandbox instance. It owns the `sandbox_config_t` structure containing user-specified settings and the `sandbox_state_t` structure tracking runtime resources. The orchestrator's primary responsibilities include validating configuration parameters, calling security components in the correct sequence, handling initialization failures with proper cleanup, and providing a unified error reporting interface.\n\nThe orchestrator must handle complex error scenarios where some security mechanisms succeed while others fail. For example, if namespace creation succeeds but filesystem isolation fails, the orchestrator must properly clean up the created namespaces before returning an error. This requires maintaining detailed cleanup state and implementing rollback logic for partial failures.\n\n| Orchestrator Function | Input Parameters | Return Value | Side Effects |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| `sandbox_config_init()` | None | `sandbox_config_t*` | Allocates configuration with defaults |\n| `sandbox_config_free()` | `sandbox_config_t*` | void | Deallocates configuration memory |\n| `sandbox_state_init()` | None | `sandbox_state_t*` | Allocates runtime state structure |\n| `create_sandbox()` | `sandbox_config_t*`, `sandbox_state_t*` | int (error code) | Creates child process, applies all security layers |\n| `cleanup_sandbox()` | `sandbox_state_t*` | void | Releases namespaces, cgroups, kills processes |\n| `check_root_privileges()` | None | int (boolean) | Checks for required root privileges |\n\n#### Security Component Interface Pattern\n\nEach security component follows a consistent interface pattern that simplifies orchestration and error handling. Every component provides initialization, application, and cleanup functions that can be called independently. This pattern allows the orchestrator to apply security mechanisms incrementally and handle failures at any stage.\n\nThe component interface pattern ensures that each security layer can be tested in isolation and that new security mechanisms can be added without modifying existing components. Each component validates its own preconditions (such as required privileges or kernel features) and reports specific error codes that help with debugging.\n\n### Security Layer Ordering\n\nThe sequence of applying security mechanisms is critical to the sandbox's effectiveness and stability. Applying these layers in the wrong order can result in privilege escalation vulnerabilities, resource leaks, or complete sandbox initialization failure. The ordering requirements stem from dependencies between security mechanisms and the way Linux kernel security checks interact.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Some security mechanisms require privileges that other mechanisms remove. For example, creating cgroups requires root privileges, but capability dropping removes those privileges. The ordering must ensure that privilege-requiring operations happen before capability dropping.\n\nThe correct initialization sequence follows a specific pattern based on privilege requirements and resource dependencies:\n\n1. **Privilege Verification** - Check for required root privileges before attempting any security operations\n2. **Process Forking** - Create the child process that will become the sandboxed environment\n3. **Namespace Creation** - Establish isolated views of system resources while retaining privileges\n4. **Filesystem Setup** - Configure isolated filesystem environment using mount namespace\n5. **Cgroup Configuration** - Set resource limits while still having cgroup management privileges\n6. **Seccomp Installation** - Install system call filter as late as possible to avoid blocking required setup calls\n7. **Capability Dropping** - Remove dangerous privileges as the final step before executing user code\n\n> **Decision: Apply Seccomp Filter Last Among Security Mechanisms**\n> - **Context**: Seccomp filters can block system calls required by other security setup operations\n> - **Options Considered**: Apply seccomp first (maximum protection), apply seccomp in middle (balanced), apply seccomp last (compatibility)\n> - **Decision**: Apply seccomp filter just before capability dropping and program execution\n> - **Rationale**: Many security setup operations require system calls that should be blocked during normal execution (like mount, setrlimit, prctl). Applying seccomp too early would block legitimate setup operations.\n> - **Consequences**: Brief window where setup code runs without system call filtering, but all other security layers are active. Setup code is trusted and minimal.\n\n#### Namespace Creation Dependencies\n\nNamespace creation must happen early because other security mechanisms depend on namespace isolation. The mount namespace must exist before filesystem isolation can configure bind mounts and chroot environments. The PID namespace should be created before cgroup assignment to ensure proper process hierarchy tracking.\n\n| Namespace Type | Must Create Before | Reason |\n|----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| User | All other namespaces | Provides privilege mapping for other namespace operations |\n| PID | Cgroup assignment | Ensures cgroup sees correct process hierarchy |\n| Mount | Filesystem isolation | Required for chroot and bind mount operations |\n| Network | Seccomp filter | Some seccomp filters check network-related system calls |\n| UTS | Program execution | Hostname isolation should be established before user code runs |\n\n#### Privilege Dropping Timing\n\nCapability dropping must be the last security operation because it removes privileges required by other security mechanisms. Once capabilities are dropped, the process cannot create new namespaces, configure cgroups, or perform other privileged operations. The `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag must be set before loading seccomp filters, but this doesn't remove existing capabilities.\n\nThe privilege dropping sequence within its own phase also matters: first change supplementary groups, then primary group, then user ID, then drop capabilities. This order prevents the process from being unable to complete privilege changes due to insufficient permissions.\n\n#### Resource Limit Application Order\n\nCgroup limits should be applied after namespace creation but before program execution to ensure the resource limits apply to the correct process hierarchy. Memory limits must be set before the program starts to prevent initial memory allocation from exceeding limits. CPU limits can be applied at any time but are most effective when set before the program begins executing.\n\n> **Decision: Configure Cgroups After Namespaces But Before Seccomp**\n> - **Context**: Cgroup operations require various system calls and file system access that might be restricted\n> - **Options Considered**: Configure cgroups first (early protection), configure cgroups after everything (late application), configure cgroups mid-sequence (balanced)\n> - **Decision**: Configure cgroups after namespace creation but before seccomp filter installation\n> - **Rationale**: Cgroup setup requires file system operations that seccomp might block, but cgroups should be active before user code runs. Namespaces must exist first to provide proper isolation context.\n> - **Consequences**: Resource limits are active during seccomp installation and capability dropping, providing protection against resource exhaustion during these phases.\n\n### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe codebase organization reflects the component-based architecture and supports incremental development through the milestone sequence. The structure separates core sandbox logic from supporting utilities and provides clear integration points for testing and debugging.\n\n```\nprocess-sandbox/\n├── src/                          # Core implementation\n│   ├── main.c                    # Entry point and command-line interface\n│   ├── sandbox.h                 # Public API and configuration structures\n│   ├── sandbox.c                 # Main orchestrator implementation\n│   ├── namespace.h               # Namespace management interface\n│   ├── namespace.c               # Namespace creation and management\n│   ├── filesystem.h              # Filesystem isolation interface  \n│   ├── filesystem.c              # Chroot/pivot_root implementation\n│   ├── seccomp.h                 # System call filtering interface\n│   ├── seccomp.c                 # BPF filter generation and installation\n│   ├── cgroups.h                 # Resource limiting interface\n│   ├── cgroups.c                 # Cgroup creation and limit enforcement\n│   ├── capabilities.h            # Privilege management interface\n│   └── capabilities.c            # Capability dropping implementation\n├── include/                      # Shared header files\n│   ├── common.h                  # Common types and constants\n│   ├── errors.h                  # Error codes and reporting\n│   └── utils.h                   # Utility functions\n├── lib/                          # Supporting utilities\n│   ├── utils.c                   # Common utility implementations\n│   ├── logging.c                 # Logging and debugging support\n│   └── cleanup.c                 # Resource cleanup utilities\n├── tests/                        # Test suite\n│   ├── unit/                     # Component unit tests\n│   │   ├── test_namespace.c\n│   │   ├── test_filesystem.c\n│   │   ├── test_seccomp.c\n│   │   ├── test_cgroups.c\n│   │   └── test_capabilities.c\n│   ├── integration/              # Full sandbox tests\n│   │   ├── test_basic_execution.c\n│   │   ├── test_security_bypass.c\n│   │   └── test_resource_limits.c\n│   └── fixtures/                 # Test data and configurations\n│       ├── minimal_rootfs/       # Test filesystem environments\n│       └── test_programs/        # Programs for testing sandbox\n├── rootfs/                       # Minimal root filesystem template\n│   ├── bin/                      # Essential binaries\n│   ├── lib/                      # Required libraries\n│   ├── dev/                      # Device nodes template\n│   └── proc/                     # Proc filesystem mount point\n├── examples/                     # Example configurations and usage\n│   ├── basic_sandbox.c           # Simple sandbox example\n│   ├── web_service_sandbox.c     # Network service sandboxing\n│   └── compiler_sandbox.c        # Code compilation sandboxing\n├── scripts/                      # Build and development tools\n│   ├── setup_rootfs.sh          # Script to create minimal root filesystem\n│   ├── test_runner.sh            # Comprehensive test execution\n│   └── benchmark.sh              # Performance measurement tools\n├── docs/                         # Documentation\n│   ├── api.md                    # API reference\n│   ├── security.md               # Security model explanation\n│   └── debugging.md              # Troubleshooting guide\n├── Makefile                      # Build configuration\n└── README.md                     # Project overview and quick start\n```\n\n#### Core Implementation Organization\n\nThe `src/` directory contains the main sandbox implementation with each security component in its own source file. This organization supports the milestone-based development approach where learners can implement one security mechanism at a time. The header files define clean interfaces between components and make dependencies explicit.\n\nThe `sandbox.h` and `sandbox.c` files contain the orchestrator logic and main API. These files depend on all other components but provide a single entry point for sandbox creation. The orchestrator handles the complex initialization sequence and error handling that coordinates all security mechanisms.\n\n| File | Primary Purpose | Key Structures | Dependencies |\n|------|----------------|----------------|--------------|\n| `main.c` | Command-line interface and program entry | Command-line parsing | `sandbox.h` |\n| `sandbox.h/c` | Orchestrator and main API | `sandbox_config_t`, `sandbox_state_t` | All component headers |\n| `namespace.h/c` | Namespace isolation | Namespace file descriptors | `clone()`, `unshare()` |\n| `filesystem.h/c` | Filesystem isolation | Mount points, chroot state | `mount()`, `chroot()` |\n| `seccomp.h/c` | System call filtering | BPF programs, filter rules | `prctl()`, BPF utilities |\n| `cgroups.h/c` | Resource limits | Cgroup paths, limit values | Cgroup filesystem |\n| `capabilities.h/c` | Privilege dropping | Capability sets, user IDs | `capset()`, `setuid()` |\n\n#### Supporting Infrastructure Organization\n\nThe `lib/` directory contains utility functions that multiple components use but that aren't part of the core security logic. This includes error reporting, resource cleanup, and debugging utilities. The `include/` directory contains shared definitions and constants used across multiple components.\n\nThe separation between core logic and supporting utilities helps maintain focus on the security mechanisms while providing necessary infrastructure. The utility functions handle cross-cutting concerns like logging and memory management that every component needs.\n\n#### Testing and Validation Structure\n\nThe `tests/` directory supports both unit testing of individual components and integration testing of the complete sandbox. Unit tests can verify each security mechanism in isolation, while integration tests validate that the components work together correctly and provide the expected security properties.\n\nThe `fixtures/` directory contains test data including minimal root filesystems and test programs that exercise different aspects of the sandbox. This structure supports automated testing and provides concrete examples of sandbox configurations.\n\n> **Decision: Separate Unit Tests by Component**\n> - **Context**: Each security component has distinct functionality that can be tested independently\n> - **Options Considered**: Single test file (simple), test per function (granular), test per component (balanced)\n> - **Decision**: Create separate test files for each major component with comprehensive test cases\n> - **Rationale**: Component-level testing matches the architecture, allows parallel test development during milestone implementation, and makes it easy to identify which security mechanism has issues\n> - **Consequences**: More test files to maintain, but better test organization and easier debugging when specific security mechanisms fail\n\n#### Development and Deployment Support\n\nThe `scripts/` directory contains automation for common development tasks including building minimal root filesystems, running comprehensive tests, and measuring performance. The `examples/` directory demonstrates different sandbox configurations for common use cases.\n\nThis structure supports both learning (clear examples and comprehensive tests) and production usage (deployment scripts and performance tools). The examples show how to configure the sandbox for different security requirements and workload types.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe process sandbox implementation requires careful attention to Linux-specific system calls and security mechanisms. The following guidance provides practical recommendations for building each component and integrating them effectively.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| BPF Filter Generation | Hand-written BPF assembly | libseccomp library | Hand-written provides learning value; libseccomp for production |\n| Configuration Format | Command-line arguments | JSON/YAML config files | Command-line for simplicity; files for complex configurations |\n| Logging | fprintf() to stderr | Structured logging library | Basic logging sufficient for learning project |\n| Error Handling | Integer return codes | Detailed error structures | Return codes align with C conventions and system calls |\n| Root Filesystem | Manual directory creation | Buildroot or similar tool | Manual creation for learning; automated tools for production |\n\n#### Core Data Structures\n\nThe sandbox system centers around two main configuration and state structures that all components use:\n\n```c\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n// Configuration structure defining sandbox parameters\ntypedef struct {\n    char* program_path;           // Path to program to execute\n    char** program_args;          // Arguments to pass to program\n    char* chroot_path;           // Root filesystem path\n    unsigned long memory_limit;   // Memory limit in bytes\n    unsigned int cpu_percent;

            // PID of sandboxed process\n    int namespace_fd[6];         // File descriptors for namespaces\n    char* cgroup_path;           // Path to cgroup directory\n    int cleanup_needed;          // Flags indicating resources to cleanup\n} sandbox_state_t;\n\n// Error codes for sandbox operations\n#define SANDBOX_SUCCESS 0\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_CONFIG 1\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_PRIVILEGE 2\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_NAMESPACE 3\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_FILESYSTEM 4\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_SECCOMP 5\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_CGROUP 6\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_CAPABILITY 7\n#define SANDBOX_ERROR_EXEC 8\n```\n\n#### Orchestrator Implementation Framework\n\nThe main orchestrator coordinates all security components and handles the complex initialization sequence:\n\n```c\n#include \"sandbox.h\"\n#include \"namespace.h\"\n#include \"filesystem.h\"\n#include \"seccomp.h\"\n#include \"cgroups.h\"\n#include \"capabilities.h\"\n\n// Initialize configuration with safe defaults\nsandbox_config_t* sandbox_config_init() {\n    sandbox_config_t* config = malloc(sizeof(sandbox_config_t));\n    if (!config) return NULL;\n    \n    // TODO 1: Set default values for all configuration fields\n    // TODO 2: Initialize program_path and program_args to NULL\n    // TODO 3: Set default chroot_path to \"./rootfs\"\n    // TODO 4: Set reasonable default memory_limit (e.g., 64MB)\n    // TODO 5: Set default cpu_percent to 10\n    // TODO 6: Disable network access by default\n    // TODO 7: Initialize allowed_syscalls to basic whitelist\n    \n    return config;\n}\n\n// Main sandbox creation function coordinating all security layers\nint create_sandbox(sandbox_config_t* config, sandbox_state_t* state) {\n    // TODO 1: Validate configuration parameters for completeness and safety\n    // TODO 2: Check for required root privileges using check_root_privileges()\n    // TODO 3: Fork child process and store PID in state->child_pid\n    // TODO 4: In parent: set up monitoring and return success\n    // TODO 5: In child: Apply security layers in correct order:\n    //         - Create namespaces (all types: PID, mount, network, UTS, user)\n    //         - Set up filesystem isolation (chroot/pivot_root)\n    //         - Configure cgroups and resource limits\n    //         - Install seccomp filter\n    //         - Drop capabilities\n    //         - Execute target program\n    // TODO 6: Handle failures at any stage with proper cleanup\n    // TODO 7: Set appropriate error codes for different failure types\n    \n    return SANDBOX_SUCCESS;\n}\n\n// Clean up all sandbox resources\nvoid cleanup_sandbox(sandbox_state_t* state) {\n    // TODO 1: Kill child process if still running\n    // TODO 2: Close namespace file descriptors\n    // TODO 3: Remove cgroup directory and limits\n    // TODO 4: Clean up any temporary filesystem mounts\n    // TODO 5: Free allocated memory in state structure\n    \n    // Hint: Use kill(state->child_pid, SIGTERM) then SIGKILL if needed\n    // Hint: Check state->cleanup_needed flags to see what needs cleanup\n}\n```\n\n#### Component Integration Pattern\n\nEach security component follows a consistent pattern for integration with the orchestrator:\n\n```c\n// Example pattern for namespace component\ntypedef struct {\n    int pid_ns_fd;\n    int mount_ns_fd; \n    int net_ns_fd;\n    int uts_ns_fd;\n    int user_ns_fd;\n    int initialized;\n} namespace_state_t;\n\n// Initialize namespace isolation\nint create_namespaces(namespace_state_t* ns_state) {\n    // TODO 1: Create user namespace first for privilege mapping\n    // TODO 2: Create PID namespace for process isolation  \n    // TODO 3: Create mount namespace for filesystem isolation\n    // TODO 4: Create network namespace for network isolation\n    // TODO 5: Create UTS namespace for hostname isolation\n    // TODO 6: Store namespace file descriptors for cleanup\n    // TODO 7: Set initialized flag on success\n    \n    // Hint: Use clone() with CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWMOUNT | etc.\n    // Hint: Open /proc/self/ns/* files to get namespace file descriptors\n    \n    return SANDBOX_SUCCESS;\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Handling and Debugging Infrastructure\n\n```c\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Centralized error reporting with context\nvoid sandbox_error(const char* operation, int error_code) {\n    // TODO 1: Print operation name and error code\n    // TODO 2: Include errno and strerror() for system call failures\n    // TODO 3: Add timestamp and PID for debugging\n    // TODO 4: Consider logging to file for production usage\n    \n    // Example: \"SANDBOX ERROR: create_namespaces failed with code 3: Operation not permitted\"\n}\n\n// Privilege checking utility\nint check_root_privileges() {\n    // TODO 1: Check if running as root (getuid() == 0)\n    // TODO 2: Verify required capabilities are available\n    // TODO 3: Test ability to create namespaces (try and rollback)\n    // TODO 4: Check for cgroup write permissions\n    // TODO 5: Return 1 if all privileges available, 0 otherwise\n    \n    // Hint: Use getuid(), geteuid(), and access() to check permissions\n    // Hint: Try opening /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces for namespace support\n    \n    return 0; // Replace with actual implementation\n}\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nAfter implementing each component, verify functionality with these specific tests:\n\n**Milestone 1 - Namespace Isolation:**\n- Run: `sudo ./sandbox /bin/sh` and execute `echo $$` (should print \"1\")\n- Verify: `cat /proc/self/status | grep NSpid` shows isolated PID namespace\n- Test: `ip addr` should show only loopback interface (network isolation)\n- Check: `hostname` should show isolated hostname different from host\n\n**Milestone 2 - Filesystem Isolation:**  \n- Run: `sudo ./sandbox /bin/ls /` (should show minimal rootfs, not host filesystem)\n- Verify: Attempting to access `/home` or other host directories fails\n- Test: Create file in sandbox - should not appear on host filesystem\n- Check: `mount` command shows sandbox-specific mounts only\n\n**Milestone 3 - System Call Filtering:**\n- Run sandbox with program that attempts forbidden system call\n- Verify: Process killed with SIGSYS signal when making blocked system call  \n- Test: `strace -f ./sandbox /bin/echo hello` shows only whitelisted system calls\n- Check: Attempt to use `ptrace()` or other dangerous calls fails immediately\n\n**Milestone 4 - Resource Limits:**\n- Run memory-intensive program exceeding configured limit\n- Verify: Process killed by OOM killer when exceeding memory limit\n- Test: CPU-intensive program should be throttled to configured percentage\n- Check: `cat /proc/<pid>/cgroup` shows sandbox cgroup membership\n\n**Milestone 5 - Capability Dropping:**\n- Run: `capsh --print` inside sandbox shows minimal capability set\n- Verify: Attempts to mount filesystems or change networking fail with permission errors\n- Test: `cat /proc/self/status | grep Cap` shows dropped capabilities\n- Check: Programs cannot escalate privileges even with setuid binaries\n\n⚠️ **Common Pitfalls**:\n\n- **Forgetting SIGCHLD in clone()**: The parent process won't be notified when the child exits, leading to zombie processes. Always include `SIGCHLD` in the clone flags.\n\n- **Not mounting /proc in new namespace**: Many utilities expect /proc to be mounted. Create the mount after entering the new mount namespace with `mount(\"proc\", \"/proc\", \"proc\", 0, NULL)`.\n\n- **Applying seccomp before setup is complete**: System call filtering can block legitimate setup operations. Install the seccomp filter as the last step before executing user code.\n\n- **Missing library dependencies in chroot**: The minimal root filesystem must include all shared libraries required by the target program. Use `ldd` to identify dependencies and copy them to the chroot environment.\n\n- **Incorrect capability dropping order**: Drop capabilities after changing user/group IDs. The sequence should be: `setgroups()` → `setgid()` → `setuid()` → `capset()`.\n\n\n## Data Model\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section provides data structures for all milestones (1-5), with specific focus on configuration (Milestones 1-2) and runtime state management (Milestones 3-5)\n\nThe data model of the process sandbox defines the fundamental structures that capture configuration intent and runtime state throughout the sandbox lifecycle. Think of the data model as the **sandbox's memory** - it stores everything the system needs to know about what the sandbox should look like (configuration) and what it actually looks like at any moment in time (runtime state). Just as a construction foreman needs blueprints (configuration) and progress tracking sheets (runtime state) to build a house, the sandbox orchestrator needs structured data to create and manage isolated execution environments.\n\nThe data model serves two critical purposes in the sandbox architecture. First, it provides a **declarative configuration interface** that allows users to specify their isolation requirements without understanding the underlying Linux primitives. Second, it maintains **runtime state tracking** that enables proper resource cleanup and monitoring throughout the sandbox lifecycle. This separation between desired state (configuration) and actual state (runtime) follows established patterns from container orchestration systems and ensures the sandbox can recover gracefully from failures.\n\n![System Architecture Overview](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\nThe complexity of the sandbox data model stems from the need to coordinate multiple independent Linux security mechanisms. Each security layer - namespaces, filesystem isolation, seccomp filtering, resource limits, and capability management - requires its own configuration parameters and runtime state tracking. The challenge lies in designing structures that are both comprehensive enough to support all security features and simple enough for users to understand and configure correctly.\n\n### Sandbox Configuration\n\nThe **sandbox configuration** represents the declarative specification of how a sandbox should be constructed. Think of it as the **architectural blueprint** for the security prison - it specifies the cell dimensions (resource limits), the permitted activities (allowed system calls), the view from the windows (namespace configuration), and the items allowed inside (filesystem access). Unlike imperative commands that describe how to build something, the configuration describes what the end result should look like, leaving the implementation details to the sandbox orchestrator.\n\nThe configuration structure must balance several competing concerns. It needs to be comprehensive enough to support all security features while remaining simple enough for typical use cases. It must provide sensible defaults that work out of the box while allowing advanced users to customize every aspect of the security policy. Most importantly, it must be validated early to prevent configuration errors from causing runtime failures after expensive setup work has already been performed.\n\n#### Configuration Structure Design\n\nThe primary configuration structure, `sandbox_config_t`, encapsulates all parameters needed to create a sandbox instance. This structure follows the principle of **explicit over implicit** - every security-relevant setting is explicitly specified rather than inferred from context. This approach prevents subtle security bugs that can arise when default behaviors change or when configurations are applied in unexpected environments.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Purpose | Default Behavior |\n|------------|------|---------|------------------|\n| `program_path` | `char*` | Absolute path to executable that will run inside sandbox | Must be specified, no default |\n| `program_args` | `char**` | Null-terminated array of command-line arguments | Empty array if not specified |\n| `chroot_path` | `char*` | Path to directory that becomes the new root filesystem | Uses minimal built-in rootfs if NULL |\n| `memory_limit` | `unsigned long` | Maximum memory in bytes that sandbox can allocate | 64MB default limit |\n| `cpu_percent` | `unsigned int` | Percentage of one CPU core (0-100) available to sandbox | 10% default allocation |\n| `enable_network` | `int` | Boolean flag controlling network namespace isolation | 0 (disabled) for maximum isolation |\n| `allowed_syscalls` | `char**` | Null-terminated array of permitted system call names | Minimal safe set if not specified |\n\nThe configuration structure intentionally uses simple C types rather than complex nested structures. This design choice reflects the reality that sandbox configuration is often driven by external configuration files, command-line arguments, or environment variables. Simple types make serialization, validation, and debugging significantly easier than deeply nested object hierarchies.\n\n#### Resource Limit Configuration\n\nResource limits represent one of the most critical aspects of sandbox configuration because they directly impact system stability. Think of resource limits as the **power grid** for the sandbox prison - they determine how much electricity (CPU), water (memory), and other utilities each cell can consume. Without proper limits, a malicious or buggy program can consume all available resources and impact other processes on the system.\n\nThe memory limit specification uses bytes rather than more convenient units like megabytes to avoid ambiguity about binary versus decimal multipliers. A limit of `67108864` bytes is unambiguous, while \"64MB\" could mean either 64 * 1000 * 1000 or 64 * 1024 * 1024 bytes depending on interpretation. This precision matters because memory limits are enforced by the kernel with byte-level accuracy.\n\nCPU limit configuration uses percentage of a single core rather than absolute CPU time to make the configuration portable across different hardware. A sandbox configured for \"10% of one core\" will behave consistently whether running on a dual-core laptop or a 32-core server. The cgroup implementation translates this percentage into appropriate period and quota values for kernel enforcement.\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: Resource limits must be specified in kernel-native units to avoid translation errors and ensure consistent enforcement. The configuration layer provides the abstraction, but the underlying values must match exactly what the kernel expects.\n\n#### System Call Allowlist Configuration\n\nThe system call allowlist represents the **security checkpoint** for all kernel interactions from the sandboxed process. Think of it as the **customs office** at a border crossing - every request to cross from userspace into kernel space must be explicitly approved based on a predetermined list of acceptable operations. The allowlist approach follows the security principle of **default deny** - anything not explicitly permitted is automatically forbidden.\n\nSystem call names are used in the configuration rather than numeric values to improve readability and avoid architecture-specific differences. The same system call can have different numbers on x86_64 versus ARM64, but the name remains constant. The sandbox implementation translates names to numbers during seccomp filter compilation based on the runtime architecture.\n\nThe configuration supports both positive allowlists (specifying permitted calls) and negative blocklists (specifying forbidden calls), though the default behavior favors allowlists for security. A typical configuration might include essential calls like `read`, `write`, `exit`, and `exit_group` while excluding dangerous operations like `ptrace`, `mount`, or `kexec_load`.\n\n> **Decision: System Call Configuration Format**\n> - **Context**: Need to specify which system calls the sandboxed process can make while keeping configuration readable and architecture-independent\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Numeric system call IDs in configuration\n>   2. String names translated to numbers at runtime\n>   3. Predefined named policies (strict, moderate, permissive)\n> - **Decision**: String names with runtime translation to numbers\n> - **Rationale**: Names are architecture-independent, human-readable, and maintainable. Translation overhead is acceptable since it happens once during sandbox setup.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires system call name-to-number translation logic and architecture detection, but improves configuration portability and debuggability.\n\n#### Filesystem Configuration\n\nFilesystem configuration determines what files and directories the sandboxed process can access. Think of this as designing the **floor plan** of the security prison - it specifies which rooms (directories) exist, what furniture (files) they contain, and whether the doors have locks (permissions). The filesystem configuration must balance security isolation with providing enough functionality for the sandboxed program to operate correctly.\n\nThe `chroot_path` configuration specifies the directory that becomes the new root filesystem for the sandboxed process. This directory must contain a complete minimal Linux filesystem with essential directories like `/bin`, `/lib`, `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/tmp`. The sandbox orchestrator validates this structure during configuration parsing to ensure the sandboxed process won't fail due to missing dependencies.\n\nWhen `chroot_path` is NULL, the sandbox uses a built-in minimal root filesystem constructed in memory using tmpfs. This default behavior provides a secure baseline that works for simple programs without requiring users to construct their own root filesystem. The built-in filesystem includes only essential files and directories needed for basic program execution.\n\n### Runtime State\n\nThe **runtime state** captures the dynamic information about a running sandbox instance. Think of runtime state as the **security control room** for the prison - it contains all the monitors, switches, and communication channels needed to observe and control the sandbox throughout its lifecycle. While configuration represents the desired state, runtime state represents the actual current state of all security mechanisms.\n\nRuntime state differs fundamentally from configuration in that it contains **handles and references to kernel objects** rather than parameters and settings. Namespace file descriptors, process IDs, and cgroup paths are all kernel-managed resources that must be properly tracked and cleaned up. The runtime state structure serves as the sandbox's **resource inventory** - it knows exactly what kernel resources are allocated and ensures they are properly released when the sandbox terminates.\n\nThe complexity of runtime state management stems from the **temporal dependencies** between different security layers. Namespaces must be created before processes can be moved into them. Cgroups must be configured before processes are added to them. Capabilities must be dropped after all other setup is complete. The runtime state tracks not just what resources exist, but what order they were created in and what dependencies exist between them.\n\n#### Process and Namespace Tracking\n\nProcess tracking represents the core of runtime state management because the sandboxed process is the central entity around which all other security mechanisms revolve. Think of the process as the **prisoner** in the security analogy - the runtime state must know where the prisoner is, what cell they're in, and how to communicate with or terminate them if necessary.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Purpose | Lifecycle |\n|------------|------|---------|-----------|\n| `child_pid` | `pid_t` | Process ID of the sandboxed process | Set after fork, cleared after wait |\n| `namespace_fd` | `int[6]` | File descriptors for each namespace type | Created during namespace setup, closed during cleanup |\n| `cgroup_path` | `char*` | Filesystem path to sandbox's cgroup directory | Allocated during cgroup creation, freed during cleanup |\n| `cleanup_needed` | `int` | Boolean flag indicating whether cleanup is required | Set to 1 during setup, cleared after successful cleanup |\n\nThe namespace file descriptor array stores handles to each namespace type in a fixed order: PID, mount, network, UTS, user, and IPC namespaces. These file descriptors allow the parent process to manipulate namespaces even after the sandboxed process has started executing. For example, the parent might need to configure network interfaces in the network namespace or add additional mount points to the mount namespace.\n\nNamespace file descriptors are obtained by opening files in `/proc/[pid]/ns/` after creating the namespaces but before the sandboxed process calls exec. Once the exec call completes, the original process image is replaced and the namespace setup code is no longer running, making these file descriptors the only way for the parent to access the namespaces.\n\n> **Critical Resource Management**: Namespace file descriptors must be closed by the parent process during cleanup to prevent file descriptor leaks. Each unclosed namespace file descriptor prevents the kernel from fully cleaning up the namespace even after all processes in it have terminated.\n\n#### Namespace State Tracking\n\nThe namespace state structure provides detailed tracking of namespace creation and initialization status. Think of this as the **facility status board** in a control room - it shows exactly which isolation chambers are operational and which are still under construction.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Purpose | Valid Values |\n|------------|------|---------|--------------|\n| `pid_ns_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for PID namespace | -1 if not created, valid fd if active |\n| `mount_ns_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for mount namespace | -1 if not created, valid fd if active |\n| `net_ns_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for network namespace | -1 if not created, valid fd if active |\n| `uts_ns_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for UTS namespace | -1 if not created, valid fd if active |\n| `user_ns_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for user namespace | -1 if not created, valid fd if active |\n| `initialized` | `int` | Boolean indicating all namespaces ready | 0 during setup, 1 when complete |\n\nThe namespace state structure enables partial cleanup in failure scenarios. If namespace creation fails partway through the process, the cleanup code can examine each file descriptor to determine which namespaces were successfully created and need to be cleaned up. This prevents resource leaks when errors occur during sandbox initialization.\n\nThe `initialized` flag serves as a **consistency marker** that indicates whether the namespace setup process completed successfully. The sandbox orchestrator sets this flag only after all namespaces have been created and their file descriptors have been stored. This flag prevents the sandboxed process from starting execution before the security isolation is fully established.\n\n#### Cleanup Resource Tracking\n\nCleanup resource tracking ensures that all kernel resources allocated during sandbox creation are properly released when the sandbox terminates. Think of this as the **maintenance checklist** that facility staff use when closing down a section of the prison - every lock must be checked, every utility must be turned off, and every resource must be accounted for.\n\nThe `cleanup_needed` flag provides a **fail-safe mechanism** that ensures cleanup occurs even if the normal termination path is interrupted. This flag is set to 1 as soon as any kernel resources are allocated and cleared to 0 only after all resources have been successfully released. If the parent process receives a signal or encounters an unexpected error, it can check this flag to determine whether cleanup is necessary.\n\nCgroup path tracking presents unique challenges because cgroups are managed through the filesystem interface rather than file descriptors. The `cgroup_path` field stores the full filesystem path to the sandbox's cgroup directory, which must be removed during cleanup to prevent accumulation of empty cgroup directories over time. The cleanup process must also handle the case where processes are still running in the cgroup, which prevents directory removal until all processes have been terminated.\n\n> **Decision: Cleanup Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Need to ensure all kernel resources are properly released when sandbox terminates, even in failure scenarios\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Manual cleanup calls at each exit point\n>   2. Cleanup flag with centralized cleanup function\n>   3. Reference counting for each resource type\n> - **Decision**: Cleanup flag with centralized cleanup function\n> - **Rationale**: Centralized cleanup reduces code duplication and ensures consistent cleanup behavior. The flag approach is simpler than reference counting while still providing safety.\n> - **Consequences**: All exit paths must call the cleanup function, but resource management is centralized and easier to verify for correctness.\n\n### Configuration Validation and Defaults\n\nConfiguration validation ensures that sandbox parameters are valid and consistent before expensive setup operations begin. Think of validation as the **blueprints review process** before construction starts - it's much cheaper to catch design problems on paper than to discover them after pouring the foundation. The validation process checks individual parameter values, relationships between parameters, and system compatibility.\n\nIndividual parameter validation checks that each configuration value is within acceptable bounds and formats. Memory limits must be positive and within system limits. CPU percentages must be between 0 and 100. File paths must be absolute and accessible. System call names must be recognized on the current architecture. These checks prevent runtime failures that would waste resources and potentially leave the system in an inconsistent state.\n\nRelationship validation ensures that configuration parameters are mutually compatible. For example, if network access is disabled, any configuration that depends on network connectivity should be flagged as invalid. If the chroot path is specified but doesn't contain required directories, the validation should detect this before attempting sandbox creation.\n\n| Validation Type | Check Performed | Error Condition | Recovery Action |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Memory Limit | Value > 0 and < system memory | Zero or negative limit | Use default 64MB limit |\n| CPU Percentage | Value between 0 and 100 | Out of range value | Use default 10% limit |\n| Program Path | File exists and is executable | Missing or non-executable | Return configuration error |\n| Chroot Path | Directory exists with required subdirs | Missing directory structure | Use built-in minimal rootfs |\n| System Calls | All names valid on current architecture | Unrecognized system call name | Return configuration error |\n\nDefault value assignment provides a secure baseline for unconfigured parameters. The defaults are chosen to prioritize security over performance - it's better to have a sandbox that runs slowly but securely than one that runs quickly but allows privilege escalation. Users who need higher performance can explicitly configure more permissive settings after understanding the security implications.\n\nThe default system call allowlist includes only the most essential operations needed for basic program execution: `read`, `write`, `exit`, `exit_group`, `brk`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `mprotect`, and `rt_sigreturn`. This minimal set allows simple programs to run while blocking dangerous operations like process creation, file system modification, or network access.\n\n### Data Flow and State Transitions\n\nThe sandbox data model supports a clear flow from initial configuration through runtime execution to final cleanup. Think of this as the **prisoner processing pipeline** - there are distinct stages with specific hand-off points and validation checkpoints between each stage. Understanding this flow is crucial for implementing robust error handling and resource management.\n\nThe configuration phase begins with parsing user input and ends with a validated `sandbox_config_t` structure. During this phase, all user-provided values are validated, defaults are applied for missing parameters, and system compatibility is verified. No kernel resources are allocated during configuration parsing, making this phase fast and reversible.\n\nThe initialization phase creates kernel resources and populates the `sandbox_state_t` structure. This phase includes namespace creation, filesystem setup, cgroup configuration, and other resource-intensive operations. Each step in initialization updates the runtime state structure to track what resources have been allocated, enabling partial cleanup if later steps fail.\n\n| Phase | Input | Output | Resources Allocated | Failure Recovery |\n|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Parse Config | User input | `sandbox_config_t` | None | Simple error return |\n| Validate Config | `sandbox_config_t` | Validated config | None | Simple error return |\n| Initialize | Config + empty state | Populated `sandbox_state_t` | Namespaces, cgroups, processes | Cleanup allocated resources |\n| Execute | State + config | Running sandbox | None (resources already allocated) | Terminate and cleanup |\n| Cleanup | `sandbox_state_t` | Clean system | None (resources released) | Force cleanup if needed |\n\nThe execution phase monitors the running sandbox and handles communication between the parent supervisor and the sandboxed process. During this phase, the configuration is read-only and the runtime state changes only to reflect the current status of the sandboxed process (running, terminated, etc.).\n\nThe cleanup phase releases all kernel resources tracked in the runtime state structure. This phase must be robust enough to handle partial failures - if some resources cannot be released immediately (e.g., because processes are still running), the cleanup process must retry or escalate to more forceful termination methods.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Configuration Pointer Ownership**\nA common mistake is unclear ownership of string pointers in the configuration structure. Fields like `program_path` and `chroot_path` point to memory that may be allocated by different parts of the system (command-line parsing, configuration file reading, etc.). If the configuration structure doesn't properly manage this memory, it can lead to double-free errors or memory leaks. The solution is to make the configuration structure own all its string data by copying values during initialization and freeing them during destruction.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Namespace File Descriptor Leaks**\nNamespace file descriptors are easy to leak because they remain valid even after all processes in the namespace have terminated. Unlike process IDs which become invalid when processes exit, namespace file descriptors keep the namespace alive indefinitely. Always close these file descriptors in the cleanup function and set them to -1 to prevent accidental reuse.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Partial Cleanup State**\nRuntime state structures can be left in inconsistent states if cleanup is interrupted or fails partway through. For example, if the parent process is killed while cleaning up cgroups, some resources may be released while others remain allocated. Design the cleanup function to be **idempotent** - calling it multiple times should be safe and should eventually clean up all resources.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Configuration Validation Race Conditions**\nValidating configuration at parse time doesn't guarantee that the same validation will hold at execution time. For example, checking that a chroot directory exists during configuration parsing doesn't prevent the directory from being deleted before sandbox creation. Critical validations must be repeated during the initialization phase when resources are actually being allocated.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Integer Overflow in Resource Limits**\nMemory and resource limits are often specified in human-readable units (MB, GB) but stored in bytes. Converting \"1GB\" to bytes requires multiplication by 1073741824, which can overflow 32-bit integers. Always use appropriate integer types (`unsigned long` or `uint64_t`) for byte-based limits and validate that conversions don't overflow.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe data model implementation requires careful attention to memory management, error handling, and resource lifecycle management. The structures serve as the foundation for all sandbox operations, so bugs in the data model can cascade throughout the entire system.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Configuration Parsing | Manual string parsing with `strtol`/`strtoul` | JSON parsing with `cjson` library |\n| String Management | Fixed-size buffers with `strncpy` | Dynamic allocation with `strdup` |\n| Error Handling | Integer return codes | Structured error objects |\n| Memory Management | Manual `malloc`/`free` with cleanup functions | Memory pools or smart pointers |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nsandbox/\n  include/\n    sandbox.h                 ← public API and data structures\n  src/\n    config.c                  ← configuration management\n    state.c                   ← runtime state management\n    cleanup.c                 ← resource cleanup utilities\n  tests/\n    test_config.c             ← configuration validation tests\n    test_state.c              ← state management tests\n```\n\n#### Configuration Management Infrastructure\n\nThe configuration management code handles parsing, validation, and memory management for sandbox configuration structures.

This infrastructure ensures that all allocated resources are properly released even in failure scenarios.\n\n```c\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <sys/wait.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include \"sandbox.h\"\n\n// Initialize runtime state structure  \nsandbox_state_t* sandbox_state_init(void) {\n    // TODO: Allocate sandbox_state_t structure using malloc\n    // TODO: Set child_pid to -1 (invalid PID)\n    // TODO: Initialize all namespace_fd entries to -1 (invalid FDs)\n    // TODO: Set cgroup_path to NULL\n    // TODO: Set cleanup_needed to 0 (no cleanup required yet)\n    // TODO: Return pointer to initialized structure\n}\n\n// Mark that cleanup will be needed for this sandbox\nvoid sandbox_state_mark_cleanup_needed(sandbox_state_t* state) {\n    // TODO: Set cleanup_needed flag to 1\n    // TODO: This should be called as soon as any kernel resources are allocated\n}\n\n// Store namespace file descriptors for later cleanup\nint sandbox_state_store_namespaces(sandbox_state_t* state, const namespace_state_t* ns_state) {\n    // TODO: Copy all file descriptors from ns_state to state->namespace_fd array\n    // TODO: Validate that all file descriptors are valid (>= 0)\n    // TODO: Mark cleanup as needed since we now have resources to clean\n    // TODO: Return SANDBOX_SUCCESS on success, error code on failure\n}\n\n// Clean up all resources tracked in state structure\nvoid cleanup_sandbox(sandbox_state_t* state) {\n    // TODO: Check cleanup_needed flag - return early if no cleanup needed\n    // TODO: If child_pid is valid, send SIGTERM then wait for process\n    // TODO: Close all valid namespace file descriptors in namespace_fd array\n    // TODO: If cgroup_path is set, remove the cgroup directory\n    // TODO: Free cgroup_path string if allocated\n    // TODO: Set cleanup_needed to 0 and reset all fields to initial values\n    // Hint: Use kill(child_pid, SIGTERM) followed by waitpid() to clean up process\n    // Hint: Use rmdir() to remove empty cgroup directory\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Handling and Validation Utilities\n\nThe error handling infrastructure provides consistent error reporting and recovery throughout the sandbox system. These utilities ensure that errors are detected early and reported with sufficient detail for debugging.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include \"sandbox.h\"\n\n// Report sandbox errors with context and errno information\nvoid sandbox_error(const char* operation, int error_code) {\n    // TODO: Print error message including operation that failed\n    // TODO: Include error_code and its meaning (use strerror if errno-based)\n    // TODO: Include current errno value if relevant\n    // TODO: Format message consistently for easier debugging\n    // Hint: Use fprintf(stderr, ...) for error output\n}\n\n// Check if current process has root privileges\nint check_root_privileges(void) {\n    // TODO: Check if effective UID is 0 (root)\n    // TODO: Return 1 if running as root, 0 if not\n    // TODO: Consider checking for specific capabilities if needed\n    // Hint: Use geteuid() to get effective user ID\n}\n\n// Validate that a directory contains required subdirectories for chroot\nint validate_chroot_structure(const char* chroot_path) {\n    // TODO: Check that chroot_path directory exists and is accessible\n    // TODO: Verify required subdirectories exist: /bin, /lib, /tmp, /proc, /dev\n    // TODO: Check that essential files exist (may be empty but structure required)\n    // TODO: Return SANDBOX_SUCCESS if valid, SANDBOX_ERROR_FILESYSTEM if not\n    // Hint: Use opendir() and readdir() to examine directory contents\n}\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nAfter implementing the data model infrastructure, verify correct behavior with these checkpoints:\n\n**Configuration Management Test:**\n```bash\n# Compile test program\ngcc -o test_config src/config.c tests/test_config.c -I include\n\n# Run configuration tests\n./test_config\n# Expected output:\n# Configuration initialization: PASSED\n# Default value assignment: PASSED  \n# Parameter validation: PASSED\n# Memory cleanup: PASSED\n```\n\n**Runtime State Management Test:**\n```bash  \n# Compile state management test\ngcc -o test_state src/state.c tests/test_state.c -I include\n\n# Run state management tests  \n./test_state\n# Expected output:\n# State initialization: PASSED\n# Resource tracking: PASSED\n# Cleanup verification: PASSED\n# Error handling: PASSED\n```\n\n**Integration Test:**\nCreate a simple test program that initializes configuration, sets up runtime state, and cleans up resources.

By leveraging Linux namespaces, this component creates isolated views of system resources that make the sandboxed process believe it exists in its own private universe, completely separate from the host system. This isolation is so convincing that a process running inside the sandbox sees itself as process ID 1 in its own system, with its own network stack, filesystem mounts, and even hostname—all while being just another process on the host system.\n\n### Mental Model: Separate Universes\n\n> Think of Linux namespaces as creating parallel universes for processes. Imagine you have a magic mirror that shows a completely different reality to anyone looking into it. From the host system's perspective, the sandboxed process is just another process with a regular PID, using the normal filesystem, and sharing the same network interfaces. But from inside the sandbox, the process sees itself as the only important process (PID 1), living on a system with its own private filesystem and isolated network stack.\n\nThis \"separate universe\" effect is achieved through the kernel's namespace mechanism, which maintains multiple independent views of the same underlying system resources. When a process is created in a new namespace, the kernel essentially creates a new mapping table for that category of resource. For example, in a new PID namespace, the kernel maintains a separate process ID mapping where the first process gets PID 1, even though it might be PID 23847 from the host's perspective.\n\nThe power of this approach lies in its completeness—the sandboxed process cannot even discover that other realities exist. It cannot see host processes, cannot access host mount points, and cannot communicate over the host's network interfaces. This isolation occurs at the kernel level, making it extremely difficult for malicious code to break out of the sandbox through normal system call interfaces.\n\nConsider a concrete scenario: when a sandboxed process calls `getpid()`, the kernel consults the PID namespace mapping and returns 1. When it calls `ps aux` to list processes, the kernel only shows processes within the same PID namespace. When it attempts to connect to network addresses, the kernel routes those requests through the network namespace's isolated network stack, which by default has no external connectivity.\n\n### Namespace Types and Usage\n\nLinux provides several types of namespaces, each isolating a different category of system resource. The process sandbox leverages five key namespace types to create comprehensive isolation. Understanding each namespace type and its security benefits is crucial for implementing effective sandbox isolation.\n\n| Namespace Type | System Resource | Security Benefit | Implementation Challenge |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| PID | Process IDs and process tree | Hides host processes, prevents process manipulation attacks | Requires proper /proc mounting, zombie reaping |\n| Mount | Filesystem mount points | Isolates filesystem view, prevents unauthorized file access | Complex mount propagation, dependency resolution |\n| Network | Network interfaces, routing tables, firewalls | Blocks network access, prevents network-based attacks | Interface creation, connectivity management |\n| UTS | Hostname and domain name | Isolates system identity, prevents information leakage | Minimal complexity, mainly cosmetic isolation |\n| User | User and group IDs | Maps root inside container to unprivileged user outside | Most complex, requires careful UID/GID mapping |\n\n**PID Namespace Isolation** provides process-level security by creating an isolated process tree where the sandboxed process becomes PID 1. This isolation prevents the sandboxed process from discovering, signaling, or manipulating host processes. The sandboxed process cannot use `kill`, `ptrace`, or other process control system calls to affect processes outside its namespace. Additionally, the isolated process tree means that when the sandbox terminates, all child processes are automatically cleaned up since they lose their parent process.\n\nThe PID namespace also affects the `/proc` filesystem, which must be mounted separately within the namespace to reflect the isolated process view. Without proper `/proc` mounting, tools like `ps`, `top`, and `pidof` will either fail or show incorrect information from the host namespace.\n\n**Mount Namespace Isolation** creates an independent filesystem view by providing a separate mount table. This isolation prevents the sandboxed process from accessing host mount points, even if it knows their paths. The sandbox can have its own `/tmp`, `/dev`, and other critical directories without affecting or being affected by the host system.\n\nMount namespaces support different propagation modes that control how mount and unmount events propagate between namespaces. The sandbox uses private propagation to ensure that mount changes within the sandbox do not affect the host system. This isolation extends to preventing access to sensitive host directories like `/root`, `/home`, and system configuration directories.\n\n**Network Namespace Isolation** provides complete network isolation by creating a separate network stack with its own interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules. By default, a new network namespace contains only a loopback interface, effectively cutting off all external network access. This isolation prevents network-based attacks, data exfiltration, and unauthorized communication.\n\nThe network namespace can be selectively configured to allow specific types of network access if required. This might involve creating virtual network interfaces, setting up network address translation, or configuring specific firewall rules. However, the default configuration provides maximum security by denying all network access.\n\n**UTS Namespace Isolation** isolates the system hostname and domain name, preventing the sandboxed process from discovering or modifying the host system's identity. While this provides minimal security benefit compared to other namespaces, it contributes to the overall isolation illusion and prevents information leakage that might aid in fingerprinting or reconnaissance attacks.\n\n**User Namespace Isolation** provides the most complex but potentially most valuable isolation by mapping user and group IDs between the host and sandbox. This mapping allows a process to have root privileges (UID 0) inside the sandbox while running as an unprivileged user outside the sandbox. This isolation dramatically reduces the impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities within the sandbox.\n\nUser namespace mapping requires careful configuration of UID and GID mappings in `/proc/PID/uid_map` and `/proc/PID/gid_map` files. These mappings define how user and group IDs translate between the namespace and the host system. Incorrect mapping can either break functionality or compromise security.\n\n### Namespace Creation and Ordering\n\nCreating namespaces in the correct sequence is critical for both functionality and security. The kernel imposes certain ordering constraints, and the sandbox's security model depends on establishing isolation layers in a specific order. The namespace creation algorithm must handle these dependencies while providing comprehensive error handling and cleanup.\n\nThe namespace creation process follows this carefully orchestrated sequence:\n\n1. **Verify Root Privileges**: Check that the calling process has sufficient privileges to create namespaces. Most namespace creation requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability or root privileges. The process should verify these privileges early to provide clear error messages rather than cryptic system call failures.\n\n2. **Create User Namespace First**: If using user namespaces, create them before any other namespaces. User namespaces are special because they can grant capabilities needed for creating other namespaces, even to non-root processes. Creating the user namespace first establishes the privilege context for subsequent namespace creation.\n\n3. **Set Up UID/GID Mappings**: Immediately after creating the user namespace, configure the UID and GID mappings by writing to `/proc/self/uid_map` and `/proc/self/gid_map`. These mappings must be established before creating other namespaces that depend on user identity checks.\n\n4. **Create PID Namespace**: Create the PID namespace to establish process isolation. The PID namespace affects process creation and signaling, so it should be established before creating the actual sandboxed process. Note that the creating process does not enter the PID namespace—only its children will be in the new namespace.\n\n5. **Create Mount Namespace**: Create the mount namespace to establish filesystem isolation. This namespace affects all subsequent filesystem operations, including the mounting of `/proc`, `/dev`, and other special filesystems that other namespaces might require.\n\n6. **Create Network Namespace**: Create the network namespace to establish network isolation. Network namespaces are relatively independent but should be created before UTS namespaces for consistency and to ensure network-related hostname resolution works correctly within the isolated environment.\n\n7. **Create UTS Namespace**: Create the UTS namespace last among the isolation namespaces. UTS namespaces have few dependencies and primarily provide cosmetic isolation, making them safe to create at any point in the sequence.\n\n8. **Validate Namespace Creation**: After creating all namespaces, validate that they were created successfully by checking namespace file descriptors and reading namespace identifiers from `/proc/self/ns/` entries. This validation catches subtle failures that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nThe algorithm must handle partial failures gracefully. If namespace creation fails at any step, the process should clean up any successfully created namespaces and return to the original namespace context. This cleanup prevents resource leaks and ensures the system remains in a consistent state.\n\n```\nAlgorithm: Namespace Creation Sequence\n\nInput: namespace_state_t* ns_state (structure to track namespace file descriptors)\nOutput: SANDBOX_SUCCESS or appropriate error code\n\n1. Initialize namespace_state_t structure with invalid file descriptors (-1)\n2. Call check_root_privileges() to verify required privileges\n3. If using user namespaces:\n   a. Call unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) to create user namespace\n   b. Store namespace fd in ns_state->user_ns_fd\n   c. Write UID mapping to /proc/self/uid_map\n   d. Write GID mapping to /proc/self/gid_map\n4. Call unshare(CLONE_NEWPID) to create PID namespace\n5. Store namespace fd in ns_state->pid_ns_fd\n6. Call unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) to create mount namespace\n7. Store namespace fd in ns_state->mount_ns_fd\n8. Call unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) to create network namespace\n9. Store namespace fd in ns_state->net_ns_fd\n10. Call unshare(CLONE_NEWUTS) to create UTS namespace\n11. Store namespace fd in ns_state->uts_ns_fd\n12. Validate all namespace creation by reading /proc/self/ns/ entries\n13. Set ns_state->initialized = 1\n14. Return SANDBOX_SUCCESS\n\nError Handling:\n- If any step fails, call cleanup_namespaces(ns_state) before returning error code\n- Log specific error messages indicating which namespace creation failed\n- Ensure all file descriptors are properly closed during cleanup\n```\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe namespace isolation component requires several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact both security and functionality. Each decision involves trade-offs between security, complexity, performance, and compatibility that must be carefully evaluated.\n\n> **Decision: Use unshare() vs clone() for Namespace Creation**\n> - **Context**: Linux provides two primary mechanisms for creating namespaces: the `unshare()` system call that moves the calling process into new namespaces, and the `clone()` system call that creates a new process in new namespaces. The choice affects process creation flow and error handling complexity.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Use `unshare()` to create namespaces then `fork()` to create sandboxed process\n>   - Use `clone()` with namespace flags to create process and namespaces atomically\n>   - Hybrid approach using `unshare()` for some namespaces and `clone()` for others\n> - **Decision**: Use `unshare()` followed by `fork()` for namespace creation\n> - **Rationale**: The `unshare()` approach provides better error handling and cleanup capabilities. If namespace creation fails, the parent process remains in the original namespaces and can clean up resources. The `clone()` approach creates the process and namespaces atomically, making error recovery more complex since the child process might be created even if some namespaces fail. Additionally, `unshare()` allows for step-by-step namespace creation with validation at each step.\n> - **Consequences**: This approach requires two separate system calls (`unshare()` then `fork()`) instead of one atomic `clone()` call. However, it provides cleaner error handling, better logging of namespace creation failures, and allows for partial namespace creation if needed for testing or debugging.\n\n| Approach | Error Handling | Complexity | Atomic Creation | Resource Cleanup |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| unshare() + fork() | Excellent - parent can recover | Medium | No | Simple |\n| clone() with flags | Limited - child handles errors | Low | Yes | Complex |\n| Hybrid approach | Complex - depends on namespace | High | Partial | Variable |\n\n> **Decision: User Namespace Mapping Strategy**\n> - **Context**: User namespaces require explicit UID and GID mappings between the host and container. These mappings determine what user and group identities the sandboxed process sees versus what identities it has on the host system. Incorrect mappings can compromise security or break functionality.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Map container root (UID 0) to host process UID with single mapping\n>   - Create comprehensive mapping covering multiple UIDs and GIDs\n>   - Skip user namespaces entirely and rely on other isolation mechanisms\n> - **Decision**: Map container root (UID 0) to host process UID with single identity mapping\n> - **Rationale**: Single identity mapping provides maximum security by ensuring the sandboxed process has no privileges outside the namespace, regardless of what UID it believes it has inside. Comprehensive mappings increase complexity and potential attack surface. Skipping user namespaces entirely misses a valuable security layer that allows other namespace creation without root privileges.\n> - **Consequences**: Sandboxed processes can run as root inside the container while being unprivileged outside. This approach limits functionality for applications that need multiple user identities but provides strong security guarantees. File ownership and permissions must be carefully managed since files created inside the sandbox will appear owned by the mapped host UID.\n\n| Mapping Strategy | Security | Complexity | Functionality | Root Required |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Single identity | Excellent | Low | Limited | No |\n| Multiple mappings | Good | High | Full | Sometimes |\n| No user namespace | Poor | Low | Full | Yes |\n\n> **Decision: Namespace File Descriptor Management**\n> - **Context**: Linux namespaces can be referenced through file descriptors obtained from `/proc/PID/ns/` entries. These file descriptors can be used to enter namespaces later or to ensure namespaces persist even after all processes exit. The sandbox must decide whether to keep these file descriptors open and how to manage their lifecycle.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Keep namespace file descriptors open for entire sandbox lifetime\n>   - Close file descriptors immediately after namespace creation\n>   - Selectively keep only critical namespace file descriptors\n> - **Decision**: Keep all namespace file descriptors open and store them in `namespace_state_t`\n> - **Rationale**: Keeping namespace file descriptors open allows the parent supervisor to monitor namespace health, perform cleanup operations, and potentially enter namespaces for debugging or management. File descriptors also prevent namespace destruction if all processes exit unexpectedly. The resource cost of keeping a few file descriptors open is minimal compared to the operational benefits.\n> - **Consequences**: The sandbox must carefully manage file descriptor cleanup to prevent resource leaks. File descriptors must be closed when the sandbox terminates. This approach increases memory usage slightly but provides better observability and control over namespace lifecycle.\n\n| FD Management | Resource Usage | Observability | Cleanup Complexity | Namespace Persistence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Keep open | Low increase | Excellent | Medium | Guaranteed |\n| Close immediately | Minimal | Limited | Simple | Process-dependent |\n| Selective keeping | Variable | Partial | High | Partial |\n\n> **Decision: Privilege Requirements and Capability Handling**\n> - **Context**: Different namespaces have different privilege requirements. Some require root privileges, others require specific capabilities like `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. The sandbox must handle privilege requirements consistently while minimizing the attack surface of running with elevated privileges.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Require root privileges for all namespace operations\n>   - Use capabilities to minimize required privileges\n>   - Create user namespace first to gain privileges for other namespace creation\n> - **Decision**: Use user namespace creation to gain privileges for other namespaces when possible, fall back to checking root privileges\n> - **Rationale**: User namespaces provide a mechanism to gain the capabilities needed for creating other namespaces without requiring the parent process to run as root. This approach follows the principle of least privilege while maintaining functionality. Falling back to root privilege checking ensures compatibility with systems where user namespaces might be disabled.\n> - **Consequences**: The sandbox can be used by non-root users on systems with user namespace support, improving security. However, the code must handle both privilege models and provide clear error messages when neither approach works. Some systems disable user namespaces for security reasons, requiring root privileges.\n\n| Privilege Strategy | Security | Compatibility | Complexity | User Access |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| User namespace first | Excellent | Good | Medium | Yes |\n| Root required | Good | Excellent | Low | No |\n| Capabilities only | Good | Limited | High | Depends |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nUnderstanding and avoiding common pitfalls in namespace creation is crucial for building a reliable process sandbox. These pitfalls often manifest as subtle bugs that only appear under specific conditions or with certain workloads, making them particularly dangerous for security-critical systems.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting SIGCHLD Handling in PID Namespaces**\n\nWhen creating PID namespaces, the first process in the namespace (PID 1) takes on special responsibilities similar to the init process on a normal system. One critical responsibility is reaping zombie child processes. If the sandbox creates child processes that terminate, they become zombies unless properly reaped by their parent.\n\nIn a PID namespace, the PID 1 process must handle `SIGCHLD` signals and call `wait()` or `waitpid()` to clean up terminated children. Failure to do this results in zombie processes accumulating within the namespace, potentially exhausting process limits and causing resource leaks.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Zombie processes consume kernel resources (process table entries) and can eventually exhaust the system's process limit. In a sandbox environment, this can be exploited as a denial-of-service attack where malicious code creates many short-lived processes to exhaust resources.\n\n**How to fix**: Install a `SIGCHLD` signal handler that calls `waitpid(-1, NULL, WNOHANG)` in a loop to reap all available zombie children. Alternatively, use `signalfd()` or `sigwaitinfo()` for synchronous signal handling that integrates better with event loops.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Mounting /proc in New PID Namespace**\n\nAfter creating a PID namespace, the `/proc` filesystem still reflects the host system's process view unless explicitly remounted. Many programs and system tools rely on `/proc` to discover running processes, system information, and resource usage. Without proper `/proc` mounting, these tools show incorrect information or fail entirely.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Programs inside the sandbox see host system processes through `/proc`, breaking the isolation illusion and potentially revealing sensitive information about the host system. Additionally, process management tools like `ps` and `top` show incorrect information, making debugging and monitoring difficult.\n\n**How to fix**: After entering the new mount and PID namespaces but before executing the sandboxed program, mount a new `proc` filesystem: `mount(\"proc\", \"/proc\", \"proc\", 0, NULL)`. Ensure the mount point exists and is properly cleaned up when the sandbox terminates.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect User Namespace UID/GID Mapping**\n\nUser namespace mapping requires writing specific formats to `/proc/self/uid_map` and `/proc/self/gid_map` files. The format is strict: \"inside-id outside-id length\" with specific whitespace requirements. Incorrect format, invalid ranges, or permission issues cause mapping failures that can compromise security or functionality.\n\nCommon mapping errors include: writing mappings after creating other namespaces (mappings must be written immediately), using incorrect UID ranges, forgetting to map GID in addition to UID, and not handling the single-write requirement (mappings can only be written once per namespace).\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Failed UID/GID mapping can leave the process without proper user identity, cause file permission issues, or in worst cases, grant unintended privileges. The process might not be able to access files it should own or might retain privileges it should have dropped.\n\n**How to fix**: Write UID and GID mappings immediately after creating the user namespace. Use the exact format: `printf(\"0 %d 1\", getuid())` for single-identity mapping. Check write return values and handle errors explicitly. Test mappings by reading back the files and verifying the process's effective UID/GID.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Namespace Creation Without Proper Error Handling**\n\nNamespace creation can fail for various reasons: insufficient privileges, kernel features disabled, resource exhaustion, or policy restrictions. Failing to handle these errors properly can leave the process in an inconsistent state with partial namespace isolation, compromising security.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Partial namespace creation might give a false sense of security while leaving attack vectors open. For example, if PID namespace creation succeeds but network namespace creation fails, the sandboxed process has process isolation but retains network access, potentially allowing data exfiltration.\n\n**How to fix**: Check the return value of every `unshare()` call and handle failures appropriately. If any namespace creation fails, clean up successfully created namespaces and return to the original state. Provide clear error messages indicating which specific namespace creation failed and why. Test namespace creation under various failure conditions to ensure robust error handling.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Namespace Setup**\n\nNamespace creation involves multiple system calls that must be coordinated carefully. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads attempt namespace operations simultaneously, when the parent and child processes interact during setup, or when namespace file descriptors are accessed concurrently.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Race conditions can lead to processes ending up in wrong namespaces, namespace file descriptors becoming invalid, or cleanup operations failing. These issues are particularly dangerous because they might only manifest under specific timing conditions, making them difficult to detect during testing.\n\n**How to fix**: Use proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores when namespace operations might be accessed concurrently. Ensure parent-child process synchronization during namespace setup using mechanisms like pipes or signals. Avoid sharing namespace file descriptors between threads without proper synchronization.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Handling Nested Namespace Restrictions**\n\nSome systems or container environments already run inside namespaces, creating nested namespace scenarios. Creating namespaces within existing namespaces can have unexpected restrictions, capability requirements, or behavior differences. Additionally, some security policies explicitly prevent nested namespace creation.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Nested namespace creation might fail silently or create namespaces with different isolation properties than expected. Security policies might prevent namespace creation entirely, causing the sandbox to fail in production environments where it worked during development.\n\n**How to fix**: Detect existing namespace contexts by comparing namespace identifiers in `/proc/self/ns/` with `/proc/1/ns/`. Provide clear error messages when nested namespace creation is attempted but not supported. Test the sandbox in various deployment environments, including containers and systems with restrictive security policies.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe namespace isolation component requires careful orchestration of Linux system calls and proper resource management.

Use `errno` and `strerror()` to provide meaningful error messages.\n- **File Descriptor Management**: Use `open()` with `/proc/self/ns/*` entries to obtain namespace file descriptors. Remember to close them during cleanup.\n- **Process Synchronization**: Use `pipe()` or `socketpair()` for parent-child synchronization during namespace setup if needed.\n- **Signal Handling**: Install `SIGCHLD` handler in PID 1 process using `sigaction()` for robust zombie reaping.\n- **Memory Management**: Always `free()` allocated configuration structures and handle allocation failures gracefully.\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing the namespace isolation component, verify correct behavior:\n\n1. **Compile and run**: `gcc -o sandbox src/*.c && sudo ./sandbox /bin/bash`\n2. **Expected behavior**: \n   - Child process should see itself as PID 1: `echo $$` returns `1`\n   - Process list isolation: `ps aux` shows only processes in namespace\n   - Network isolation: `ip addr` shows only loopback interface  \n   - Hostname isolation: `hostname` shows isolated or custom hostname\n   - Filesystem namespace: mount changes don't affect host system\n\n3. **Validation commands** (run inside sandbox):\n   ```bash\n   echo $$                    # Should print: 1\n   ps aux | wc -l            # Should show very few processes\n   cat /proc/self/ns/pid     # Different namespace ID than host\n   ping 8.8.8.8              # Should fail (network isolated)\n   hostname                  # Should show custom/isolated hostname\n   ```\n\n4. **Signs of problems**:\n   - **Child PID not 1**: PID namespace creation failed or `/proc` not remounted\n   - **Can see host processes**: Mount namespace not created or `/proc` issue\n   - **Network connectivity works**: Network namespace creation failed\n   - **Same hostname as host**: UTS namespace creation failed\n   - **Permission errors**: Insufficient privileges or user mapping problems\n\n![Namespace Isolation View](./diagrams/namespace-isolation.svg)\n\n\n## Filesystem Isolation Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section corresponds to Milestone 2 (Filesystem Isolation) and builds upon the namespace isolation from Milestone 1, providing the foundation for secure system call filtering in Milestone 3\n\nThe filesystem isolation component creates a **convincing but restricted filesystem environment** for sandboxed processes. While namespace isolation provides the container for our security boundaries, filesystem isolation defines what the sandboxed process can actually see and access within those boundaries. This component transforms a potentially dangerous process that expects full system access into one that operates within a carefully crafted minimal environment.\n\n![Isolated Filesystem Layout](./diagrams/filesystem-layout.svg)\n\n### Mental Model: The Fake Building\n\nUnderstanding filesystem isolation requires thinking about it like constructing a **fake building** for a movie set. When filming a scene that takes place in a hospital, the production team doesn't need to build an actual functioning hospital—they only need to construct the rooms and corridors that will appear on camera, fill them with convincing props, and ensure the actors can't accidentally wander off the set into the real world.\n\nSimilarly, filesystem isolation creates a **convincing but minimal environment** that contains everything the sandboxed process expects to find (essential binaries, libraries, device files) while ensuring it cannot escape to access the real host filesystem. The sandboxed process believes it's running on a complete Linux system, but it's actually operating within a carefully constructed façade that contains only what it needs and nothing more.\n\nJust as a movie set has controlled entry and exit points, **chroot** or **pivot_root** operations define the boundaries of this fake environment. The process can explore freely within its artificial world, but the walls are designed to be impenetrable—it cannot climb out of its confined space to reach the production equipment (real host system) beyond the set.\n\nThe key insight is that **most processes don't actually need access to the entire filesystem hierarchy**. A typical application might only need access to its own executable, a few shared libraries, basic device files like `/dev/null`, and a temporary scratch space. By providing exactly these resources and nothing more, we create an environment that's functionally complete for the application but severely limited from an attacker's perspective.\n\n### Minimal Root Filesystem Construction\n\nBuilding the minimal root filesystem requires understanding **exactly what components are necessary** for the sandboxed process to function while excluding everything that could be exploited for privilege escalation or information disclosure. This construction process involves identifying dependencies, creating directory structures, and populating the environment with only essential files.\n\nThe foundation of any Linux filesystem environment consists of several **critical directory structures** that processes expect to find. The `/bin` directory must contain essential executables that the sandboxed process might invoke, such as `/bin/sh` if the process needs to spawn shell commands. The `/lib` and `/lib64` directories house shared libraries that executables depend on—these are discovered by analyzing the dynamic linking requirements of all binaries included in the sandbox.\n\n**Library dependency resolution** represents one of the most complex aspects of minimal filesystem construction. Every executable and shared library can depend on additional libraries, creating a dependency tree that must be fully resolved to avoid runtime failures. The `ldd` command reveals immediate dependencies, but this analysis must be performed recursively since dependencies can have their own dependencies. Dynamic linking also involves the runtime linker itself (typically `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` on x86_64 systems), which must be present and functional.\n\nThe `/dev` directory requires careful population with **device files that applications commonly expect**. Most processes assume they can access `/dev/null` for discarding output, `/dev/zero` for obtaining null bytes, `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom` for entropy, and `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr` for standard I/O operations. However, dangerous device files like `/dev/mem` (direct memory access) or `/dev/kmem` (kernel memory) must be explicitly excluded to prevent privilege escalation.\n\n**Configuration and data files** represent another category that requires selective inclusion. Many applications expect to find configuration files in `/etc`, such as `/etc/passwd` for user information, `/etc/group` for group definitions, or `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS resolution. However, these files should be created specifically for the sandbox environment rather than copied from the host system, as host configuration files might contain sensitive information or references to resources outside the sandbox.\n\nThe minimal filesystem construction process follows a **systematic approach** to ensure completeness while maintaining security:\n\n1. **Analyze the target executable** using `ldd` and similar tools to identify all shared library dependencies\n2. **Create the essential directory structure** with appropriate permissions: `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/dev`, `/proc`, `/tmp`, `/etc`\n3. **Copy required executables** to `/bin`, ensuring they have appropriate permissions (typically 755) and are owned by root\n4. **Recursively copy all library dependencies** to `/lib` and `/lib64`, following the same ownership and permission patterns as the host system\n5. **Create essential device files** using `mknod` with appropriate major and minor numbers, limiting to safe devices only\n6. **Generate minimal configuration files** in `/etc` with sandbox-specific content that doesn't expose host information\n7. **Set up temporary and writable areas** that the process can use for scratch space without affecting the host system\n\nThe **size optimization** of the minimal filesystem becomes critical when running multiple sandbox instances. Each sandbox requires its own filesystem copy to maintain isolation, so minimizing the size reduces memory usage and creation time. This optimization involves identifying which libraries are truly necessary versus those that are transitively included but never used, and potentially using static linking for simple executables to eliminate library dependencies entirely.\n\n| Directory | Purpose | Security Considerations | Typical Contents |\n|-----------|---------|------------------------|------------------|\n| `/bin` | Essential executables | Include only necessary binaries | `sh`, target executable |\n| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Shared libraries | Resolve all dependencies | `libc.so.6`, `ld-linux.so.2` |\n| `/dev` | Device files | Include only safe devices | `null`, `zero`, `random`, `urandom` |\n| `/etc` | Configuration files | Create sandbox-specific configs | `passwd`, `group`, `hosts` |\n| `/tmp` | Temporary storage | Writable, size-limited | Empty directory with 1777 permissions |\n| `/proc` | Process information | Mount read-only when possible | Kernel-provided filesystem |\n\n### Chroot vs Pivot Root Decision\n\nThe choice between **chroot** and **pivot_root** for filesystem isolation represents a fundamental architectural decision that affects both security robustness and implementation complexity. Both mechanisms change the apparent root directory for processes, but they operate through different principles and provide different levels of isolation guarantees.\n\n**Chroot** operates by changing the root directory reference for a process and its children without affecting the underlying mount namespace structure. When a process calls `chroot(\"/new/root\")`, the kernel updates the process's root directory pointer, making all absolute paths resolve relative to the new location. However, the old root filesystem remains mounted and potentially accessible through various escape mechanisms, particularly if the process has sufficient privileges or can manipulate file descriptors that point outside the chroot environment.\n\n**Pivot_root**, conversely, operates at the mount namespace level by atomically swapping two mount points—making the new root the actual root of the mount namespace while moving the old root to a specified location within the new hierarchy. This approach provides stronger isolation because it actually changes the mount namespace structure rather than just adjusting process-level path resolution.\n\n> **Decision: Use pivot_root for filesystem isolation**\n> - **Context**: Need robust filesystem isolation that prevents sandbox escape attempts while maintaining clean separation from host filesystem\n> - **Options Considered**: chroot-only approach, pivot_root with old root cleanup, hybrid approach using both mechanisms\n> - **Decision**: Implement pivot_root with immediate cleanup of old root references\n> - **Rationale**: Pivot_root provides stronger security guarantees by actually restructuring the mount namespace rather than relying on path resolution changes. It eliminates many classical chroot escape vectors and provides cleaner separation between sandbox and host environments.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires mount namespace isolation (already provided by Milestone 1), increases implementation complexity, but significantly improves security posture against filesystem-based escape attempts.\n\n| Approach | Security Strength | Implementation Complexity | Escape Vectors | Mount Namespace Required |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| chroot only | Moderate | Low | fd-based, /proc traversal | No |\n| pivot_root | High | Moderate | Limited, requires root access | Yes |\n| hybrid | High | High | Minimal | Yes |\n\nThe **pivot_root implementation sequence** requires careful coordination with mount namespace creation to ensure proper isolation. The process begins by creating the minimal root filesystem in a temporary location, then setting up a new mount namespace where pivot_root can operate safely. The old root must be moved to a location within the new root hierarchy before being unmounted and removed to prevent any references from persisting.\n\n**Security implications** of this choice extend beyond simple path resolution. Chroot environments can be escaped through various mechanisms: processes with sufficient privileges can create device files to access raw disk devices, file descriptors opened before the chroot can provide access to external files, and /proc filesystem entries can potentially be traversed to reach the original root. Pivot_root eliminates most of these vectors by actually restructuring the filesystem view rather than layering path resolution changes on top of the existing structure.\n\n**Error handling complexity** differs significantly between approaches. Chroot failures are typically straightforward—either the target directory exists and is accessible, or the operation fails. Pivot_root failures can be more complex, involving mount namespace state, filesystem busy conditions, or cleanup of partially completed operations. The implementation must handle these failure modes gracefully while ensuring that failed sandbox creation doesn't leave mount artifacts on the host system.\n\n### Mount Management\n\nEffective mount management ensures that the sandbox filesystem contains necessary kernel-provided filesystems while preventing escape vectors through filesystem traversal or mount manipulation. The sandbox requires access to **pseudo-filesystems** like `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/sys` for normal operation, but these mounts must be configured to prevent information disclosure and privilege escalation.\n\n**Proc filesystem mounting** provides essential process and system information that applications frequently require. However, the standard `/proc` mount reveals extensive information about the host system, including all running processes, kernel configuration, and system resource usage. The sandbox implementation must mount `/proc` within the isolated filesystem while ensuring that the **PID namespace isolation** from Milestone 1 limits the visible process information to only processes within the same namespace.\n\nThe `/proc` mount also contains sensitive entries that can be exploited for container escape, particularly `/proc/*/root` symlinks that point to the root directory of arbitrary processes. If a sandboxed process can access `/proc/1/root` (assuming PID 1 exists outside the sandbox), it might be able to traverse back to the host filesystem. **Proper PID namespace isolation** prevents this by ensuring that external processes are not visible within the sandbox's `/proc` view.\n\n**Dev filesystem population** requires creating device files that applications expect while excluding dangerous devices that could enable privilege escalation. The sandbox needs basic devices like `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, and `/dev/random`, but it must not include devices like `/dev/mem` or `/dev/kmem` that provide raw system access. Rather than mounting the host's `/dev` directly, the implementation creates a new tmpfs mount at `/dev` and populates it with only the necessary device files.\n\n**Tmpfs mounts** provide writable storage areas within the sandbox without affecting the host filesystem. These mounts are backed by memory and swap space rather than persistent storage, ensuring that any modifications made by the sandboxed process are automatically cleaned up when the sandbox terminates. Common tmpfs mount points include `/tmp` for temporary files and potentially `/var` or application-specific directories that need write access.\n\nThe **mount sequence** must be carefully ordered to avoid conflicts and ensure proper layering of filesystem views:\n\n1. **Create and mount the new root filesystem** using bind mounts or copying files to a tmpfs\n2. **Set up pivot_root preparation** by creating the old root directory within the new root\n3. **Execute pivot_root operation** to swap the root filesystem\n4. **Mount /proc within the new root** to provide process information within the PID namespace\n5. **Create and populate /dev** as a tmpfs with necessary device files\n6. **Mount additional tmpfs filesystems** for writable areas like `/tmp`\n7. **Unmount and remove the old root** to complete the isolation\n8. **Apply mount options** like read-only, noexec, nosuid, nodev where appropriate\n\n**Mount option security** plays a crucial role in preventing various attack vectors. The `noexec` option prevents execution of binaries from specific mount points, which is particularly important for writable areas like `/tmp`. The `nosuid` option prevents set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits from taking effect, limiting privilege escalation attempts. The `nodev` option prevents device files from being interpreted as such, even if they have the correct major and minor numbers.\n\n| Mount Point | Type | Options | Purpose | Security Considerations |\n|-------------|------|---------|---------|------------------------|\n| `/` | tmpfs or bind | ro, nodev | Root filesystem | Read-only prevents modification |\n| `/proc` | proc | ro, nosuid, nodev, noexec | Process information | Limited by PID namespace |\n| `/dev` | tmpfs | rw, nosuid, noexec | Device files | Manually populated with safe devices |\n| `/tmp` | tmpfs | rw, noexec, nosuid, nodev | Temporary storage | Prevent execution and privilege escalation |\n| `/var/tmp` | tmpfs | rw, noexec, nosuid, nodev | Application temp | Size-limited scratch space |\n\n**Bind mount restrictions** prevent the sandboxed process from accessing sensitive host filesystem locations even if it manages to create new mount points. The implementation must ensure that no bind mounts provide access to locations like `/etc/shadow`, `/proc` from the host mount namespace, or any directory containing sensitive files. This restriction is typically enforced by ensuring that the sandbox root filesystem is completely separate from the host filesystem rather than layering access controls on top of host directories.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe filesystem isolation component requires several critical architectural decisions that balance security, performance, and maintainability. These decisions affect how the sandbox creates, manages, and cleans up filesystem environments across multiple concurrent instances.\n\n> **Decision: Use tmpfs-backed sandbox filesystems with COW optimization**\n> - **Context**: Need isolated filesystem for each sandbox instance while minimizing memory usage and creation time for multiple concurrent sandboxes\n> - **Options Considered**: Directory copying per sandbox, tmpfs with full file copying, COW filesystem overlays, shared read-only base with per-instance writable layers\n> - **Decision**: Implement tmpfs-based sandboxes with copy-on-write overlays for shared components\n> - **Rationale**: Tmpfs provides automatic cleanup and memory-backed performance, while COW overlays allow sharing of common files (libraries, binaries) across multiple sandbox instances, significantly reducing memory footprint\n> - **Consequences**: Requires overlay filesystem support in kernel, increases implementation complexity, but provides excellent scalability for multiple concurrent sandboxes\n\n**Filesystem lifecycle management** determines how sandbox filesystems are created, maintained, and destroyed throughout the sandbox lifetime. The implementation must handle creation failures gracefully, ensure proper cleanup even when sandboxed processes terminate unexpectedly, and provide isolation between concurrent sandbox instances sharing the same host system.\n\nThe **creation process** begins with establishing a new mount namespace (provided by the namespace isolation component) and then constructing the minimal filesystem within that namespace. This construction can follow several strategies: copying files from a template directory, extracting from a prepared archive, or assembling from shared components using overlay mounts. Each approach offers different trade-offs between creation time, memory usage, and customization flexibility.\n\n**Template-based creation** involves preparing a complete minimal filesystem template during sandbox initialization and then copying or bind-mounting this template for each new sandbox instance. This approach provides fast startup times since the dependency resolution and file copying is done once during initialization rather than for each sandbox. However, it requires more disk space and doesn't allow for per-sandbox customization of the filesystem contents.\n\n> **Decision: Implement read-only base with per-sandbox writable overlays**\n> - **Context**: Balance between sharing common components across sandboxes while allowing per-instance modifications and maintaining strict isolation\n> - **Options Considered**: Complete filesystem copying, shared read-only base, overlay filesystems, union mounts\n> - **Decision**: Create shared read-only base filesystem with per-sandbox tmpfs overlays for writable areas\n> - **Rationale**: Maximizes sharing of common files (executables, libraries) while ensuring complete isolation for writable areas. Tmpfs overlays provide automatic cleanup and prevent persistent storage of sandbox modifications\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful management of overlay mount points and cleanup, but provides optimal memory efficiency and strong isolation guarantees\n\n**Writable area management** addresses the need for sandboxed processes to create temporary files, modify application state, or generate output while preventing these modifications from affecting other sandbox instances or persisting beyond the sandbox lifetime. The implementation uses **tmpfs mounts** for writable areas, ensuring that all modifications are memory-backed and automatically cleaned up when the sandbox terminates.\n\nThe overlay approach requires **careful mount point management** to ensure that writable areas are properly isolated while shared areas remain accessible. The implementation creates tmpfs mounts at specific locations (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, potentially application-specific directories) and uses bind mounts or overlay filesystems to compose the final filesystem view that the sandboxed process observes.\n\n**Cleanup and resource management** becomes critical when running multiple sandbox instances concurrently. Each sandbox creates mount points, temporary directories, and potentially overlay filesystems that must be properly cleaned up to prevent resource leaks. The cleanup process must handle cases where the sandboxed process terminates cleanly, crashes unexpectedly, or becomes unresponsive.\n\nThe **cleanup sequence** follows a specific order to avoid conflicts and ensure complete resource deallocation:\n\n1. **Terminate the sandboxed process** if it's still running\n2. **Unmount all tmpfs and overlay mounts** in reverse order of creation\n3. **Remove temporary directories** created for the sandbox instance\n4. **Clean up any bind mounts** that were created for the sandbox\n5. **Verify that all resources are freed** and log any cleanup failures for debugging\n\n| Architecture Aspect | Chosen Approach | Alternative | Trade-off Rationale |\n|---------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Base filesystem | Shared read-only template | Per-sandbox copying | Memory efficiency for concurrent instances |\n| Writable areas | Per-sandbox tmpfs overlays | Shared writable space | Complete isolation between instances |\n| Library sharing | Shared base with COW | Individual copies | Reduced memory footprint |\n| Cleanup strategy | Automatic tmpfs cleanup | Manual file deletion | Guaranteed cleanup even on crashes |\n| Mount namespace | Per-sandbox isolation | Shared with restrictions | Complete filesystem isolation |\n\n**Performance optimization** considerations affect how the filesystem isolation component handles concurrent sandbox creation and teardown. Creating a new sandbox involves multiple filesystem operations (mounting, copying, device file creation) that can become a bottleneck when launching many sandboxes simultaneously. The implementation should pre-compute as much as possible and use efficient copying mechanisms like hard links where security permits.\n\n**Error recovery mechanisms** ensure that partially created sandbox filesystems don't leave artifacts on the host system. If sandbox creation fails partway through the process, the cleanup logic must be able to identify and remove any mount points, temporary directories, or other resources that were created before the failure. This requires maintaining state about what resources have been allocated and ensuring that the cleanup code can handle incomplete resource sets.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nFilesystem isolation implementation involves several complex interactions between mount namespaces, file permissions, and process privileges that create opportunities for subtle but dangerous mistakes. Understanding these common pitfalls helps avoid security vulnerabilities and operational issues that can compromise the entire sandbox system.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Library Dependency Resolution**\n\nMany implementations fail to properly resolve all shared library dependencies, leading to runtime failures when the sandboxed process attempts to load missing libraries. This issue often manifests intermittently because some libraries are loaded only when specific code paths are executed, making the problem difficult to detect during initial testing.\n\nThe root cause typically involves **incomplete recursive dependency analysis**. Using `ldd` on the main executable reveals immediate dependencies, but those libraries may themselves depend on additional libraries that are loaded dynamically. For example, `libc.so.6` might depend on `ld-linux.so.2`, and various libraries might require plugins or modules that are loaded at runtime based on configuration or feature usage.\n\n**Detection**: The sandboxed process fails with \"cannot open shared object file\" errors, often occurring only when specific features are used rather than immediately at startup.\n\n**Solution**: Implement recursive dependency scanning that follows the entire dependency tree, use tools like `objdump -p` to examine dynamic section requirements, and consider using `strace` on the target executable in a non-sandboxed environment to identify all libraries actually loaded during typical operation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient /dev Device Population**\n\nSandboxed processes frequently fail because they cannot access expected device files in `/dev`, but the symptoms often appear as generic I/O errors rather than clearly indicating missing devices. Applications assume that standard devices like `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, and `/dev/urandom` are always available, and their absence can cause unexpected behavior.\n\n**Critical devices** that are commonly required include `/dev/null` (for output redirection), `/dev/zero` (for memory mapping), `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom` (for entropy), and the standard I/O devices (`/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`). Missing any of these can cause applications to fail in non-obvious ways.\n\n**Detection**: Applications fail with permission denied errors when attempting I/O operations, random number generation fails, or processes hang when trying to access entropy sources.\n\n**Solution**: Create a comprehensive device population function that creates all standard devices with correct major/minor numbers and permissions. Use `ls -la /dev` on the host system to identify the correct device parameters, but be selective about which devices to include.\n\n```c\n// Essential devices with major/minor numbers and permissions\nstruct device_spec {\n    char *name;\n    mode_t mode;\n    dev_t device_number;\n};\n\nstatic struct device_spec essential_devices[] = {\n    {\"/dev/null\", S_IFCHR | 0666, makedev(1, 3)},\n    {\"/dev/zero\", S_IFCHR | 0666, makedev(1, 5)},\n    {\"/dev/random\", S_IFCHR | 0444, makedev(1, 8)},\n    {\"/dev/urandom\", S_IFCHR | 0444, makedev(1, 9)},\n    // ... additional devices\n};\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mount Point Cleanup Race Conditions**\n\nImproper cleanup of mount points can lead to resource leaks, permission errors, or in severe cases, interference between different sandbox instances. The cleanup process must handle cases where mount points are busy, processes are still accessing mounted filesystems, or the cleanup itself is interrupted.\n\n**Race conditions** commonly occur when the sandboxed process is still running when cleanup begins, when multiple threads are accessing the filesystem simultaneously, or when the cleanup process itself fails partway through the sequence. These races can leave orphaned mount points that consume system resources and potentially interfere with subsequent sandbox creation.\n\n**Detection**: Mount points remain visible in `/proc/mounts` after sandbox termination, \"device busy\" errors during cleanup, or mounting failures in subsequent sandboxes due to existing mount points.\n\n**Solution**: Implement a robust cleanup sequence that first ensures all processes using the mount points have terminated, then unmounts in reverse order of creation, and finally verifies that all mount points have been successfully removed.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate /proc Mount Security**\n\nMounting `/proc` within the sandbox without proper consideration of PID namespace isolation can leak information about host processes or provide escape vectors through `/proc` entries that reference external resources. The `/proc` filesystem contains numerous entries that can be exploited if not properly restricted.\n\n**Dangerous /proc entries** include `/proc/*/root` (symlinks to process root directories), `/proc/*/cwd` (current working directories), `/proc/*/fd/*` (file descriptor symlinks), and various entries under `/proc/sys` that can affect system behavior. If the sandboxed process can see processes outside its PID namespace, these entries provide potential escape routes.\n\n**Detection**: The sandboxed process can see host processes in `/proc`, can traverse `/proc/*/root` to access the host filesystem, or can access `/proc/sys` entries that should be restricted.\n\n**Solution**: Ensure that PID namespace isolation is properly configured before mounting `/proc`, consider mounting `/proc` read-only, and potentially use mount options or bind mounts to restrict access to sensitive `/proc` subdirectories.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Writable Area Permission Confusion**\n\nIncorrect permissions on writable areas can either prevent legitimate application operation or provide unintended privilege escalation opportunities. The permission model must balance functional requirements (allowing the application to create and modify files) with security constraints (preventing exploitation of set-user-ID bits or device file creation).\n\n**Permission inheritance** from the host system can create unexpected security holes. If writable directories inherit permissive permissions or special flags from their parent directories, sandboxed processes might be able to create files with unintended capabilities.\n\n**Detection**: Applications cannot create necessary temporary files, or conversely, applications can create files with elevated privileges or special capabilities that should not be permitted.\n\n**Solution**: Explicitly set permissions on all mount points and directories rather than inheriting from templates, use mount options like `nosuid`, `nodev`, and `noexec` on writable areas, and verify permissions after filesystem setup is complete.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Pivot Root State Confusion**\n\nThe pivot_root operation requires specific preconditions about mount point states and can fail with cryptic error messages if these conditions are not met. The operation must be performed within a mount namespace, the new root must be a mount point, and the old root destination must exist within the new root hierarchy.\n\n**State requirements** for pivot_root include: both old and new root must be mount points, the old root must not be the same as the new root, the new root and its parent must not be on the same mount as the current root, and the calling process must have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.\n\n**Detection**: pivot_root fails with \"Invalid argument\" or \"Device or resource busy\" errors, or the operation appears to succeed but the filesystem layout is incorrect.\n\n**Solution**: Carefully prepare the mount namespace state before attempting pivot_root, verify that all preconditions are met, and implement comprehensive error handling that can diagnose and report specific failure conditions.\n\n| Pitfall | Symptom | Root Cause | Prevention |\n|---------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Missing libraries | Runtime \"cannot open shared object\" errors | Incomplete dependency resolution | Recursive dependency scanning |\n| Missing devices | Generic I/O failures or hangs | Unpopulated /dev directory | Comprehensive device creation |\n| Mount leaks | Resource exhaustion, mounting failures | Improper cleanup ordering | Robust cleanup with verification |\n| /proc exposure | Information disclosure, escape vectors | Inadequate namespace isolation | Proper PID namespace before /proc mount |\n| Permission errors | Application failures or privilege escalation | Incorrect writable area permissions | Explicit permission setting with mount options |\n| pivot_root failure | Filesystem isolation setup failure | Unmet mount state preconditions | State verification before pivot_root |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe filesystem isolation component requires careful orchestration of mount operations, file system construction, and cleanup procedures.

`EBUSY` often indicates processes still using mount points\n- Use `MNT_DETACH` flag with `umount2()` for lazy unmounting during cleanup\n- `makedev()` macro creates device numbers from major/minor values\n- Use `mkdtemp()` for creating unique temporary directories safely\n\n**Error Handling Patterns**:\n- Always check return values from mount operations - they fail frequently due to permissions or state issues\n- Use `strerror(errno)` to get descriptive error messages for debugging\n- Implement cleanup functions that can handle partial failure states\n- Log mount operations for debugging - knowing what was mounted helps with troubleshooting\n\n**Memory Management**:\n- Use `strdup()` for copying path strings that need to persist\n- Free all allocated paths in cleanup functions\n- Be careful with stack-allocated buffers for path construction - use `PATH_MAX`\n- Consider using `asprintf()` for dynamic string formatting of paths\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the filesystem isolation component, verify the following behavior:\n\n**Test Command**: Compile and run the sandbox with a simple test program that tries to access various filesystem locations.\n\n```bash\ngcc -o sandbox src/sandbox.c src/filesystem/*.c src/common/*.c\nsudo ./sandbox /bin/ls /\n```\n\n**Expected Output**: The sandboxed `ls` command should show only the minimal filesystem contents (bin, lib, dev, proc, tmp) rather than the full host filesystem.\n\n**Verification Steps**:\n1. **Filesystem Isolation**: The sandboxed process should not see host directories like `/home`, `/root`, `/boot`\n2. **Device Access**: Test that `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero` work: `echo test > /dev/null` succeeds\n3. **Process Information**: `/proc/self/` should exist and show the sandboxed process information\n4. **Write Permissions**: Writing to `/tmp` should succeed, writing to `/bin` should fail\n5. **Library Resolution**: Complex programs should still run despite minimal library set\n\n**Common Issues and Debugging**:\n- **\"No such file or directory\" for libraries**: Check dependency resolution in template creation\n- **\"Permission denied\" on device files**: Verify device creation and permissions\n- **\"Invalid argument\" from pivot_root**: Check mount namespace creation and directory setup\n- **Processes hanging**: Usually indicates missing `/dev/random` or similar device files\n- **Mount cleanup failures**: Check that no processes are still running in the namespace\n\n\n## System Call Filtering Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section corresponds to Milestone 3 (Seccomp System Call Filtering) and builds upon the namespace and filesystem isolation from Milestones 1-2, providing system call-level restrictions that will be enhanced by resource limits (Milestone 4) and capability dropping (Milestone 5)\n\nThe system call filtering component represents the third layer in our defense-in-depth sandbox architecture. While namespace isolation creates separate views of system resources and filesystem isolation restricts access to files and directories, system call filtering operates at the most fundamental level—controlling which kernel operations the sandboxed process can invoke. This component uses Linux's **seccomp** (secure computing) mechanism with Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs to create a kernel-enforced whitelist of permitted system calls.\n\nThink of seccomp as installing a strict security checkpoint between user space and kernel space. Every time the sandboxed process attempts to invoke a system call—whether to open a file, allocate memory, or communicate over a network—the seccomp filter program examines the request and decides whether to allow it, block it, or terminate the process entirely. This filtering happens at the kernel level, making it impossible for malicious code to bypass through clever programming tricks or exploits.\n\n### Mental Model: The Strict Gatekeeper\n\nUnderstanding seccomp requires thinking about the fundamental boundary between user space and kernel space in Linux systems. Every program runs in user space, which provides a safe, virtualized environment with limited privileges. When a program needs to perform privileged operations—reading files, allocating memory, creating network connections—it must request these services from the kernel through **system calls**.\n\nImagine the kernel as a high-security government building, and system calls as different types of access requests. Normally, any program with appropriate permissions can enter through various doors: the \"file access\" entrance, the \"network communication\" lobby, the \"process creation\" wing. Each system call represents a different way to enter the kernel and request services.\n\nNow imagine installing an extremely strict gatekeeper at every entrance to this building. This gatekeeper has been given a detailed list of who is allowed through which doors, under what circumstances, and with what identification. The gatekeeper doesn't just check identity—they inspect every detail of each access request: which door the visitor wants to use, what they're carrying, where they claim to be going, and what they intend to do once inside.\n\nThis is exactly how seccomp-BPF works. The **BPF filter program** acts as the gatekeeper, examining every system call attempt. For each system call, the filter can inspect:\n- The **system call number** (which \"door\" they're trying to use)\n- The **arguments** passed to the system call (what they're \"carrying\")\n- The **architecture** of the calling process (their \"identification type\")\n- Other **process characteristics** available in the seccomp context\n\nBased on this inspection, the gatekeeper makes one of several decisions:\n- **SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW**: \"You're on the approved list—go right in\"\n- **SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO**: \"Access denied—here's an error code explaining why\"\n- **SECCOMP_RET_KILL**: \"You're not supposed to be here at all—security breach!\"\n- **SECCOMP_RET_TRAP**: \"Hold on—let me call the supervisor to handle this special case\"\n\nThe key insight is that this gatekeeper operates at the kernel level, not in user space. Once a seccomp filter is installed and the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag is set, there's no way for the sandboxed process to remove or bypass the filter. Even if an attacker gains complete control of the sandboxed process, they're still constrained by the system call restrictions enforced by the kernel itself.\n\nThis creates a powerful security boundary that complements our namespace and filesystem isolation. An attacker might find ways to escape chroot or manipulate filesystem paths, but they still cannot invoke forbidden system calls like `ptrace` (for debugging other processes), `mount` (for manipulating filesystems), or `socket` (for creating network connections) if these are blocked by the seccomp filter.\n\n### BPF Filter Program Design\n\nBerkeley Packet Filter programs provide the mechanism for implementing sophisticated system call filtering logic. Originally designed for high-performance network packet filtering, BPF has evolved into a general-purpose kernel programming interface. In the context of seccomp, BPF programs examine system call invocations and return decisions about whether to allow or block them.\n\n![Seccomp BPF Filter Evaluation](./diagrams/seccomp-filter-flow.svg)\n\nA **BPF filter program** consists of a sequence of instructions that operate on a virtual machine within the kernel. This virtual machine provides a safe execution environment where filter programs can examine data without risking kernel stability. The BPF instruction set includes arithmetic operations, comparison operations, memory access operations, and control flow operations, but is deliberately constrained to ensure that programs always terminate and cannot cause kernel crashes.\n\nWhen a system call occurs, the kernel creates a **seccomp data structure** containing information about the system call attempt. This structure includes the system call number, the architecture identifier, and all six system call arguments. The BPF program receives a pointer to this data structure and can examine any fields within it to make filtering decisions.\n\nThe fundamental structure of a seccomp BPF program follows this pattern:\n\n1. **Architecture Validation**: First, check that the system call comes from the expected architecture (x86_64, ARM, etc.). Different architectures use different system call numbers for the same operations, so this validation prevents bypass attempts using alternative architectures.\n\n2. **System Call Number Extraction**: Load the system call number from the seccomp data structure and use it as the primary filtering criterion.\n\n3. **Whitelist Comparison**: Compare the system call number against a list of permitted operations. This typically involves a series of conditional jumps that either allow the system call or continue to the next check.\n\n4. **Argument-Level Filtering**: For system calls that require additional scrutiny, examine the arguments to apply more sophisticated filtering rules. For example, an `openat` system call might be allowed only when opening files under specific directory paths.\n\n5. **Default Action**: If no explicit allow rule matches, apply the default action—typically either returning an error or killing the process.\n\nThe BPF instruction format uses a compact representation where each instruction contains an operation code, addressing information, and immediate values or jump offsets. Instructions can perform operations like:\n- **BPF_LD**: Load data from the seccomp structure\n- **BPF_JMP**: Conditional or unconditional jumps for control flow\n- **BPF_ALU**: Arithmetic and logical operations on loaded values\n- **BPF_RET**: Return a seccomp action code\n\nBuilding effective BPF programs requires understanding both the instruction set and the data layout of the seccomp structure. The seccomp data provides access to system call information through fixed offsets, allowing BPF programs to load and examine specific fields efficiently.\n\n| BPF Program Component | Purpose | Key Considerations |\n|----------------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Architecture Check | Prevent bypass via alternative architectures | Must handle x86_64, ARM64, etc. based on target |\n| System Call Lookup | Primary filtering by system call number | Requires architecture-specific syscall mappings |\n| Argument Examination | Fine-grained filtering based on parameters | Limited to simple comparisons and ranges |\n| Return Action | Decision about allowing or blocking call | ALLOW, ERRNO, KILL, or TRAP actions available |\n| Program Validation | Kernel verification of BPF safety | Must prove termination and memory safety |\n\nOne critical aspect of BPF program design is **performance optimization**. Since every system call triggers BPF program execution, inefficient filters can significantly impact application performance. Well-designed programs place the most common system calls early in the decision tree and use jump tables rather than linear searches when possible. However, premature optimization should be avoided—clarity and correctness take precedence over micro-optimizations in most sandbox scenarios.\n\nThe kernel imposes several **safety constraints** on BPF programs that influence their design. Programs must be provably terminating (no infinite loops), cannot access arbitrary kernel memory (only the provided seccomp structure), and cannot perform operations that might compromise kernel stability. The kernel's BPF verifier analyzes every program before allowing its installation, rejecting programs that violate these safety properties.\n\n### System Call Whitelist Strategy\n\nDeveloping an effective system call whitelist requires balancing security restrictions with functional requirements. The challenge lies in identifying the minimal set of system calls necessary for the sandboxed application to operate while blocking all operations that could be used for malicious purposes. This decision significantly impacts both the security posture and the compatibility of the sandbox.\n\nThe **whitelist approach** forms the foundation of secure system call filtering. Rather than attempting to blacklist dangerous operations (which inevitably misses newly discovered attack vectors), a whitelist explicitly enumerates every permitted operation. This approach follows the **principle of least privilege**—start with no permissions and grant only the minimum access required for legitimate functionality.\n\nConstructing an effective whitelist begins with **profiling the target application** to understand its system call usage patterns. This involves running representative workloads under `strace` or similar tracing tools to capture the complete set of system calls invoked during normal operation. The profiling process must cover all code paths, including error handling routines and initialization sequences, to avoid missing essential system calls.\n\nHowever, raw profiling data typically reveals many more system calls than actually necessary. Modern C libraries like glibc implement high-level functions using multiple system calls and may use different implementation strategies depending on kernel version or runtime conditions. For example, file operations might use either `open` or `openat`, and memory allocation might invoke `brk`, `mmap`, or `mmap2` depending on allocation size and system configuration.\n\nThe whitelist construction process involves several refinement steps:\n\n1. **Essential System Calls**: Start with fundamental operations required for any meaningful program execution—memory management (`brk`, `mmap`, `munmap`), process lifecycle (`exit`, `exit_group`), and basic I/O (`read`, `write`).\n\n2. **Application-Specific Operations**: Add system calls required by the specific application being sandboxed. Web servers need socket operations, file processors need filesystem access, computational applications need mathematical libraries.\n\n3. **Library Dependencies**: Include system calls required by shared libraries used by the application. This often includes dynamic linking operations (`mmap` for library loading), locale processing (`open` for locale data), and runtime configuration (`access` for configuration file checks).\n\n4. **Error Handling Paths**: Ensure that error conditions don't trigger forbidden system calls. For example, failed memory allocations might trigger alternative allocation strategies that use different system calls.\n\n5. **Platform Variations**: Account for differences between kernel versions, distributions, and architectures. System call numbers and availability vary significantly across platforms.\n\n| System Call Category | Examples | Security Considerations | Inclusion Strategy |\n|---------------------|----------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Memory Management | `brk`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `madvise` | Required for basic operation, low risk | Always include with argument restrictions |\n| File Operations | `open`, `openat`, `read`, `write`, `close` | High risk if unrestricted | Include with path-based filtering when possible |\n| Process Control | `fork`, `clone`, `execve`, `wait4` | Very high risk, enables privilege escalation | Exclude unless absolutely necessary |\n| Network Operations | `socket`, `connect`, `sendto`, `recvfrom` | High risk, enables data exfiltration | Exclude for offline processing, restrict for network services |\n| System Information | `getpid`, `getuid`, `uname`, `clock_gettime` | Generally safe, information disclosure | Include with minimal restrictions |\n| Signal Handling | `sigaction`, `sigprocmask`, `sigreturn` | Required for proper error handling | Include but monitor for abuse |\n\n**Architecture-specific considerations** add significant complexity to whitelist development. Linux supports multiple processor architectures, each with its own system call numbering scheme. The same logical operation (like reading a file) uses different system call numbers on x86_64 versus ARM64. Additionally, some architectures provide multiple system calls for similar operations—for example, x86_64 has both `open` and `openat` system calls, while newer architectures only provide `openat`.\n\nModern seccomp filtering addresses this by requiring **architecture validation** as the first step in every BPF program. The filter must explicitly check the architecture field in the seccomp data and either handle each supported architecture separately or reject calls from unexpected architectures entirely. This prevents attackers from bypassing filters by switching to alternative architectures or using compatibility layers.\n\nThe **glibc complexity problem** represents one of the most challenging aspects of whitelist development. The GNU C Library implements standard library functions using various system calls, and its implementation strategy can change between versions or based on runtime conditions. For example, `malloc()` might use `brk()` for small allocations and `mmap()` for large ones, but the threshold and exact behavior depend on glibc configuration and heap state.\n\nTo address glibc complexity, many sandbox implementations adopt a **learning mode** approach. They initially run the target application with permissive logging to capture all attempted system calls, then iteratively refine the whitelist based on observed behavior. This process must be repeated across different environments and workloads to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The most secure whitelist is often not the most restrictive one. A whitelist that's too restrictive will force developers to add exceptions or disable filtering entirely, ultimately reducing security. The goal is finding the minimal set that reliably supports legitimate application behavior while blocking meaningful attack vectors.\n\n### Argument-Level Filtering\n\nWhile system call number filtering provides a foundation for sandbox security, many attacks exploit legitimate system calls with malicious arguments rather than using forbidden operations entirely. **Argument-level filtering** extends seccomp protection by examining the parameters passed to allowed system calls and applying additional restrictions based on their values. This approach enables much more sophisticated security policies that can distinguish between safe and dangerous uses of the same system call.\n\nConsider the `openat` system call, which opens files and directories. Blocking `openat` entirely would prevent the sandboxed process from reading any files, making most applications non-functional. However, allowing unrestricted `openat` enables attackers to access sensitive system files, escape chroot restrictions, or open device files for privilege escalation. Argument-level filtering resolves this dilemma by examining the path parameter and allowing only access to safe locations.\n\nThe **seccomp data structure** provides access to all system call arguments through fixed offsets. Each system call can accept up to six arguments, stored as 64-bit values in the seccomp context. BPF programs can load these arguments and apply various filtering operations:\n\n1. **Exact Value Matching**: Compare arguments against specific allowed values. For example, restrict file descriptors to standard input/output/error (0, 1, 2).\n\n2. **Range Checking**: Verify that numeric arguments fall within acceptable ranges. Memory allocation sizes, signal numbers, and priority values often have safe operational ranges.\n\n3. **Bitmask Validation**: Check that flag arguments contain only permitted bit combinations. Many system calls accept flag parameters that control behavior—filtering can ensure only safe flag combinations are used.\n\n4. **Pointer Validation**: Limited validation of pointer arguments, typically checking for null pointers or obvious invalid values (though comprehensive pointer validation requires kernel cooperation).\n\nHowever, argument-level filtering faces significant **technical limitations** that constrain its effectiveness. BPF programs operate in kernel space but cannot safely dereference user space pointers. This means that string arguments (like file paths) cannot be directly examined by the filter program. The BPF program can check whether a pointer is null and validate its numeric value, but cannot inspect the string content it points to.\n\n| Filtering Technique | Applicable Argument Types | Security Benefit | Implementation Complexity |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| Exact Value Match | Integers, flags, file descriptors | High for specific values | Low |\n| Range Validation | Sizes, counts, priorities | Medium for preventing extremes | Low |\n| Bitmask Filtering | Flag combinations, permissions | High for controlling behavior | Medium |\n| Pointer Null Check | All pointer types | Low but prevents crashes | Low |\n| String Content Filtering | File paths, names | Very high but not directly possible | High (requires kernel cooperation) |\n\nThis limitation has led to the development of **hybrid filtering approaches** that combine BPF-based argument filtering with user space policy enforcement. The seccomp filter handles straightforward numeric validation, while more complex string-based policies are implemented through other mechanisms:\n\n- **User Space Helpers**: The BPF program can return `SECCOMP_RET_TRAP`, which triggers a signal handler in user space. The signal handler can examine string arguments and decide whether to allow the operation.\n\n- **Seccomp Notify Extension**: Modern kernels support `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF`, which suspends the system call and notifies a supervisor process. The supervisor can examine all arguments, including string content, and decide whether to allow, modify, or deny the operation.\n\n- **Path-Based Restrictions**: Combine seccomp filtering with filesystem isolation. Rather than trying to filter file paths in BPF, use chroot or mount namespaces to ensure that all accessible paths are safe.\n\nDespite these limitations, argument-level filtering provides valuable security benefits for numeric parameters. Consider these practical examples:\n\n**File Descriptor Validation**: Many attacks involve manipulating file descriptors to access unexpected files. A seccomp filter can restrict file operations to known-safe descriptors. For example, a log processing application might only be allowed to read from file descriptor 3 (the input log) and write to file descriptor 4 (the output file).\n\n**Signal Number Restriction**: The `kill` system call allows sending signals to processes, but many signals can be used maliciously. Argument filtering can restrict signal sending to safe signals like `SIGTERM` while blocking dangerous ones like `SIGSTOP` or `SIGKILL`.\n\n**Memory Protection Flags**: The `mmap` system call accepts protection flags that control whether memory regions are readable, writable, or executable. Argument filtering can block requests for executable memory regions, preventing certain code injection attacks.\n\n**Socket Domain Restrictions**: If network access is required, socket creation can be restricted to specific domains and types. For example, allow only `AF_INET` TCP sockets while blocking `AF_UNIX` domain sockets that might bypass other restrictions.\n\nThe implementation of argument-level filtering requires careful attention to **system call ABI details**. Different architectures pass arguments in different ways, and the seccomp data structure reflects the raw argument values as received by the kernel. This may include pointer values, packed structures, or encoded flags that require specific interpretation logic.\n\n> **Security Principle**: Argument-level filtering is most effective when used to restrict the scope of allowed operations rather than trying to distinguish between safe and unsafe string content. Use it to limit numeric parameters to safe ranges and combine it with other isolation mechanisms for comprehensive protection.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe design of an effective seccomp filtering system involves several critical decisions that significantly impact both security effectiveness and implementation complexity. These architectural choices must balance security goals with practical considerations like performance, maintainability, and compatibility across different environments.\n\n> **Decision: Whitelist vs Blacklist Filtering Strategy**\n> - **Context**: System call filtering can either explicitly allow safe operations (whitelist) or explicitly block dangerous operations (blacklist). This fundamental choice affects the entire security model and determines how new system calls and attack vectors are handled.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Blacklist Approach**: Block known dangerous system calls, allow everything else\n>   2. **Whitelist Approach**: Allow only known safe system calls, block everything else\n>   3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use whitelists for core functionality, blacklists for specific dangerous operations\n> - **Decision**: Implement pure whitelist filtering with comprehensive application profiling\n> - **Rationale**: Blacklist approaches inevitably miss new attack vectors and fail-open when encountering unknown system calls. Whitelists provide stronger security guarantees by defaulting to denial and requiring explicit justification for each permitted operation. While more difficult to implement correctly, whitelists offer better long-term security properties.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires extensive profiling and testing to identify all necessary system calls. May break applications that use uncommon system calls or evolve over time. However, provides strong security guarantees and fails-safe when encountering unexpected operations.\n\n| Filtering Strategy | Security Strength | Implementation Effort | Maintenance Burden | Compatibility Risk |\n|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Blacklist Only | Low - misses new attacks | Low | High - requires tracking new threats | Low |\n| Whitelist Only | High - fails safe | High | Medium - requires app profiling | High |\n| Hybrid Model | Medium - complex interactions | Very High | Very High - dual complexity | Medium |\n\n> **Decision: BPF Program Compilation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: BPF filter programs can be written as raw instruction arrays, generated from higher-level descriptions, or compiled from domain-specific languages. The compilation strategy affects both development productivity and runtime performance.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Hand-Written BPF Instructions**: Directly specify BPF instruction arrays in C\n>   2. **Macro-Based Generation**: Use C macros to generate instruction sequences\n>   3. **Runtime Compilation**: Build BPF programs from configuration at runtime\n> - **Decision**: Use macro-based generation with compile-time optimization\n> - **Rationale**: Hand-written instructions are error-prone and unmaintainable. Runtime compilation adds complexity and potential failure modes. Macro-based generation provides good balance of control and maintainability while ensuring filters are validated at compile time.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires learning BPF instruction patterns and macro systems. However, produces reliable, efficient filters that can be validated during development rather than deployment.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Architecture Support Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Linux runs on multiple processor architectures with different system call numbering schemes. The sandbox must either support multiple architectures or restrict operation to specific platforms.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. **Single Architecture**: Support only x86_64, reject other architectures\n>   2. **Multi-Architecture**: Support x86_64, ARM64, and other common architectures\n>   3. **Runtime Detection**: Automatically adapt to detected architecture\n> - **Decision**: Support x86_64 primarily with explicit architecture validation, framework for adding others\n> - **Rationale**: Multi-architecture support significantly increases complexity and testing requirements. Most deployment environments use x86_64. However, the architecture must be explicitly validated to prevent bypass attacks using alternative architectures or compatibility layers.\n> - **Consequences**: Limits deployment flexibility but reduces complexity and testing burden. Architecture validation prevents certain bypass techniques but requires updates when adding platform support.\n\nThe **filter installation and lifecycle management** represents another crucial architectural decision. Seccomp filters are inherited across fork operations but cannot be removed once installed. This creates constraints around when and how filters are applied within the sandbox creation sequence.\n\nThe optimal filter installation strategy coordinates with other sandbox components:\n\n1. **Pre-Namespace Installation**: Install seccomp filters before creating namespaces to ensure filtering applies to namespace creation operations themselves. However, this prevents the filter from utilizing namespace-based path restrictions.\n\n2. **Post-Filesystem Installation**: Install filters after filesystem isolation is complete, allowing argument-level filtering to assume chroot restrictions are already active. This simplifies filter logic but allows unrestricted system calls during sandbox setup.\n\n3. **Staged Installation**: Use multiple filter installations at different stages, with progressively restrictive policies. Initial filters allow setup operations, final filters enforce strict runtime restrictions.\n\nThe sandbox implementation adopts a **staged installation** approach that balances security and functionality. During the sandbox creation phase, a permissive filter allows necessary setup operations while blocking obviously dangerous calls like `ptrace` and `mount`. After filesystem isolation and other setup is complete, a strict runtime filter replaces the permissive one.\n\n| Installation Stage | Allowed Operations | Security Focus | Implementation Notes |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| Initial Setup | Namespace creation, filesystem operations, resource setup | Prevent obvious attacks during setup | Permissive but blocks dangerous operations |\n| Transition Phase | Final setup operations, privilege dropping | Prepare for strict filtering | Brief window with intermediate restrictions |\n| Runtime Operation | Application-specific whitelist only | Maximum restriction | Permanent strict filtering |\n\n**Performance optimization** considerations influence several architectural decisions. While BPF programs execute very efficiently, system call filtering still adds overhead to every kernel transition. The filter design must minimize this impact through several strategies:\n\n- **Early Exit Optimization**: Place the most frequently used system calls early in the filter decision tree to minimize instruction execution for common operations.\n\n- **Jump Table Organization**: Use structured jump patterns rather than linear searches when checking system call numbers against large whitelists.\n\n- **Argument Validation Ordering**: Perform expensive argument validation only after confirming the system call number is allowed and likely to be used.\n\nHowever, premature optimization should be avoided. The primary goals are correctness and security—performance optimization should only be applied to filters that demonstrably impact application performance under realistic workloads.\n\nThe **error handling strategy** for seccomp violations significantly affects both security and debuggability. When a sandboxed process attempts a forbidden system call, the filter can respond in several ways:\n\n- **SECCOMP_RET_KILL**: Immediately terminate the process with SIGKILL\n- **SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO**: Return a specific error code to the caller\n- **SECCOMP_RET_TRAP**: Trigger a signal handler for custom processing\n\nThe choice between these responses involves trade-offs between security and operational considerations. Killing processes provides the strongest security guarantee but makes debugging difficult and may cause data loss. Returning errors allows graceful handling but may enable attackers to probe the filter and adapt their approach.\n\nThe implementation uses a **differentiated response strategy** based on the severity of the violation. Attempts to use obviously malicious system calls like `ptrace` result in immediate process termination, while attempts to access forbidden files return appropriate error codes. This approach provides strong protection against serious attacks while maintaining reasonable debuggability for legitimate application issues.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nImplementing effective seccomp filtering involves numerous subtle technical challenges that frequently trip up developers, even those experienced with Linux systems programming. Understanding these common mistakes helps avoid security vulnerabilities and implementation problems that could compromise the entire sandbox.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS Before Filter Installation**\n\nOne of the most critical mistakes is installing seccomp filters without first setting the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag. This flag prevents the process from gaining additional privileges through setuid binaries, file capabilities, or other privilege escalation mechanisms. The kernel requires this flag to be set before allowing unprivileged processes to install seccomp filters.\n\nWithout `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, seccomp filter installation will fail with `EACCES` even when running as root, because the kernel cannot guarantee that the filter will remain effective if the process later gains additional privileges. This requirement ensures that seccomp filtering cannot be bypassed through privilege escalation.\n\nThe correct implementation sequence must call `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0)` before any `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &filter)` operation. This flag setting is irreversible and inherited by child processes, ensuring that the security restriction cannot be removed later.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Architecture-Specific System Call Number Confusion**\n\nSystem call numbers vary significantly between processor architectures, and using the wrong numbers can create massive security holes. For example, `__NR_open` has different values on x86_64 versus ARM64, and some system calls exist on one architecture but not others. A filter that works correctly on x86_64 might inadvertently allow dangerous operations on ARM64 if it uses wrong system call numbers.\n\nAdditionally, some 64-bit architectures provide compatibility layers for 32-bit applications, which use entirely different system call numbering schemes. An attacker might attempt to bypass filtering by using 32-bit system call interfaces even on 64-bit systems.\n\nThe solution requires explicit architecture validation as the first step in every BPF program. The filter must check the `arch` field in the seccomp data and either handle each supported architecture correctly or reject calls from unexpected architectures. Never assume that system call numbers are portable between architectures.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Essential glibc System Calls**\n\nModern C library implementations use many more system calls than application developers typically realize. Functions like `malloc()`, `printf()`, and even simple arithmetic operations may trigger unexpected system calls for memory management, locale processing, or dynamic linking. Missing any of these essential calls can cause applications to crash or behave unpredictably.\n\nThe most problematic cases involve system calls that are used only in specific circumstances—error handling paths, memory pressure situations, or particular input patterns. An application might work fine during normal testing but fail in production when these edge cases are encountered.\n\nComprehensive system call profiling is essential, but it must cover all possible execution paths. Use tools like `strace -f` to trace all system calls during extensive testing, including error conditions, resource exhaustion scenarios, and various input types. Additionally, understand that different glibc versions may use different implementation strategies, requiring testing across target environments.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect BPF Program Termination and Validation**\n\nBPF programs must be provably terminating—the kernel's BPF verifier will reject programs that might contain infinite loops or unbounded recursion. However, developers often create inadvertent infinite loops through incorrect jump logic or fail to handle all possible code paths properly.\n\nCommon BPF validation failures include:\n- **Unreachable Code**: Instructions that cannot be reached through any execution path\n- **Uninitialized Register Access**: Attempting to use registers that might not contain valid values\n- **Infinite Loop Potential**: Jump patterns that could theoretically loop forever\n- **Invalid Memory Access**: Attempting to access data outside the provided seccomp structure\n\nThe BPF verifier's error messages can be cryptic and difficult to debug. The best approach is to build BPF programs incrementally, testing each addition with the kernel verifier. Use systematic patterns for jump logic and ensure every execution path reaches a valid return instruction.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Testing of Filter Edge Cases**\n\nSeccomp filters often work correctly for normal application behavior but fail when applications encounter unusual conditions or use less common system call patterns. These edge cases can create security vulnerabilities or operational failures that only manifest in production environments.\n\nCritical edge cases to test include:\n- **Signal Handling**: Ensure signal delivery and handling works correctly with filtering active\n- **Thread Creation**: Verify that threading libraries can function with the restricted system call set\n- **Memory Pressure**: Test behavior when system memory is low and allocation strategies change\n- **File Descriptor Exhaustion**: Check that applications handle file descriptor limits gracefully\n- **Network Timeouts**: For network applications, verify timeout and error handling works correctly\n\nThe testing strategy should include both positive tests (verifying allowed operations work) and negative tests (confirming forbidden operations are blocked). Negative tests are particularly important because they verify the security properties of the filter.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Filter Bypass Through Alternative System Call Interfaces**\n\nLinux provides multiple ways to accomplish many operations, and attackers may attempt to bypass filters by using alternative system call interfaces. For example, file operations can be performed using `open`, `openat`, `creat`, or even `memfd_create` depending on the specific requirements.\n\nSimilarly, memory mapping can be accomplished through `mmap`, `mmap2`, or `mremap`, and process creation might use `fork`, `vfork`, `clone`, or `clone3`. A filter that blocks `open` but allows `openat` might be trivially bypassed.\n\nThe solution requires understanding the complete family of system calls related to each operation and either allowing all safe variants or blocking all potentially dangerous ones. This often involves studying the kernel source code and glibc implementation to understand which system calls are actually used in different scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Argument Validation Complexity and Limitations**\n\nArgument-level filtering appears more powerful than it actually is due to fundamental limitations in what BPF programs can safely examine. Developers often attempt to implement sophisticated string validation or complex data structure inspection that cannot be safely performed in kernel space.\n\nRemember that BPF programs cannot dereference user space pointers, cannot call kernel functions, and have very limited stack space. Attempting to validate file paths, examine structure contents, or perform complex calculations will either fail BPF verification or create security vulnerabilities.\n\nFocus argument validation on simple numeric checks—ranges, exact values, and bitmasks. Use other isolation mechanisms like filesystem namespaces and chroot for complex policy enforcement rather than trying to implement everything in BPF.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Filter Installation Timing and Inheritance**\n\nThe timing of seccomp filter installation relative to other sandbox setup operations critically affects both security and functionality. Installing filters too early can prevent necessary sandbox setup operations, while installing them too late allows a window where dangerous operations are permitted.\n\nAdditionally, seccomp filters are inherited by child processes but cannot be removed once installed. This inheritance behavior affects how the sandbox manages multi-process applications and may require careful coordination between parent and child processes.\n\nPlan the filter installation sequence carefully, potentially using multiple filter stages with progressively stricter policies. Document the security properties of each stage and ensure that the transition between stages cannot be exploited.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nBuilding a robust seccomp filtering system requires careful attention to BPF program construction, system call profiling, and proper integration with the overall sandbox architecture. This implementation guidance provides concrete code patterns and debugging strategies for common seccomp development challenges.\n\n**Technology Recommendations Table:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| BPF Program Generation | Hand-written instruction arrays with helper macros | libseccomp library for high-level policy specification |\n| System Call Profiling | Manual strace analysis with grep/awk scripts | Automated profiling with custom ptrace-based tracer |\n| Architecture Support | Hardcoded x86_64 with explicit validation | Runtime architecture detection with per-arch filters |\n| Filter Testing | Shell scripts with specific test binaries | Comprehensive test framework with fuzzing capabilities |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n\nThe seccomp filtering component integrates with the existing sandbox architecture while maintaining clear separation of concerns:\n\n```\nsandbox/\n  include/\n    seccomp_filter.h         ← public interface definitions\n    bpf_helpers.h           ← BPF instruction generation macros\n  src/\n    seccomp/\n      seccomp_filter.c      ← main filtering implementation\n      bpf_programs.c        ← BPF program generation and compilation\n      syscall_whitelist.c   ← system call whitelist definitions\n      filter_install.c      ← filter installation and lifecycle management\n      seccomp_filter_test.c ← unit tests for filtering logic\n  tools/\n    profile_syscalls.c      ← system call profiling utility\n    test_filter.c          ← filter validation and testing tool\n  config/\n    base_whitelist.h       ← default system call whitelist\n    arch_syscalls.h        ← architecture-specific system call numbers\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\nThe following BPF helper infrastructure provides the foundation for building seccomp filters without requiring deep knowledge of BPF instruction formats:\n\n```c\n// bpf_helpers.h -

For dynamic filters, allocate instruction arrays with `malloc()` and ensure proper cleanup. The kernel copies the filter during installation, so temporary arrays can be freed afterward.\n\n**System Call Number Portability**: Always use `__NR_syscallname` macros from `<sys/syscall.h>` rather than hardcoded numbers. These macros provide architecture-specific values and are the only reliable way to ensure portability.\n\n**Error Handling for prctl()**: The `prctl()` system call returns specific error codes that indicate different failure modes. `EINVAL` suggests invalid arguments or BPF program format, `EACCES` indicates missing `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, and `EFAULT` suggests memory access problems with the filter array.\n\n**BPF Program Size Limits**: The kernel imposes limits on BPF program size and complexity. Keep programs under 4096 instructions and minimize jump complexity. If whitelist size approaches limits, consider splitting into multiple filters or using more efficient instruction patterns.\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter implementing basic seccomp filtering, verify the implementation with these tests:\n\n1. **Basic Installation Test**: Create a minimal filter that allows only `read`, `write`, and `exit_group`. Install the filter and verify a simple program can print a message and exit normally.\n\n2. **Whitelist Enforcement Test**: Create a test program that attempts both allowed and forbidden system calls. Verify that allowed calls succeed and forbidden calls either return appropriate errors or terminate the process.\n\n3. **Architecture Validation Test**: Verify that the BPF program correctly validates architecture and rejects calls from unexpected architectures (this is difficult to test directly but can be verified through BPF program inspection).\n\n4. **Application Compatibility Test**: Run a realistic application (like a simple file processing tool) with comprehensive system call profiling to ensure the whitelist covers all necessary operations.\n\nExpected behavior: Applications should run normally with appropriate whitelists but fail quickly and safely when attempting forbidden operations. The filter should be transparent for normal operation while providing strong security boundaries.\n\n**Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|-----|\n| prctl() fails with EACCES | PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS not set | Check process flags in /proc/self/status | Call prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS) before filter installation |\n| Application crashes immediately | Missing essential system calls | Run with strace to identify blocked calls | Add required syscalls to whitelist |\n| BPF program installation fails | Invalid instruction format | Use kernel BPF verifier error messages | Review instruction generation and program structure |\n| Filter allows forbidden operations | Incorrect syscall numbers or logic | Test with known forbidden calls | Verify architecture-specific syscall numbers |\n\n\n## Resource Limit Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section corresponds to Milestone 4 (Resource Limits with Cgroups) and builds upon the isolation mechanisms from Milestones 1-3, adding resource control to prevent resource exhaustion attacks\n\nThe resource limit component provides the fourth layer of our defense-in-depth strategy, addressing resource-based attacks that can occur even within isolated namespaces and restricted system calls. While namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, and seccomp filtering control **what** a sandboxed process can access, cgroups control **how much** of each system resource the process can consume. This distinction is crucial because a compromised process might attempt to exhaust system resources as a denial-of-service attack or to trigger out-of-memory conditions that could lead to privilege escalation opportunities.\n\n### Mental Model: The Resource Allocation Department\n\nThink of cgroups as a **bureaucratic resource allocation department** within the Linux kernel. Just as a corporate IT department tracks and limits how much computing resources, storage quota, and network bandwidth each department can use, cgroups create accounting ledgers and enforcement policies for system resources on a per-process-group basis.\n\nIn this analogy, the **cgroup hierarchy** represents the organizational chart of departments and sub-departments. Each department (cgroup) has its own resource budget allocated by the parent department. The **cgroup controllers** are like specialized accounting divisions - the memory controller tracks RAM usage like a facilities manager tracking office space, the CPU controller manages processor time like a project manager allocating developer hours, and the I/O controller monitors disk bandwidth like a network administrator managing traffic quotas.\n\nWhen a sandboxed process attempts to consume resources, it's like an employee making a resource request. The appropriate controller checks the current usage against the allocated budget. If the request would exceed the limit, the controller acts like a strict department head - it either denies the request (returning ENOMEM for memory), throttles the resource allocation (CPU time slicing), or queues the request until resources become available (I/O bandwidth limiting).\n\nThis mental model helps explain why cgroups are hierarchical (departments can have sub-departments with smaller budgets), why limits are enforced at allocation time rather than after the fact (good accounting prevents overspending), and why different controllers operate independently (different types of resources require different accounting methods).\n\nThe key insight is that cgroups provide **proactive resource governance** rather than reactive monitoring. They prevent resource exhaustion before it happens, rather than detecting it after the system is already under stress.\n\n### Cgroup Controllers and Limits\n\nThe cgroups subsystem provides several **controllers**, each responsible for managing a specific type of system resource. Our sandbox leverages four primary controllers that address the most common resource exhaustion attack vectors: memory consumption, CPU utilization, process proliferation, and I/O bandwidth abuse.\n\n| Controller | Resource Managed | Primary Limits | Attack Vector Prevented |\n|------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| memory | RAM and swap usage | memory.limit_in_bytes, memory.soft_limit_in_bytes | Memory exhaustion, OOM conditions |\n| cpu | Processor time allocation | cpu.cfs_quota_us, cpu.cfs_period_us | CPU starvation, busy loops |\n| pids | Process and thread count | pids.max | Fork bombs, process exhaustion |\n| blkio | Block device I/O | blkio.throttle.read_bps_device, blkio.throttle.write_bps_device | I/O flooding, disk thrashing |\n\nThe **memory controller** operates by tracking page allocations and maintaining running totals of resident memory usage. When a sandboxed process requests memory allocation (through malloc, mmap, or stack growth), the kernel consults the memory cgroup's current usage against its configured limit. If the allocation would exceed the limit, the kernel triggers the Out of Memory (OOM) killer specifically within that cgroup, terminating processes within the sandbox without affecting the host system.\n\nMemory limits are configured through two primary mechanisms: **hard limits** that trigger immediate OOM killing when exceeded, and **soft limits** that allow temporary exceedances but prioritize reclaiming memory from processes that exceed their soft allocation. For sandbox environments, hard limits provide more predictable behavior since they create deterministic boundaries that cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.\n\nThe **CPU controller** uses the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) bandwidth control mechanism to allocate processor time. Rather than setting absolute CPU percentages, it configures quotas and periods - for example, a quota of 50,000 microseconds within a period of 100,000 microseconds effectively limits the cgroup to 50% of one CPU core. This approach scales properly across systems with different numbers of CPU cores and provides more granular control than simple percentage-based limiting.\n\nCPU throttling operates by tracking the cumulative CPU time consumed by all processes within the cgroup during each scheduling period. When the quota is exhausted, all processes in the cgroup are removed from the scheduler's run queue until the next period begins. This creates predictable CPU allocation that prevents CPU starvation attacks while maintaining fair scheduling for legitimate workloads.\n\nThe **PID controller** provides a simple but critical safeguard against fork bomb attacks. By setting `pids.max` to a reasonable value (typically 32-128 processes for most sandbox workloads), it prevents malicious code from creating thousands of processes that could exhaust the system's process table or memory resources. The PID controller tracks both processes and threads, preventing attackers from circumventing limits by using threads instead of processes.\n\nThe **block I/O controller** manages disk bandwidth by setting per-device read and write limits measured in bytes per second. This prevents sandboxed processes from saturating disk I/O channels with large read or write operations that could impact host system performance. I/O throttling is implemented through request queuing - when a process exceeds its bandwidth allocation, additional I/O requests are queued and processed at the configured rate limit.\n\n| Limit Type | Configuration Parameter | Typical Sandbox Value | Enforcement Behavior |\n|------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Memory Hard Limit | memory.limit_in_bytes | 64MB - 256MB | OOM kill on exceed |\n| CPU Quota | cpu.cfs_quota_us / cpu.cfs_period_us | 10% - 50% of one core | Throttle scheduling |\n| Process Count | pids.max | 32 - 128 processes | EAGAIN on fork() |\n| Read Bandwidth | blkio.throttle.read_bps_device | 10MB/s - 100MB/s | Queue excess requests |\n| Write Bandwidth | blkio.throttle.write_bps_device | 5MB/s - 50MB/s | Queue excess requests |\n\n### Cgroup Hierarchy Management\n\nCgroups organize resources through a **hierarchical filesystem interface** mounted at `/sys/fs/cgroup`. This hierarchy reflects resource inheritance relationships - child cgroups inherit resource limits from their parents and can further subdivide allocated resources among their own children. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for properly isolating sandbox instances from each other and from the host system.\n\n![Cgroup Hierarchy](./diagrams/cgroup-hierarchy.svg)\n\nThe filesystem interface means that creating and configuring cgroups involves standard filesystem operations: creating directories establishes new cgroups, writing to special files configures limits, and reading from these files monitors current usage. This design provides a uniform interface for cgroup management that integrates well with existing system administration tools and scripts.\n\nFor sandbox environments, we typically create a dedicated hierarchy structure that isolates all sandbox instances under a common parent cgroup while providing individual resource allocation for each sandbox instance:\n\n```\n/sys/fs/cgroup/\n├── sandbox-parent/                    ← Common parent for all sandboxes\n│   ├── memory.limit_in_bytes         ← Total memory pool for all sandboxes\n│   ├── cpu.cfs_quota_us              ← Total CPU allocation for sandbox system\n│   └── instance-<uuid>/              ← Individual sandbox instance\n│       ├── memory.limit_in_bytes     ← Per-instance memory limit\n│       ├── cpu.cfs_quota_us          ← Per-instance CPU quota\n│       ├── pids.max                  ← Per-instance process limit\n│       └── cgroup.procs              ← Process membership file\n```\n\nThis hierarchical structure provides several important benefits. First, it enables **resource isolation between sandbox instances** - one sandbox cannot consume resources allocated to another sandbox, even if both are running on the same host. Second, it provides **aggregate resource control** - the parent cgroup can limit the total resources consumed by the entire sandbox system, preventing it from impacting other host services. Third, it simplifies **cleanup and management** - removing the parent directory recursively cleans up all child cgroups automatically.\n\nCgroup creation requires careful attention to the **order of operations**. The kernel automatically creates certain control files when a cgroup directory is created, but these files only become writable after the appropriate controllers are enabled in the parent cgroup's `cgroup.subtree_control` file. This means the controller enablement must propagate down the hierarchy before child cgroups can configure their limits.\n\nProcess membership in cgroups is managed through the `cgroup.procs` file, which contains the PID of every process currently assigned to that cgroup. Writing a PID to this file moves the process into the cgroup, automatically removing it from its previous cgroup. This mechanism provides **atomic process migration** that ensures every process belongs to exactly one cgroup for each controller type at any given time.\n\n| Hierarchy Level | Purpose | Configuration Responsibilities | Cleanup Requirements |\n|-----------------|---------|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Root Cgroup | System-wide defaults | Enable controllers for descendants | N/A (persistent) |\n| Sandbox Parent | Aggregate sandbox limits | Total resource pool, controller enablement | Remove after all instances |\n| Instance Cgroup | Per-sandbox limits | Individual resource quotas, process membership | Remove after process termination |\n\nThe hierarchical nature also enables **resource limit inheritance and override patterns**. A parent cgroup can set conservative default limits that apply to all children, while individual child cgroups can set more restrictive limits based on their specific workload requirements. However, child cgroups cannot exceed the resource allocations of their parents - the kernel enforces this constraint automatically.\n\n### Limit Enforcement and Monitoring\n\nCgroup limit enforcement operates through **kernel-level resource accounting** that intercepts resource allocation requests at the point they occur. This proactive enforcement model prevents resource exhaustion attacks by denying excessive resource requests before they can impact system stability, rather than attempting to reclaim resources after problems have already occurred.\n\n**Memory limit enforcement** occurs during page allocation operations within the kernel memory management subsystem. When a process requests additional memory through system calls like `brk()`, `mmap()`, or during page fault handling, the kernel checks the requesting process's memory cgroup usage against its configured limits. If the allocation would exceed the hard limit, the kernel immediately returns ENOMEM to the requesting process and may invoke the OOM killer to terminate processes within the cgroup to free memory.\n\nThe OOM killer behavior within cgroups is **scope-limited** to the violating cgroup, meaning it only considers processes within the same cgroup as candidates for termination. This provides important isolation guarantees - a memory-exhausting sandbox cannot trigger OOM killing of host processes or processes in other sandboxes. The kernel selects OOM victims based on a scoring algorithm that considers memory usage, process age, and OOM adjustment values.\n\n**CPU limit enforcement** integrates with the kernel's process scheduler to implement **bandwidth throttling**. The CFS scheduler tracks the cumulative CPU time consumed by all processes within a cgroup during each scheduling period (typically 100 milliseconds). When the configured quota is exhausted, all processes in the cgroup are removed from the scheduler's run queues and cannot be scheduled for execution until the next period begins.\n\nThis enforcement mechanism provides **guaranteed CPU isolation** between cgroups while maintaining fair scheduling within each cgroup. Processes within a throttled cgroup continue to compete fairly with each other for their allocated CPU time, but cannot consume CPU cycles beyond their quota regardless of system load or availability of idle CPU time.\n\n**Process limit enforcement** occurs at `fork()` and `clone()` system call sites within the kernel. Before creating a new process or thread, the kernel increments the PID cgroup's process count and checks it against the configured maximum. If the limit would be exceeded, the system call fails with EAGAIN, preventing the process creation. This provides immediate feedback to applications that attempt to create excessive numbers of processes.\n\n**I/O bandwidth enforcement** operates through the block layer's request queuing mechanism. When processes issue read or write requests that would exceed their configured bandwidth limits, the block I/O scheduler places these requests in a throttling queue and processes them at the configured rate. This creates **smooth I/O rate limiting** that prevents I/O flooding while allowing processes to make progress at their allocated bandwidth.\n\nResource monitoring capabilities provide real-time visibility into resource consumption patterns and limit violations. Each cgroup controller exposes usage statistics through filesystem interfaces that can be polled programmatically or monitored by system administration tools.\n\n| Monitoring File | Information Provided | Usage Pattern | Alert Thresholds |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| memory.usage_in_bytes | Current memory consumption | Poll every 1-5 seconds | >90% of limit |\n| memory.failcnt | Count of allocation failures | Check after process termination | Any non-zero value |\n| cpu.stat | CPU time and throttling events | Poll every 5-30 seconds | High throttle ratio |\n| pids.current | Current process/thread count | Poll when fork() fails | Approaching pids.max |\n| blkio.throttle.io_service_bytes | I/O bytes transferred | Poll every 10-60 seconds | Sustained limit hitting |\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe design and implementation of cgroup resource limiting requires several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact security effectiveness, performance characteristics, and operational complexity. These decisions must balance the competing requirements of strong resource isolation, minimal performance overhead, and maintainable system architecture.\n\n> **Decision: Cgroups v1 vs v2 Selection**\n> - **Context**: Linux systems may support cgroups v1 (legacy), cgroups v2 (unified hierarchy), or both simultaneously. The sandbox system must choose which version to use for resource limiting, with implications for feature availability, performance, and compatibility.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Cgroups v1 with separate controller hierarchies\n>   2. Cgroups v2 with unified hierarchy\n>   3. Hybrid approach detecting available version at runtime\n> - **Decision**: Use cgroups v2 when available, fall back to v1 for compatibility\n> - **Rationale**: Cgroups v2 provides simplified management through unified hierarchy, better resource control granularity, improved performance through reduced overhead, and enhanced security through better privilege delegation. However, older systems may only support v1, making fallback necessary for broad compatibility.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables access to advanced v2 features like enhanced memory control and improved CPU isolation while maintaining compatibility with older systems. Requires implementing dual code paths and version detection logic.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|---------|------|------|---------|\n| Cgroups v1 Only | Universal compatibility, well-documented, stable API | Separate hierarchies complex, limited delegation, performance overhead | No |\n| Cgroups v2 Only | Unified hierarchy, better performance, enhanced features | Limited compatibility, newer feature set | No |\n| Hybrid v2/v1 | Best features when available, broad compatibility | Additional complexity, dual maintenance | **Yes** |\n\n> **Decision: Controller Selection Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Cgroups provides numerous controllers for different resource types (memory, CPU, I/O, network, devices, etc.). The sandbox must determine which controllers to enable and configure, balancing security coverage against complexity and performance overhead.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Enable all available controllers for maximum security\n>   2. Enable minimal controller set (memory, CPU, PID only)\n>   3. Configurable controller selection based on workload requirements\n> - **Decision**: Enable core controllers (memory, CPU, PID, I/O) by default with optional additional controllers\n> - **Rationale**: Memory, CPU, and PID controllers address the most common resource exhaustion attack vectors with minimal overhead. I/O controller prevents disk flooding attacks. Additional controllers like network or devices can be enabled for specific high-security scenarios but add complexity and overhead for general use cases.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides strong protection against primary resource exhaustion attacks while maintaining good performance. Allows specialized deployments to enable additional controllers as needed.\n\n> **Decision: Default Resource Limit Values**\n> - **Context**: The sandbox system must establish default resource limits that provide security without unnecessarily constraining legitimate workloads. These limits affect both security effectiveness and usability, requiring careful balance between restriction and functionality.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Very restrictive defaults (16MB memory, 5% CPU) prioritizing security\n>   2. Permissive defaults (1GB memory, 100% CPU) prioritizing compatibility\n>   3. Moderate defaults (128MB memory, 25% CPU) balancing security and usability\n> - **Decision**: Moderate defaults with easy configuration override\n> - **Rationale**: Very restrictive defaults would break many legitimate applications and create poor user experience. Permissive defaults provide insufficient protection against resource exhaustion attacks. Moderate defaults accommodate most legitimate workloads while providing meaningful resource constraint.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables sandbox system to work well \"out of the box\" for common use cases while maintaining reasonable security boundaries. Users can tighten limits for high-security scenarios or relax them for resource-intensive applications.\n\n| Resource Type | Conservative Default | Moderate Default | Permissive Default | Chosen |\n|----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Memory Limit | 16MB | 128MB | 1GB | **128MB** |\n| CPU Quota | 5% of one core | 25% of one core | 100% of one core | **25%** |\n| Process Limit | 8 processes | 32 processes | 256 processes | **32** |\n| I/O Read Bandwidth | 1MB/s | 10MB/s | Unlimited | **10MB/s** |\n| I/O Write Bandwidth | 512KB/s | 5MB/s | Unlimited | **5MB/s** |\n\n> **Decision: Cgroup Hierarchy Organization**\n> - **Context**: The sandbox system must organize cgroup hierarchies to provide isolation between sandbox instances while enabling efficient management and cleanup. Different organizational patterns have implications for resource sharing, isolation guarantees, and administrative overhead.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Flat hierarchy with all sandboxes as siblings under root\n>   2. Two-level hierarchy with sandbox parent containing instance children\n>   3. Multi-level hierarchy organized by user, application, and instance\n> - **Decision**: Two-level hierarchy with dedicated sandbox parent cgroup\n> - **Rationale**: Flat hierarchy provides no aggregate resource control and complicates cleanup. Multi-level hierarchy adds unnecessary complexity for most use cases. Two-level approach provides aggregate resource control, simplifies cleanup through parent removal, and enables resource sharing policies between sandbox instances when desired.\n> - **Consequences**: Simplifies resource management and cleanup while providing good isolation. Enables aggregate resource policies for the entire sandbox system. May require additional levels for complex multi-tenant scenarios.\n\nThe architecture decisions collectively create a resource limiting system that prioritizes **practical security** over theoretical maximum restriction. By choosing moderate defaults, hybrid cgroup version support, and essential controller enablement, the system provides strong resource exhaustion protection while remaining usable for a wide variety of legitimate applications.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nResource limit implementation with cgroups involves several subtle failure modes that can compromise security effectiveness or system stability. Understanding these pitfalls and their prevention strategies is essential for building reliable sandbox systems.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Permission Management**\n\nCgroup operations require specific privileges that vary between cgroups v1 and v2, and many developers underestimate the permission requirements for cgroup management. Simply running as root is insufficient - the process needs appropriate capabilities and must handle permission delegation correctly for child processes.\n\nIn cgroups v1, writing to controller-specific files like `memory.limit_in_bytes` requires root privileges, but the process also needs write access to `cgroup.procs` to add processes to the cgroup. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where the sandbox launcher needs root privileges to set up limits, but the sandboxed process should run with dropped privileges.\n\nThe common mistake is attempting to configure cgroup limits from within the sandboxed process after privileges have been dropped. This fails because the process no longer has sufficient privileges to write to cgroup control files. The correct approach is to configure all cgroup settings from the privileged parent process before spawning the sandboxed child.\n\n**Prevention**: Configure all cgroup limits and settings from the privileged launcher process before spawning the sandboxed child. Use file descriptor passing or other IPC mechanisms to communicate cgroup paths to child processes that need to monitor their resource usage but not modify limits.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Controller Enablement Propagation**\n\nCgroups v2 requires explicit controller enablement in parent cgroups before child cgroups can use those controllers. Many developers forget that controller availability propagates down the hierarchy - if a controller is not enabled in a parent cgroup's `cgroup.subtree_control`, child cgroups cannot use that controller even if it's available at the system level.\n\nThis creates confusing error conditions where attempting to write to `memory.max` in a child cgroup fails with \"Operation not permitted\" even when running as root, because the memory controller was never enabled in the parent cgroup. The error messages are often misleading and don't clearly indicate the controller enablement issue.\n\n**Prevention**: Implement systematic controller enablement that propagates from the root cgroup down to the target cgroup level. Check `cgroup.controllers` to verify available controllers and write to `cgroup.subtree_control` to enable controllers for child cgroups before creating those children.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Process Migration**\n\nMoving processes into cgroups involves writing PIDs to `cgroup.procs`, but this operation is racy - the process might exit between the time you obtain its PID and when you write it to the cgroup file. This is particularly problematic when trying to move short-lived processes or when the target process is already under resource pressure.\n\nAdditionally, multi-threaded processes require special handling because individual threads cannot be moved to different cgroups independently. Attempting to write a thread ID (TID) to `cgroup.procs` results in moving the entire process including all its threads.\n\n**Prevention**: Perform process migration immediately after fork() but before exec() when the child process is still under parent control. Use the `cgroup.threads` interface (cgroups v2) when thread-level granularity is needed, but understand the additional complexity and limitations this introduces.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Limit Calculation Errors**\n\nResource limits require careful calculation to account for system architecture differences and kernel accounting overhead. Memory limits specified in bytes may not account for kernel memory overhead, page alignment requirements, or memory used by shared libraries that may be charged to the cgroup.\n\nCPU limits using CFS quotas are specified in microseconds and require understanding the relationship between quota and period values. A common mistake is setting CPU quotas without considering the number of available CPU cores - setting a 100,000 microsecond quota with a 100,000 microsecond period limits the cgroup to 100% of one CPU core, not 100% of system CPU capacity.\n\n**Prevention**: Always specify memory limits with headroom above the expected application memory usage (typically 20-30% overhead). For CPU limits, explicitly calculate quotas relative to desired percentage of total system CPU capacity. Test resource limits under realistic workload conditions to verify they provide adequate resources for legitimate operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Cleanup and Resource Leaks**\n\nCgroup cleanup requires careful ordering to avoid resource leaks and permission errors. Attempting to remove a cgroup directory while processes are still assigned to it fails, but processes may continue running even after the parent process exits if they've daemonized or been inherited by init.\n\nThe cleanup process must also handle hierarchical dependencies - child cgroups must be removed before their parents, and all processes must be terminated or migrated before cgroup removal. Failing to clean up cgroups properly leads to resource leaks where system resources remain allocated to non-existent sandbox instances.\n\n**Prevention**: Implement systematic cleanup that first terminates all processes in the cgroup (using SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL), waits for process exit, then removes child cgroups before parent cgroups. Use `find /sys/fs/cgroup -name \"*sandbox*\" -type d` to identify leaked cgroups during development and testing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cgroups Version Detection Failures**\n\nSystems may support both cgroups v1 and v2 simultaneously, with different controllers available through each interface. Simply checking for the existence of `/sys/fs/cgroup/unified` is insufficient to determine v2 availability - the system may have v2 mounted but with limited controller support.\n\nDetection logic must verify not only that cgroups v2 is available, but that the required controllers (memory, CPU, PID, I/O) are available and can be enabled for the sandbox hierarchy. Fallback logic must gracefully handle scenarios where some controllers are only available through v1 interfaces.\n\n**Prevention**: Implement comprehensive version detection that checks controller availability in both v1 and v2 interfaces. Create capability matrices that map required functionality to available controller interfaces. Test detection logic on systems with different cgroup configurations including hybrid setups.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe cgroup resource management component bridges the gap between Linux kernel resource control mechanisms and practical sandbox resource limiting. This implementation provides both the low-level cgroup manipulation primitives and the higher-level resource policy management needed to create secure, isolated execution environments.\n\n####

formatting when building cgroup file paths to prevent buffer overflows\n- Handle `EINTR` when reading from cgroup files as operations may be interrupted by signals  \n- Use `strtoul()` and `strtoull()` for parsing numeric values from cgroup stat files with proper error checking\n- Remember that cgroup file writes may fail with `EBUSY` if the cgroup contains running processes during certain operations\n- Use `access()` with `W_OK` to check write permissions before attempting to modify cgroup control files\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Always `free()` the cgroup_state_t structure and its allocated strings in the cleanup function\n- Use `strdup()` for copying strings into the state structure and check for allocation failures\n- Consider using a memory pool or arena allocator for cgroup path strings to reduce fragmentation\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Return negative errno values for system call failures to provide detailed error information\n- Use consistent error codes (`SANDBOX_ERROR_CGROUP`) for cgroup-specific failures that aren't system call related\n- Log error details with `perror()` or `strerror()` when system calls fail for debugging assistance\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the cgroup resource management component, verify correct functionality with these validation steps:\n\n**Basic Functionality Test:**\n```bash\n# Compile and run basic cgroup test\ngcc -o test_cgroup src/cgroup/*.c src/utils/*.c tests/cgroup/test_cgroup_mgr.c\nsudo ./test_cgroup\n\n# Expected output should show:\n# - Detected cgroup version (v1, v2, or hybrid)\n# - Available controllers (memory, cpu, pids, io)\n# - Successfully created cgroup hierarchy\n# - Configured resource limits without errors\n# - Added test process to cgroup\n# - Read back resource usage statistics\n# - Cleaned up cgroup hierarchy\n```\n\n**Integration Test with Previous Milestones:**\n```bash\n# Run complete sandbox with resource limits\nsudo ./sandbox --memory-limit 64M --cpu-percent 10 --pid-limit 16 /bin/sh -c 'echo \"Testing resource limits\"'\n\n# Verify resource constraints:\n# 1. Memory limit should be visible in /sys/fs/cgroup/.../memory.max (or memory.limit_in_bytes)\n# 2. CPU limit should be configured in cpu.max (or cpu.cfs_quota_us)  \n# 3. Process should be listed in cgroup.procs file\n# 4. Resource usage should be trackable in usage files\n```\n\n**Resource Limit Enforcement Test:**\n```bash\n# Test memory limit enforcement (should terminate with OOM)\nsudo ./sandbox --memory-limit 32M /bin/sh -c 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=64'\n\n# Test CPU limit enforcement (should show throttling in cpu.stat)\nsudo ./sandbox --cpu-percent 10 /bin/sh -c 'yes > /dev/null' &\nsleep 5\n# Check cpu.stat file for nr_throttled events\n\n# Test process limit enforcement (should fail with EAGAIN)\nsudo ./sandbox --pid-limit 4 /bin/bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do sleep 60 & done'\n```\n\n**Signs of Problems and Debugging:**\n- **\"Operation not permitted\" when writing cgroup files**: Check that you're running as root and that parent cgroups have appropriate controllers enabled\n- **Cgroup creation fails**: Verify that cgroup filesystem is mounted and writable, check `dmesg` for kernel cgroup errors\n- **Resource limits not enforced**: Confirm that processes are actually assigned to the cgroup by checking `cgroup.procs` file contents\n- **Cleanup failures**: Check for zombie processes that prevent cgroup removal, use `kill -9` on stubborn processes\n- **Controller not available**: Verify kernel configuration includes required cgroup controllers (`CONFIG_MEMCG`, `CONFIG_CPU_SETS`, etc.)\n\nThe successful completion of this milestone provides the foundation for comprehensive resource management that prevents resource exhaustion attacks while maintaining usable performance boundaries for legitimate sandbox workloads.\n\n\n## Capability Management Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section corresponds to Milestone 5 (Capability Dropping) and represents the final security layer, building upon all previous isolation mechanisms from Milestones 1-4 to achieve complete privilege minimization\n\nThe capability management component represents the final layer in our defense-in-depth sandbox architecture. After establishing namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, and resource limits, we must address one critical remaining attack vector: **privilege escalation**. Even within a heavily restricted environment, a process running with unnecessary Linux capabilities retains pathways to break out of the sandbox or cause system-wide damage.\n\n### Mental Model: The Security Clearance System\n\nThink of Linux capabilities as a **government security clearance system**. In traditional Unix systems, processes are either \"civilians\" (regular users) or \"generals\" (root with unlimited power). This binary model creates a dangerous situation: any process that needs even one privileged operation must be granted the equivalent of top-secret clearance, giving it access to far more than it actually requires.\n\nLinux capabilities solve this problem by subdividing root's omnipotent powers into specific, granular permissions—like specialized security clearances in a military organization. Instead of giving someone \"access to everything classified,\" you can grant specific clearances: \"authorized to access network configuration files,\" \"permitted to bind to privileged ports,\" or \"allowed to modify process scheduling.\" Each capability represents a different type of security clearance that can be granted or revoked independently.\n\nJust as a military organization follows the principle of least privilege—granting only the minimum clearance level needed for each job—our sandbox must systematically drop all capabilities except those absolutely essential for the sandboxed workload. A document editor doesn't need network administration capabilities, and a computational task doesn't need the ability to mount filesystems.\n\nThe complexity arises from Linux's sophisticated capability inheritance model. When a process spawns children or executes new programs, different rules govern which security clearances transfer automatically, which must be explicitly granted, and which are permanently revoked. Understanding these inheritance patterns is crucial for maintaining security across process boundaries and preventing accidental privilege escalation.\n\n### Capability Sets and Inheritance\n\nLinux implements capabilities through five distinct capability sets that govern how privileges are managed and inherited across process execution boundaries. Each set serves a specific role in the overall security model, and understanding their interactions is essential for safely dropping privileges.\n\n| Capability Set | Purpose | Inheritance Behavior | Security Impact |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Effective** | Currently active privileges | Reset on exec, must be explicitly activated | Controls what the process can do right now |\n| **Permitted** | Maximum possible privileges | Inherited based on file capabilities and other sets | Upper bound for effective capabilities |\n| **Inheritable** | Privileges that can transfer to child processes | Preserved across exec if file allows | Determines what children can potentially inherit |\n| **Bounding** | System-wide privilege ceiling | Cannot be raised, only lowered | Prevents any process from gaining specific capabilities |\n| **Ambient** | Simplified inheritance for unprivileged processes | Automatically becomes effective after exec | Provides easier capability management for non-root |\n\nThe **effective set** contains capabilities that are currently active and usable by the process. These are the actual privileges the process can exercise at any given moment. When a process calls a privileged operation, the kernel checks this set to determine authorization. The effective set can be modified during runtime by adding capabilities from the permitted set or removing capabilities entirely.\n\nThe **permitted set** represents the maximum capabilities the process could potentially activate. Think of this as a pool of available privileges that the process can draw from to populate its effective set. The permitted set cannot be expanded beyond its current contents, but capabilities can be permanently dropped from it. This set plays a crucial role during exec operations, as it determines what privileges survive the transition to a new program.\n\nThe **inheritable set** controls which capabilities can be passed to child processes during exec operations. However, inheritance is not automatic—it depends on complex interactions with the target executable's file capabilities and the ambient set. This set is preserved across exec boundaries but only becomes active in the child if specific conditions are met.\n\nThe **bounding set** functions as a system-wide capability ceiling. No process can acquire capabilities that are not present in the bounding set, regardless of file capabilities or inheritance rules. Dropping capabilities from the bounding set is a one-way operation that affects the current process and all its descendants, making it a powerful tool for permanent privilege reduction.\n\nThe **ambient set** provides a simplified inheritance mechanism designed for unprivileged processes. Capabilities in the ambient set automatically become effective in child processes after exec, eliminating the need for complex file capability configurations. However, ambient capabilities pose security risks if not carefully managed.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Capability Dropping Strategy**\n> - **Context**: We need to determine which capability sets to modify and in what order to achieve maximum security while maintaining functionality\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Drop only from effective set (preserves potential for re-elevation)\n>   2. Drop from all sets simultaneously (may cause unexpected failures)\n>   3. Systematic dropping: bounding → ambient → inheritable → permitted → effective\n> - **Decision**: Use systematic dropping with verification at each step\n> - **Rationale**: This approach provides defense in depth by creating multiple barriers to privilege escalation while allowing us to detect issues early in the process\n> - **Consequences**: More complex implementation but maximum security assurance and better debugging capability\n\nThe capability inheritance algorithm during exec operations follows intricate rules that combine file capabilities, process capabilities, and security policies. When a process executes a new program, the kernel calculates the new capability sets using formulas that consider the current process capabilities, the target file's capabilities, and various security flags.\n\nFor unprivileged processes (non-root), the inheritance calculation is:\n1. New permitted = (current inheritable & file inheritable) | (file permitted & capability bounding set)\n2. New effective = file effective ? new permitted : empty set\n3. New inheritable = current inheritable & file inheritable\n4. New ambient = current ambient if program allows, otherwise empty\n\nThese inheritance rules create several security implications that our sandbox must address. Most critically, any capabilities left in the inheritable set could potentially transfer to child processes if they execute programs with matching file capabilities. Similarly, capabilities remaining in the ambient set automatically become effective in child processes, creating a straightforward privilege escalation path.\n\n### Privilege Dropping Algorithm\n\nThe process of safely dropping Linux capabilities requires careful orchestration of multiple operations in a specific sequence. The order of operations is critical because certain steps are irreversible, and incorrect sequencing can leave the process in an inconsistent security state or cause legitimate operations to fail unexpectedly.\n\nThe complete privilege dropping algorithm proceeds through several phases, each with specific verification steps:\n\n1. **Capability Assessment Phase**: The first step involves querying the current process capabilities across all five capability sets. This assessment provides a baseline for verification and helps identify which capabilities are currently active. The `capget` system call retrieves the current capability state, which we store for comparison after each dropping operation.\n\n2. **Bounding Set Reduction Phase**: We begin by dropping capabilities from the bounding set because this operation creates a permanent ceiling that cannot be raised. Each capability not explicitly required for the sandboxed workload is removed using the `prctl` system call with `PR_CAPBSET_DROP`. This operation requires `CAP_SETPCAP` capability, so it must be performed before dropping that capability from our own sets.\n\n3. **Ambient Set Clearing Phase**: The ambient capability set is cleared entirely because these capabilities automatically become effective in child processes. The `prctl` system call with `PR_CAP_AMBIENT` and `PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL` removes all ambient capabilities in a single operation. This prevents child processes from inheriting unexpected privileges.\n\n4. **User and Group Transition Phase**: Before dropping the remaining capability sets, we transition to the target user and group identities. This step is crucial because changing user ID typically clears many capability sets automatically. The sequence is: `setgid`, `setgroups`, then `setuid`. Each operation must be verified to ensure it succeeded.\n\n5. **Inheritable Set Clearing Phase**: The inheritable capability set is cleared to prevent any capabilities from transferring to child processes through the inheritance mechanism. This operation uses `capset` system call to explicitly set the inheritable set to empty.\n\n6. **Permitted Set Reduction Phase**: Capabilities are removed from the permitted set, leaving only those absolutely necessary for the sandboxed workload. This step requires careful analysis of the target program's requirements, as dropping essential capabilities will cause the program to fail when it attempts privileged operations.\n\n7. **Effective Set Minimization Phase**: Finally, the effective capability set is reduced to match the permitted set or further restricted based on immediate needs. This set can be modified during runtime, so we set it to the minimum required for program startup.\n\n8. **No New Privileges Flag**: The `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag is set using `prctl` to prevent the process and its children from gaining privileges through exec operations, even if they execute setuid programs or programs with file capabilities.\n\nEach phase includes verification steps to ensure the operations succeeded and the process is in the expected security state. The verification process re-reads the capability sets and compares them against expected values, providing immediate detection of any failures in the privilege dropping process.\n\n> The critical insight in capability dropping is that it's a one-way operation with complex interdependencies. Once capabilities are dropped from certain sets, they cannot be recovered, making verification at each step essential for debugging and security assurance.\n\nThe algorithm must also handle several edge cases and error conditions. If the target program requires capabilities that were accidentally dropped, the error typically manifests as `EPERM` errors when the program attempts privileged operations. The algorithm includes rollback provisions for non-critical failures, but certain operations like bounding set modifications cannot be undone.\n\n### No New Privileges Flag\n\nThe `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag represents a fundamental security mechanism that prevents privilege escalation through exec operations. This flag creates an irreversible security boundary that blocks several common attack vectors used to escape from restricted environments.\n\nWhen `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` is set, the kernel prevents the process and all its descendants from gaining privileges in several ways. First, it disables the setuid and setgid bits on executable files. Normally, when a process executes a setuid program, the effective user ID changes to the file's owner, potentially granting additional privileges. With `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` set, these bits are ignored, and the process continues running with its current credentials.\n\nSecond, the flag prevents file capabilities from granting new privileges during exec operations. File capabilities are extended attributes that can grant specific Linux capabilities to processes executing a program. Without the no-new-privs flag, a restricted process could potentially execute a program with file capabilities to regain privileges. The flag ensures that exec operations cannot increase the process's capability sets beyond their current contents.\n\nThird, certain Linux Security Modules (LSMs) like AppArmor and SELinux respect the no-new-privs flag and may apply additional restrictions. These systems can implement more permissive policies for processes that have committed to not gaining new privileges, creating a trust boundary that enables more flexible security policies.\n\nThe flag also interacts with seccomp filters in important ways. When `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` is set, unprivileged processes can install seccomp filters that would otherwise require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. This interaction is particularly relevant for our sandbox because it ensures that the seccomp restrictions cannot be bypassed through privilege escalation.\n\n| Privilege Escalation Vector | Without NO_NEW_PRIVS | With NO_NEW_PRIVS |\n|---|---|---|\n| Setuid executables | Process gains file owner's privileges | Setuid bit ignored, no privilege change |\n| Setgid executables | Process gains file group's privileges | Setgid bit ignored, no privilege change |\n| File capabilities | Process can gain capabilities from file | File capabilities cannot increase process caps |\n| LSM transitions | May allow privilege-granting transitions | LSM policies may provide additional restrictions |\n| Seccomp installation | Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN for unprivileged | Allows unprivileged seccomp filter installation |\n\nThe timing of setting `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` within our privilege dropping algorithm is crucial. It should be set after the process has transitioned to its target user ID and dropped most capabilities, but before executing the final target program. Setting it too early might interfere with necessary privilege operations during sandbox setup. Setting it too late leaves a window where privilege escalation might be possible.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: NO_NEW_PRIVS Timing**\n> - **Context**: Determining when to set PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS in the capability dropping sequence\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Set immediately after fork (blocks all privilege operations)\n>   2. Set after user transition but before capability dropping (may interfere with capability operations)  \n>   3. Set after capability dropping but before exec (optimal security/functionality balance)\n> - **Decision**: Set after complete capability dropping, immediately before exec\n> - **Rationale**: Ensures all necessary privilege operations complete successfully while preventing privilege escalation in the target program\n> - **Consequences**: Maximum compatibility with target programs while maintaining strong privilege escalation prevention\n\nThe no-new-privs flag cannot be unset once it's enabled, making it a permanent commitment for the process and all its descendants. This irreversible nature provides strong security guarantees but requires careful consideration of the target program's requirements. Some legitimate programs may fail if they depend on setuid operations or file capabilities for normal functionality.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n\nThe capability management component requires several critical architecture decisions that significantly impact both security effectiveness and implementation complexity. These decisions must balance maximum privilege reduction against practical usability and compatibility with diverse sandboxed workloads.\n\n> **Decision: Minimum Required Capabilities**\n> - **Context**: Determining the absolute minimum set of capabilities that sandboxed processes need to function\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Drop all capabilities (maximum security, high compatibility risk)\n>   2. Retain common capabilities like CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (moderate security, better compatibility)\n>   3. Configurable capability whitelist based on workload type (complex but flexible)\n> - **Decision**: Configurable whitelist with secure defaults dropping all capabilities\n> - **Rationale**: Different sandboxed programs have vastly different requirements; flexibility allows optimization while secure defaults protect against misconfiguration\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful analysis of each workload's needs but provides maximum security when properly configured\n\nThe minimum capability set decision proves particularly challenging because Linux capabilities are not well-documented from an application perspective. Many programs don't clearly specify which capabilities they require, leading to trial-and-error discovery processes. Our architecture addresses this by providing a capability discovery mode that logs attempted privileged operations, helping administrators identify necessary capabilities through testing.\n\n| Capability | Common Use Cases | Security Risk | Recommended Action |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `CAP_CHOWN` | Change file ownership | Medium - can manipulate file permissions | Drop unless file management needed |\n| `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` | Bypass file permission checks | High - can access any file | Drop unless specific access patterns required |\n| `CAP_SETUID` | Change user ID | High - enables privilege escalation | Always drop after user transition |\n| `CAP_SETGID` | Change group ID | Medium - enables group privilege escalation | Always drop after group transition |\n| `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` | Bind to privileged ports (<1024) | Medium - can impersonate system services | Drop unless network service needed |\n| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` | Many administrative operations | Critical - effectively equivalent to root | Always drop |\n| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` | Trace other processes | Critical - can access process memory | Always drop |\n\n> **Decision: Capability Verification Strategy**\n> - **Context**: How to verify that capability dropping succeeded and the process is in the expected security state\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Trust system call return values (fast but unreliable)\n>   2. Re-read capabilities after each operation (thorough but slow)\n>   3. Final verification only (balanced approach)\n> - **Decision**: Verification after each major phase with detailed logging\n> - **Rationale**: Capability operations can fail silently or partially; immediate verification enables precise error diagnosis and security assurance\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher overhead but dramatically improved security confidence and debugging capability\n\nThe verification strategy implementation maintains a shadow copy of expected capability sets and compares them against actual kernel state after each modification. This approach catches several classes of errors: partial failures where some capabilities are dropped but others remain, kernel version incompatibilities that cause operations to be ignored, and race conditions where other processes modify our capabilities unexpectedly.\n\n> **Decision: Capability Drop Failure Handling**\n> - **Context**: How to respond when capability dropping operations fail\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Continue with reduced security (dangerous but functional)\n>   2. Abort sandbox creation entirely (secure but may impact availability)\n>   3. Retry with progressively relaxed requirements (complex fallback logic)\n> - **Decision**: Abort sandbox creation with detailed error reporting\n> - **Rationale**: Security boundaries must be absolute; partial security provides false confidence and unknown attack surface\n> - **Consequences**: Some workloads may fail to start, but security guarantees are maintained and administrators receive clear guidance for resolution\n\nThe failure handling strategy extends beyond simple abortion to include comprehensive diagnostic information. When capability operations fail, the system logs the current state of all capability sets, the attempted operation, the specific error code, and recommendations for resolution. This detailed error reporting significantly reduces the debugging burden for administrators trying to configure appropriate capability whitelists.\n\nThe capability management component also implements several performance optimizations that don't compromise security. Capability queries are batched where possible to reduce system call overhead. The verification process uses efficient bit manipulation to compare capability sets rather than iterating through individual capabilities. Error paths are optimized for fast failure detection to minimize the impact on sandbox creation performance.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nCapability management presents several subtle pitfalls that frequently trap developers implementing process sandboxes. These mistakes often result in security vulnerabilities, unexpected program failures, or difficult-to-diagnose runtime issues.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect Operation Ordering**\n\nMany developers attempt to drop capabilities before completing necessary privileged operations, causing the privilege dropping process itself to fail. For example, calling `setuid()` before dropping `CAP_SETUID` from the bounding set will succeed, but attempting to drop `CAP_SETUID` from the bounding set after calling `setuid()` may fail because the process no longer has the necessary privileges to modify capability sets.\n\nThe correct sequence must complete all privileged operations that require specific capabilities before dropping those capabilities from any set. This includes operations like changing user/group IDs, setting up cgroups, modifying namespaces, and installing seccomp filters. A common mistake is forgetting that some operations require capabilities that aren't immediately obvious—for example, certain cgroup operations may require `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` to write to cgroup control files.\n\nTo avoid this pitfall, create a comprehensive checklist of all privileged operations your sandbox performs and identify the capabilities each operation requires. Perform all operations before beginning the capability dropping sequence, and verify each operation's success before proceeding to the next phase.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ambient Capability Oversight**\n\nAmbient capabilities are often overlooked because they're a relatively recent addition to Linux and don't appear in older documentation. Developers frequently remember to drop capabilities from the traditional four sets (effective, permitted, inheritable, bounding) but leave ambient capabilities intact. This creates a significant security vulnerability because ambient capabilities automatically become effective in child processes.\n\nEven if a process successfully drops all capabilities from its effective and permitted sets, any capabilities remaining in the ambient set will be granted to child processes after exec operations. This means a sandboxed process could spawn a child that has more privileges than the parent, completely defeating the purpose of capability dropping.\n\nThe solution requires explicitly clearing the ambient capability set using `prctl(PR_CAP_AMBIENT, PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL)`. This operation should be performed early in the privilege dropping sequence, ideally immediately after assessing current capabilities but before beginning other dropping operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Capability Assessment**\n\nMany implementations fail to comprehensively assess which capabilities a target program actually requires, leading to either security vulnerabilities (retaining unnecessary capabilities) or functionality failures (dropping required capabilities). This assessment is complicated by the fact that most programs don't document their capability requirements, and the requirements may vary based on configuration or runtime behavior.\n\nA partial assessment might identify obvious requirements like `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` for programs that bind to privileged ports, but miss subtle requirements like `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` for programs that need to traverse directories with restrictive permissions. These subtle requirements often only manifest under specific conditions, making them difficult to discover through casual testing.\n\nTo address this pitfall, implement a systematic capability discovery process. Run the target program in a test environment with capability auditing enabled, exercise all program functionality, and log any capability-related failures. Use tools like `filecap` and `getcap` to identify file capabilities that the program might depend on. Document the discovered requirements and validate them through comprehensive testing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Programs**\n\nCapability operations affect the entire process, including all threads, but the timing of these operations can create race conditions in multi-threaded programs. If the sandbox process creates threads before dropping capabilities, those threads might perform privileged operations concurrently with capability dropping, leading to inconsistent security states or unexpected failures.\n\nFor example, if one thread is dropping `CAP_NET_ADMIN` while another thread is attempting to configure network interfaces, the network configuration might succeed or fail depending on the exact timing of the operations. This creates non-deterministic behavior that's difficult to debug and may leave the sandbox in an unexpected security state.\n\nThe solution requires careful coordination of capability dropping with thread management. Ensure that capability dropping occurs before creating any threads that might perform privileged operations, or implement explicit synchronization to prevent privileged operations during capability transitions. Consider using the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag early in the process to prevent threads from gaining new privileges even if capability dropping is delayed.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Verification Logic Errors**\n\nCapability verification logic often contains subtle bugs that can mask security vulnerabilities or cause false alarms. Common errors include incorrect bit manipulation when checking capability sets, endianness issues when reading capability data structures, and failure to account for kernel version differences in capability representation.\n\nOne particularly common mistake is assuming that capability numbers are consistent across all Linux architectures and kernel versions. Capability constants like `CAP_NET_ADMIN` have the same numeric values across systems, but the internal kernel representation and the format returned by `capget()` can vary. This can cause verification logic to incorrectly interpret capability sets or fail to detect security issues.\n\nImplement capability verification using well-tested libraries like `libcap` rather than raw system calls where possible. When using raw system calls is necessary, carefully validate the verification logic against known capability states and test on multiple kernel versions and architectures.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe capability management component requires careful integration of Linux-specific system calls with robust error handling and verification logic. The implementation must handle the complex interactions between different capability sets while providing clear diagnostics for debugging capability-related issues.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|---|---|---|\n| Capability Operations | Raw system calls (`capget`, `capset`, `prctl`) | `libcap` library with higher-level abstractions |\n| Verification Logic | Manual bit manipulation and comparison | Capability parsing libraries with built-in validation |\n| Error Reporting | Simple error codes and messages | Structured logging with capability state dumps |\n| Testing Framework | Basic unit tests with mock capabilities | Comprehensive integration tests with real privilege dropping |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\nproject-root/\n  src/\n    capability_manager.c     ← Core capability dropping logic\n    capability_manager.h     ← Public interface and type definitions\n    capability_utils.c       ← Utility functions for capability operations\n    capability_utils.h       ← Utility function declarations\n    test/\n      test_capability_manager.c  ← Unit tests for capability operations\n      test_capability_utils.c    ← Tests for utility functions\n    include/\n      sandbox_types.h        ← Shared type definitions\n```\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\n```c\n#include <sys/capability.h>\n#include <sys/prctl.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n// Capability utility functions - complete implementations\nint get_current_capabilities(cap_t *caps) {\n    *caps = cap_get_proc();\n    if (*caps == NULL) {\n        return -errno;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint verify_capability_dropped(cap_value_t cap) {\n    cap_t caps;\n    cap_flag_value_t value;\n    int result = get_current_capabilities(&caps);\n    if (result < 0) {\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    if (cap_get_flag(caps, cap, CAP_EFFECTIVE, &value) < 0) {\n        cap_free(caps);\n        return -errno;\n    }\n    \n    cap_free(caps);\n    return (value == CAP_CLEAR) ?

Verify these operations return `EPERM`.\n\n3. **No New Privileges Test**: After setting the no-new-privs flag, attempt to execute a setuid program. Verify the program runs with current privileges rather than elevated privileges.\n\n4. **Child Process Test**: Fork a child process after capability dropping and verify the child inherits the restricted capability set, not the original capabilities.\n\n5. **Integration Test**: Run the complete sandbox with capability dropping enabled and verify the target program functions correctly with minimal capabilities.\n\n**Expected output for capability verification:**\n```\nCapabilities before dropping: = cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_fowner,cap_setgid,cap_setuid+eip\nDropping capabilities from bounding set...\nClearing ambient capabilities...\nSetting capability sets...\nCapabilities after dropping: =\nNo new privileges flag set successfully\nCapability dropping completed successfully\n```\n\n**Signs of problems and debugging steps:**\n- If capability operations return `EPERM`: Check that the process has sufficient privileges to perform capability operations (may need to be root initially)\n- If the target program fails with permission errors: Review the capability whitelist and add necessary capabilities\n- If child processes have unexpected privileges: Verify ambient and inheritable sets are properly cleared\n- If setuid programs still gain privileges: Confirm the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag is set correctly\n\n\n## Sandbox Orchestration and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section integrates concepts from all milestones (1-5), showing how namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability dropping work together to create a complete sandbox\n\nThe **sandbox orchestration** represents the conductor of a complex symphony, where each security mechanism plays its part in perfect harmony. Like a master chef following a precise recipe, the orchestration must combine ingredients (security primitives) in exactly the right order and proportions to create the desired outcome—a secure execution environment that contains untrusted code without breaking functionality.\n\nThe orchestration component serves as the **central coordinator** that understands the dependencies between security layers and ensures they are applied in the correct sequence. This is not merely about calling functions in order; it requires deep understanding of how Linux security primitives interact, what state each component needs from its predecessors, and how to handle the complex cleanup required when things go wrong.\n\n### Mental Model: The Security Assembly Line\n\nThink of sandbox creation as a **sophisticated assembly line** in a high-security facility. Each station on the line adds another layer of protection to the product (the untrusted process). The line supervisor (orchestration component) ensures that:\n\n- Each station receives exactly what it needs from previous stations\n- No station begins work until prerequisites are complete\n- If any station fails, the entire assembly line stops and reverses all completed work\n- The final product meets all security specifications before leaving the facility\n\nJust as an assembly line has quality control checkpoints, our sandbox orchestration includes validation steps that verify each security layer is properly configured before proceeding to the next.\n\n### Sandbox Creation Sequence\n\nThe sandbox creation follows a **strictly ordered sequence** where each step depends on the successful completion of its predecessors. This ordering is not arbitrary—it reflects the fundamental dependencies between Linux security mechanisms and the need to establish isolation before applying restrictions.\n\n![Sandbox Creation Sequence](./diagrams/sandbox-creation-flow.svg)\n\nThe creation sequence must handle both the **happy path** (successful creation) and multiple **failure scenarios** where partial setup must be cleanly reversed. The orchestration component maintains detailed state about what has been configured, enabling precise cleanup even when failures occur in the middle of the sequence.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Creation Algorithm\n\nThe sandbox creation follows this precise algorithm, where each step represents a **point of no return** that requires specific cleanup if subsequent steps fail:\n\n1. **Privilege Verification**: The orchestration component first verifies that the calling process has sufficient privileges (typically root or specific capabilities) to perform all required operations. This early check prevents partial setup followed by privilege-related failures.\n\n2. **Configuration Validation**: The `sandbox_config_t` structure is validated for consistency and completeness. This includes verifying that file paths exist, resource limits are reasonable, and the syscall whitelist contains required system calls for basic operation.\n\n3. **State Initialization**: A new `sandbox_state_t` structure is allocated and initialized to track all resources that will need cleanup. This includes namespace file descriptors, cgroup paths, and process identifiers.\n\n4. **Initial Process Fork**: The orchestration performs the first `fork()` operation to create the child process that will become the sandboxed process. The parent retains the ability to configure the child's environment before it begins execution.\n\n5. **Namespace Creation**: The child process creates all required namespaces using `clone()` or `unshare()` system calls. This establishes the fundamental isolation boundaries that all subsequent security layers will rely upon.\n\n6. **User Namespace Setup**: If user namespaces are enabled, the orchestration configures UID and GID mappings to provide privilege separation. This step must occur before certain other namespace operations that require mapped privileges.\n\n7. **Filesystem Isolation**: The filesystem isolation component creates the minimal root filesystem and performs `chroot()` or `pivot_root()` to establish the new root directory. This physically limits what files the sandboxed process can access.\n\n8. **Resource Limit Application**: The cgroup component creates the necessary cgroup hierarchy and applies memory, CPU, and I/O limits. The sandboxed process is added to the appropriate cgroups before it begins execution.\n\n9. **System Call Filter Installation**: The seccomp-BPF filter is compiled and installed, restricting which system calls the sandboxed process can make. This step occurs late in the sequence because the sandbox setup itself requires many privileged system calls.\n\n10. **Capability Dropping**: All unnecessary Linux capabilities are dropped, and the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag is set to prevent privilege escalation. This represents the final hardening step before execution.\n\n11. **Program Execution**: The `exec()` system call replaces the sandboxed process image with the target program. At this point, all security restrictions are active and cannot be circumvented.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Fork-Then-Configure vs Configure-Then-Fork**\n> - **Context**: We need to decide whether to fork first and then configure the child, or configure the current process and then fork\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Fork early and configure child from parent\n>   - Configure current process then fork configured child\n>   - Use clone() with all flags at once\n> - **Decision**: Fork early and configure child from parent\n> - **Rationale**: This approach provides better error handling (parent can clean up failed child), maintains parent privileges for configuration, and allows parent to monitor child throughout setup\n> - **Consequences**: Requires IPC between parent and child during setup, but provides superior error recovery and monitoring capabilities\n\n| Creation Step | Prerequisites | Failure Recovery | Critical Resources |\n|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Privilege Verification | Process must be root or have CAP_SYS_ADMIN | No cleanup needed | None |\n| Configuration Validation | Valid config structure | Free allocated memory | Configuration object |\n| State Initialization | Valid configuration | Free state structure | State tracking object |\n| Process Fork | Sufficient process limits | None (fork failed) | Child process |\n| Namespace Creation | Forked child process | Terminate child process | Namespace file descriptors |\n| Filesystem Isolation | Mount namespace active | Unmount all sandbox mounts | Mount points, directories |\n| Resource Limits | Cgroup controllers available | Remove from cgroups, delete hierarchy | Cgroup directories |\n| System Call Filtering | No conflicting seccomp filters | Cannot be undone | BPF program |\n| Capability Dropping | Process in target user namespace | Cannot be undone | Process capabilities |\n| Program Execution | All security layers configured | Terminate sandbox process | Running program |\n\n### Sandboxed Process Lifecycle\n\nThe sandboxed process experiences a **well-defined lifecycle** with clear state transitions and specific responsibilities for the orchestration component at each stage. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for proper resource management and error handling.\n\n![Sandboxed Process Lifecycle](./diagrams/process-lifecycle.svg)\n\nThe lifecycle management ensures that the orchestration component maintains complete visibility into the sandbox state and can perform appropriate cleanup at any stage. The parent process (orchestrator) remains responsible for monitoring and resource cleanup even after the sandboxed process begins execution.\n\n#### Lifecycle State Machine\n\nThe sandbox process transitions through distinct states, each with specific entry conditions and possible exit transitions:\n\n| Current State | Entry Condition | Possible Events | Next State | Actions Taken |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|\n| **Created** | Successful fork() | Configuration starts | Configuring | Begin security layer setup |\n| **Created** | Fork failure | Process cleanup | Terminated | Release partial resources |\n| **Configuring** | Security layer setup in progress | Setup completes successfully | Running | Execute target program |\n| **Configuring** | Security layer setup failure | Cleanup begins | Terminating | Reverse completed setup steps |\n| **Running** | Target program executing | Program exits normally | Terminating | Begin resource cleanup |\n| **Running** | Security violation detected | Kill signal sent | Terminating | Force process termination |\n| **Running** | Resource limit exceeded | OOM or SIGKILL | Terminating | Clean up cgroup resources |\n| **Terminating** | Cleanup in progress | Cleanup completes | Cleaned Up | All resources released |\n| **Terminating** | Cleanup failure | Cleanup retry | Terminating | Attempt cleanup again |\n| **Cleaned Up** | All resources released | Process reaped | Destroyed | Remove from parent tracking |\n\n#### State Transition Details\n\nEach state transition represents a **significant change** in the sandbox's security posture and resource allocation. The orchestration component must carefully manage these transitions to prevent resource leaks and security violations.\n\n**Created → Configuring**: This transition occurs when the child process begins applying security restrictions. The parent process monitors the child's configuration progress and maintains the ability to terminate the child if configuration fails or hangs.\n\n**Configuring → Running**: The most critical transition, where the sandbox becomes fully isolated and begins executing untrusted code. Once this transition completes, the sandboxed process can no longer be reconfigured—all security policies are immutable.\n\n**Running → Terminating**: This transition can be triggered by several events: normal program completion, security policy violations, resource limit exceeded, or external termination requests. The orchestration component must distinguish between these causes for proper logging and response.\n\n**Terminating → Cleaned Up**: The cleanup phase requires careful reversal of the creation sequence, removing the process from cgroups, cleaning up mount points, and closing namespace file descriptors. The orchestration component tracks which resources need cleanup to avoid double-free errors.\n\n> The critical insight is that once a sandbox enters the Running state, security policies become immutable. This is why the configuration phase must be completely successful before allowing program execution.\n\n### Communication Channels\n\nThe orchestration of a complex sandbox requires **reliable communication channels** between the parent supervisor and the child sandbox process. These channels serve multiple purposes: coordinating the configuration sequence, monitoring sandbox health, and providing a controlled interface for legitimate interactions with the outside world.\n\n#### Parent-Child Coordination Channel\n\nDuring the configuration phase, the parent and child processes must coordinate their activities to ensure proper timing and error handling. This coordination uses a **bidirectional pipe** established before the fork operation.\n\n| Message Type | Direction | Purpose | Payload | Response Required |\n|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| **CONFIG_START** | Parent → Child | Begin configuration sequence | Configuration step ID | ACK or ERROR |\n| **NAMESPACE_READY** | Child → Parent | Namespaces created successfully | Namespace FDs | CONTINUE |\n| **FILESYSTEM_READY** | Child → Parent | Filesystem isolation complete | Mount point list | CONTINUE |\n| **SECCOMP_READY** | Child → Parent | System call filter active | Filter program hash | CONTINUE |\n| **LIMITS_APPLIED** | Child → Parent | Resource limits configured | Cgroup path | CONTINUE |\n| **CAPS_DROPPED** | Child → Parent | Capabilities dropped | Remaining capabilities | EXEC_APPROVED |\n| **CONFIG_ERROR** | Child → Parent | Configuration step failed | Error code and details | TERMINATE |\n| **READY_TO_EXEC** | Child → Parent | All security layers active | Final status | EXEC_APPROVED |\n\nThe coordination protocol ensures that the child process never proceeds to the next configuration step without explicit approval from the parent. This **synchronous handshake** prevents race conditions and ensures proper error handling.\n\n#### Runtime Monitoring Channel\n\nAfter the sandbox begins executing the target program, the communication needs change from configuration coordination to **runtime monitoring**. The parent process needs visibility into sandbox behavior without compromising isolation.\n\nThe monitoring channel uses **signal-based communication** combined with `procfs` inspection to gather information about the sandbox state. Direct IPC channels are intentionally limited to prevent sandbox escape vectors.\n\n| Monitoring Method | Information Gathered | Update Frequency | Security Implications |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| **Process Status** | PID, PPID, state, exit status | On-demand | Read-only access to /proc/[pid]/stat |\n| **Resource Usage** | Memory, CPU, I/O consumption | Periodic polling | Read cgroup accounting files |\n| **Security Events** | Seccomp violations, capability attempts | Real-time signals | Kernel delivers SIGSYS or SIGKILL |\n| **Filesystem Activity** | File access patterns, mount changes | Audit subsystem | Optional integration with auditd |\n| **Network Activity** | Connection attempts, data transfer | Network namespace inspection | Limited by namespace isolation |\n\n#### Controlled External Interface\n\nSome sandbox applications require **limited interaction** with external resources while maintaining security isolation. The orchestration component can provide controlled interfaces that allow specific operations without compromising the sandbox integrity.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Signal-Based vs Socket-Based Communication**\n> - **Context**: Need to monitor sandbox without providing escape vectors\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Unix domain sockets for bidirectional communication\n>   - Signal-based notification with procfs inspection\n>   - Shared memory with lock-free protocols\n> - **Decision**: Signal-based communication with procfs inspection\n> - **Rationale**: Signals cannot be used for privilege escalation, procfs provides read-only monitoring, and this approach minimizes attack surface compared to bidirectional sockets\n> - **Consequences**: Limited bandwidth for monitoring data, requires polling for some information, but provides excellent security isolation\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Communication Design\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Bidirectional Sockets in Sandbox**\nCreating Unix domain sockets between parent and child provides a potential escape vector if the sandbox can influence socket operations. Attackers may exploit socket buffer overflows, file descriptor passing, or credential passing mechanisms to escape isolation.\n**Fix**: Use unidirectional communication where possible, with signals from child to parent and procfs inspection by parent.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking on Child Communication**\nIf the parent process blocks indefinitely waiting for child responses, a misbehaving sandbox can cause denial of service by simply not responding to coordination messages.\n**Fix**: Implement timeouts for all coordination operations and terminate non-responsive sandboxes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Information Leakage Through Error Messages**\nDetailed error messages sent from sandbox to parent may leak information about the host system's configuration or internal state.\n**Fix**: Use standardized error codes instead of free-form error messages, and sanitize any diagnostic information before transmission.\n\n### Integration Flow Example\n\nTo illustrate how all components work together, consider a complete sandbox creation scenario for executing a simple untrusted Python script:\n\n**Initial Setup**: The orchestration component receives a request to execute `untrusted_script.py` with a memory limit of 64MB, CPU limit of 10%, and network access disabled.\n\n1. **Configuration Validation**: The orchestrator verifies that Python interpreter exists in the minimal rootfs, memory limit is reasonable, and the syscall whitelist includes Python's requirements (`read`, `write`, `mmap`, etc.).\n\n2. **Process Creation**: The orchestrator forks, creating parent (PID 1000) and child (PID 1001) processes. The child will become the sandbox.\n\n3. **Namespace Setup**: Child 1001 creates PID, mount, network, and UTS namespaces. From child's perspective, it becomes PID 1 in its own PID namespace.\n\n4. **Filesystem Preparation**: Child 1001 performs `chroot()` to `/sandbox/python-minimal/`, which contains only Python interpreter, required libraries, and the target script. Host filesystem becomes completely inaccessible.\n\n5. **Cgroup Assignment**: Parent 1000 creates cgroup `/sys/fs/cgroup/sandbox-1001/` and configures memory.limit_in_bytes=67108864 (64MB) and cpu.cfs_quota_us=10000 (10% CPU). Child 1001 is added to this cgroup.\n\n6. **Seccomp Filter**: Child 1001 installs BPF filter allowing only: `read`, `write`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `exit_group`, `rt_sigaction`, and `brk`. All other syscalls will terminate the process.\n\n7. **Capability Dropping**: Child 1001 drops all capabilities and sets `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS=1`, preventing any privilege escalation.\n\n8. **Program Execution**: Child 1001 executes `execve(\"/usr/bin/python3\", [\"python3\", \"untrusted_script.py\"])`. The sandbox is now fully active.\n\n**Runtime Monitoring**: Parent 1000 monitors child 1001 through `/proc/1001/stat` and cgroup accounting files. If the script attempts forbidden operations (network access, excessive memory), appropriate limits trigger termination.\n\n### Error Handling and Recovery Patterns\n\nThe orchestration component must handle failures at every stage of sandbox creation and execution. Each failure mode requires specific recovery actions to prevent resource leaks and maintain system stability.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Immediate Action | Recovery Steps | Prevention Strategy |\n|--------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Configuration Validation Failure** | Invalid parameters in `sandbox_config_t` | Return error to caller | Free configuration memory | Validate all parameters before creation |\n| **Fork Failure** | `fork()` returns -1 | Log error and return failure | No cleanup needed | Check process limits before fork |\n| **Namespace Creation Failure** | `clone()` or `unshare()` fails | Terminate child process | Kill child, reap zombie | Verify kernel namespace support |\n| **Filesystem Setup Failure** | `chroot()` or mount operations fail | Begin cleanup sequence | Unmount all sandbox mounts | Verify filesystem permissions and space |\n| **Cgroup Creation Failure** | Cannot write to cgroup files | Remove partial cgroup hierarchy | Delete created cgroup directories | Check cgroup controller availability |\n| **Seccomp Installation Failure** | `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)` fails | Terminate sandbox immediately | Cannot recover - kill process | Validate BPF program before installation |\n| **Capability Dropping Failure** | `capset()` fails or verification fails | Terminate sandbox immediately | Cannot recover - kill process | Verify capability support before dropping |\n| **Runtime Security Violation** | SIGSYS signal or limit exceeded | Kill sandbox process | Clean up all resources | Monitor and tune security policies |\n| **Parent Process Death** | Sandbox becomes orphaned | Sandbox continues until exit | Init system reaps orphan | Use process monitoring and restart |\n\n### Resource Lifecycle Management\n\nThe orchestration component maintains complete responsibility for **resource lifecycle management**, ensuring that every allocated resource is properly cleaned up regardless of how the sandbox terminates.\n\n#### Resource Tracking Tables\n\nThe `sandbox_state_t` structure maintains comprehensive tracking of all resources requiring cleanup:\n\n| Resource Type | Tracking Method | Cleanup Function | Cleanup Order | Failure Recovery |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| **Child Process** | `child_pid` field | `kill()` + `waitpid()` | First (prevent further resource use) | Retry with SIGKILL |\n| **Namespace FDs** | `namespace_fd[]` array | `close()` file descriptors | After process termination | Close remaining FDs |\n| **Mount Points** | Linked list in filesystem state | `umount()` in reverse order | Before namespace cleanup | Lazy unmount with MNT_DETACH |\n| **Cgroup Hierarchy** | `cgroup_path` and process list | Remove processes, delete directories | After process termination | Force process removal |\n| **Temporary Directories** | Path tracking in filesystem state | `rmdir()` recursive removal | After unmounting | Force removal with elevated privileges |\n| **Lock Files** | File handle tracking | `unlink()` and `close()` | Before directory removal | Continue cleanup despite failures |\n\n#### Cleanup Ordering Dependencies\n\nThe cleanup sequence must respect **dependency relationships** between resources. Attempting cleanup in the wrong order can cause failures or leave resources in inconsistent states.\n\n> The fundamental principle is to clean up resources in the reverse order of their creation, with process termination occurring first to prevent interference with cleanup operations.\n\n1. **Process Termination**: Send SIGTERM to sandbox process, wait briefly, then SIGKILL if needed. Reap zombie process with `waitpid()`.\n\n2. **Cgroup Cleanup**: Remove sandbox process from all cgroups, delete cgroup hierarchy directories. This must occur after process termination to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Filesystem Cleanup**: Unmount all sandbox mount points in reverse order of creation. Use lazy unmount (`MNT_DETACH`) if normal unmount fails.\n\n4. **Namespace Cleanup**: Close namespace file descriptors. The kernel automatically cleans up namespaces when all references are closed.\n\n5. **Temporary Resource Cleanup**: Remove temporary directories, close temporary files, release any other allocated resources.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe orchestration component serves as the integration point for all sandbox security mechanisms.

Implementation Hints\n\n**C-Specific Considerations**:\n- Use `signalfd()` or `sigaction()` to handle SIGCHLD for child process monitoring\n- Implement proper error handling with `errno` checking after system calls\n- Use `strace -f` to debug parent-child coordination and system call sequences\n- Be careful with file descriptor inheritance across `fork()` and `exec()`\n- Use `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)` in child to ensure cleanup if parent dies\n\n**Memory Management**:\n- Always initialize pointers to NULL in structures\n- Use `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` to zero-initialize memory\n- Implement proper cleanup functions for each component state structure\n- Use valgrind to detect memory leaks during testing\n\n**Error Handling Patterns**:\n```c\nint result = some_operation();\nif (result != SANDBOX_SUCCESS) {\n    sandbox_error(\"Operation failed\", errno);\n    cleanup_partial_state();\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Checkpoint 1: Basic Orchestration**\nAfter implementing the basic orchestration framework:\n- Command: `gcc -o sandbox src/orchestration/*.c src/common/*.c && sudo ./sandbox --program=/bin/echo --args=\"hello world\"`\n- Expected: Program should fork, coordinate setup, and execute echo successfully\n- Verify: Check that parent receives coordination messages and child executes correctly\n- Debug: Use `strace -f` to trace system calls in both parent and child processes\n\n**Checkpoint 2: Security Layer Integration**\nAfter integrating all security components:\n- Command: `sudo ./sandbox --program=/bin/ls --memory-limit=32M --cpu-limit=5 --no-network`\n- Expected: Program runs with all security restrictions active, lists directory contents\n- Verify: Check `/proc/[pid]/status` for namespace isolation, cgroup limits applied\n- Debug: Examine `/sys/fs/cgroup/sandbox-*/` for resource limit configuration\n\n**Checkpoint 3: Error Handling and Cleanup**\nAfter implementing complete error handling:\n- Command: `sudo ./sandbox --program=/nonexistent/program` (should fail gracefully)\n- Expected: Clean error message, all resources cleaned up properly\n- Verify: No orphaned processes, no leftover cgroup directories, no mounted filesystems\n- Debug: Check for resource leaks using `ps`, `mount`, and `lsof` commands\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| **Child process hangs during setup** | Deadlock in parent-child coordination | Use `strace -f` to see where each process blocks | Add timeouts to all coordination operations |\n| **Sandbox escapes isolation** | Security layers applied in wrong order | Check sequence of security operations | Follow strict ordering: namespaces → filesystem → seccomp → cgroups → capabilities |\n| **Resource cleanup fails** | Resources cleaned up in wrong order | Examine cleanup sequence and dependencies | Clean up in reverse order of creation |\n| **Parent process becomes zombie** | Child process outlives parent | Check process hierarchy with `ps axjf` | Use `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)` in child |\n| **Permission denied during setup** | Insufficient privileges for operation | Check capabilities and user ID at each step | Verify root privileges before starting, check namespace mappings |\n\n\n## Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section applies to all milestones (1-5), providing error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms for namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability management.\n\nThe robustness of a process sandbox depends not just on its security mechanisms, but on how gracefully it handles failures, resource exhaustion, and edge cases. A production sandbox system must anticipate and recover from dozens of failure modes while maintaining security boundaries even during error conditions. This section explores the systematic approach to error detection, classification, recovery, and cleanup that ensures the sandbox remains both secure and reliable.\n\n### Mental Model: The Emergency Response System\n\nThink of sandbox error handling like a hospital emergency response system. Just as hospitals have protocols for every type of medical emergency—cardiac arrest, trauma, poisoning—a sandbox must have specific responses for every type of system failure. The emergency response system has three key characteristics that apply directly to sandbox error handling:\n\n**Triage and Classification**: Emergency rooms immediately classify patients by severity and type of condition to determine treatment priority. Similarly, the sandbox must classify errors by severity (fatal vs recoverable) and component (namespace vs cgroup vs seccomp) to determine the appropriate response strategy.\n\n**Containment and Stabilization**: Medical teams first stabilize the patient and prevent the condition from worsening before attempting curative treatment. The sandbox must first contain failures—preventing resource leaks, zombie processes, or security breaches—before attempting recovery.\n\n**Documentation and Learning**: Hospitals maintain detailed incident reports to improve future responses. The sandbox logs detailed error information not just for debugging, but to identify patterns that indicate systemic issues requiring architectural changes.\n\nThis mental model emphasizes that error handling is not just \"catch and log\"—it requires systematic preparation, immediate containment, and long-term improvement based on failure analysis.\n\n### Common Failure Modes\n\nThe process sandbox encounters failures across multiple dimensions: system call failures during setup, resource exhaustion during execution, and permission errors during cleanup. Understanding these failure modes and their cascading effects is crucial for building robust error detection and recovery mechanisms.\n\n#### System Call Failures\n\nSystem call failures represent the most fundamental class of errors in sandbox creation, as every security mechanism depends on kernel operations that can fail for various reasons.\n\n**Namespace Creation Failures** occur when the kernel cannot create the requested namespace isolation. The `clone()` system call with namespace flags can fail due to kernel limits, insufficient memory, or disabled namespace support. More subtly, the kernel enforces per-user limits on namespace creation—the `CLONE_NEWUSER` flag fails when a user exceeds their maximum namespace count, typically 32 per user. Network namespace creation fails when the system has exhausted network namespace slots or when network controllers are not available.\n\n**Mount Operation Failures** represent another critical failure mode during filesystem isolation setup. The `mount()` system call can fail due to incorrect filesystem types, missing mount points, insufficient permissions, or kernel module loading failures. Bind mounts fail when source paths do not exist or when mount propagation settings conflict. The `pivot_root()` operation fails when the old and new root filesystems are on the same mount point or when processes still hold references to the old root.\n\n**Cgroup Management Failures** occur when the kernel cannot create cgroup hierarchies or configure resource limits. Cgroup creation fails when hierarchies are full, when controllers are not available, or when the cgroup filesystem is not mounted. Setting resource limits fails when values exceed system maximums or when processes are already consuming more resources than the new limits allow.\n\n| Failure Mode | Detection Method | Immediate Effect | Recovery Strategy |\n|--------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| `clone()` ENOMEM | Return value check | Fork failure | Release memory, retry with fewer namespaces |\n| `clone()` EINVAL | Return value check | Invalid namespace flags | Detect kernel support, fallback configuration |\n| `mount()` ENOENT | Return value check | Missing mount point | Create directory, retry mount |\n| `mount()` EPERM | Return value check | Permission denied | Check capabilities, escalate privileges |\n| `pivot_root()` EINVAL | Return value check | Invalid filesystem state | Verify mount setup, fix mount points |\n| Cgroup creation ENOSPC | Return value check | No cgroup slots | Clean up unused cgroups, retry |\n| Resource limit EINVAL | Return value check | Invalid limit value | Validate limits, use system defaults |\n\n**Seccomp Filter Installation Failures** can occur when BPF programs are malformed, when the process already has incompatible seccomp filters, or when the kernel does not support required BPF features. The `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP)` call fails with `EINVAL` when the BPF program contains invalid instructions or when filter size exceeds kernel limits.\n\n> **Design Insight**: System call failures often cascade—a failed namespace creation can prevent subsequent mount operations, which then causes seccomp setup to operate in an unexpected environment. The error handling strategy must account for these dependencies and either fail fast or adapt the configuration to work with partial setup.\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Attacks\n\nResource exhaustion represents a class of failures where the sandboxed process or the sandbox infrastructure itself consumes excessive system resources, potentially affecting host system stability.\n\n**Memory Exhaustion** can occur at multiple levels within the sandbox system. The sandboxed process can exceed its cgroup memory limit, triggering the OOM (Out of Memory) killer within the cgroup. More dangerously, the sandbox creation process itself can exhaust system memory when creating large numbers of concurrent sandboxes or when namespace setup requires significant kernel memory allocation.\n\n**Process ID Exhaustion** happens when sandboxed processes spawn children faster than the PID cgroup limit allows, or when the system-wide PID limit is approached. This can cause legitimate processes to fail to fork, creating denial-of-service conditions.\n\n**File Descriptor Exhaustion** occurs when sandboxed processes open files or sockets faster than they close them, eventually hitting per-process or system-wide file descriptor limits. This is particularly problematic for network-enabled sandboxes that can open many socket connections.\n\n**Disk Space Exhaustion** can happen when sandboxes write to tmpfs mounts faster than space is reclaimed, or when log files from sandbox activity grow without bounds. Tmpfs mounts backed by system memory can trigger OOM conditions when they grow too large.\n\n| Resource Type | Exhaustion Trigger | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Memory | Process exceeds cgroup limit | Cgroup memory.events counter | Terminate process group |\n| Memory | System OOM condition | Monitor /proc/meminfo | Suspend new sandbox creation |\n| PIDs | Process fork() fails | Cgroup pids.events counter | Kill oldest child processes |\n| File Descriptors | open() returns EMFILE | Monitor /proc/pid/fd count | Close unused descriptors |\n| Disk Space | write() returns ENOSPC | Monitor tmpfs usage | Clean temporary files |\n| Network Sockets | socket() returns EMFILE | Network namespace socket count | Close idle connections |\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Resource exhaustion often occurs gradually and then suddenly. Monitoring systems must track resource usage trends and implement proactive throttling before hard limits trigger emergency termination. Reactive-only approaches result in poor user experience and potential security issues.\n\n#### Permission and Privilege Errors\n\nPermission errors occur when the sandbox system lacks the necessary privileges to perform required operations, or when privilege transitions fail during sandbox setup or cleanup.\n\n**Insufficient Privileges During Setup** is the most common cause of sandbox creation failure. Creating namespaces requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, mounting filesystems requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, and managing cgroups typically requires root privileges. The error handling must detect these permission failures and either escalate privileges through appropriate mechanisms (setuid binaries, systemd services) or gracefully degrade functionality.\n\n**Privilege Dropping Failures** can occur when the capability dropping sequence is performed in the wrong order or when processes attempt to drop capabilities they do not possess. The interaction between user namespace mappings and capability inheritance creates complex failure modes where capabilities appear available but cannot be effectively used or dropped.\n\n**Cleanup Permission Failures** happen when the privileged sandbox orchestrator process lacks permissions to clean up resources created by child processes. This is particularly problematic with user namespaces, where processes running as different mapped UIDs create resources that the parent process cannot remove.\n\n| Permission Error | Root Cause | Detection | Resolution |\n|------------------|------------|-----------|------------|\n| `EPERM` on `clone()` | Missing `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` | System call return code | Check effective capabilities |\n| `EPERM` on `mount()` | Missing mount capability | System call return code | Verify filesystem permissions |\n| `EPERM` on cgroup write | Incorrect cgroup ownership | File write failure | Fix cgroup permissions |\n| `EPERM` on capability drop | Invalid capability state | `prctl()` failure | Verify current capability set |\n| `EPERM` on cleanup | Mismatched ownership | File operation failure | Use appropriate cleanup privileges |\n\n### Cleanup and Resource Management\n\nProper cleanup and resource management in a process sandbox requires systematic tracking of all allocated resources and careful attention to cleanup ordering, especially when dealing with interdependent Linux kernel resources like namespaces, mounts, and cgroups.\n\n#### Resource Tracking and Lifecycle Management\n\nThe sandbox system must maintain comprehensive tracking of all resources allocated during sandbox creation to ensure proper cleanup even when failures occur partway through setup. This requires a **resource tracking registry** that records each successful resource allocation and provides cleanup handlers for each resource type.\n\n**Namespace File Descriptor Management** involves tracking namespace file descriptors obtained through `/proc/self/ns/` entries. These file descriptors pin namespaces in memory even after the creating process exits, preventing kernel cleanup until the descriptors are closed. The tracking system must record namespace file descriptors in the `sandbox_state_t` structure and ensure they are closed during cleanup.\n\n**Mount Point Tracking** requires maintaining a list of all mount operations performed during filesystem isolation setup. Mounts must be unmounted in reverse order of creation to handle dependencies correctly—child mounts must be unmounted before parent mounts to avoid `EBUSY` errors. The system tracks mount points in a linked list through the `mount_entry` structure, allowing cleanup traversal in LIFO order.\n\n**Cgroup Hierarchy Management** involves tracking created cgroup directories and ensuring that all processes are terminated before attempting to remove cgroup nodes. Cgroups cannot be removed while they contain processes, so cleanup must first terminate all processes in the cgroup, wait for process exit, and then remove the hierarchy from leaf nodes toward the root.\n\n| Resource Type | Allocation Tracking | Cleanup Dependencies | Cleanup Method |\n|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Namespace FDs | `namespace_state_t.pid_ns_fd` array | Close before process exit | `close()` system call |\n| Mount Points | `mount_entry` linked list | Unmount children first | `umount2()` with `MNT_DETACH` |\n| Cgroup Dirs | `cgroup_state_t.cgroup_path` | Kill processes first | Remove directory tree |\n| Process IDs | `cgroup_state_t.managed_pids` array | Send SIGTERM, then SIGKILL | `kill()` system call |\n| Temporary Files | Track in global file list | Remove before parent dirs | `unlink()` system call |\n| Device Nodes | Track created devices | Remove after unmounting | `unlink()` special files |\n\n#### Cleanup Ordering and Dependencies\n\nThe order of resource cleanup operations is critical for avoiding cleanup failures and ensuring that interdependent resources are released in the correct sequence. The cleanup sequence must handle the dependency relationships between different resource types while being robust to partial failures.\n\n**Process Termination First** represents the fundamental principle of sandbox cleanup. All sandboxed processes must be terminated before attempting to clean up other resources, as running processes can hold references to namespaces, mount points, and cgroup resources that prevent their removal. The termination sequence uses escalating signals: `SIGTERM` for graceful shutdown, followed by `SIGKILL` after a timeout period.\n\n**Mount Point Cleanup Ordering** follows a specific hierarchy where bind mounts and overlay mounts are unmounted before their underlying filesystems. Special filesystems like `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/sys` within the sandbox namespace are unmounted before unmounting the root filesystem. The `umount2()` call with `MNT_DETACH` flag performs lazy unmounting that handles some ordering dependencies automatically.\n\n**Namespace Cleanup Dependencies** require understanding that mount namespaces must be cleaned up before PID namespaces, and network namespaces can be cleaned up independently. Closing namespace file descriptors allows kernel garbage collection, but the kernel may delay actual cleanup until all references are released.\n\n> **Decision: Cleanup Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Resource cleanup can fail partially, leaving the system in an inconsistent state with leaked resources\n> - **Options Considered**: Best-effort cleanup vs. mandatory cleanup vs. cleanup with retries\n> - **Decision**: Implement cleanup with retries and best-effort fallback\n> - **Rationale**: Some cleanup operations may temporarily fail due to timing issues (processes still exiting), but permanent failures should not prevent other resources from being cleaned up\n> - **Consequences**: Enables robust cleanup that handles transient failures while preventing cascading cleanup failures\n\nThe cleanup algorithm follows this specific ordering:\n\n1. **Signal Process Termination**: Send `SIGTERM` to all processes in the sandbox cgroup\n2. **Wait with Timeout**: Wait up to 5 seconds for graceful process termination\n3. **Force Kill**: Send `SIGKILL` to any remaining processes\n4. **Wait for Process Exit**: Wait for all PIDs to be reaped by parent processes\n5. **Unmount Filesystems**: Unmount all tracked mount points in reverse order\n6. **Close Namespace FDs**: Close all namespace file descriptors to release references\n7. **Remove Cgroup Hierarchy**: Remove cgroup directories from leaf to root\n8. **Clean Temporary Files**: Remove temporary directories and files created during setup\n\n#### Error Recovery During Cleanup\n\nCleanup operations can themselves fail, creating the possibility of resource leaks and requiring recovery strategies that handle partial cleanup failures gracefully.\n\n**Retry Logic for Transient Failures** handles cleanup operations that fail due to timing issues, such as attempting to unmount filesystems while processes are still exiting. The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff with a maximum retry count to handle transient failures without infinite loops.\n\n**Best-Effort Cleanup for Permanent Failures** ensures that permanent failures in one cleanup operation do not prevent other resources from being cleaned up. For example, if a mount point cannot be unmounted due to busy processes, the cleanup continues with other mount points and cgroup removal, logging the failure for administrative attention.\n\n**Resource Leak Detection and Reporting** involves checking for successful completion of each cleanup operation and maintaining counters of leaked resources. This information is logged for monitoring systems and can trigger alerts when resource leaks exceed acceptable thresholds.\n\n| Cleanup Failure | Retry Strategy | Fallback Action | Leak Detection |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Mount umount EBUSY | Retry 3 times with 1s delay | Log warning, continue | Check /proc/mounts |\n| Cgroup rmdir ENOTEMPTY | Retry after killing processes | Mark for admin cleanup | Check cgroup.procs |\n| Process kill ESRCH | No retry needed | Process already gone | Check /proc/pid |\n| File unlink ENOENT | No retry needed | File already removed | No leak possible |\n| Namespace close EBADF | No retry needed | FD already closed | No leak possible |\n\n> **⚠️ Pitfall: Blocking on Failed Cleanup**\n> A common mistake is making cleanup operations synchronous and blocking when they fail. This can cause the sandbox orchestrator to hang indefinitely if kernel resources are in inconsistent states. Instead, implement cleanup with timeouts and continue with other operations even if some cleanup steps fail. Use asynchronous cleanup monitoring to retry failed operations in the background.\n\n### Monitoring and Health Checks\n\nEffective sandbox monitoring requires continuous observation of sandboxed process health, resource consumption patterns, and security boundary integrity. The monitoring system must detect both gradual degradation and sudden failures while providing actionable information for both automated recovery and human intervention.\n\n#### Sandbox Health Detection\n\nSandbox health encompasses multiple dimensions: process liveness, security boundary integrity, resource consumption patterns, and communication channel functionality. Each dimension requires specific monitoring approaches and failure detection thresholds.\n\n**Process Liveness Monitoring** tracks whether sandboxed processes are running, responsive, and behaving within expected parameters. This involves monitoring process existence through PID tracking, responsiveness through communication channel heartbeats, and behavioral patterns through system call monitoring. The monitoring system maintains process state in the `sandbox_lifecycle_state_t` enumeration and transitions between states based on observed behavior.\n\n**Security Boundary Integrity Checks** verify that namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, and capability limitations remain in effect throughout sandbox execution. These checks involve periodic verification that processes cannot access restricted resources, that namespace views remain isolated, and that seccomp filters continue blocking forbidden system calls.\n\n**Resource Consumption Pattern Analysis** monitors resource usage trends to detect both gradual resource leaks and sudden consumption spikes that might indicate malicious behavior or process malfunction. This includes tracking memory usage growth rates, file descriptor accumulation, and process creation patterns.\n\n| Health Dimension | Monitoring Method | Check Frequency | Failure Threshold |\n|------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Process Existence | Check /proc/pid | Every 1 second | Process not found |\n| Process Responsiveness | Heartbeat ping | Every 5 seconds | No response in 15s |\n| Memory Usage | Read cgroup memory.usage | Every 2 seconds | >90% of limit |\n| CPU Usage | Read cgroup cpu.stat | Every 5 seconds | >100% sustained |\n| File Descriptors | Count /proc/pid/fd entries | Every 10 seconds | >80% of limit |\n| Network Activity | Monitor namespace traffic | Every 1 second | Unexpected connections |\n| System Call Pattern | Audit log analysis | Continuous | Blocked syscall attempts |\n\n#### Misbehaving Process Detection\n\nDetecting and responding to misbehaving sandboxed processes requires understanding both resource-based misbehavior (consuming excessive resources) and security-based misbehavior (attempting to violate sandbox boundaries).\n\n**Resource Abuse Detection** identifies processes that consume resources in patterns inconsistent with their expected workload. This includes detecting memory leaks through monotonically increasing memory usage, CPU abuse through sustained high CPU utilization, and I/O abuse through excessive disk or network activity. The detection system uses sliding window analysis to distinguish between legitimate bursts and sustained abuse patterns.\n\n**Security Violation Detection** monitors attempts to breach sandbox security boundaries, including seccomp filter violations (blocked system calls), capability escalation attempts, and filesystem access violations. These violations are typically logged by kernel security mechanisms, but the monitoring system must aggregate and analyze these logs to detect coordinated attacks or persistent probing behavior.\n\n**Communication Protocol Violations** occur when sandboxed processes fail to follow expected communication patterns with the sandbox orchestrator. This includes sending malformed messages, failing to respond to control messages, or attempting to establish unauthorized communication channels.\n\n> **Decision: Misbehavior Response Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Misbehaving processes can affect both sandbox security and system stability, requiring immediate response\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate termination vs. graduated response vs. resource throttling\n> - **Decision**: Implement graduated response with escalating severity\n> - **Rationale**: Immediate termination may interrupt legitimate work during temporary resource spikes, while graduated response allows distinction between malicious behavior and temporary resource needs\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more complex monitoring logic but provides better user experience and more precise security enforcement\n\nThe misbehavior detection algorithm uses a **three-tier response system**:\n\n**Tier 1: Warning and Throttling** responds to minor resource violations or single security boundary probes by logging warnings and applying resource throttling. CPU throttling reduces the process's CPU quota, memory pressure applies swap pressure, and I/O throttling reduces bandwidth allocation.\n\n**Tier 2: Process Suspension** responds to repeated violations or sustained resource abuse by suspending the offending process using `SIGSTOP`. This prevents further resource consumption while preserving process state for analysis or user intervention.\n\n**Tier 3: Process Termination** responds to severe violations, persistent abuse after throttling, or security boundary breach attempts by terminating the entire sandbox process tree using `SIGKILL`.\n\n| Misbehavior Type | Detection Criteria | Tier 1 Response | Tier 2 Response | Tier 3 Response |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Memory Growth | 10% increase in 60s | Apply memory pressure | Suspend process | Kill on OOM |\n| CPU Abuse | >95% CPU for 30s | Reduce CPU quota | Suspend process | Kill after 2 minutes |\n| Fork Bomb | 10+ processes in 5s | Block new forks | Suspend all processes | Kill process tree |\n| File Descriptor Leak | FD count doubles | Close unused FDs | Suspend process | Kill and cleanup |\n| Network Flooding | >1000 packets/sec | Apply bandwidth limit | Suspend process | Kill and block |\n| Seccomp Violations | 5+ blocked syscalls | Log and monitor | Suspend process | Kill on 10+ attempts |\n\n#### Automated Recovery and Escalation\n\nThe monitoring system must not only detect problems but also implement automated recovery strategies and escalate to human operators when automated responses are insufficient.\n\n**Automatic Restart Policies** handle transient failures by restarting failed sandboxes according to configurable policies. The restart logic distinguishes between failures that warrant restart (resource exhaustion, temporary system issues) and failures that should not be retried (security violations, configuration errors). Restart attempts use exponential backoff to prevent resource thrashing.\n\n**Resource Adjustment and Healing** responds to resource pressure by automatically adjusting resource limits within acceptable bounds. If a sandbox consistently approaches memory limits but otherwise behaves properly, the system can increase memory allocation up to configured maximums. Similarly, CPU quotas can be adjusted based on workload patterns.\n\n**Escalation Triggers and Notifications** activate when automated responses are insufficient or when patterns suggest systemic issues requiring human attention. Escalation triggers include repeated sandbox failures, resource exhaustion at the host level, or security violation patterns that suggest coordinated attacks.\n\n| Recovery Scenario | Automatic Action | Escalation Trigger | Human Notification |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Process Crash | Restart with same config | 3 restarts in 5 minutes | Email alert |\n| Memory Pressure | Increase memory limit by 25% | Host memory <10% free | Page operator |\n| CPU Starvation | Increase CPU quota | Host load >8.0 | Dashboard alert |\n| Security Violations | Kill and restart with stricter limits | >10 violations/hour | Security team alert |\n| Host Resource Exhaustion | Suspend new sandboxes | Cannot create new sandbox | Emergency page |\n| Cleanup Failures | Retry cleanup with delays | >50 leaked resources | Operations alert |\n\n> **⚠️ Pitfall: Alert Fatigue from Over-Monitoring**\n> Monitoring systems often generate so many alerts that operators become desensitized to genuine problems. Design monitoring thresholds to minimize false positives by using trend analysis rather than absolute thresholds, implementing alert suppression during maintenance windows, and escalating only when multiple indicators suggest genuine problems. A single memory spike should not trigger alerts, but sustained growth combined with increased CPU usage and file descriptor accumulation should.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe error handling and monitoring system bridges the gap between sandbox creation and production readiness, providing the infrastructure needed to detect, respond to, and recover from the wide variety of failure modes that occur in real deployments.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Process Monitoring | Poll /proc filesystem | Use netlink process events |\n| Resource Monitoring | Parse cgroup files | Use cgroup notification API |\n| Log Aggregation | Write to syslog | Use structured logging with journald |\n| Metrics Collection | Simple counters in memory | Prometheus metrics endpoint |\n| Health Checks | Basic HTTP endpoint | Rich health check with component status |\n| Error Reporting | Write to stderr | Structured error logs with correlation IDs |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe error handling system integrates across all sandbox components, requiring both centralized error handling infrastructure and component-specific error recovery logic.\n\n```\nsandbox/\n├── src/\n│   ├── error/\n│   │   ├── error_handler.c        ← centralized error classification and logging\n│   │   ├── cleanup_manager.c      ← resource tracking and cleanup orchestration\n│   │   ├── retry_logic.c          ← exponential backoff and retry utilities\n│   │   └── error_recovery.c       ← automatic recovery strategies\n│   ├── monitoring/\n│   │   ├── health_monitor.c       ← sandbox health checks and status tracking\n│   │   ├── resource_monitor.c     ← resource usage monitoring and trend analysis\n│   │   ├── process_monitor.c      ← process lifecycle and misbehavior detection\n│   │   └── metrics_collector.c    ← metrics aggregation and reporting\n│   ├── sandbox/\n│   │   ├── sandbox_orchestrator.c ← integrates error handling with sandbox creation\n│   │   └── lifecycle_manager.c    ← manages sandbox lifecycle state transitions\n│   └── util/\n│       ├── signal_utils.c         ← signal handling utilities for cleanup\n│       └── proc_utils.c           ← /proc filesystem parsing utilities\n├── include/\n│   ├── error/\n│   │   ├── error_codes.h          ← error code definitions and classifications\n│   │   ├── cleanup_manager.h      ← resource tracking structures and APIs\n│   │   └── error_recovery.h       ← recovery strategy function signatures\n│   └── monitoring/\n│       ├── health_monitor.h       ← health check structures and status definitions\n│       └── resource_monitor.h     ← resource monitoring thresholds and limits\n└── tests/\n    ├── error/\n    │   ├── test_error_injection.c  ← controlled failure testing\n    │   └── test_cleanup_recovery.c ← cleanup and recovery testing\n    └── monitoring/\n        ├── test_health_checks.c    ← health monitoring validation\n        └── test_misbehavior.c      ← misbehavior detection testing\n```\n\n#### Error Classification and Reporting Infrastructure\n\nThe error handling system requires comprehensive infrastructure for classifying, logging, and responding to different types of failures.

The sandbox's primary purpose is to **contain and restrict** rather than to provide functionality, which means our tests must verify that operations fail correctly rather than succeed. Think of testing a process sandbox like **quality assurance for a maximum-security prison** - we're not just checking that the doors lock, but that every possible escape route has been blocked, every privilege has been properly restricted, and every resource limit is actively enforced.\n\nThe challenge lies in the fact that security mechanisms often work by **preventing observable behavior** rather than producing it. A successful seccomp filter kills processes before they can report what happened. A properly configured cgroup silently throttles CPU usage. A correctly dropped capability makes system calls fail with cryptic error codes. Our testing strategy must account for these \"negative\" behaviors while ensuring that legitimate operations still function correctly within the restricted environment.\n\nFurthermore, the defense-in-depth architecture means that **multiple security layers interact** in complex ways. A test might pass when only namespaces are active but fail when seccomp filtering is added, or resource limits might behave differently when capabilities have been dropped. Our testing approach must validate not just individual components but their interactions and the emergent security properties of the complete system.\n\n### Unit Testing Approach\n\n**Mental Model: The Security Component Laboratory**\n\nThink of unit testing security components like **running controlled experiments in separate laboratory chambers**. Each test isolates a single security mechanism (namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, capabilities) and subjects it to precisely controlled conditions to verify it behaves correctly. Just as a laboratory experiment controls all variables except the one being studied, our unit tests activate only the security layer under test while mocking or bypassing the others.\n\nThe key insight is that security components have **dual responsibilities**: they must block malicious operations while allowing legitimate ones. Every unit test must therefore verify both the \"deny\" path and the \"allow\" path. A namespace test that only checks isolation without verifying that permitted operations still work is incomplete and may hide bugs that break legitimate functionality.\n\n**Component-Level Test Structure**\n\nEach security component requires a distinct testing approach tailored to its specific isolation mechanism and failure modes. The following table outlines the core test categories for each component:\n\n| Component | Primary Test Focus | Success Criteria | Failure Criteria | Special Considerations |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Namespace Isolation | Resource view separation | Isolated process sees different PIDs, mounts, network | Host system resources remain visible | Requires root privileges, cleanup of namespaces |\n| Filesystem Isolation | Filesystem access restriction | Only sandbox root and permitted paths accessible | Host filesystem paths remain accessible | Requires mount/unmount operations, dependency tracking |\n| Seccomp Filtering | System call restriction | Allowed syscalls succeed, forbidden syscalls killed | Forbidden syscalls succeed or wrong error code | Architecture-specific syscall numbers, BPF compilation |\n| Resource Limits | Resource consumption control | Limits enforced when exceeded | Unlimited resource consumption possible | Time-dependent behavior, requires resource pressure |\n| Capability Management | Privilege restriction | Privileged operations fail after dropping | Privileged operations succeed after dropping | Order-dependent operations, ambient capability interactions |\n\n**Namespace Isolation Unit Tests**\n\nNamespace testing focuses on verifying that each namespace type creates the expected isolated view of system resources. The fundamental challenge is that namespace isolation is only visible from inside the namespace, requiring tests to fork child processes and examine their environment.\n\nThe namespace test suite must verify isolation for each namespace type:\n\n1. **PID Namespace Tests**: Fork a child process in a new PID namespace and verify it sees itself as PID 1, cannot see host processes in `/proc`, and can only signal processes within its namespace.\n\n2. **Mount Namespace Tests**: Create a new mount namespace, perform mount operations, and verify they are not visible from the host namespace while confirming the child can access its own mounts.\n\n3. **Network Namespace Tests**: Create a network namespace and verify the child process has no network interfaces except loopback, cannot connect to external services, and cannot see host network configuration.\n\n4. **UTS Namespace Tests**: Modify hostname within a UTS namespace and confirm changes are isolated from the host system while remaining visible within the namespace.\n\n5. **User Namespace Tests**: Map user IDs within a user namespace and verify the mapping is enforced for file system operations and process ownership while maintaining isolation from host user management.\n\nEach test requires careful orchestration of parent-child communication to verify isolation properties:\n\n| Test Phase | Parent Process Actions | Child Process Actions | Verification Method |\n|------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Setup | Create namespace with `create_namespaces()` | Enter namespace via `setns()` | Check namespace inode numbers |\n| Isolation | Modify host resources | Attempt to observe host changes | Verify child sees unchanged state |\n| Containment | Monitor host state | Perform operations in namespace | Verify host remains unaffected |\n| Cleanup | Clean up namespace file descriptors | Exit normally | Verify namespace is destroyed |\n\n**Filesystem Isolation Unit Tests**\n\nFilesystem isolation testing must verify that the sandbox's filesystem view is both complete enough to function and restricted enough to prevent access to sensitive host resources. The tests must account for the complex interactions between chroot/pivot_root operations, mount namespaces, and bind mount restrictions.\n\nThe core filesystem isolation tests include:\n\n1. **Root Filesystem Restriction**: Verify that processes cannot access paths outside the sandbox root, cannot traverse to parent directories, and cannot follow symlinks that escape the sandbox.\n\n2. **Essential Directory Population**: Confirm that `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/sys` are properly mounted with appropriate restrictions, essential device files are accessible, and system information is available but filtered.\n\n3. **Mount Point Management**: Test that temporary filesystems are correctly mounted, bind mounts are properly restricted, and all mounts are tracked for cleanup.\n\n4. **Dependency Resolution**: Verify that all required shared libraries are available within the sandbox, binary executables can load and run, and no missing dependencies prevent legitimate operations.\n\nThe filesystem test approach requires careful setup of test environments:\n\n| Test Environment | Purpose | Setup Requirements | Cleanup Requirements |\n|------------------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Minimal Root | Test basic chroot functionality | Create directory tree, copy essential binaries | Remove temporary directory tree |\n| Library Test Root | Test dependency resolution | Copy full library dependencies | Clean up library cache, temporary files |\n| Device Node Test | Test `/dev` population | Create device nodes, set permissions | Remove created devices, restore permissions |\n| Mount Test Environment | Test mount management | Prepare test mount points | Unmount all test mounts, remove directories |\n\n**Seccomp Filtering Unit Tests**\n\nSeccomp filter testing requires verifying that BPF programs correctly identify and block forbidden system calls while allowing permitted ones. The challenge is that seccomp violations terminate the process, requiring careful test orchestration to capture and verify the termination behavior.\n\nThe seccomp test methodology involves:\n\n1. **BPF Program Generation**: Test that syscall whitelists generate correct BPF instruction sequences, handle architecture-specific syscall numbers properly, and produce valid filter programs that load without errors.\n\n2. **Allowed Syscall Verification**: Install the filter and verify that whitelisted syscalls complete successfully, return expected values, and do not trigger filter violations.\n\n3. **Forbidden Syscall Detection**: Attempt forbidden syscalls and verify they result in process termination, appropriate exit codes, and no side effects on system state.\n\n4. **Argument-Level Filtering**: Test filters that examine syscall arguments, verify that parameter-based restrictions work correctly, and confirm that argument validation prevents bypass attempts.\n\nThe seccomp testing approach requires managing child processes that may be killed by the filter:\n\n| Test Scenario | Parent Actions | Child Actions | Expected Outcome |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Whitelist Compliance | Fork child, wait for exit | Install filter, call allowed syscalls | Child exits normally |\n| Blacklist Violation | Fork child, expect SIGKILL | Install filter, call forbidden syscall | Child killed by kernel |\n| Argument Filtering | Fork child, monitor exit code | Install filter, call syscall with bad args | Child killed or errno returned |\n| Filter Bypass Attempt | Monitor system state | Try various bypass techniques | All attempts fail, no system impact |\n\n**Resource Limit Unit Tests**\n\nCgroup resource limit testing must verify that limits are correctly applied and enforced under resource pressure. These tests require generating controlled resource consumption to trigger limit enforcement and observing the system's response.\n\nThe resource limit test categories include:\n\n1. **Memory Limit Enforcement**: Allocate memory beyond the configured limit and verify the process is terminated by the OOM killer, memory usage is capped at the limit, and other processes remain unaffected.\n\n2. **CPU Limit Enforcement**: Generate CPU load and verify that usage is throttled to the configured percentage, other processes receive fair scheduling, and limits are maintained over time.\n\n3. **Process Count Limits**: Fork processes beyond the PID limit and verify new forks fail with appropriate error codes, existing processes continue running, and the limit is enforced consistently.\n\n4. **I/O Bandwidth Limits**: Generate disk I/O load and verify throughput is capped at configured rates, I/O operations are throttled appropriately, and limits apply to all file operations.\n\nResource limit testing requires careful coordination of resource consumption:\n\n| Resource Type | Load Generation Method | Measurement Approach | Verification Criteria |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Memory | Allocate increasing buffer sizes | Monitor `/proc/*/status` RSS | Allocation fails or process killed at limit |\n| CPU | Busy loop with configurable intensity | Monitor CPU usage via cgroup stats | Usage throttled to configured percentage |\n| Process Count | Fork bomb with controlled rate | Count processes in cgroup | Fork fails when limit reached |\n| I/O Bandwidth | Large file read/write operations | Monitor I/O rates via iostat | Throughput capped at limit |\n\n**Capability Management Unit Tests**\n\nCapability testing verifies that Linux capabilities are correctly dropped and that privilege escalation is prevented. The tests must account for the complex interactions between different capability sets and the various mechanisms for capability inheritance.\n\nThe capability test framework must verify:\n\n1. **Capability Dropping**: Confirm that specified capabilities are removed from all capability sets, remaining capabilities are preserved correctly, and the bounding set prevents re-acquisition of dropped capabilities.\n\n2. **Privilege Operation Blocking**: Attempt operations that require dropped capabilities and verify they fail with permission denied errors, no privileged side effects occur, and error handling is appropriate.\n\n3. **No New Privileges Enforcement**: Verify that `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` prevents privilege escalation through exec, setuid binaries do not gain privileges, and capability inheritance is blocked correctly.\n\n4. **User/Group Transition**: Test that user and group changes occur in the correct order, capabilities are appropriately adjusted during transitions, and the final privilege state matches expectations.\n\nThe capability testing approach requires privilege verification at multiple stages:\n\n| Test Stage | Capability Check | Operation Test | Success Criteria |\n|------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Initial State | List all current capabilities | Verify privileged operations work | Full capability set available |\n| After Dropping | Verify specific caps removed | Confirm dropped operations fail | Only whitelisted capabilities remain |\n| After No-New-Privs | Check flag is set | Attempt privilege escalation | All escalation attempts fail |\n| After User Change | Verify final capability state | Test remaining privileges work | Expected capabilities functional |\n\n### Integration Testing\n\n**Mental Model: The Complete Security System Rehearsal**\n\nIntegration testing for a process sandbox is like **conducting a full-scale security drill** for a high-security facility. While unit tests examine individual security components in isolation (like testing each lock and sensor separately), integration tests activate the entire security system simultaneously and verify that all layers work together harmoniously. The goal is to ensure that the combination of namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability dropping creates a robust containment environment without unexpected interactions that could compromise security or break legitimate functionality.\n\nThe critical insight is that security layers can interfere with each other in subtle ways. Namespace isolation might prevent seccomp filters from accessing required kernel information. Capability dropping might break cgroup management operations. Filesystem restrictions might prevent access to libraries needed for system call handling. Integration testing must uncover these interactions and verify that the orchestration sequence produces a stable, secure environment.\n\n**Realistic Workload Testing**\n\nIntegration testing focuses on running realistic programs within the complete sandbox environment to verify that all security layers cooperate effectively. The test workloads should represent the types of programs the sandbox is designed to contain: computational tasks, file processing jobs, network services, and potentially malicious code that attempts various escape techniques.\n\nThe integration test suite includes several categories of realistic workloads:\n\n| Workload Category | Program Type | Security Challenge | Expected Behavior |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Computational | CPU-intensive calculations | Resource limit enforcement | Program completes within CPU limits |\n| File Processing | Read/write file operations | Filesystem isolation + I/O limits | Only sandbox files accessible, I/O throttled |\n| System Information | Query system resources | Namespace isolation | Only sandbox view visible |\n| Network Operations | Socket creation, connections | Network namespace isolation | Network access blocked |\n| Privilege Escalation | Setuid, capability manipulation | Capability dropping + seccomp | All escalation attempts fail |\n| Resource Exhaustion | Memory/CPU/disk bombs | Cgroup resource limits | Resource consumption capped, no host impact |\n\n**Multi-Process Workload Testing**\n\nReal-world programs often spawn child processes, creating additional complexity for sandbox management. Integration tests must verify that all child processes inherit the same security restrictions, resource limits are applied hierarchically, and process management operations work correctly within the sandbox environment.\n\nThe multi-process testing approach examines several scenarios:\n\n1. **Fork and Exec Chains**: Programs that spawn multiple child processes through fork and exec operations, verifying that each child inherits the complete security context and cannot escape through process manipulation.\n\n2. **Process Communication**: Parent and child processes that communicate through pipes, shared memory, or other IPC mechanisms, confirming that communication works within the sandbox but cannot reach external processes.\n\n3. **Process Tree Management**: Programs that create complex process hierarchies, ensuring that resource limits apply to the entire tree and that process cleanup handles all descendants correctly.\n\n4. **Signal Handling**: Process groups that use signals for coordination, verifying that signal delivery works within the sandbox but cannot affect external processes.\n\nThe multi-process test framework tracks process relationships and resource usage:\n\n| Test Scenario | Process Pattern | Verification Points | Success Criteria |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Simple Fork | Parent forks one child | Both processes in same cgroup, namespace | Resource limits apply to both, isolation maintained |\n| Exec Chain | Process A execs B, B execs C | Security context preserved across execs | All execed processes have same restrictions |\n| Process Tree | Parent spawns multiple children | Hierarchical resource accounting | Tree-wide resource limits enforced |\n| IPC Communication | Processes share data via pipes | Communication works, isolation maintained | Internal IPC works, external blocked |\n\n**Performance Impact Assessment**\n\nIntegration testing must verify that the security layers do not impose excessive performance overhead that would make the sandbox impractical for real workloads. Performance testing measures the overhead introduced by each security mechanism and their combined impact on system resources.\n\nThe performance testing methodology includes:\n\n1. **Baseline Measurements**: Run workloads on the host system without any sandbox restrictions to establish performance baselines for CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O throughput, and execution time.\n\n2. **Incremental Layer Testing**: Add security layers one at a time and measure the performance impact of each addition, identifying which mechanisms contribute most to overhead and whether the impact is acceptable.\n\n3. **Resource Efficiency**: Monitor system resource usage during sandbox operation to verify that the sandbox infrastructure itself does not consume excessive CPU, memory, or I/O bandwidth that could affect host system performance.\n\n4. **Scalability Testing**: Run multiple sandbox instances simultaneously to verify that the system can handle realistic concurrent workloads without performance degradation or resource exhaustion.\n\nThe performance measurement framework tracks key metrics:\n\n| Performance Metric | Measurement Method | Acceptable Overhead | Failure Threshold |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| CPU Overhead | Compare execution time vs baseline | < 20% increase | > 50% increase |\n| Memory Overhead | Monitor RSS usage of sandbox processes | < 10MB per sandbox | > 50MB per sandbox |\n| I/O Throughput | Measure disk read/write rates | < 15% reduction | > 40% reduction |\n| Startup Time | Time from sandbox creation to program execution | < 100ms | > 500ms |\n| Cleanup Time | Time to fully clean up sandbox resources | < 50ms | > 200ms |\n\n**Security Interaction Testing**\n\nThe most critical aspect of integration testing is verifying that the combination of security layers does not create unexpected vulnerabilities or bypass opportunities. Security interaction testing attempts various escape techniques that might exploit the interfaces between different security mechanisms.\n\nThe security interaction test suite includes:\n\n1. **Layer Bypass Attempts**: Try to use features of one security layer to circumvent restrictions imposed by another, such as using namespace manipulation to escape filesystem isolation or exploiting cgroup interfaces to bypass capability restrictions.\n\n2. **Privilege Escalation Chains**: Attempt multi-step privilege escalation attacks that combine techniques across different security layers, verifying that the defense-in-depth approach blocks sophisticated attack sequences.\n\n3. **Resource Exhaustion Attacks**: Try to exhaust resources in ways that might disable security mechanisms or cause the sandbox to fail in an unsafe state, ensuring that resource limits protect the security infrastructure itself.\n\n4. **Information Leakage Tests**: Attempt to extract information about the host system through various channels, verifying that namespace isolation and filesystem restrictions prevent information disclosure.\n\nThe security testing approach systematically explores potential vulnerabilities:\n\n| Attack Category | Attack Vector | Security Layers Tested | Expected Defense |\n|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Container Escape | `/proc` traversal, mount manipulation | Namespace + filesystem isolation | All escape attempts blocked |\n| Privilege Escalation | Setuid exploitation, capability abuse | Capability dropping + seccomp | Escalation impossible |\n| Resource Bombing | Memory/CPU exhaustion attacks | Cgroup limits + seccomp | Resource consumption capped |\n| Information Disclosure | System resource enumeration | Namespace isolation | Only sandbox view visible |\n| Side-Channel Attacks | Timing analysis, cache behavior | Complete security stack | Minimal information leakage |\n\n### Security Validation Tests\n\n**Mental Model: The Penetration Testing Laboratory**\n\nSecurity validation testing transforms our sandbox into a **target for systematic penetration testing**, where we deliberately attempt to break, bypass, or exploit every security mechanism we've implemented. Think of this phase as **hiring a professional burglar to test your security system** - we assume the role of an attacker with detailed knowledge of the sandbox's implementation and systematically probe every possible weakness. The goal is not just to verify that security mechanisms work under normal conditions, but to ensure they remain effective against sophisticated attacks designed specifically to exploit their weaknesses.\n\nThe key insight is that security validation must test both **known attack vectors** and **unexpected failure modes**. Known attacks include well-documented container escape techniques, privilege escalation exploits, and resource exhaustion attacks. Unexpected failure modes arise from the complex interactions between security layers and might include race conditions in cleanup code, edge cases in BPF filter evaluation, or resource accounting errors under extreme load.\n\n**Namespace Escape Prevention Testing**\n\nNamespace isolation is often the first target for container escape attempts because it provides the most fundamental isolation layer. Security validation must verify that namespace boundaries cannot be crossed through any combination of system calls, filesystem operations, or resource manipulations.\n\nThe namespace escape testing methodology systematically probes each namespace type for vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **PID Namespace Escape Tests**: Attempt to access or manipulate processes outside the namespace through `/proc` traversal, process signaling, shared memory segments, and process tracing interfaces. Verify that all attempts fail and that the namespace boundary is impermeable.\n\n2. **Mount Namespace Escape Tests**: Try to access the host filesystem through mount point manipulation, symlink traversal, bind mount exploitation, and `/proc` filesystem access. Confirm that all host filesystem access is blocked and that mount operations remain contained.\n\n3. **Network Namespace Escape Tests**: Attempt to communicate with external networks through socket operations, netlink interfaces, network filesystem mounts, and shared network resources. Verify that all external communication is blocked and that network isolation is complete.\n\n4. **User Namespace Privilege Escalation**: Try to gain host privileges through user namespace mapping manipulation, capability inheritance, setuid program exploitation, and filesystem permission bypasses. Ensure that user mapping provides isolation without privilege escalation opportunities.\n\nThe namespace escape test framework uses systematic probing techniques:\n\n| Escape Technique | Test Methodology | Security Expectation | Failure Indicators |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| /proc Traversal | Access `/proc/1/root`, `/proc/*/cwd` | Access denied, symlinks blocked | Host filesystem becomes visible |\n| Mount Manipulation | Bind mount host paths, remount read-write | Operations fail or restricted | Host mounts accessible |\n| Netlink Exploitation | Use netlink sockets to query host network | No host network information | Host network config visible |\n| Capability Inheritance | Exploit user namespace for capability gain | No additional privileges acquired | Privileged operations succeed |\n\n**Seccomp Filter Bypass Testing**\n\nSeccomp-BPF filters represent a critical security boundary that attackers will attempt to bypass through various techniques including syscall argument manipulation, architecture-specific exploit, and timing-based attacks. Security validation must verify that the BPF filter correctly handles all edge cases and cannot be circumvented.\n\nThe seccomp bypass testing approach includes:\n\n1. **Syscall Argument Manipulation**: Test BPF filters with edge case arguments including null pointers, invalid addresses, extreme values, and crafted data structures designed to confuse argument parsing logic.\n\n2. **Architecture-Specific Bypasses**: Verify that syscall number mappings are correct across different architectures, that no syscalls are missed due to architecture differences, and that calling conventions are properly handled.\n\n3. **Race Condition Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit timing windows between filter installation and process execution, verify that filters cannot be modified after installation, and ensure that filter application is atomic.\n\n4. **BPF Program Logic Flaws**: Test the BPF program with syscalls that have multiple code paths, verify that all conditional branches lead to correct decisions, and ensure that no logic errors allow forbidden operations.\n\nThe seccomp testing framework validates filter correctness systematically:\n\n| Bypass Technique | Test Implementation | Expected Filter Behavior | Vulnerability Indicators |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Argument Crafting | Call allowed syscalls with malicious args | Arguments validated, bad calls blocked | Malicious args bypass filter |\n| Syscall Aliasing | Use alternate syscall numbers for same operation | All variants blocked consistently | Alias syscalls succeed |\n| Timing Attacks | Install filter during syscall execution | Filter applied atomically | Race condition allows bypass |\n| Logic Exploitation | Trigger edge cases in BPF logic | All edge cases handled correctly | Unexpected filter behavior |\n\n**Resource Limit Enforcement Verification**\n\nResource limits protect both the host system and the sandbox infrastructure from resource exhaustion attacks. Security validation must verify that limits are enforced under extreme conditions and that limit enforcement mechanisms cannot be bypassed or disabled.\n\nThe resource limit testing approach examines enforcement under pressure:\n\n1. **Memory Exhaustion Attacks**: Rapidly allocate memory to exceed limits, attempt to bypass limits through shared memory or memory mapping, and verify that the OOM killer terminates processes correctly without affecting the host system.\n\n2. **CPU Consumption Attacks**: Generate maximum CPU load to test throttling mechanisms, attempt to bypass CPU limits through process spawning or nice value manipulation, and ensure that other processes receive fair scheduling.\n\n3. **Process Spawning Attacks**: Create fork bombs to test PID limits, attempt to exhaust process table entries, and verify that process creation limits protect system stability.\n\n4. **I/O Exhaustion Attacks**: Generate intensive disk I/O to test bandwidth limits, attempt to bypass I/O limits through different filesystem interfaces, and ensure that I/O throttling protects system responsiveness.\n\nThe resource limit validation framework tests enforcement under extreme conditions:\n\n| Attack Type | Resource Pressure Method | Limit Enforcement Test | System Protection Verification |\n|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Memory Bomb | Allocate beyond cgroup limit | Process killed by OOM | Host memory usage unaffected |\n| CPU Bomb | Busy loops consuming 100% CPU | CPU usage throttled to limit | Host processes remain responsive |\n| Fork Bomb | Spawn processes rapidly | Fork fails at PID limit | Host process table protected |\n| I/O Bomb | Heavy disk read/write load | I/O rate limited to quota | Host I/O performance preserved |\n\n**Capability Escalation Prevention Testing**\n\nCapability dropping provides fine-grained privilege control, but capability management has many subtle edge cases that attackers may exploit. Security validation must verify that capability restrictions cannot be bypassed through any combination of system calls or process manipulation.\n\nThe capability escalation testing methodology includes:\n\n1. **Direct Capability Exploitation**: Attempt operations that require dropped capabilities and verify they fail consistently, test that capability sets are correctly maintained across process operations, and ensure that no capabilities can be re-acquired.\n\n2. **Indirect Privilege Escalation**: Try to gain privileges through setuid programs, filesystem capabilities, or other mechanisms that might bypass capability restrictions, ensuring that all privilege escalation paths are blocked.\n\n3. **Capability Inheritance Attacks**: Exploit capability inheritance mechanisms through exec operations, process spawning, and shared resources to gain additional privileges in child processes.\n\n4. **Ambient Capability Exploitation**: Test that ambient capabilities do not provide unexpected privilege escalation opportunities and that the interaction between different capability sets is secure.\n\nThe capability escalation test framework systematically probes privilege boundaries:\n\n| Escalation Method | Attack Implementation | Expected Failure Mode | Security Breach Indicators |\n|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Direct Cap Usage | Call syscalls requiring dropped caps | Operation fails with EPERM | Privileged operation succeeds |\n| Setuid Exploitation | Execute setuid programs | No privilege change | Process gains privileges |\n| Exec Inheritance | Gain caps through program exec | No additional capabilities | New capabilities acquired |\n| Ambient Cap Abuse | Exploit ambient capability set | Ambient caps remain restricted | Unexpected privileges gained |\n\n**Complete System Penetration Testing**\n\nThe most comprehensive security validation involves **comprehensive penetration testing** that combines multiple attack techniques in sophisticated sequences designed to exploit the interactions between different security layers. This testing phase attempts realistic attack scenarios that a skilled adversary might use against the sandbox.\n\nThe penetration testing approach includes:\n\n1. **Multi-Stage Attack Sequences**: Chain together multiple exploit techniques across different security layers, attempting to use partial success in one area to enable attacks against another security mechanism.\n\n2. **Information Gathering and Reconnaissance**: Systematically probe the sandbox environment to gather information that could enable more targeted attacks, testing whether the sandbox reveals implementation details that could aid an attacker.\n\n3. **Persistence and Stealth Testing**: Attempt to establish persistent access or hide malicious activities within the sandbox environment, verifying that monitoring and cleanup mechanisms detect and prevent such activities.\n\n4. **Host Impact Assessment**: Conduct attacks designed to impact the host system through resource consumption, information disclosure, or privilege escalation, ensuring that the sandbox provides complete isolation.\n\nThe comprehensive penetration testing framework simulates realistic attack scenarios:\n\n| Attack Scenario | Attack Chain | Security Layers Challenged | Success Criteria |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Container Breakout | Info gathering → namespace escape → privilege escalation | All layers | Complete containment maintained |\n| Resource Warfare | Resource exhaustion → monitoring evasion → persistence | Cgroup limits + monitoring | Resource attacks contained |\n| Stealth Persistence | Minimal footprint → cleanup evasion → information exfiltration | All layers + cleanup | No persistent access achieved |\n| Host Compromise | Privilege escalation → capability abuse → system manipulation | Capabilities + seccomp | No host system impact |\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Mental Model: Security Clearance Checkpoints**\n\nThink of milestone checkpoints as **security clearance verification stations** where each sandbox component must pass rigorous testing before being certified for the next level of integration. Just as security clearance involves both background checks and practical demonstrations of trustworthiness, each milestone checkpoint combines automated testing with manual verification to ensure that the component functions correctly and securely before advancing to more complex integration scenarios.\n\nThe checkpoint system serves multiple purposes: it provides **incremental confidence building** as each security layer is validated, it enables **early problem detection** before components become entangled in complex interactions, and it creates **natural debugging boundaries** that help isolate issues to specific components when integration testing reveals problems.\n\n**Milestone 1: Namespace Isolation Verification**\n\nThe namespace isolation checkpoint verifies that the foundational isolation layer works correctly and provides the expected separation of system resource views. This checkpoint is critical because all subsequent security layers depend on namespace isolation to provide their security context.\n\nThe namespace checkpoint testing procedure includes systematic verification of each namespace type:\n\n1. **PID Namespace Verification**: Create a sandbox with PID namespace isolation and verify that the sandboxed process sees itself as PID 1, cannot observe host processes in its `/proc` view, and can only send signals to processes within its own namespace.\n\n2. **Mount Namespace Verification**: Set up mount namespace isolation and confirm that mount operations within the sandbox are invisible to the host, that the sandbox cannot see host mount points, and that mount point manipulation cannot escape the namespace boundary.\n\n3. **Network Namespace Verification**: Establish network namespace isolation and verify that the sandbox has no network connectivity, cannot see host network interfaces, and cannot communicate with external network services.\n\n4. **UTS Namespace Verification**: Create UTS namespace isolation and confirm that hostname changes within the sandbox do not affect the host system and that the sandbox cannot observe host system identification information.\n\nThe namespace checkpoint verification process follows a structured validation sequence:\n\n| Verification Step | Test Command | Expected Output | Failure Indicators |\n|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| PID Namespace | Run `ps aux` inside sandbox | Only sandbox processes visible, init PID is 1 | Host processes visible, wrong init PID |\n| Mount Namespace | Check `/proc/mounts` inside sandbox | Only sandbox mounts listed | Host mounts visible |\n| Network Namespace | Run `ip addr` inside sandbox | Only loopback interface present | Host network interfaces visible |\n| UTS Namespace | Change hostname, check from host | Host hostname unchanged | Host hostname modified |\n\n**Namespace Isolation Debugging Checklist**\n\nWhen namespace isolation tests fail, systematic debugging helps identify the root cause:\n\n⚠️ **Common Namespace Issues**\n\n- **Missing CLONE_NEWPID Flag**: If processes don't see PID 1, verify that `CLONE_NEWPID` was specified in the clone() call and that `/proc` is mounted in the new namespace.\n\n- **Insufficient Privileges**: Namespace creation requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. Verify that the sandbox creator process has appropriate privileges or is running as root.\n\n- **Namespace File Descriptor Leaks**: If namespace isolation is inconsistent, check that namespace file descriptors are properly managed and that processes enter the correct namespace via `setns()`.\n\n- **Mount Propagation Issues**: If mount operations affect the host, verify that mount propagation is set to private and that the mount namespace is properly isolated.\n\n**Milestone 2: Filesystem Isolation Verification**\n\nThe filesystem isolation checkpoint ensures that the sandbox provides a complete and secure filesystem environment that prevents access to sensitive host resources while providing all necessary functionality for legitimate programs.\n\nThe filesystem checkpoint validation process examines multiple aspects of filesystem isolation:\n\n1. **Root Filesystem Containment**: Verify that processes cannot access paths outside the sandbox root directory through any combination of path traversal, symlink following, or special filesystem interfaces.\n\n2. **Essential Service Availability**: Confirm that essential directories like `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/tmp` are properly mounted and populated with necessary entries for program execution.\n\n3. **Library Dependency Resolution**: Test that programs can successfully load all required shared libraries and that no library dependencies cause execution failures within the sandbox environment.\n\n4. **Filesystem Permission Enforcement**: Verify that filesystem permissions are correctly enforced within the sandbox and that privilege escalation through filesystem manipulation is prevented.\n\nThe filesystem checkpoint verification follows a comprehensive testing protocol:\n\n| Verification Category | Test Procedure | Success Criteria | Troubleshooting Steps |\n|--------------------- |----------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Root Containment | Try to access `/host`, `/../`, `/proc/1/root` | All access attempts fail | Check chroot/pivot_root, mount namespaces |\n| Essential Directories | Test access to `/proc`, `/dev/null`, `/tmp` | All essential paths accessible | Verify mount operations, device creation |\n| Library Loading | Run dynamically linked programs | Programs execute successfully | Check library paths, dependency resolution |\n| Permission Enforcement | Test file operations with various permissions | Permissions enforced correctly | Verify filesystem type, mount options |\n\n**Filesystem Isolation Debugging Checklist**\n\nFilesystem isolation problems often involve complex interactions between mount operations, permission settings, and library dependencies:\n\n⚠️ **Common Filesystem Issues**\n\n- **Missing Device Nodes**: If programs fail with \"No such device\" errors, verify that essential device files like `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, and `/dev/random` are present and have correct permissions.\n\n- **Library Path Problems**: If programs fail to load, use `ldd` on the host to identify required libraries and ensure they are copied to the appropriate paths within the sandbox root.\n\n- **Mount Order Dependencies**: If mounts fail inconsistently, verify that mount operations occur in the correct order and that parent directories exist before mounting child filesystems.\n\n- **Permission Propagation**: If permission changes affect the host, check that bind mounts are configured appropriately and that filesystem operations are properly contained.\n\n**Milestone 3: System Call Filtering Verification**\n\nThe seccomp filtering checkpoint validates that system call restrictions are correctly implemented and that the BPF filter provides robust protection against unauthorized system call usage while allowing legitimate operations to proceed.\n\nThe seccomp checkpoint testing protocol includes comprehensive validation of filter behavior:\n\n1. **Whitelist Compliance Testing**: Execute programs that use only whitelisted system calls and verify they complete successfully without filter violations or unexpected termination.\n\n2. **Blacklist Enforcement Testing**: Attempt to execute forbidden system calls and confirm they result in immediate process termination with appropriate exit codes and no side effects on system state.\n\n3. **Argument-Level Filter Testing**: Test system calls with various argument combinations to verify that argument-based filtering works correctly and that malicious arguments are properly detected.\n\n4. **Filter Robustness Testing**: Subject the seccomp filter to edge case inputs and stress conditions to ensure it remains stable and secure under all operating conditions.\n\nThe seccomp verification process validates filter behavior systematically:\n\n| Filter Test Category | Test Implementation | Expected Behavior | Validation Method |\n|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Allowed Syscalls | Call whitelisted syscalls with normal args | Syscalls complete successfully | Monitor exit status, check for violations |\n| Forbidden Syscalls | Attempt blacklisted syscalls | Process killed immediately | Verify SIGSYS signal, check exit code |\n| Argument Filtering | Call syscalls with filtered arguments | Bad args rejected, good args allowed | Test argument validation logic |\n| Filter Edge Cases | Test with extreme or malformed inputs | Filter remains stable and secure | Monitor for crashes, bypasses, errors |\n\n**Seccomp Filter Debugging Checklist**\n\nSeccomp filter problems often involve subtle issues in BPF program logic or syscall number handling:\n\n⚠️ **Common Seccomp Issues**\n\n- **Missing Required Syscalls**: If legitimate programs are killed unexpectedly, use `strace` to identify required syscalls that are missing from the whitelist.\n\n- **Architecture-Specific Numbers**: If filters behave differently on different systems, verify that syscall numbers are correctly mapped for the target architecture.\n\n- **NO_NEW_PRIVS Flag**: If seccomp filter installation fails, ensure that the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag is set before installing the filter.\n\n- **BPF Program Validation**: If filter installation fails, verify that the BPF program is correctly formatted and that all instruction offsets and jump targets are valid.\n\n**Milestone 4: Resource Limit Enforcement Verification**\n\nThe cgroup resource limit checkpoint ensures that resource consumption is properly controlled and that limits are enforced under various load conditions without affecting host system performance or stability.\n\nThe resource limit checkpoint validation examines enforcement across all resource types:\n\n1. **Memory Limit Enforcement**: Generate memory pressure beyond configured limits and verify that processes are terminated by the OOM killer when limits are exceeded while ensuring that memory usage remains within bounds.\n\n2. **CPU Limit Enforcement**: Generate CPU load and verify that CPU usage is throttled to the configured percentage while confirming that other system processes continue to receive appropriate CPU time.\n\n3. **Process Count Limit Enforcement**: Spawn processes beyond the configured PID limit and verify that fork operations fail appropriately while existing processes continue to function correctly.\n\n4. **I/O Bandwidth Limit Enforcement**: Generate intensive disk I/O and verify that throughput is limited to the configured rate while ensuring that I/O operations remain functional within the limits.\n\nThe cgroup verification protocol tests limit enforcement under controlled conditions:\n\n| Resource Type | Load Generation | Limit Verification | System Protection Check |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Memory | Allocate increasingly large buffers | Process killed at limit | Host memory usage stable |\n| CPU | Run CPU-intensive loops | Usage capped at percentage | Host CPU responsive |\n| Process Count | Spawn child processes rapidly | Fork fails at limit | Host process creation unaffected |\n| I/O Bandwidth | Heavy file read/write operations | Throughput limited to quota | Host I/O performance maintained |\n\n**Resource Limit Debugging Checklist**\n\nResource limit problems often involve cgroup configuration issues or incorrect limit calculations:\n\n⚠️ **Common Cgroup Issues**\n\n- **Controller Availability**: If resource limits are not enforced, verify that the required cgroup controllers are available and enabled in the kernel configuration.\n\n- **Cgroup Version Compatibility**: If cgroup operations fail, check whether the system uses cgroups v1 or v2 and ensure that the sandbox uses the appropriate interfaces.\n\n- **Permission Problems**: If cgroup directory creation fails, verify that the process has appropriate permissions to create and manage cgroup hierarchies.\n\n- **Limit Value Validation**: If resource limits behave unexpectedly, verify that limit values are within acceptable ranges and properly formatted for the cgroup interface.\n\n**Milestone 5: Capability Management Verification**\n\nThe capability management checkpoint validates that Linux capabilities are correctly dropped and that privilege restrictions are properly enforced while ensuring that necessary functionality remains available within the restricted environment.\n\nThe capability checkpoint testing protocol comprehensively validates privilege restrictions:\n\n1. **Capability Dropping Verification**: Confirm that specified capabilities are removed from all capability sets and that attempts to use dropped capabilities fail consistently with appropriate error codes.\n\n2. **Privilege Operation Blocking**: Test operations that require various capabilities and verify that dropped capabilities prevent unauthorized privileged operations while retained capabilities continue to function.\n\n3. **No New Privileges Enforcement**: Verify that the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag prevents privilege escalation through exec operations and that setuid binaries do not grant additional privileges.\n\n4. **User Transition Verification**: Confirm that user and group ID changes occur correctly and that the final privilege state matches the expected configuration for the sandbox environment.\n\nThe capability verification process validates privilege restrictions systematically:\n\n| Capability Test | Privilege Operation | Expected Result | Verification Method |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Dropped Capabilities | Attempt operations requiring dropped caps | Operation fails with EPERM | Test specific privileged syscalls |\n| Retained Capabilities | Use operations requiring retained caps | Operation succeeds normally | Verify necessary functions work |\n| No New Privileges | Execute setuid binaries | No privilege escalation | Check effective UID unchanged |\n| User Transition | Change to unprivileged user | User change successful, caps adjusted | Verify final UID/GID and capability state |\n\n**Capability Management Debugging Checklist**\n\nCapability management problems often involve the complex interactions between different capability sets and privilege transition operations:\n\n⚠️ **Common Capability Issues**\n\n- **Operation Ordering**: If capability dropping fails, verify that operations occur in the correct sequence: drop capabilities, set no-new-privs, then change user/group.\n\n- **Capability Dependencies**: If essential functions break after dropping capabilities, identify the minimum required capability set and ensure that necessary capabilities are retained.\n\n- **Ambient Capability Handling**: If child processes have unexpected privileges, check that ambient capabilities are properly managed and do not provide unintended privilege inheritance.\n\n- **Verification Method Accuracy**: If capability verification reports incorrect results, ensure that capability checking uses the appropriate interfaces and examines all relevant capability sets.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe testing strategy implementation requires a systematic approach that builds testing infrastructure alongside the sandbox components. The testing framework must be robust enough to handle the complex interactions between security layers while providing clear diagnostic information when tests fail.\n\n**Testing Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Testing Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Unit Test Framework | Basic C assert macros with test runner | Check framework with fixtures and mocking |\n| Process Management | fork() with waitpid() for child testing | Process sandbox library with cleanup tracking |\n| System Call Tracing | Manual strace analysis | Automated syscall capture and analysis |\n| Resource Monitoring | /proc filesystem parsing | Cgroup statistics API with automated collection |\n| Security Validation | Manual exploit attempts | Automated penetration testing framework |\n\n**Recommended Testing File Structure**\n\nThe testing infrastructure should be organized to support both component-level testing and integration scenarios:\n\n```\nprocess-sandbox/\n  tests/\n    unit/\n      test_namespaces.c         ← Namespace isolation unit tests\n      test_filesystem.c         ← Filesystem isolation unit tests  \n      test_seccomp.c           ← Seccomp filter unit tests\n      test_cgroups.c           ← Cgroup resource limit unit tests\n      test_capabilities.c       ← Capability management unit tests\n    integration/\n      test_workloads.c         ← Realistic program testing\n      test_security.c          ← Security validation tests\n      test_performance.c       ← Performance impact assessment\n    common/\n      test_framework.c         ← Shared testing utilities\n      test_helpers.c           ← Common test helper functions\n    workloads/\n      cpu_bomb.c               ← CPU exhaustion test program\n      memory_bomb.c            ← Memory exhaustion test program\n      fork_bomb.c              ← Process spawning test program\n      escape_attempt.c         ← Container escape test program\n  scripts/\n    run_tests.sh              ← Test execution orchestration\n    analyze_results.sh        ← Test result analysis\n```\n\n**Testing Infrastructure Starter Code**\n\nThe testing framework requires infrastructure for managing child processes, monitoring resource usage, and validating security properties.

correctly:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Milestone checkpoint validation script\n\n# Milestone 1: Namespace Isolation Checkpoint\nvalidate_milestone_1() {\n    echo \"=== Milestone 1: Namespace Isolation Verification ===\"\n    \n    # Test PID namespace isolation\n    sudo ./test_sandbox --test=pid_namespace_isolation\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"✓ PID namespace isolation working\"\n    else\n        echo \"✗ PID namespace isolation failed\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    \n    # Test mount namespace isolation\n    sudo ./test_sandbox --test=mount_namespace_isolation\n    if [ $? -eq

   sudo ./test_sandbox --test=network_namespace_isolation\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"✓ Network namespace isolation working\"\n    else\n        echo \"✗ Network namespace isolation

fi\n    \n    echo \"Milestone 3 checkpoint: PASSED\"\n    return 0\n}\n```\n\n**Security Validation Test Framework**\n\nThe security validation framework provides systematic testing of attack scenarios:\n\n```c\n// Security validation test implementation\ntypedef struct {\n    char attack_name[64];\n    int (*attack_func)(void);\n    int expected_failure;  // 1 if attack should fail, 0 if should succeed\n} security_test_t;\n\n// Test container escape attempts\nint test_container_escape() {\n    // TODO 1: Attempt /proc traversal to access host filesystem\n    // TODO 2: Try mount manipulation to escape namespace\n    // TODO 3: Attempt symlink traversal to host directories\n    // TODO 4: Test bind mount exploitation techniques\n    // TODO 5: Verify all escape attempts fail with appropriate errors\n    // Return 0 if all attacks blocked, -1 if any succeed\n}\n\n// Test privilege escalation attempts\nint test_privilege_escalation() {\n    // TODO 1: Attempt to use dropped capabilities\n    // TODO 2: Try setuid program exploitation\n    // TODO 3: Test capability inheritance bypass\n    // TODO 4: Attempt ambient capability manipulation\n    // TODO 5: Verify all escalation attempts fail\n    // Return 0 if all attacks blocked, -1 if any succeed\n}\n\n// Test resource exhaustion attacks\nint test_resource_exhaustion() {\n    // TODO 1: Generate memory bomb to test OOM killer\n    // TODO 2: Create CPU bomb to test throttling\n    // TODO 3: Launch fork bomb to test PID limits  \n    // TODO 4: Generate I/O bomb to test bandwidth limits\n    // TODO 5: Verify host system remains stable and responsive\n    // Return 0 if all attacks contained, -1 if host affected\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive testing strategy ensures that each security component works correctly in isolation and that the complete system provides robust defense against sophisticated attacks while maintaining usability for legitimate workloads.\n\n\n## Debugging Guide\n\n> **Milestone(s):** This section applies to all milestones (1-5), providing systematic debugging approaches for namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and capability management\n\nBuilding a process sandbox requires orchestrating multiple complex Linux security mechanisms, each with their own failure modes and debugging challenges. The **Mental Model: The Crime Scene Investigation** - think of debugging a sandbox failure like being a detective at a crime scene. You need to systematically examine all the evidence (logs, process state, system calls, resource usage) to reconstruct what happened and identify the root cause. Just as a detective follows clues from the scene backwards to understand the sequence of events, sandbox debugging requires tracing symptoms back through the layers of security mechanisms to find where the failure originated.\n\nThe debugging process becomes particularly challenging because sandbox failures often manifest as cryptic symptoms far removed from their root causes. A process that fails to start might be blocked by seccomp, missing library dependencies, insufficient capabilities, or resource limits. A process that starts but behaves incorrectly might be operating with an incomplete filesystem view, blocked system calls, or unexpected namespace isolation. The key to effective debugging is understanding how these security layers interact and developing systematic approaches to isolate which layer is causing the problem.\n\n### Symptom-Based Diagnosis\n\nEffective sandbox debugging starts with systematic symptom analysis. Each type of failure produces characteristic symptoms that point toward specific security layers or configuration issues. Understanding these patterns allows developers to quickly narrow down the root cause rather than randomly checking all possible failure points.\n\nThe following diagnostic matrix maps common symptoms to their most likely root causes, organized by the security layer most commonly responsible:\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Primary Layer | Secondary Causes |\n|---------|------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Process fails to start with \"No such file or directory\" | Missing executable or libraries in sandbox filesystem | Filesystem Isolation | Mount namespace not properly initialized, chroot incomplete |\n| Process starts but immediately exits with status 127 | Dynamic linker cannot find shared libraries | Filesystem Isolation | Incorrect library paths, missing ld.so cache |\n| Process killed with SIGSYS signal | Blocked system call by seccomp filter | System Call Filtering | Missing syscall in whitelist, architecture mismatch |\n| Process hangs during startup | Blocked system call without error return | System Call Filtering | Filter returns ERRNO instead of allowing required syscall |\n| Process fails with \"Permission denied\" on file access | Insufficient capabilities for operation | Capability Management | Missing CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE or other required capability |\n| Process cannot bind to network port | Network namespace isolation or capability restriction | Namespace Isolation | Missing CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE or isolated network namespace |\n| Process killed by OOM killer | Memory limit exceeded | Resource Limits | Cgroup memory limit too low, memory leak in sandboxed code |\n| Process throttled or slow performance | CPU or I/O limits reached | Resource Limits | Cgroup CPU quota exhausted, I/O bandwidth throttling active |\n| Cannot create child processes | Process limit exceeded | Resource Limits | Cgroup PID limit reached, fork bomb protection triggered |\n| Process sees wrong PID or hostname | Namespace isolation incomplete | Namespace Isolation | PID or UTS namespace not created properly |\n| Mount operations fail | Missing mount capabilities or wrong namespace | Namespace Isolation | CAP_SYS_ADMIN dropped, mount namespace not isolated |\n| Device access fails | Missing device nodes or permissions | Filesystem Isolation | /dev not populated, device files missing or wrong permissions |\n\n**Process Startup Failures** represent the most common category of sandbox problems. These typically manifest as immediate process termination with cryptic error codes. The key diagnostic approach involves systematically checking each prerequisite:\n\n1. **Executable existence**: Verify the target program exists at the expected path within the sandbox filesystem\n2. **Library dependencies**: Use `ldd` on the host to identify required shared libraries, then verify each exists in the sandbox\n3. **Dynamic linker configuration**: Ensure `/etc/ld.so.conf` or `/etc/ld.so.cache` provides correct library search paths\n4. **File permissions**: Check that executable has proper permissions and all parent directories are accessible\n\n**System Call Blocking** symptoms require careful analysis of which operations are failing. The most reliable diagnostic approach uses `strace` to capture the exact system call that triggers the seccomp violation:\n\n```\nProcess killed by SIGSYS at system call: openat()\nArguments: AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/passwd\", O_RDONLY\n```\n\nThis information immediately identifies whether the problem is a missing syscall in the whitelist (openat not allowed) or argument-level filtering (specific file path blocked).\n\n**Resource Exhaustion** symptoms often appear as performance degradation before triggering hard limits. The diagnostic approach involves monitoring resource usage patterns:\n\n- Memory exhaustion: Process RSS grows until hitting cgroup limit, then OOM killer activates\n- CPU throttling: Process experiences intermittent delays as CPU quota is exhausted and restored\n- I/O throttling: File operations become progressively slower as bandwidth limit is reached\n- Process limits: Fork or clone operations fail with EAGAIN when PID limit is exceeded\n\n**Namespace Isolation Issues** typically manifest as processes seeing unexpected system state. The key diagnostic technique involves comparing the process's view of system resources with the expected isolated view:\n\n- PID namespace: Check if process sees itself as PID 1 and only sees processes in its namespace\n- Mount namespace: Verify filesystem layout matches expected sandbox structure\n- Network namespace: Confirm network interfaces, routing tables, and port bindings are isolated\n- UTS namespace: Check hostname and domain name are isolated from host system\n\n> The critical debugging insight is that symptoms often appear in one security layer but originate in another. A \"permission denied\" error might seem like a capability problem but actually result from seccomp blocking the underlying system call before capability checks occur.\n\n### Debugging Tools and Techniques\n\nEffective sandbox debugging requires a comprehensive toolkit of Linux debugging utilities, each specialized for examining different aspects of process isolation and security enforcement. The key principle is using the right tool for each security layer rather than relying on generic debugging approaches.\n\n**Namespace Inspection Tools** provide visibility into the isolated views that sandboxed processes experience. These tools are essential for verifying that namespace isolation is working correctly:\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Usage Pattern | Key Information |\n|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `lsns` | List all namespaces on system | `lsns -p <pid>` | Shows which namespaces process belongs to |\n| `nsenter` | Enter existing namespace | `nsenter -t <pid> -p -m /bin/bash` | Execute commands in process's namespace view |\n| `unshare` | Create new namespaces | `unshare -p -m -n /bin/bash` | Test namespace creation independently |\n| `ip netns` | Network namespace management | `ip netns exec <name> ip addr` | Inspect network configuration in namespace |\n| `/proc/<pid>/ns/` | Namespace file descriptors | `ls -la /proc/<pid>/ns/` | Compare namespace IDs between processes |\n\nThe most powerful namespace debugging technique involves using `nsenter` to \"step inside\" the sandboxed process's view of the system. This allows direct inspection of what the process actually sees:\n\n```bash\n# Enter all namespaces of sandboxed process\nnsenter -t $SANDBOX_PID -p -m -n -u /bin/bash\n\n# Now running inside sandbox's view - check what's visible\nps aux          # Should only see processes in PID namespace\nmount           # Should see sandbox filesystem layout  \nip addr         # Should see isolated network interfaces\nhostname        # Should see sandbox hostname\n```\n\n**Filesystem Debugging Tools** help identify problems with chroot, mount configuration, and file access permissions within the isolated filesystem:\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Usage Pattern | Key Information |\n|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `findmnt` | Display filesystem tree | `findmnt -D` | Shows all mount points with propagation |\n| `lsof` | List open files | `lsof -p <pid>` | Shows what files process actually has open |\n| `strace` | Trace file operations | `strace -e trace=file <command>` | Shows file access attempts and results |\n| `ls -la /proc/<pid>/fd/` | Open file descriptors | Direct inspection | Shows numbered file descriptors |\n| `/proc/<pid>/mountinfo` | Process mount view | `cat /proc/<pid>/mountinfo` | Shows mounts visible to specific process |\n\nA systematic approach to filesystem debugging involves comparing the sandbox's filesystem view with expectations:\n\n1. **Mount verification**: Use `findmnt` to confirm all required filesystems are mounted at correct locations\n2. **Path resolution**: Trace file access attempts to see where path lookups fail\n3. **Permission analysis**: Check that file permissions, ownership, and capabilities are correct\n4. **Library dependency tracking**: Verify all shared libraries are accessible and properly linked\n\n**System Call Tracing** provides the most detailed view of how processes interact with the kernel, making it indispensable for debugging seccomp issues:\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Usage Pattern | Key Information |\n|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `strace` | System call tracer | `strace -f -o trace.log <command>` | Complete syscall log with arguments |\n| `perf trace` | Performance-oriented tracing | `perf trace -p <pid>` | Lower overhead syscall monitoring |\n| `seccomp_tools` | Seccomp filter analysis | `seccomp-tools dump <pid>` | Shows active seccomp filters |\n| `bpftool` | BPF program inspection | `bpftool prog show` | Lists loaded BPF programs |\n| `/proc/<pid>/seccomp_filter` | Seccomp status | `cat /proc/<pid>/seccomp_filter` | Shows seccomp mode and filter count |\n\nThe key to effective system call debugging is using filtered tracing to focus on relevant operations rather than being overwhelmed by every syscall:\n\n```bash\n# Trace only file operations\nstrace -e trace=file,desc -f -o file_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n\n# Trace only network operations  \nstrace -e trace=network -f -o network_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n\n# Trace specific problematic syscalls\nstrace -e trace=openat,read,write,mmap -f -o specific_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n```\n\n**Resource Monitoring Tools** help diagnose cgroup-related issues by showing actual resource consumption versus configured limits:\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Usage Pattern | Key Information |\n|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `systemd-cgtop` | Live cgroup resource view | `systemd-cgtop` | Shows CPU, memory, I/O usage by cgroup |\n| `cgget` | Read cgroup parameters | `cgget -g memory:/sandbox/<id>` | Shows current cgroup configuration |\n| `cgexec` | Execute in cgroup | `cgexec -g memory:/test <command>` | Test resource limits independently |\n| `/sys/fs/cgroup/` | Direct cgroup inspection | `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/sandbox/memory.usage_in_bytes` | Raw cgroup statistics |\n| `dmesg` | Kernel log messages | `dmesg -T \\| grep -i \"killed process\"` | Shows OOM killer activity |\n\n**Capability Analysis Tools** help identify privilege-related failures by showing exactly which capabilities a process has and needs:\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Usage Pattern | Key Information |\n|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| `capsh` | Capability shell | `capsh --print` | Shows current process capabilities |\n| `getpcaps` | Get process capabilities | `getpcaps <pid>` | Shows capabilities of specific process |\n| `pscap` | Process capability scan | `pscap -a` | Lists capabilities of all processes |\n| `filecap` | File capability scan | `filecap /usr/bin/` | Shows file-based capabilities |\n| `/proc/<pid>/status` | Process status | `grep Cap /proc/<pid>/status` | Shows capability bitmasks |\n\n> The debugging strategy should always start with the most specific tools for the suspected problem area, then expand to broader system-level analysis if the specific tools don't reveal the issue.\n\n### System Call Tracing\n\nSystem call tracing represents the most powerful debugging technique for sandbox issues because it provides complete visibility into how processes interact with the kernel. Every security mechanism ultimately affects system call behavior, making syscall tracing the common diagnostic pathway for all sandbox problems.\n\n**Comprehensive Tracing Strategy** involves using `strace` with systematic filtering and analysis approaches. The key principle is starting broad to identify the problem area, then narrowing focus to specific system calls or failure patterns:\n\n```bash\n# Phase 1: Broad tracing to identify problem category\nstrace -f -o full_trace.log -T -tt -v ./sandbox_program\n\n# Phase 2: Filter to specific syscall categories\nstrace -e trace=process -f -o process_trace.log ./sandbox_program    # Process creation\nstrace -e trace=file -f -o file_trace.log ./sandbox_program          # File operations  \nstrace -e trace=network -f -o network_trace.log ./sandbox_program    # Network operations\nstrace -e trace=ipc -f -o ipc_trace.log ./sandbox_program            # IPC operations\n\n# Phase 3: Focus on specific failing syscalls\nstrace -e trace=openat,read,write -f -o specific_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n```\n\nThe `-f` flag is crucial for sandbox tracing because it follows child processes created by fork or clone. Many sandbox issues occur in child processes, so missing this flag can hide the actual problem. The `-T` flag shows time spent in each syscall, helping identify performance issues caused by resource throttling.\n\n**Seccomp Filter Analysis** through system call tracing requires understanding how seccomp violations appear in trace output. When seccomp blocks a system call, it can either return an error code or kill the process, depending on the filter configuration:\n\n```\n# Seccomp returning EPERM (error code)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/passwd\", O_RDONLY) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)\n\n# Seccomp killing process (appears as signal)\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/passwd\", O_RDONLY) = ?\n+++ killed by SIGSYS +++\n```\n\nThe key diagnostic technique involves comparing syscall traces between successful execution outside the sandbox versus failed execution inside the sandbox. Differences in syscall success/failure patterns immediately identify which operations are being blocked.\n\n**Advanced Tracing Techniques** help diagnose complex interaction issues between multiple security layers:\n\n| Technique | Command | Purpose | Analysis Focus |\n|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| Multi-process tracing | `strace -f -ff -o trace` | Separate log per process | Child process failures |\n| Time-based analysis | `strace -T -tt` | Timestamp each syscall | Performance bottlenecks |\n| Signal tracing | `strace -e signal=all` | Show signal delivery | Seccomp kills, resource limits |\n| Memory mapping | `strace -e trace=mmap,munmap,mprotect` | Memory operations | Library loading issues |\n| Capability tracing | `strace -e trace=capget,capset` | Privilege changes | Capability dropping problems |\n\n**Filter Development and Testing** uses system call tracing to iteratively develop seccomp filters. The process involves:\n\n1. **Baseline tracing**: Run the target program outside sandbox to capture complete syscall profile\n2. **Syscall cataloging**: Extract unique syscall names and analyze their necessity\n3. **Iterative filtering**: Start with minimal whitelist, add syscalls as failures occur\n4. **Argument analysis**: Use detailed traces to develop argument-level filtering rules\n\n```bash\n# Extract unique syscalls from trace\ngrep -o '^[a-z_]*(' trace.log | sort | uniq > required_syscalls.txt\n\n# Count syscall frequency to prioritize\ngrep -o '^[a-z_]*(' trace.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > syscall_frequency.txt\n\n# Analyze specific syscall arguments\ngrep 'openat(' trace.log | grep -v ENOENT | head -20\n```\n\n**Performance Impact Analysis** uses tracing to identify resource bottlenecks caused by cgroup limits. CPU throttling appears as increased time spent in syscalls, memory pressure shows up as frequent memory management operations, and I/O throttling causes delays in read/write operations:\n\n```bash\n# Identify slow syscalls (potential throttling)\nstrace -T -f -o timing_trace.log ./sandbox_program\ngrep -E ' <[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{3}[0-9]+>' timing_trace.log | sort -k2 -nr\n\n# Monitor memory pressure\nstrace -e trace=mmap,munmap,brk,madvise -T -f -o memory_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n\n# Track I/O patterns\nstrace -e trace=read,write,readv,writev -T -f -o io_trace.log ./sandbox_program\n```\n\n**Common System Call Patterns** that indicate specific problems:\n\n| Pattern | Syscalls Involved | Indicates | Solution |\n|---------|------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Repeated `openat(\"/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\")` failures | openat, access, stat | Dynamic linker problems | Fix library paths, populate /lib64 |\n| `clone()` followed by immediate `exit()` | clone, exit | Child process startup failure | Check child process requirements |\n| Frequent `futex()` calls with timeouts | futex | Lock contention or deadlock | Analyze threading issues |\n| `mmap()` failures with ENOMEM | mmap, brk | Memory limit reached | Increase memory limit or optimize usage |\n| `socket()` returning EACCES | socket, bind | Network namespace or capability issue | Check network isolation, CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE |\n\n> The most effective system call debugging approach combines automated analysis (extracting patterns from large trace files) with manual inspection of specific failure points. Start with automated tools to identify the problem area, then manually analyze the specific syscalls that are failing.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| System Call Tracing | strace with shell scripts | Custom ptrace-based tracer |\n| Log Analysis | grep/awk/sed | Python with syscall parsing library |\n| Namespace Inspection | Manual nsenter commands | Automated namespace comparison tool |\n| Resource Monitoring | Manual cgroup file reading | Real-time monitoring with eBPF |\n| Error Reporting | Simple logging to stderr | Structured logging with correlation IDs |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n\n```\nproject-root/\n  debug/\n    debug_utils.h           ← debugging utility functions\n    debug_utils.c           ← implementation\n    trace_analyzer.c        ← system call trace analysis\n    namespace_inspector.c   ← namespace state inspection\n    resource_monitor.c      ← cgroup resource monitoring\n  tools/\n    sandbox_debug.c         ← main debugging tool\n    trace_filter.sh         ← strace filtering scripts\n    namespace_diff.py       ← namespace comparison utility\n  tests/\n    debug_test.c           ← debugging functionality tests\n```\n\n**Debugging Infrastructure Code:**\n\n```c\n// debug_utils.h -

These future extensions fall into three primary categories: advanced security features that leverage cutting-edge kernel capabilities, performance optimizations that improve sandbox efficiency and scalability, and management tooling that enables production deployment at scale.\n\nUnderstanding these potential extensions serves multiple purposes for learners. First, it demonstrates that security is never a completed project—new threats emerge, new kernel features become available, and operational requirements evolve. Second, it provides a roadmap for continued learning and skill development in systems security. Third, it illustrates how foundational knowledge of namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities serves as a springboard for understanding more sophisticated security mechanisms.\n\nThe extensions presented here range from relatively straightforward enhancements that could be implemented immediately after completing the core milestones, to research-grade features that represent the cutting edge of container security. Each category addresses different aspects of the classic trade-off between security, performance, and usability that defines all practical security systems.\n\n### Advanced Security Features\n\n#### Mental Model: The Evolving Security Arsenal\n\nThink of advanced security features as upgrading from a basic home security system to a state-of-the-art facility protection network. Your current sandbox is like having locks, an alarm system, and security cameras—effective and proven. Advanced features are like adding biometric access controls, AI-powered threat detection, motion sensors that can distinguish between authorized personnel and intruders, and automated response systems that can isolate threats before they spread. Each new capability adds another layer of sophisticated protection, but also introduces complexity in configuration, integration, and troubleshooting.\n\nThe landscape of Linux security features has expanded dramatically in recent years, driven by the growing adoption of containers and the increasing sophistication of attack vectors. While the foundational mechanisms of namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities remain essential, newer kernel features provide more granular control, better performance, and protection against attack classes that weren't well-understood when the original mechanisms were designed.\n\n#### Linux Security Modules (LSM) Integration\n\nLinux Security Modules represent a fundamental shift from discretionary access control to mandatory access control policies that can enforce security decisions regardless of process ownership or traditional Unix permissions. The most relevant LSMs for sandbox enhancement are SELinux, AppArmor, and the newer Landlock framework.\n\n**SELinux Integration** provides label-based security that can enforce policies based on security contexts rather than user identity. In a sandbox context, SELinux can prevent sandboxed processes from accessing resources even if filesystem permissions would normally allow access. This creates an additional security layer that operates independently of namespace isolation and capability restrictions.\n\n| SELinux Feature | Security Benefit | Implementation Complexity | Performance Impact |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|\n| Type Enforcement | Process-resource access control | High - requires policy development | Medium - kernel policy evaluation |\n| Multi-Level Security | Information flow control | Very High - complex classification | Low - cached policy decisions |\n| Role-Based Access | Administrative separation | Medium - role definition required | Low - minimal runtime overhead |\n| Confined Domains | Process behavior restriction | High - domain transition rules | Medium - policy lookup overhead |\n\n> **Decision: Landlock for Filesystem Access Control**\n> - **Context**: Need finer-grained filesystem access control than mount namespaces alone provide, without the complexity of full SELinux policy development\n> - **Options Considered**: SELinux type enforcement, AppArmor path-based restrictions, Landlock filesystem sandboxing\n> - **Decision**: Implement Landlock integration for filesystem access control\n> - **Rationale**: Landlock provides programmatic access control without requiring system-wide policy configuration, offers better granularity than mount namespaces, and has lower complexity than SELinux\n> - **Consequences**: Enables per-file access control within sandbox, requires kernel 5.13+, adds another security layer to coordinate with existing mechanisms\n\n**Landlock Integration** represents the most promising LSM enhancement for process sandboxes because it was specifically designed for application-level sandboxing. Unlike SELinux or AppArmor, which require system-wide policy configuration, Landlock allows individual applications to impose additional restrictions on themselves and their children.\n\nLandlock filesystem rules can restrict access to specific files or directories regardless of namespace configuration. This enables scenarios like allowing a sandboxed process to access `/etc/passwd` for user lookup while preventing access to `/etc/shadow`, even if both files are visible in the mount namespace. The programmatic nature of Landlock policies means they can be generated dynamically based on sandbox configuration rather than requiring pre-written policy files.\n\nThe integration approach involves creating Landlock rulesets during sandbox initialization, after namespace creation but before dropping capabilities. This ensures the sandbox orchestrator retains the ability to call the Landlock system calls, but the sandboxed process inherits the restrictions without the ability to modify them.\n\n#### Seccomp Notify and User Mode Helper\n\nTraditional seccomp filtering operates as a binary allow-or-deny decision made entirely in kernel space. The seccomp notify mechanism, introduced in Linux 5.0, enables a more sophisticated approach where filtered system calls can be intercepted and handled by a user space supervisor process.\n\n**Seccomp Notify Architecture** creates a communication channel between the kernel's seccomp filter and a supervisor process. When a sandboxed process attempts a system call that matches a notify filter rule, the kernel suspends the sandboxed process and sends details about the system call to the supervisor through a file descriptor. The supervisor can then examine the system call arguments, potentially perform the operation on behalf of the sandboxed process with additional validation, and return either the successful result or an error code.\n\n| Notify Use Case | Security Advantage | Implementation Challenge | Performance Consideration |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| File Access Mediation | Path-based access control | Complex path canonicalization | Context switching overhead |\n| Network Request Filtering | Protocol-aware filtering | Network protocol parsing | Socket state management |\n| IPC Auditing | Comprehensive communication logging | Message format interpretation | Audit data volume |\n| Resource Quota Enforcement | Dynamic limit adjustment | Cross-process state tracking | Lock contention management |\n\nThis mechanism enables sophisticated policies like allowing `openat()` system calls only for files that match specific patterns, or permitting network connections only to pre-approved destinations. The supervisor can implement complex logic that would be impossible to express in a static BPF program, such as rate limiting, quota management, or integration with external policy engines.\n\n**Implementation Strategy** involves modifying the BPF filter generation to include `SECCOMP_RET_USER_NOTIF` return values for system calls that require mediation, creating a supervisor thread or process that handles the notification file descriptor, and implementing a policy engine that can make access control decisions based on system call arguments and current sandbox state.\n\nThe supervisor process design presents interesting architectural choices. A threaded approach keeps the supervisor within the same process as the sandbox orchestrator, simplifying state sharing but creating potential attack surface if the supervisor is compromised. A separate process approach provides better isolation but requires more complex inter-process communication and state management.\n\n#### eBPF and Advanced Monitoring\n\nExtended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) represents a significant evolution beyond traditional seccomp BPF, enabling sophisticated monitoring and enforcement capabilities throughout the kernel. While seccomp BPF is limited to system call filtering, eBPF programs can be attached to numerous kernel events including network packet processing, filesystem operations, process scheduling, and memory management.\n\n**eBPF Integration Opportunities** for sandbox enhancement include runtime security monitoring that tracks sandbox behavior patterns and detects anomalous activity, performance profiling that identifies resource usage patterns and optimization opportunities, and dynamic policy enforcement that can adapt security policies based on observed behavior.\n\nLSM hooks provide attachment points where eBPF programs can intercept and potentially modify security decisions made by the kernel. An eBPF program attached to the `security_file_permission` hook can implement custom file access policies, while programs attached to `security_task_create` can monitor process creation and enforce additional restrictions on child processes.\n\n| eBPF Program Type | Monitoring Capability | Security Enhancement | Resource Overhead |\n|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| LSM Hook Programs | Security decision interception | Dynamic policy enforcement | Low - efficient JIT compilation |\n| Tracepoint Programs | System event monitoring | Anomaly detection | Medium - event processing overhead |\n| Kprobe Programs | Function call tracing | Detailed behavior analysis | High - frequent execution |\n| Socket Filter Programs | Network traffic analysis | Protocol-specific filtering | Medium - packet processing |\n\nThe observability benefits of eBPF extend beyond security to performance optimization and debugging. eBPF programs can collect detailed metrics about system call latency, memory allocation patterns, and I/O behavior within the sandbox. This data enables identification of performance bottlenecks and validation that security restrictions are not causing unexpected performance degradation.\n\n**Implementation Considerations** include the requirement for specific kernel versions and configuration options, the complexity of eBPF program development and verification, and the need for careful resource management to prevent eBPF programs from impacting system performance. The eBPF verifier ensures program safety but requires understanding of eBPF programming constraints and kernel internals.\n\n#### Hardware Security Features\n\nModern processors provide hardware-assisted security features that can enhance process isolation beyond what software mechanisms alone can achieve. Intel's Memory Protection Extensions (MPX), Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET), and Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK) offer hardware-level enforcement of memory safety and control flow integrity.\n\n**Intel MPK Integration** enables fine-grained memory protection by associating memory regions with protection keys and allowing rapid switching of access permissions for those keys. In a sandbox context, MPK can provide an additional layer of memory isolation that operates independently of virtual memory protections and can be toggled with minimal overhead.\n\nThe integration approach involves allocating separate protection keys for sandbox memory regions during process initialization, configuring initial access permissions that allow supervisor access but restrict sandboxed code, and potentially implementing dynamic permission switching based on execution context. This requires careful coordination with memory management and process lifecycle management to ensure keys are properly allocated and cleaned up.\n\n**ARM Pointer Authentication and Memory Tagging** provide similar hardware-assisted security features on ARM platforms. Pointer authentication can detect return-oriented programming (ROP) and jump-oriented programming (JOP) attacks by cryptographically signing return addresses and function pointers. Memory tagging associates tags with memory allocations and pointers, enabling detection of use-after-free and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nThe heterogeneous nature of hardware security features across processor architectures requires careful abstraction layer design that can leverage available features without creating hard dependencies on specific hardware capabilities. The implementation should gracefully degrade when hardware features are not available while taking advantage of them when present.\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n\n#### Mental Model: The Assembly Line Optimization\n\nThink of performance optimizations as transforming a custom craft workshop into an efficient assembly line. Your current sandbox is like a skilled craftsperson who can create a custom security environment for each request, carefully measuring, cutting, and assembling each component. Performance optimizations are like introducing pre-cut materials, standardized templates, assembly jigs, and parallel workstations. The end result is the same high-quality product, but produced with dramatically higher throughput and lower resource consumption per unit.\n\nPerformance optimization in security systems presents unique challenges because optimizations cannot compromise security properties. Every performance enhancement must be carefully analyzed to ensure it doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities or weaken the existing security model. This creates a constraint that doesn't exist in many other performance optimization contexts.\n\n#### Template-Based Sandbox Creation\n\nThe sandbox creation process involves numerous expensive operations: namespace creation, filesystem setup, cgroup configuration, and seccomp filter compilation. These operations are largely independent of the specific program being sandboxed, suggesting opportunities for template-based optimization.\n\n**Sandbox Templates** involve pre-creating sandbox environments with common configurations and reusing them for multiple sandboxed processes. This approach amortizes the expensive setup operations across multiple sandbox instances and reduces the latency between sandbox request and program execution.\n\nThe template approach requires careful design to maintain security isolation. Templates cannot share writable resources between instances, and each template instantiation must receive its own isolated namespace and filesystem view. The implementation strategy involves creating \"golden\" sandbox environments with read-only base configurations and using copy-on-write mechanisms to provide per-instance writable areas.\n\n| Template Component | Reuse Strategy | Isolation Mechanism | Performance Benefit |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Base Filesystem | Read-only mount with overlay | Overlay filesystem per instance | Eliminates filesystem construction |\n| Namespace Configuration | Clone from template namespace | Namespace creation with CLONE_NEW* flags | Reduces namespace setup time |\n| Seccomp Filter | Compiled BPF program reuse | Per-process filter installation | Eliminates BPF compilation |\n| Cgroup Structure | Shared cgroup hierarchy | Per-instance cgroup directories | Reduces cgroup creation overhead |\n\n**Container Image Integration** extends the template concept by leveraging existing container image formats and tooling. Container images provide standardized mechanisms for packaging filesystem contents and metadata, enabling integration with existing container ecosystems while maintaining the enhanced security properties of the custom sandbox implementation.\n\nThe integration approach involves implementing container image unpacking and mounting within the sandbox filesystem isolation component, adapting container image metadata to sandbox configuration parameters, and potentially supporting container registry integration for dynamic image retrieval.\n\nThis integration enables use cases like sandboxing language-specific runtime environments (Node.js, Python, JVM) that are distributed as container images, while applying more restrictive security policies than typical container runtimes provide.\n\n#### Process Pool Management\n\nCreating new processes and configuring security restrictions involves significant overhead, particularly when sandboxes are used for short-lived tasks. Process pool management addresses this by maintaining a pool of pre-configured sandbox processes that can be rapidly assigned to new tasks.\n\n**Pool Architecture** involves creating a master pool manager that maintains multiple pre-initialized sandbox processes in a ready state, a task dispatcher that assigns incoming work to available processes from the pool, and a lifecycle manager that handles process recycling and replacement.\n\nThe security implications require careful consideration. Pool processes must be reset to a clean state between tasks to prevent information leakage, and the pool manager must ensure that process failures don't compromise other pool members. The implementation strategy involves designing a task execution protocol that provides clean isolation between tasks and implementing process health monitoring to detect and replace unhealthy pool members.\n\n| Pool Management Aspect | Design Challenge | Security Consideration | Performance Impact |\n|------------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Process Initialization | Balancing pool size with resource usage | Limiting pool process capabilities | Startup time amortization |\n| Task Isolation | Ensuring clean state between tasks | Preventing information leakage | Context switching overhead |\n| Failure Recovery | Detecting and replacing failed processes | Maintaining pool security properties | Recovery time impact |\n| Resource Management | Controlling total resource consumption | Enforcing per-task and pool-wide limits | Memory and CPU efficiency |\n\n**Task Execution Protocol** design involves creating a communication mechanism between the pool manager and pool processes that can safely transmit task specifications and results. The protocol must prevent task data from being accessible to subsequent tasks and ensure that task failures don't compromise the pool process.\n\nThe protocol implementation options include Unix domain sockets for high-performance local communication, shared memory with careful synchronization for bulk data transfer, and file descriptor passing for providing task-specific resource access. Each approach has different performance characteristics and security implications.\n\n#### Resource Sharing and Deduplication\n\nMultiple sandbox instances often require similar resources, particularly when executing related tasks or using common runtime environments. Resource sharing and deduplication can significantly reduce memory usage and improve cache efficiency while maintaining security isolation.\n\n**Memory Deduplication** using kernel same-page merging (KSM) can identify identical memory pages across different sandbox processes and merge them into shared read-only pages. This is particularly effective for shared libraries, runtime environments, and static data that is identical across multiple sandbox instances.\n\nThe security analysis requires ensuring that memory deduplication doesn't create information leakage channels. The KSM implementation provides copy-on-write semantics that prevent one process from observing modifications made by another process, but timing-based attacks might potentially infer information about shared memory usage patterns.\n\n**Filesystem Layer Sharing** extends the overlay filesystem approach to share common layers across multiple sandbox instances. When multiple sandboxes use similar base environments, the common portions can be shared while providing per-instance writable layers for modifications.\n\n| Sharing Mechanism | Resource Savings | Security Risk | Implementation Complexity |\n|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| Shared Library Memory | High - common across all processes | Low - read-only sharing | Low - kernel KSM support |\n| Filesystem Layer Sharing | Medium - depends on commonality | Medium - layer isolation required | Medium - overlay management |\n| Seccomp Filter Sharing | Low - filters are small | Low - per-process installation | Low - compiled program reuse |\n| Network Namespace Sharing | High - for network-isolated workloads | High - requires network isolation | High - complex namespace management |\n\nThe implementation strategy involves identifying sharing opportunities during sandbox configuration, implementing reference counting and lifecycle management for shared resources, and providing monitoring and debugging capabilities to understand sharing effectiveness and detect sharing-related issues.\n\n#### Asynchronous Operations and Batching\n\nMany sandbox management operations can be performed asynchronously without impacting security properties. Asynchronous operation design can improve responsiveness and enable batching optimizations that reduce per-operation overhead.\n\n**Asynchronous Cleanup** involves deferring resource cleanup operations that don't have immediate security implications to background tasks. Cgroup removal, filesystem unmounting, and namespace cleanup can often be performed after the sandboxed process has terminated without creating security risks.\n\nThe design involves implementing a cleanup queue with background worker threads, prioritizing cleanup operations based on resource pressure and security sensitivity, and providing monitoring capabilities to ensure cleanup operations don't accumulate indefinitely.\n\n**Batched Configuration Updates** can optimize scenarios where multiple sandbox instances require similar configuration changes. Cgroup limit updates, seccomp filter installations, and namespace configuration changes can potentially be batched to reduce system call overhead.\n\nThe batching strategy requires careful analysis to ensure that batching doesn't delay critical security updates or create windows where security policies are inconsistently applied across related sandbox instances.\n\n### Management and Monitoring\n\n#### Mental Model: The Mission Control Center\n\nThink of management and monitoring as building a mission control center for your sandbox fleet. Your current implementation is like a skilled pilot flying a single aircraft—effective for the immediate task but limited in scope. Management and monitoring systems are like air traffic control, flight tracking systems, communication networks, and automated response protocols that enable coordination of hundreds of aircraft simultaneously. They provide visibility into the entire operation, early warning of problems, and coordinated response capabilities that no single operator could manage manually.\n\nProduction deployment of process sandboxes requires sophisticated management and monitoring capabilities that extend far beyond the core isolation mechanisms. These systems must provide operational visibility, automated response to failures, resource planning data, and security monitoring that can detect sophisticated attacks or policy violations.\n\n#### Comprehensive Metrics Collection\n\nEffective sandbox management requires detailed metrics covering security events, performance characteristics, resource utilization, and operational health. The metrics collection system must balance comprehensive coverage with minimal performance impact on sandbox operations.\n\n**Security Metrics** include tracking seccomp filter violations with detailed context about blocked system calls and their arguments, monitoring capability usage patterns to detect privilege escalation attempts, and recording namespace escape attempts or other container breakout behaviors.\n\nThe metrics collection architecture involves implementing lightweight instrumentation throughout the sandbox components, designing efficient data aggregation mechanisms that can handle high-volume metric streams, and providing configurable retention and sampling policies to manage storage requirements.\n\n| Metric Category | Key Metrics | Collection Method | Storage Requirements |\n|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Security Events | Seccomp violations, capability usage, escape attempts | Event-driven logging with structured data | High - retain for audit |\n| Resource Utilization | Memory, CPU, I/O consumption per sandbox | Periodic sampling from cgroups | Medium - time-series data |\n| Performance | Sandbox creation latency, operation throughput | Request/response timing | Medium - aggregated statistics |\n| Operational Health | Process lifecycle events, error rates | State change notifications | Low - current status only |\n\n**Performance Metrics** provide data for optimization decisions and capacity planning. Key metrics include sandbox creation and destruction latency, resource utilization efficiency, and throughput characteristics under various load patterns. These metrics enable identification of performance bottlenecks and validation that optimizations provide expected benefits.\n\nThe collection system design involves implementing efficient metric aggregation that can handle high-frequency measurements, providing configurable metric retention policies that balance storage costs with analytical requirements, and ensuring that metrics collection doesn't significantly impact sandbox performance.\n\n#### Centralized Policy Management\n\nProduction sandbox deployments often require consistent policy enforcement across multiple hosts and dynamic policy updates without service interruption. Centralized policy management provides the administrative capabilities needed for large-scale deployments.\n\n**Policy Distribution Architecture** involves implementing a policy server that maintains canonical policy definitions, a distribution mechanism that ensures policy updates are consistently applied across all sandbox hosts, and a versioning system that enables rollback and audit trail maintenance.\n\nThe policy management system must handle various policy types including seccomp filter specifications that define allowed system calls for different sandbox categories, resource limit templates that provide standard resource allocations for different workload types, and filesystem policy definitions that specify allowed file access patterns.\n\n| Policy Type | Update Frequency | Distribution Latency | Rollback Requirements |\n|-------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Seccomp Filters | Low - security-driven updates | Fast - security critical | Immediate rollback capability |\n| Resource Limits | Medium - capacity management | Medium - operational impact | Gradual rollback preferred |\n| Filesystem Policies | Low - application-driven | Medium - functionality impact | Validation before rollback |\n| Network Policies | High - dynamic environments | Fast - connectivity critical | Automatic rollback on failure |\n\n**Policy Validation and Testing** capabilities ensure that policy updates don't break existing functionality or introduce security vulnerabilities. The validation system includes automated testing of new policies against representative workloads, staged deployment mechanisms that apply policy changes incrementally, and monitoring integration that detects policy-related issues after deployment.\n\nThe implementation involves creating policy specification languages or configuration formats that can express complex security requirements, implementing policy compilation and optimization mechanisms that generate efficient runtime enforcement code, and providing policy simulation capabilities that can predict the impact of proposed policy changes.\n\n#### Automated Incident Response\n\nLarge-scale sandbox deployments require automated response capabilities to handle security incidents, resource exhaustion, and operational failures without human intervention. Automated incident response systems can react to threats faster than human operators and provide consistent response policies across the entire deployment.\n\n**Security Incident Response** involves implementing detection mechanisms for various attack patterns including container escape attempts, privilege escalation behaviors, and resource exhaustion attacks. The response system can automatically isolate affected sandbox instances, collect forensic data, and implement containment measures.\n\nThe incident response architecture includes event correlation engines that can identify attack patterns across multiple sandbox instances, automated containment mechanisms that can isolate compromised sandbox instances without impacting others, and escalation policies that engage human operators when automated responses are insufficient.\n\n| Incident Type | Detection Method | Automated Response | Escalation Criteria |\n|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Container Escape | Namespace boundary violations | Process termination and isolation | Successful escape detection |\n| Resource Exhaustion | Cgroup limit violations | Resource reallocation or throttling | Sustained exhaustion patterns |\n| Anomalous Behavior | Behavioral pattern analysis | Increased monitoring and logging | Patterns matching known attacks |\n| Policy Violations | Seccomp or capability violations | Process termination and alerting | Repeated violation attempts |\n\n**Operational Incident Response** handles non-security failures including host resource exhaustion, network connectivity issues, and software failures. The response system can implement failover mechanisms, automatic resource rebalancing, and service degradation strategies that maintain partial functionality during outages.\n\nThe implementation strategy involves creating a rule engine that can process complex incident detection logic, implementing response action libraries that provide safe and tested incident response capabilities, and providing comprehensive logging and audit trails that enable post-incident analysis and system improvement.\n\n#### Integration with Container Orchestration\n\nModern deployment environments often involve container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, which provide additional management capabilities but may require integration with custom sandbox implementations. Integration strategies can leverage orchestration platform capabilities while maintaining enhanced security properties.\n\n**Kubernetes Integration** involves implementing custom resource definitions (CRDs) that represent sandbox configurations and policies, developing operators that manage sandbox lifecycle within Kubernetes clusters, and implementing admission controllers that can enforce additional security policies beyond standard Kubernetes controls.\n\nThe integration approach includes designing sandbox-aware scheduling policies that consider security requirements and resource isolation needs, implementing network policy integration that coordinates between Kubernetes network policies and sandbox network isolation, and providing monitoring integration that surfaces sandbox-specific metrics through standard Kubernetes monitoring systems.\n\n**Runtime Integration** with container runtimes like containerd or CRI-O enables leveraging existing container management capabilities while applying enhanced security restrictions. This approach involves implementing runtime plugins or alternative runtime implementations that provide standard container runtime interfaces while using the custom sandbox security mechanisms.\n\nThe integration strategy includes implementing OCI runtime specification compliance that enables integration with standard container tooling, providing image management integration that can work with existing container image workflows, and ensuring that enhanced security properties are preserved when integrating with standard container management systems.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe implementation of these advanced features requires careful planning and staged development to avoid introducing complexity that compromises the reliability and security of the core sandbox functionality.

technical terms and Linux-specific concepts used throughout the process sandbox implementation.\n\nThe process sandbox leverages numerous Linux-specific security primitives and kernel mechanisms that may be unfamiliar to developers new to systems programming or security engineering. This glossary provides comprehensive definitions of all technical terms, data structures, security concepts, and Linux kernel mechanisms used throughout the sandbox design and implementation.\n\n### Mental Model: The Technical Dictionary\n\nThink of this glossary as a **technical dictionary for a specialized security domain**. Just as learning a new language requires understanding vocabulary before constructing complex sentences, building a process sandbox requires mastering the terminology of Linux security primitives before orchestrating them into a complete defense system. Each term builds upon others, creating a hierarchy of concepts from basic Linux primitives to advanced security mechanisms.\n\nThe terms are organized to reflect the conceptual layers of the sandbox: fundamental Linux concepts, security primitives, data structures, operational procedures, and debugging terminology. Understanding these definitions enables precise communication about sandbox behavior and systematic troubleshooting of security mechanisms.\n\n### Core Linux Security Concepts\n\n**Process sandbox**: An isolated execution environment created using operating system primitives that restricts an untrusted program's access to system resources. The sandbox combines multiple Linux security mechanisms including namespaces, seccomp, cgroups, and capabilities to create defense-in-depth isolation. Unlike virtual machines which virtualize hardware, process sandboxes use kernel features to isolate processes while sharing the same kernel.\n\n**Defense-in-depth**: A security strategy employing multiple independent layers of protection, where the failure of one security mechanism does not compromise the entire system. In the context of process sandboxing, this means combining namespace isolation, filesystem restrictions, system call filtering, resource limits, and privilege dropping so that an attacker must bypass all layers to escape the sandbox.\n\n**Namespace**: A Linux kernel feature that provides isolated views of system resources, making processes believe they have exclusive access to resources that are actually shared. Each namespace type isolates a different category of system resource: PID namespaces isolate process trees, mount namespaces isolate filesystem views, network namespaces isolate network stacks, UTS namespaces isolate hostname and domain, user namespaces isolate user and group IDs, and cgroup namespaces isolate cgroup hierarchies.\n\n**Seccomp**: A Linux kernel security feature that allows processes to restrict which system calls they can make through Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) programs. Seccomp operates at the kernel level, intercepting system calls before they execute and applying filtering rules. The most common mode, seccomp-BPF, enables complex filtering based on system call numbers, arguments, and calling process characteristics.\n\n**Cgroups**: The Linux control groups subsystem that provides resource limiting, accounting, and isolation for collections of processes. Cgroups organize processes into hierarchical groups and apply resource controls through specialized controllers for memory, CPU time, process count, I/O bandwidth, and other resources. Both cgroups v1 and v2 are commonly deployed, with different interfaces and capabilities.\n\n**Capabilities**: Linux's fine-grained privilege system that divides the traditional root privileges into distinct units that can be independently granted or revoked. Instead of running as either privileged (root) or unprivileged (user), processes can hold specific capabilities like `CAP_NET_ADMIN` for network configuration or `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` for process debugging while lacking other dangerous privileges.\n\n### Filesystem Isolation Terminology\n\n**Chroot**: A Linux operation that changes the apparent root directory for a process and its children, making the process unable to access files outside the new root hierarchy. While chroot provides basic filesystem isolation, it can be escaped by processes with sufficient privileges and is primarily useful as one layer of a multi-layered security approach.\n\n**Pivot_root**: An atomic operation that swaps the root filesystem of a process, moving the old root to a specified location within the new root hierarchy. Unlike chroot, pivot_root operates on mounted filesystems and provides stronger isolation guarantees, making it the preferred mechanism for container and sandbox implementations.\n\n**Tmpfs**: A memory-backed temporary filesystem that stores files in virtual memory instead of persistent storage. Tmpfs provides high-performance temporary storage that automatically disappears when unmounted, making it ideal for writable areas within otherwise read-only sandbox environments.\n\n**Mount namespace**: A Linux namespace that provides each process group with an isolated view of filesystem mount points. Processes in different mount namespaces can mount and unmount filesystems independently without affecting other namespaces, enabling the creation of customized filesystem layouts for sandboxed processes.\n\n**Device files**: Special files that provide interfaces to kernel drivers and hardware devices. Device files appear in the filesystem (typically under `/dev`) but reading or writing them communicates with kernel drivers rather than storing data on disk. Sandboxes must carefully control which device files are accessible to prevent hardware access and privilege escalation.\n\n**Overlay filesystem**: A union filesystem that combines multiple directories into a single logical filesystem, typically with a read-only lower layer and a writable upper layer. Overlay filesystems enable efficient sandbox creation by providing each sandbox instance with a writable view of a shared read-only base system without duplicating files.\n\n### System Call and BPF Terminology\n\n**BPF**: Berkeley Packet Filter, originally designed for network packet filtering but extended to provide a safe in-kernel execution environment for various purposes including seccomp system call filtering. BPF programs are executed in a virtual machine within the kernel, providing security through static analysis and runtime restrictions.\n\n**Whitelist**: An explicit list of allowed system calls that a sandboxed process may invoke. Whitelisting follows the security principle of default deny, where only explicitly permitted system calls are allowed and all others result in process termination or error returns. This contrasts with blacklisting approaches that attempt to enumerate dangerous system calls.\n\n**System call**: The interface through which user-space programs request services from the kernel, such as reading files, allocating memory, or creating network connections. System calls represent the boundary between user and kernel space, making them a critical enforcement point for security policies in process sandboxes.\n\n**Argument-level filtering**: Advanced seccomp filtering that examines not just the system call number but also the arguments passed to the system call. This enables policies like \"allow `open()` but only for files under `/tmp`\" or \"allow `socket()` but only for Unix domain sockets\" by inspecting system call parameters.\n\n### Resource Management Terminology\n\n**Resource exhaustion**: An attack pattern where malicious code attempts to consume excessive system resources (memory, CPU time, file descriptors, processes) to cause denial of service or trigger resource allocation failures that might lead to privilege escalation opportunities.\n\n**Hierarchical filesystem**: The tree-structured organization of cgroups where child cgroups inherit and are constrained by the resource limits of their parent cgroups. This hierarchy enables sophisticated resource management policies and delegation of administrative responsibilities.\n\n**Controller**: A cgroup subsystem that manages a specific type of resource, such as the memory controller for RAM usage limits, the CPU controller for processor time quotas, or the PID controller for process count restrictions. Each controller provides its own configuration files and enforcement mechanisms.\n\n**Quota**: A specific allocation of resource consumption permitted to a process or cgroup. Quotas can be absolute limits (maximum 64MB of memory) or relative shares (10% of CPU time) and are enforced by the kernel to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.\n\n**Bandwidth throttling**: The technique of limiting the rate at which processes can consume resources, particularly I/O bandwidth. Throttling prevents sudden bursts of resource consumption from affecting system performance and enables predictable resource sharing among multiple sandboxes.\n\n### Privilege and Capability Terminology\n\n**Effective set**: The set of Linux capabilities that are currently active and can be used by a process. The effective set determines what privileged operations the process can actually perform at any given moment.\n\n**Permitted set**: The maximum set of capabilities that a process may add to its effective set. The permitted set acts as a ceiling on the capabilities a process can activate, even if it possesses them in other sets.\n\n**Inheritable set**: Capabilities that can be inherited by child processes when combined with the inheritable set of an executable file during `exec()`. The inheritable set provides controlled privilege transfer across process boundaries.\n\n**Bounding set**: A system-wide or process-specific ceiling on capabilities that can be gained through any mechanism. The bounding set provides an ultimate limit on privilege escalation, even for processes that might otherwise gain capabilities through setuid executables or other means.\n\n**Ambient set**: A simplified capability inheritance mechanism that allows unprivileged processes to retain specific capabilities across `exec()` boundaries without requiring special file attributes. Ambient capabilities automatically transfer to child processes when certain conditions are met.\n\n**No new privileges**: A process flag set via `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)` that prevents the process and its descendants from gaining additional privileges through any mechanism, including setuid executables, file capabilities, or SELinux transitions. This flag provides strong protection against privilege escalation attacks.\n\n**Privilege dropping**: The systematic process of removing unnecessary Linux capabilities and changing to a lower-privileged user account to minimize the attack surface if the sandboxed process is compromised. Proper privilege dropping follows a specific sequence to avoid accidentally retaining dangerous capabilities.\n\n### Data Structure Definitions\n\nThe process sandbox employs numerous data structures to manage configuration, runtime state, and security mechanisms. Understanding these structures is essential for implementing and debugging the sandbox system.\n\n| Structure Name | Purpose | Key Fields |\n|---|---|---|\n| `sandbox_config_t` | Configuration parameters for sandbox creation | `program_path`, `program_args`, `chroot_path`, `memory_limit`, `cpu_percent`, `enable_network`, `allowed_syscalls` |\n| `sandbox_state_t` | Runtime state and handles for active sandbox | `child_pid`, `namespace_fd[6]`, `cgroup_path`, `cleanup_needed` |\n| `namespace_state_t` | File descriptors for namespace isolation | `pid_ns_fd`, `mount_ns_fd`, `net_ns_fd`, `uts_ns_fd`, `user_ns_fd`, `initialized` |\n| `fs_isolation_state_t` | Filesystem isolation configuration and state | `sandbox_root`, `old_root_path`, `mount_ns_fd`, `cleanup_needed` |\n| `cgroup_limits_t` | Resource limit specifications | `memory_limit_bytes`, `cpu_quota_us`, `cpu_period_us`, `pid_max`, `io_read_bps`, `io_write_bps` |\n| `cgroup_state_t` | Cgroup management and cleanup state | `cgroup_path`, `instance_id`, `version`, `available_controllers`, `managed_pids` |\n| `error_context_t` | Comprehensive error reporting information | `error_code`, `severity`, `category`, `component`, `operation`, `description`, `sandbox_pid` |\n| `health_check_result_t` | Individual health check outcome | `check_name`, `status`, `message`, `response_time_ms`, `last_check_time` |\n\n### Process Lifecycle and State Management\n\n**Orchestration**: The coordination of multiple security components in the correct sequence to create a functional sandbox. Orchestration ensures that namespaces are created before filesystem isolation, that seccomp filters are applied before executing untrusted code, and that resource limits are configured before allowing process creation.\n\n**Lifecycle management**: The systematic tracking of sandbox state from initial creation through final cleanup, including all intermediate states like configuration, execution, termination, and resource cleanup. Proper lifecycle management ensures that resources are allocated and deallocated correctly and that partial failures don't leave system resources in inconsistent states.\n\n**Coordination channel**: Communication mechanisms between the parent supervisor process and sandboxed child processes, typically implemented using pipes, Unix domain sockets, or shared memory. Coordination channels enable status reporting, graceful shutdown signaling, and emergency termination commands.\n\n**Resource tracking**: The maintenance of references to all allocated resources (file descriptors, mount points, cgroup hierarchies, temporary files) to ensure proper cleanup even in failure scenarios. Resource tracking prevents resource leaks that could accumulate over time and affect system stability.\n\n### Testing and Validation Terminology\n\n**Unit testing**: Testing individual security components in isolation to verify their specific functionality without dependencies on other components. Unit tests for sandbox components might verify that namespace creation succeeds, that seccomp filters block specific system calls, or that cgroup limits are properly enforced.\n\n**Integration testing**: Testing the complete sandbox system with realistic workloads to verify that all security components work together correctly. Integration tests execute actual programs within sandboxes and verify that the expected isolation and resource constraints are maintained.\n\n**Security validation**: Systematic testing of attack scenarios and bypass attempts to verify that security mechanisms cannot be circumvented. Security validation includes testing known container escape techniques, privilege escalation attacks, and resource exhaustion scenarios.\n\n**Penetration testing**: Comprehensive security testing that simulates real attacks against the sandbox system, including both automated tools and manual exploitation attempts. Penetration testing validates that the defense-in-depth approach successfully prevents sandbox escapes and privilege escalation.\n\n### Debugging and Diagnostics\n\n**Symptom-based diagnosis**: A systematic debugging approach that maps observable failure symptoms to likely root causes and provides specific diagnostic steps. This approach is particularly valuable for complex systems like process sandboxes where failures can have multiple contributing factors.\n\n**System call tracing**: The monitoring and recording of all system calls made by a process, typically using tools like `strace` or in-kernel tracing mechanisms. System call tracing is essential for debugging seccomp filter configurations and understanding process behavior within sandboxes.\n\n**Namespace inspection**: The examination of namespace configurations and isolation effectiveness by comparing the view of system resources from inside and outside the sandbox. Namespace inspection typically involves examining `/proc` filesystem entries and namespace file descriptors.\n\n**Resource monitoring**: The continuous or periodic measurement of resource consumption within cgroups to verify that resource limits are properly configured and enforced. Resource monitoring helps diagnose performance issues and validate resource limit effectiveness.\n\n### Advanced Security Features\n\n**LSM**: Linux Security Module, a framework that enables additional mandatory access control systems to be integrated into the kernel. LSMs like SELinux, AppArmor, and Smack provide policy-based access controls that complement the capability and namespace-based protections of process sandboxes.\n\n**Landlock**: A modern Linux Security Module that enables unprivileged processes to create fine-grained security sandboxes for themselves and their children. Landlock provides programmable access control for filesystem operations and integrates well with existing sandbox mechanisms.\n\n**eBPF**: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter, a powerful in-kernel programming framework that enables safe execution of user-defined programs within the kernel. eBPF can be used for advanced security monitoring, custom system call filtering, and performance monitoring of sandboxed processes.\n\n**Seccomp notify**: A modern seccomp feature that allows user-space programs to handle filtered system calls instead of simply allowing or denying them. Seccomp notify enables sophisticated policies like \"allow file access but log all operations\" or \"allow network access but restrict destinations.\"\n\n### Performance and Operational Terms\n\n**Template-based optimization**: A performance enhancement technique that pre-creates sandbox environments and reuses them for multiple executions. Templates reduce sandbox creation overhead by preparing common configurations and filesystem layouts in advance.\n\n**Process pool**: A resource management technique that maintains a collection of pre-configured processes ready for immediate task assignment. Process pools reduce the latency of sandbox creation by avoiding the overhead of repeated process creation and configuration.\n\n**Memory deduplication**: An optimization technique that identifies and shares identical memory pages across multiple processes. In sandbox contexts, memory deduplication can significantly reduce memory overhead when running many similar sandbox instances.\n\n**Metrics collection**: The systematic gathering of operational and security data from sandbox instances for monitoring, alerting, and analysis purposes. Metrics collection typically includes resource usage statistics, security events, performance measurements, and operational health indicators.\n\n### Error Handling and Recovery\n\n**Cleanup ordering**: The specific sequence in which sandbox resources must be deallocated to handle dependencies correctly. For example, processes must be terminated before cgroups can be removed, and mount points must be unmounted before namespaces can be cleaned up.\n\n**Health monitoring**: Continuous observation of sandbox operational status to detect failures, resource exhaustion, security violations, or other problems that require intervention. Health monitoring enables proactive response to issues before they cause complete sandbox failures.\n\n**Automated recovery**: Systematic response to detected failures without requiring human intervention. Automated recovery might include restarting failed processes, recreating corrupted resources, or falling back to simpler configurations when advanced features fail.\n\n**Escalation**: The process of triggering human attention when automated responses are insufficient to handle detected problems. Escalation policies define when and how operational staff should be notified of sandbox issues that require manual intervention.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe process sandbox implementation relies on numerous Linux-specific system calls, kernel interfaces, and user-space utilities. Understanding how to correctly invoke these mechanisms and handle their error conditions is essential for building robust sandbox systems.\n\n#### Essential System Calls and Library Functions\n\n| Function/System Call | Purpose | Critical Parameters | Common Pitfalls |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `clone()` | Create child process with namespace isolation | `CLONE_NEWPID`, `CLONE_NEWMNT`, `CLONE_NEWNET`, `CLONE_NEWUTS`, `CLONE_NEWUSER` | Forgetting `SIGCHLD` flag, insufficient privileges for user namespaces |\n| `unshare()` | Move calling process to new namespaces | Namespace flags, timing relative to other operations | Cannot unshare PID namespace from running process |\n| `mount()` | Mount filesystems and bind mounts | `MS_BIND`, `MS_RDONLY`, `MS_NOSUID`, `MS_NODEV`, `MS_NOEXEC` | Mount propagation, order dependencies |\n| `pivot_root()` | Atomically change root filesystem | Old and new root paths, mount point requirements | Requires mounted filesystems, complex setup sequence |\n| `prctl()` | Set process attributes and security flags | `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, `PR_SET_SECCOMP`, capability operations | Operation ordering, irreversible changes |\n| `seccomp()` | Install BPF system call filters | Filter programs, operation modes, flag combinations | Architecture-specific syscall numbers, missing required calls |\n\n#### File Structure and Organization\n\nThe sandbox implementation should be organized into clearly separated modules that handle specific security mechanisms and can be tested independently:\n\n```\nsandbox/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── sandbox-runner/\n│       └── main.c                    #
