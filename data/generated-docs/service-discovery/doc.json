The key architectural challenge is maintaining an accurate, real-time view of service health across a distributed system where services can fail or become unreachable at any time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the foundational understanding needed throughout the project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-phone-book-analogy\">Mental Model: The Phone Book Analogy</h3>\n<p>Think of service discovery as maintaining a <strong>dynamic phone book</strong> for a bustling city where businesses constantly open, close, relocate, and change their phone numbers. In the traditional world, a phone book is published once a year and becomes outdated quickly. But imagine if you needed a phone book that updated itself in real-time, automatically removing businesses that closed down and adding new ones as they opened.</p>\n<p>In a microservices architecture, each service is like a business in this city. When a new service instance starts up (like a new restaurant opening), it needs to announce itself to the registry: &quot;Hi, I&#39;m the Payment Service, and I&#39;m available at IP address 192.168.1.10 on port 8080.&quot; When clients need to make a payment, they consult this dynamic phone book to find all healthy instances of the Payment Service, just like you&#39;d look up a restaurant&#39;s phone number before making a reservation.</p>\n<p>The crucial difference from a traditional phone book is that services can fail, become overloaded, or lose network connectivity at any moment. A restaurant might close temporarily for renovations, or their phone lines might go down. In our service registry, we need to detect these situations automatically and stop directing traffic to unhealthy services. This is where <strong>health checking</strong> comes in – imagine having an army of inspectors who constantly call every business in the phone book to verify they&#39;re still operating and ready to serve customers.</p>\n<p>The registry becomes the single source of truth that answers questions like: &quot;What are all the available instances of the User Service right now?&quot; or &quot;Is the Database Service healthy and ready to accept connections?&quot; Without this centralized knowledge, services would have to maintain their own lists of where to find other services, leading to configuration nightmares and stale information.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps us understand the core challenges we&#39;re solving: <strong>dynamic registration</strong> (businesses announcing themselves), <strong>real-time health monitoring</strong> (checking if they&#39;re still operational), <strong>efficient lookup</strong> (finding services quickly when needed), and <strong>automatic cleanup</strong> (removing failed services from the directory).</p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-solutions-comparison\">Existing Solutions Comparison</h3>\n<p>Before building our own service registry, it&#39;s important to understand how existing solutions approach the service discovery problem. Each solution represents different trade-offs between complexity, performance, reliability, and operational overhead.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dns-based-service-discovery\">DNS-Based Service Discovery</h4>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong>: Traditional DNS can be extended for service discovery by creating DNS records for services, often using SRV records that specify both hostname and port information. Services register themselves by creating DNS entries, and clients discover services through DNS lookups.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of DNS-based discovery as using the existing postal system infrastructure. Every service gets a mailing address (DNS name), and when you want to reach a service, you look up its address in the postal directory (DNS server). The existing infrastructure handles the routing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Simplicity</strong></td>\n<td>Leverages existing DNS infrastructure and client libraries</td>\n<td>Very simple to implement and understand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Caching Behavior</strong></td>\n<td>DNS responses are cached at multiple levels (client, resolver, authoritative)</td>\n<td>Fast lookups but stale data during failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Health Checking</strong></td>\n<td>Limited to basic connectivity checks, no application-level health</td>\n<td>Cannot detect application-specific failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Update Propagation</strong></td>\n<td>Bounded by DNS TTL settings, typically 30-300 seconds</td>\n<td>Slow to reflect service changes and failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Load Balancing</strong></td>\n<td>Basic round-robin through multiple A records</td>\n<td>Limited load balancing strategies</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: DNS-based discovery works well for relatively stable services with long-lived instances. It requires minimal additional infrastructure since DNS is already ubiquitous. The approach integrates seamlessly with existing networking tools and doesn&#39;t require special client libraries.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The caching behavior that makes DNS fast also makes it inappropriate for dynamic environments where services frequently start, stop, or fail. A failed service might continue receiving traffic for minutes after it becomes unavailable. Additionally, DNS provides no visibility into service health beyond basic connectivity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"load-balancer-centric-discovery\">Load Balancer-Centric Discovery</h4>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong>: Services register themselves with a load balancer (like HAProxy, NGINX, or cloud load balancers), and clients connect to the load balancer instead of directly to service instances. The load balancer maintains the service registry internally and handles health checking, traffic distribution, and failover.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Imagine a hotel concierge desk where all guests (clients) come to ask for services. The concierge maintains a current list of all available service providers (restaurants, tours, transportation) and their status. When you need something, you ask the concierge, and they direct you to an available provider. You never need to know all the providers yourself.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Health Checking</strong></td>\n<td>Built-in health checks with configurable protocols and intervals</td>\n<td>Excellent health detection but centralized failure point</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Performance</strong></td>\n<td>Single network hop, connection pooling, traffic optimization</td>\n<td>High performance but bottleneck at load balancer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Operational Complexity</strong></td>\n<td>Requires load balancer configuration and management</td>\n<td>Simpler for clients but complex operational overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scalability</strong></td>\n<td>Load balancer must handle all traffic for registered services</td>\n<td>Excellent per-service scaling but limited by LB capacity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Visibility</strong></td>\n<td>Rich metrics and monitoring through load balancer</td>\n<td>Great observability but only at network level</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Load balancer-centric discovery provides excellent performance and reliability. The load balancer can perform sophisticated health checking, implement advanced routing strategies, and provide detailed traffic metrics. Clients have a simple experience – they just connect to a single, stable endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: This approach creates a potential bottleneck and single point of failure at the load balancer. It also adds network latency for every request and requires careful capacity planning for the load balancer itself. The operational complexity of managing load balancer configurations can become significant as the number of services grows.</p>\n<h4 id=\"service-mesh-solutions\">Service Mesh Solutions</h4>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong>: A service mesh like Istio or Linkerd deploys a proxy (sidecar) alongside each service instance. These proxies form a mesh network that handles service-to-service communication, discovery, security, and observability. Services register with the mesh control plane, and proxies automatically discover and connect to other services.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: Think of a service mesh as a sophisticated telephone operator system from the early 1900s. Every service has a personal operator (the sidecar proxy) who knows how to reach every other service in the system. When your service wants to call another service, it talks to its operator, who handles finding the destination, establishing the connection, monitoring the call quality, and even encrypting the conversation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Feature Richness</strong></td>\n<td>Comprehensive traffic management, security, observability</td>\n<td>Powerful capabilities but high complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Transparency</strong></td>\n<td>Services require minimal changes to benefit from mesh features</td>\n<td>Easy adoption but hidden complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Resource Overhead</strong></td>\n<td>Each service requires an additional proxy sidecar</td>\n<td>Rich features but significant memory/CPU cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Learning Curve</strong></td>\n<td>Complex configuration and troubleshooting requirements</td>\n<td>Advanced capabilities but steep learning curve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Operational Overhead</strong></td>\n<td>Requires dedicated platform team to manage mesh infrastructure</td>\n<td>Enterprise-grade features but substantial operational burden</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Service meshes provide the most comprehensive solution, handling not just service discovery but also security (mTLS), advanced traffic routing, observability, and policy enforcement. They offer fine-grained control over service communication and can be incrementally adopted without major application changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: The complexity and resource overhead can be overwhelming, especially for smaller teams or simpler use cases. Each service instance requires additional memory and CPU for the sidecar proxy, and troubleshooting network issues becomes significantly more complex when every connection flows through multiple proxies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dedicated-service-registry-solutions\">Dedicated Service Registry Solutions</h4>\n<p><strong>How It Works</strong>: Purpose-built service registries like Consul, etcd, or Eureka provide specialized APIs for service registration, discovery, and health checking. Services actively register themselves via API calls, and clients query the registry to discover healthy service instances.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental Model</strong>: This is like having a specialized business directory service that&#39;s designed specifically for the needs of a rapidly changing marketplace. Unlike a general-purpose phone book, this directory is built from the ground up to handle businesses that frequently change locations, hours, and availability. It has dedicated staff (health checkers) who constantly verify business information and provides specialized search capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Purpose-Built</strong></td>\n<td>APIs designed specifically for service discovery use cases</td>\n<td>Excellent fit for purpose but additional infrastructure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Flexibility</strong></td>\n<td>Configurable health checking, metadata, and query capabilities</td>\n<td>Highly customizable but requires configuration expertise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Consistency</strong></td>\n<td>Strong consistency guarantees for registration data</td>\n<td>Reliable state but potential availability trade-offs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Integration</strong></td>\n<td>Rich client libraries and integration patterns</td>\n<td>Easy to integrate but adds dependency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scalability</strong></td>\n<td>Designed to handle large numbers of services and frequent updates</td>\n<td>Excellent scalability but requires proper deployment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong>: Dedicated registries excel at service discovery workflows and provide exactly the APIs and features needed for microservice architectures. They offer sophisticated health checking, rich metadata support, and strong consistency guarantees. The query capabilities are optimized for service discovery patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Adding another infrastructure component increases operational complexity and introduces additional failure modes. Teams must learn registry-specific APIs and configuration patterns, and the registry itself becomes a critical dependency that must be highly available.</p>\n<h4 id=\"comparison-summary-and-project-rationale\">Comparison Summary and Project Rationale</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Solution</th>\n<th>Best For</th>\n<th>Avoid When</th>\n<th>Complexity</th>\n<th>Performance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>DNS</strong></td>\n<td>Stable, long-lived services</td>\n<td>Dynamic, frequently changing services</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Load Balancer</strong></td>\n<td>High-performance, centralized routing</td>\n<td>Diverse service communication patterns</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Service Mesh</strong></td>\n<td>Enterprise microservices with advanced requirements</td>\n<td>Simple use cases, resource-constrained environments</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Dedicated Registry</strong></td>\n<td>Purpose-built service discovery with flexibility</td>\n<td>Minimal infrastructure, simple scenarios</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: For learning purposes, we&#39;re building a dedicated service registry because it best demonstrates the core concepts of service discovery without the abstractions of other approaches. Understanding how registration, health checking, and lookup work at the fundamental level provides the foundation for appreciating why other solutions make the trade-offs they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why We&#39;re Building Our Own</strong>: Our project implements a dedicated service registry approach because it provides the clearest learning path for understanding service discovery fundamentals. By building the registry, health checker, and API layer ourselves, we&#39;ll understand the challenges that existing solutions address: how to handle concurrent registrations, how to detect and respond to service failures, how to provide consistent views of service health, and how to design APIs that are both simple and powerful.</p>\n<p>This hands-on experience with the core algorithms and data structures will make it much easier to understand the design decisions in production systems like Consul or Eureka. We&#39;ll encounter the same fundamental trade-offs around consistency vs. availability, push vs. pull health checking, and centralized vs. distributed architectures that influence all service discovery solutions.</p>\n<p>The registry we build will be simpler than production systems but will demonstrate the essential concepts that apply regardless of implementation. Once you understand how service registration state machines work, how health check failures propagate through the system, and how to design APIs for efficient service lookup, you&#39;ll be well-equipped to work with any service discovery solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-non-goals\">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the scope and boundaries that guide design decisions throughout the project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-hotel-concierge-service\">Mental Model: The Hotel Concierge Service</h3>\n<p>Think of this service registry like a hotel concierge desk in a busy metropolitan hotel. The concierge maintains a comprehensive directory of all local services - restaurants, theaters, transportation options, and medical facilities. When guests need recommendations, they don&#39;t wander the streets hoping to stumble upon what they need. Instead, they ask the concierge, who provides current, accurate information about what&#39;s available and operational.</p>\n<p>However, the concierge doesn&#39;t just maintain a static phone book. They actively verify that recommended services are still operating - calling restaurants to confirm they&#39;re open, checking theater schedules, and removing temporarily closed businesses from their active recommendations. The concierge also doesn&#39;t handle the actual transactions; they don&#39;t make dinner reservations or buy theater tickets. Their job is purely to maintain accurate, up-to-date information about what services exist and how to reach them.</p>\n<p>This analogy captures the essence of what we&#39;re building: a system that maintains current information about available services and provides reliable discovery, but doesn&#39;t handle the actual service-to-service communication or complex distributed coordination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"primary-goals\">Primary Goals</h3>\n<p>Our service registry aims to solve the fundamental <strong>service discovery</strong> problem in distributed systems by providing a centralized, authoritative source of truth about service availability. This system will enable microservices to dynamically discover and communicate with each other without hardcoded network locations or static configuration files.</p>\n<h4 id=\"goal-1-reliable-service-registration-and-discovery\">Goal 1: Reliable Service Registration and Discovery</h4>\n<p>The registry must provide a simple yet robust mechanism for services to announce their availability and for clients to discover healthy service instances. When a new instance of a payment service starts up, it should be able to register itself with minimal configuration. When an order service needs to process a payment, it should reliably discover available payment service instances without knowing their specific network locations in advance.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operation</th>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service Registration</td>\n<td>Services can announce availability with metadata</td>\n<td>Returns unique instance ID, stores host/port/tags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Lookup</td>\n<td>Clients can find healthy instances by service name</td>\n<td>Returns list of available instances with connection details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Deregistration</td>\n<td>Services can cleanly remove themselves when shutting down</td>\n<td>Instance no longer appears in lookup results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bulk Discovery</td>\n<td>Clients can retrieve all available services and their instances</td>\n<td>Returns complete registry state for debugging/monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registration process must handle essential metadata including service name, network endpoint (host and port), optional tags for service variants, and unique instance identification. This metadata enables both basic discovery and more advanced routing patterns where clients might need specific service variants.</p>\n<h4 id=\"goal-2-automated-health-monitoring-and-failure-detection\">Goal 2: Automated Health Monitoring and Failure Detection</h4>\n<p>The registry must automatically detect failed or unresponsive services and remove them from active discovery results. In dynamic environments where services can crash, become overloaded, or experience network partitions, stale registry information leads to connection failures and cascading errors throughout the system.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Check Type</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n<th>Failure Detection</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Health Endpoints</td>\n<td>Poll <code>/health</code> endpoints at configurable intervals</td>\n<td>Mark unhealthy after consecutive failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TCP Connectivity</td>\n<td>Verify network connectivity to service ports</td>\n<td>Detect network partitions and service crashes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Response Latency</td>\n<td>Monitor health check response times</td>\n<td>Identify overloaded or degrading services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Protocols</td>\n<td>Support gRPC health checking protocol</td>\n<td>Enable health checks for non-HTTP services</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>health checking</strong> system operates as a background process that continuously monitors registered services. Rather than relying on services to actively maintain their registration (which fails when services crash unexpectedly), the registry proactively verifies service health and automatically removes unresponsive instances.</p>\n<h4 id=\"goal-3-http-api-for-integration\">Goal 3: HTTP API for Integration</h4>\n<p>The registry must expose all operations through a well-designed REST API that services and operational tools can easily integrate with. This API serves as the primary interface for service registration during startup, service discovery during runtime, and administrative operations for monitoring and debugging.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>API Category</th>\n<th>Endpoints</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service Management</td>\n<td><code>POST /services</code>, <code>DELETE /services/{name}/{id}</code></td>\n<td>Register and deregister service instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Discovery</td>\n<td><code>GET /services/{name}</code>, <code>GET /services</code></td>\n<td>Look up healthy instances and browse registry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Monitoring</td>\n<td><code>GET /health/status</code>, <code>GET /health/services/{name}</code></td>\n<td>Monitor system health and troubleshoot issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Administrative</td>\n<td><code>GET /admin/stats</code>, <code>POST /admin/gc</code></td>\n<td>Operational monitoring and maintenance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The API design emphasizes simplicity and discoverability. Services should be able to integrate with minimal client library dependencies, using standard HTTP clients and JSON serialization available in any programming language.</p>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>Understanding what this service registry will <strong>not</strong> provide is equally important for setting appropriate expectations and avoiding scope creep during implementation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"non-goal-1-service-mesh-or-traffic-management\">Non-Goal 1: Service Mesh or Traffic Management</h4>\n<p>This registry is purely an information service - it maintains data about service locations but does not participate in actual service-to-service communication. We will not implement load balancing algorithms, circuit breakers, retry logic, or traffic shaping capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Service Mesh Feature</th>\n<th>Why Not Included</th>\n<th>Alternative Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Load Balancing</td>\n<td>Client-side responsibility</td>\n<td>Clients implement load balancing using registry data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circuit Breakers</td>\n<td>Application-level concern</td>\n<td>Services implement circuit breakers independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Traffic Splitting</td>\n<td>Requires <strong>sidecar proxy</strong> infrastructure</td>\n<td>Use service tags for blue/green deployments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mutual TLS</td>\n<td>Complex PKI infrastructure</td>\n<td>Services handle TLS termination directly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registry provides the data foundation that enables these features, but implementing them remains the responsibility of client applications or dedicated infrastructure components like service mesh <strong>sidecar proxy</strong> processes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"non-goal-2-distributed-consensus-or-multi-node-clustering\">Non-Goal 2: Distributed Consensus or Multi-Node Clustering</h4>\n<p>This implementation focuses on a single-node registry that can be deployed as a centralized service. We will not implement distributed consensus algorithms (like Raft or PBFT), multi-master replication, or automatic failover capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Distributed Feature</th>\n<th>Complexity Introduced</th>\n<th>Single-Node Alternative</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Consensus Algorithms</td>\n<td>Leader election, log replication, partition handling</td>\n<td>Deploy multiple independent registries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Data Replication</td>\n<td>Consistency guarantees, conflict resolution</td>\n<td>Use external backup/restore mechanisms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automatic Failover</td>\n<td>Split-brain detection, membership management</td>\n<td>Implement manual failover procedures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-Region Sync</td>\n<td>Network partition tolerance, eventual consistency</td>\n<td>Deploy regional registry instances</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>While this limits high availability, it dramatically simplifies the implementation and makes the system easier to reason about, debug, and operate. Production deployments can achieve redundancy through external mechanisms like database replication or deployment automation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"non-goal-3-complex-service-routing-or-protocol-translation\">Non-Goal 3: Complex Service Routing or Protocol Translation</h4>\n<p>The registry will not implement service routing logic, protocol translation, or advanced service composition patterns. These capabilities require deep integration with application protocols and business logic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Advanced Feature</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Recommended Approach</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Protocol Translation</td>\n<td>HTTP ↔ gRPC conversion, message transformation</td>\n<td>Use dedicated API gateways</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Composition</td>\n<td>Workflow orchestration, transaction coordination</td>\n<td>Implement in application layer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic Routing</td>\n<td>A/B testing, canary deployments, feature flags</td>\n<td>Use service tags + client-side logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Request Transformation</td>\n<td>Header manipulation, payload modification</td>\n<td>Handle in reverse proxies or gateways</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registry provides service metadata (including tags and version information) that enables client applications to implement these patterns, but it does not dictate how services should communicate or route requests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Registry Scope - Information Service vs Infrastructure Service</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Service registries can range from simple directories to full-featured service mesh control planes</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Full service mesh with traffic management</li>\n<li>Registry with basic load balancing</li>\n<li>Pure information service</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement as pure information service</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Focuses implementation on core <strong>service discovery</strong> problem without coupling to specific communication patterns or load balancing strategies</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables simple, reliable implementation but requires clients to handle traffic management</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Full Service Mesh</td>\n<td>Complete solution, advanced traffic features</td>\n<td>Extreme complexity, tight coupling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Registry + Load Balancing</td>\n<td>Moderate functionality, some traffic help</td>\n<td>Still complex, assumes specific patterns</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pure Information Service</td>\n<td>Simple, focused, widely applicable</td>\n<td>Clients must implement traffic logic</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Single-Node vs Distributed Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Production registries often require high availability and geographic distribution</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Distributed consensus (Raft/etcd-style)</li>\n<li>Eventually consistent replication</li>\n<li>Single-node with external backup</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Single-node architecture</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Distributed consensus adds significant complexity that obscures core learning objectives;

This registry should be easy to understand, debug, and extend. Complex features that benefit only specific use cases should be left for future extensions or external tools.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal is to build a service registry that a junior developer can understand completely after reading the code for a few hours, not a feature-complete service mesh that requires months to master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"principle-2-explicit-over-implicit\">Principle 2: Explicit Over Implicit</h4>\n<p>Service registration, health check configuration, and failure modes should be explicit rather than hidden behind automatic discovery or complex heuristics. Services should clearly declare their endpoints and health check requirements rather than relying on convention-based discovery.</p>\n<h4 id=\"principle-3-fail-safe-over-fail-fast\">Principle 3: Fail-Safe Over Fail-Fast</h4>\n<p>When the registry encounters ambiguous situations (like temporary network partitions), it should err on the side of leaving services available rather than aggressively removing them. False positives (showing unhealthy services as healthy) are generally preferable to false negatives (removing healthy services).</p>\n<h3 id=\"success-criteria-and-acceptance-testing\">Success

Using Go maps without proper synchronization leads to data races and potential crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Go maps are not thread-safe. Concurrent reads and writes cause undefined behavior and can crash the program.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Always protect registry state with <code>sync.RWMutex</code>. Use read locks for lookups and write locks for registration/deregistration.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Health Checks</strong>\nImplementing health checks that block the main registry thread while waiting for HTTP responses. This causes the entire registry to become unresponsive during network timeouts.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> Health checks can take several seconds to timeout. Blocking the main thread prevents new registrations and lookups.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Run health checks in separate goroutines and communicate results through channels. Set aggressive timeouts on HTTP clients used for health checking.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Unbounded Growth</strong>\nForgetting to clean up deregistered services or failed health check records. Over time, the registry accumulates stale data and consumes unbounded memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong:</strong> In long-running deployments, memory usage grows without bound, eventually causing out-of-memory crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix:</strong> Implement background cleanup processes that remove stale entries. Use TTL-based expiration for registration records and limit the size of health check history.</p>\n<h2 id=\"high-level-architecture\">High-Level Architecture</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the architectural foundation that supports service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API exposure (Milestone 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview\">Component Overview</h3>\n<p>Think of our service discovery system like a <strong>modern hotel with smart operations</strong>. The hotel has three key departments working together: the <strong>Reception Desk</strong> (Registry Core) maintains the guest registry and handles check-ins and check-outs, the <strong>Security Team</strong> (Health Checker) does regular rounds to verify guests are actually in their rooms and responsive, and the <strong>Concierge Service</strong> (HTTP API) provides a friendly interface for guests and external visitors to interact with hotel services. Each department has distinct responsibilities, but they must coordinate seamlessly to maintain an accurate, real-time picture of who&#39;s staying where and whether they&#39;re available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-components.svg\" alt=\"System Component Architecture\"></p>\n<p>Our service discovery system consists of three primary components that work in concert to provide reliable service registration and discovery capabilities. Each component has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with others through carefully designed interfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>The Registry Core</strong> serves as the authoritative source of truth for all service instance information. It maintains an in-memory data structure that maps service names to collections of registered instances, along with their current health status. This component handles the fundamental operations of service registration, deregistration, and lookup. When a service wants to announce its availability, the Registry Core assigns it a unique identifier, stores its metadata (name, host, port, tags, and health endpoint), and initializes its health status tracking. The Registry Core also enforces time-to-live (TTL) semantics, automatically removing instances that haven&#39;t sent heartbeats within the configured timeout period. All operations on the registry are thread-safe, allowing concurrent registrations, lookups, and health updates without data corruption.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight:</strong> The Registry Core operates entirely in memory for maximum performance. This means lookup operations can respond in microseconds rather than milliseconds, which is crucial for high-throughput microservice environments where service discovery is on the critical path of every request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Health Checker</strong> operates as a background component responsible for continuously monitoring the health of all registered service instances. It maintains a separate goroutine (or thread) for each health check protocol and schedules periodic health verification requests according to configurable intervals. When a health check fails, the Health Checker implements a failure counting mechanism rather than immediately marking the service as unhealthy, which protects against transient network issues. Only after consecutive failures exceed the configured threshold does it notify the Registry Core to mark the instance as unavailable. The Health Checker supports multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, and gRPC) and can be extended with additional health check mechanisms as needed.</p>\n<p>The Health Checker&#39;s relationship with the Registry Core is carefully designed to avoid tight coupling. Rather than directly modifying registry state, it communicates health status changes through a well-defined interface. This allows the Registry Core to maintain control over its data consistency and enables features like health status caching and batched updates.</p>\n<p><strong>The HTTP API Layer</strong> provides the external interface through which services and clients interact with the service registry. It exposes REST endpoints for service registration, deregistration, lookup, and health status queries. This component handles HTTP request parsing, input validation, error handling, and response formatting. It translates between HTTP semantics and the internal operations of the Registry Core, ensuring that web clients can easily integrate with the service discovery system using standard HTTP tools and libraries.</p>\n<p>The API layer implements proper HTTP status codes, content negotiation, and error responses to provide a developer-friendly experience. It also handles concerns like request logging, metrics collection, and rate limiting that are essential for production deployment but separate from the core service discovery logic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Primary Responsibility</th>\n<th>Key Interfaces</th>\n<th>Data Ownership</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Registry Core</td>\n<td>Service instance storage and lookup</td>\n<td><code>Register()</code>, <code>Deregister()</code>, <code>Lookup()</code>, <code>UpdateHealth()</code></td>\n<td>Service metadata, health status, instance mappings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Checker</td>\n<td>Continuous health monitoring</td>\n<td><code>StartHealthCheck()</code>, <code>StopHealthCheck()</code>, <code>CheckHealth()</code></td>\n<td>Health check schedules, failure counters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP API</td>\n<td>External service interface</td>\n<td>REST endpoints: <code>/services</code>, <code>/services/{name}</code>, <code>/health</code></td>\n<td>HTTP request/response handling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h3>\n<p>The codebase should be organized to reflect the logical separation of concerns between our three main components, while providing clear boundaries between public interfaces and internal implementation details.

However, services need a client library to interact with it. This separation prevents external packages from importing server internals while providing a clean client interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Clear API boundaries, easier testing, prevents coupling between client and server implementations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>internal/</code> directory structure reflects our three-component architecture. Each component gets its own package with clearly defined responsibilities:</p>\n<p><strong>Registry Package</strong> (<code>internal/registry/</code>) contains the Registry Core implementation along with all data models used throughout the system. The <code>models.go</code> file defines <code>ServiceInstance</code>, <code>HealthStatus</code>, and other core data structures, ensuring consistent data representation across components. Custom error types in <code>errors.go</code> provide specific error handling for registry operations like duplicate registration or instance not found.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Package</strong> (<code>internal/health/</code>) encapsulates all health checking logic. The separation between <code>checker.go</code> (core health checking logic) and <code>protocols.go</code> (protocol-specific implementations) allows easy extension with new health check types. The <code>scheduler.go</code> file handles the complex timing logic for periodic health checks, failure tracking, and backoff strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>API Package</strong> (<code>internal/api/</code>) implements the HTTP interface layer. The separation between <code>server.go</code> (HTTP server setup) and <code>handlers.go</code> (request handling logic) follows standard web service patterns. Middleware components handle cross-cutting concerns like request logging, authentication, and error handling without cluttering the core handler logic.</p>\n<p>The <code>pkg/client/</code> package provides a Go client library that other services can import to interact with the service registry. This client encapsulates the HTTP API calls and provides a more convenient, strongly-typed interface for service registration and discovery operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Directory</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Public/Private</th>\n<th>Dependencies</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>cmd/server/</code></td>\n<td>Application entry point</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>All internal packages</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>internal/registry/</code></td>\n<td>Registry Core logic</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td><code>internal/config</code> only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>internal/health/</code></td>\n<td>Health checking</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td><code>internal/registry</code>, <code>internal/config</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>internal/api/</code></td>\n<td>HTTP API handlers</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td><code>internal/registry</code>, <code>internal/health</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>internal/config/</code></td>\n<td>Configuration management</td>\n<td>Private</td>\n<td>Standard library only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pkg/client/</code></td>\n<td>Client library</td>\n<td>Public</td>\n<td>Standard library only</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This structure supports the development workflow across all three milestones. Milestone 1 (Service Registry) focuses primarily on <code>internal/registry/</code>, Milestone 2 (Health Checking) adds <code>internal/health/</code>, and Milestone 3 (HTTP API) completes the system with <code>internal/api/</code>. The clear separation allows incremental development and testing of each component without complex dependencies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Implementation Note:</strong> The dependency direction flows from API layer → Health Checker → Registry Core → Config. This prevents circular dependencies and ensures that the Registry Core remains the authoritative component that other layers build upon, rather than being tightly coupled to HTTP or health checking concerns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This implementation guidance provides the foundation for organizing and building the service discovery system.

Each <strong>service instance</strong> is like an employee record containing their name, desk location (host and port), department tags, and how to reach them for status updates (health endpoint). The <strong>health status</strong> is like a wellness tracker showing whether each employee is currently available, when they were last checked on, and how many consecutive sick days they&#39;ve had. The <strong>service registry</strong> itself is like the HR database that maintains all employee records, tracks their wellness status, and provides lookup capabilities when other departments need to find someone.</p>\n<p>Just as an employee directory needs to handle new hires (registration), departures (deregistration), relocations (updates), and sick leave (health status changes), our data model must capture all the information needed to track service instances throughout their lifecycle. The key insight is that we&#39;re not just storing static information—we&#39;re maintaining a living directory that reflects the current state of our distributed system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model.svg\" alt=\"Data Model Relationships\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"core-data-structures\">Core Data Structures</h3>\n<p>The service discovery system centers around three primary data structures that work together to maintain a complete picture of service availability and health. Each structure serves a specific purpose while maintaining clear relationships with the others.</p>\n<p>The <code>ServiceInstance</code> represents a single running instance of a service that has registered itself with our registry. This is the fundamental unit of service discovery—each instance contains all the information needed for other services to connect to it and verify its health. The structure captures both the networking details required for communication and the metadata needed for service selection and routing decisions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>name</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Service name used for discovery lookups (e.g., &quot;user-service&quot;, &quot;payment-api&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>host</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Network host where the service instance is running (IP address or hostname)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>port</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>TCP port number on which the service instance is listening for requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tags</td>\n<td>[]string</td>\n<td>Metadata labels for filtering and routing (e.g., &quot;production&quot;, &quot;v2&quot;, &quot;us-west&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>health_endpoint</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>HTTP endpoint path for health checks (e.g., &quot;/health&quot;, &quot;/status&quot;)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>HealthStatus</code> tracks the current wellness state of each service instance. This structure is updated continuously by our health checking system and determines whether an instance should be included in discovery results. The health status provides both current state information and historical context about recent failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>status</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Current health state: &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;unhealthy&quot;, or &quot;unknown&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>last_check</td>\n<td>timestamp</td>\n<td>When the most recent health check was performed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>failure_count</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Number of consecutive failed health checks since last success</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> serves as the central repository that coordinates all service discovery operations. It maintains the complete mapping between service names and their instances, integrates with the health checking system, and provides thread-safe access to registry data. This structure represents the core state of our entire service discovery system.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>services</td>\n<td>map[string][]RegistryEntry</td>\n<td>Map from service names to lists of registered instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>health_checker</td>\n<td>HealthChecker</td>\n<td>Component responsible for monitoring instance health</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>config</td>\n<td>Config</td>\n<td>System configuration including timeouts, intervals, and limits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"supporting-data-structures\">Supporting Data Structures</h3>\n<p>Beyond the core structures, several supporting types handle configuration, internal state management, and API interactions. These structures provide the scaffolding that enables the core components to work together effectively.</p>\n<p>The <code>Config</code> structure centralizes all system configuration parameters, making it easy to adjust behavior without code changes. This structure determines how aggressively we check health, how long we wait for responses, and how quickly we clean up failed instances.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Port</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>HTTP port for the registry API server</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Host</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Host address to bind the API server</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HealthCheckInterval</td>\n<td>duration</td>\n<td>How frequently to check each instance&#39;s health</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HealthTimeout</td>\n<td>duration</td>\n<td>Maximum time to wait for health check responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MaxFailures</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Consecutive failures before marking instance unhealthy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TTL</td>\n<td>duration</td>\n<td>Time-to-live for service registrations before automatic cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CleanupInterval</td>\n<td>duration</td>\n<td>How frequently to remove expired registrations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>RegistryEntry</code> serves as an internal structure that combines instance information with its health status. This structure is not exposed directly through APIs but provides the registry core with a unified view of each service instance&#39;s complete state.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>instance</td>\n<td>ServiceInstance</td>\n<td>The service instance registration details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>health</td>\n<td>HealthStatus</td>\n<td>Current health status and check history</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>registered_at</td>\n<td>timestamp</td>\n<td>When this instance was first registered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>instance_id</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Unique identifier for this specific instance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"api-response-structures\">API Response Structures</h3>\n<p>The HTTP API layer requires standardized response formats that provide consistent interfaces for clients. These structures ensure that all API responses follow the same patterns, making the system easier to integrate with and debug.</p>\n<p>The <code>ServiceList</code> structure formats discovery query responses, providing clients with all the information needed to connect to healthy service instances. This structure includes both the instance details and sufficient metadata for clients to make intelligent routing decisions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>service_name</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Name of the requested service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>instances</td>\n<td>[]ServiceInstance</td>\n<td>List of healthy instances available for connection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>total_count</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Total number of registered instances (including unhealthy)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>healthy_count</td>\n<td>int</td>\n<td>Number of instances currently passing health checks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ErrorResponse</code> provides standardized error reporting across all API endpoints. Consistent error formatting helps clients handle failures gracefully and provides operators with clear diagnostic information.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>error</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Human-readable error message describing what went wrong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>error_code</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Machine-readable error identifier for programmatic handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>details</td>\n<td>map[string]interface{}</td>\n<td>Additional context information specific to the error type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>SuccessResponse</code> wraps successful API operations with metadata about the operation result. This structure provides confirmation of successful operations along with any relevant result data.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>success</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Always true for successful responses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>data</td>\n<td>interface{}</td>\n<td>The actual result data (varies by endpoint)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>message</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Optional human-readable success message</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"data-relationships-and-lifecycle\">Data Relationships and Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>Understanding how these data structures relate to each other reveals the complete picture of service discovery operations. The relationships between structures define the data flow and lifecycle management patterns that drive the entire system.</p>\n<p>Each <code>ServiceInstance</code> in the registry has a corresponding <code>HealthStatus</code> that tracks its current wellness state. This one-to-one relationship is maintained internally through the <code>RegistryEntry</code> structure, which acts as a container that keeps instance data and health information synchronized. When a service instance is registered, both the instance details and an initial health status are created together, ensuring they remain linked throughout the instance&#39;s lifetime.</p>\n<p>The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> maintains collections of these linked instance-health pairs, organized by service name for efficient lookup operations. The registry structure serves as the authoritative source of truth about which services exist and which instances are currently available. This centralized approach ensures consistency across all discovery operations while providing the single point of control needed for health checking and cleanup operations.</p>\n<p>Service instances progress through a well-defined lifecycle that&#39;s reflected in the data model. Upon registration, an instance starts with &quot;unknown&quot; health status until the first health check completes. Successful health checks transition the instance to &quot;healthy&quot; status, making it available for discovery queries. Failed health checks increment the failure count, and consecutive failures eventually transition the instance to &quot;unhealthy&quot; status, removing it from discovery results while keeping the registration record for potential recovery.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight here is that instance registration and health status are managed as a unified lifecycle—you cannot have healthy instances without registration, and you cannot have useful registrations without health tracking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p>The data model design involves several key architectural decisions that significantly impact system behavior, performance, and maintainability. Each decision represents a trade-off between different approaches, and understanding these choices helps explain why the system behaves as it does.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Embedded Health Status vs. Separate Health Store</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to track health status for each registered service instance, and we must decide whether to store health data alongside instance data or in a separate data structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Embedded health in RegistryEntry, separate health map indexed by instance ID, external health database</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Embed health status directly in RegistryEntry structure</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Co-locating instance and health data ensures atomic updates, simplifies lookup operations, and eliminates consistency issues between separate stores. The performance overhead is minimal since we access both pieces of data together in most operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables atomic health updates, simplifies concurrent access patterns, but increases memory usage per instance and couples health checking to registry storage.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Embedded health</td>\n<td>Atomic updates, simpler lookups, consistency guaranteed</td>\n<td>Higher memory usage, coupled storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Separate health map</td>\n<td>Lower memory per instance, flexible health backends</td>\n<td>Consistency challenges, complex updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>External health database</td>\n<td>Scalable storage, independent scaling</td>\n<td>Network overhead, eventual consistency</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Service Name as Primary Index vs. Instance ID</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The registry must support both service discovery (find instances by name) and health updates (update specific instances), requiring an indexing strategy that supports both access patterns efficiently.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Service name primary index with linear instance search, instance ID primary index with reverse name lookup, dual indexing with both approaches</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Service name as primary index with instance ID for secondary access</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Service discovery is the primary use case and must be optimized for performance. Health updates happen less frequently and can tolerate linear search within a service&#39;s instance list, which is typically small (under 100 instances per service).</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Fast service discovery lookups, simple data structure, but slower instance-specific operations and potential for duplicate instance handling.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service name primary</td>\n<td>Fast discovery, simple structure</td>\n<td>Slower instance updates</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instance ID primary</td>\n<td>Fast instance operations</td>\n<td>Slow discovery, complex structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dual indexing</td>\n<td>Fast both operations</td>\n<td>Memory overhead, consistency complexity</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Failure Count vs. Failure History</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Health checking needs to distinguish between transient failures and persistent problems, requiring a decision about how much failure history to maintain for each instance.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Simple failure counter, sliding window of recent checks, complete failure history with timestamps</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Simple failure counter with reset on success</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: A failure counter provides sufficient information to detect persistent failures while keeping memory usage constant. More complex history tracking adds little value since we only need to know &quot;is this instance consistently failing&quot; rather than detailed failure patterns.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables effective failure detection with minimal memory overhead, but loses information about failure patterns and recovery timing.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simple counter</td>\n<td>Low memory, easy logic</td>\n<td>Limited failure insight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sliding window</td>\n<td>Better failure patterns</td>\n<td>Higher memory, complex logic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complete history</td>\n<td>Full failure analysis</td>\n<td>Memory growth, processing overhead</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"data-validation-and-constraints\">Data Validation and Constraints</h3>\n<p>The data model enforces several validation rules and constraints that ensure system correctness and prevent common configuration errors. These constraints are checked at data creation time and help maintain registry integrity throughout system operation.</p>\n<p>Service instance validation ensures that all networking information is properly formatted and reachable. The service name must follow DNS-compatible naming conventions since it&#39;s used for discovery lookups that may integrate with DNS-based systems. Host addresses must be valid IP addresses or resolvable hostnames, and port numbers must fall within the valid TCP port range (1-65535). Health endpoint paths must be valid HTTP paths starting with a forward slash.</p>\n<p>Health status validation maintains consistency in status reporting and prevents invalid state transitions. The status field accepts only predefined values (&quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;unhealthy&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;) to ensure consistent interpretation across all system components. Failure counts must be non-negative integers, and timestamp fields must represent valid time values to prevent temporal inconsistencies in health tracking.</p>\n<p>Configuration validation prevents system misconfiguration that could lead to performance problems or operational failures. Health check intervals must be positive values to ensure checks actually occur, and timeouts must be shorter than intervals to prevent check backlog. The maximum failure threshold must be at least 1 to ensure that failures can actually trigger status changes, and TTL values must be longer than health check intervals to prevent premature instance expiration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memory-management-and-scaling-considerations\">Memory Management and Scaling Considerations</h3>\n<p>The data model&#39;s memory usage patterns directly impact system scalability and operational characteristics. Understanding these patterns helps operators plan capacity and detect potential memory issues before they impact system performance.</p>\n<p>Each service instance consumes a predictable amount of memory based on the string lengths in its service name, host address, tags, and health endpoint path. The base structure overhead is approximately 200-300 bytes per instance, with additional memory proportional to the total length of string fields. Tags have the highest variability in memory usage since they&#39;re user-defined and can vary significantly between deployments.</p>\n<p>Health status tracking adds minimal memory overhead per instance, consuming approximately 50-100 bytes for status strings, timestamps, and failure counters. The memory usage remains constant over time since we don&#39;t maintain failure history beyond the current failure count, making memory consumption predictable and bounded.</p>\n<p>The registry&#39;s memory usage scales linearly with the number of registered instances across all services. With typical instance metadata, the system can comfortably handle 10,000-50,000 service instances in memory on modern server hardware. Memory usage becomes a concern primarily in very large deployments or when instance metadata contains unusually long tag lists or host names.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A critical scaling insight is that memory usage per instance remains constant regardless of system age—we don&#39;t accumulate historical data that causes memory to grow over time, making the system&#39;s memory footprint predictable and stable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Understanding common mistakes in data model implementation helps avoid subtle bugs that can cause system-wide failures or performance degradation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mutable Shared Structures</strong>\nMany implementations accidentally share data structures between concurrent operations, leading to race conditions where one operation modifies data while another is reading it. This typically manifests as inconsistent service lists returned from discovery queries or health status updates being lost. The fix requires ensuring that all public API methods return deep copies of data structures rather than direct references to internal state, and that all internal modifications use proper synchronization.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Unbounded Tag Lists</strong>\nService instances with very large tag lists (hundreds of tags) can consume excessive memory and slow down registry operations. This often happens when automated systems generate tags containing detailed metadata or when unique identifiers are stored as tags rather than in dedicated fields. The solution involves validating tag list sizes during registration and providing guidance on appropriate tag usage patterns.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: String Interning Neglect</strong>\nService names and common tag values are often repeated across many instances, but storing them as separate strings wastes memory and reduces cache locality. For example, 1000 instances of &quot;user-service&quot; store the service name 1000 times instead of referencing a single string. Implementing string interning for common values can significantly reduce memory usage in large deployments.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Timestamp Precision Inconsistency</strong>\nMixing different timestamp precisions (seconds vs. milliseconds vs. nanoseconds) across the health checking system leads to incorrect timeout calculations and inconsistent health status updates. This typically manifests as health checks that timeout too quickly or too slowly. The fix requires standardizing on a single timestamp precision throughout the system and explicitly converting external timestamps to the internal format.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Instance Identity</strong>\nFailing to assign unique identifiers to service instances makes it impossible to distinguish between multiple instances of the same service running on the same host with different ports. This leads to registration conflicts and incorrect health status updates. The solution requires generating unique instance IDs during registration and using these IDs for all instance-specific operations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The data model implementation focuses on creating clean, thread-safe data structures that support the concurrent access patterns required by service discovery operations. The Go language provides excellent tools for building these structures with proper synchronization and memory management.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology

Error responses should be consistently formatted with clear error messages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-registry-core\">Service Registry Core</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (Service Registry) - This section covers the central component that handles service registration, deregistration, and lookup operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-hotel-reception-desk\">Mental Model: The Hotel Reception Desk</h3>\n<p>Before diving into technical details, let&#39;s build intuition about what the service registry core does by thinking of it like a hotel reception desk. When you arrive at a hotel, you approach the front desk to check in. The receptionist takes your information (name, room preferences, special requests), assigns you a room number, gives you a key card, and records your stay in their system. Throughout your stay, if someone calls asking for you, the receptionist can look up your room number and connect the call. When you check out, they remove your information from the active guest registry.</p>\n<p>The service registry core works exactly like this hotel reception system. When a service instance starts up, it &quot;checks in&quot; by registering itself with the registry, providing its name, network address (host and port), and any special attributes (tags). The registry assigns it a unique instance ID and records all this information. When other services need to find instances of a particular service type, they ask the registry to &quot;look up&quot; that service name, and the registry returns a list of all currently registered instances, just like a receptionist providing room numbers for guests. When a service shuts down or fails, it gets &quot;checked out&quot; of the registry, either explicitly through deregistration or automatically through health check failures.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps us understand the core responsibilities: <strong>accepting registrations</strong> (check-in), <strong>providing lookups</strong> (directory assistance), <strong>maintaining current state</strong> (guest registry), and <strong>handling departures</strong> (check-out). Just as a hotel reception desk must handle multiple guests simultaneously, our registry core must safely handle concurrent operations from many services registering, deregistering, and looking up other services at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fservice-lifecycle.svg\" alt=\"Service Instance State Machine\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"registry-interface\">Registry Interface</h3>\n<p>The service registry core exposes a clean interface that encapsulates all service management operations. This interface defines the contract between the registry and its clients (both internal components like the health checker and external clients via the HTTP API layer).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Register(instance ServiceInstance)</code></td>\n<td><code>instance</code>: Service metadata including name, host, port, tags</td>\n<td><code>string</code>: Unique instance ID for this registration</td>\n<td>Adds a new service instance to the registry with generated unique identifier and current timestamp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Deregister(instanceID string)</code></td>\n<td><code>instanceID</code>: Unique identifier returned during registration</td>\n<td><code>error</code>: nil on success, error if instance not found</td>\n<td>Removes the specified service instance from active registry and stops health checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Lookup(serviceName string)</code></td>\n<td><code>serviceName</code>: Name of service type to find</td>\n<td><code>ServiceList</code>: Container with healthy instances, counts, metadata</td>\n<td>Returns all currently healthy instances of the specified service name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetAllServices()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>map[string]ServiceList</code>: Map of service name to instance list</td>\n<td>Returns complete snapshot of all registered services and their healthy instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UpdateHealth(serviceName, instanceID string, status HealthStatus)</code></td>\n<td>Service name, instance ID, new health status object</td>\n<td><code>error</code>: nil on success, error if instance not found</td>\n<td>Updates health status for specified instance, used by health checker component</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetRegistryStats()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>RegistryStats</code>: Counts and metrics about registry state</td>\n<td>Returns statistics about total services, instances, health status distribution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Cleanup()</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>int</code>: Number of expired entries removed</td>\n<td>Removes expired registrations based on TTL and cleanup policy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The interface design follows several important principles. First, it uses <strong>value objects</strong> like <code>ServiceInstance</code> and <code>HealthStatus</code> to ensure data consistency and make the API self-documenting. Second, it separates <strong>read operations</strong> (<code>Lookup</code>, <code>GetAllServices</code>) from <strong>write operations</strong> (<code>Register</code>, <code>Deregister</code>, <code>UpdateHealth</code>) to enable different concurrency patterns. Third, it returns <strong>structured data</strong> rather than raw maps or slices, making it easier for callers to handle the results correctly.</p>\n<p>The <code>Register</code> method returns a unique instance ID that becomes the handle for all future operations on that specific instance. This design choice is crucial because it allows multiple instances of the same service to run on the same host (perhaps on different ports) while maintaining distinct identities. The instance ID also provides a stable identifier even if service metadata changes.</p>\n<p>The <code>Lookup</code> method intentionally returns only healthy instances, implementing the core service discovery principle that clients should never receive references to services that cannot handle requests. The health filtering happens transparently within the registry, so clients don&#39;t need to understand health status details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-algorithms\">Core Algorithms</h3>\n<p>The service registry core implements three fundamental algorithms that handle the primary use cases: registration, deregistration, and lookup. Each algorithm must handle concurrent access safely while maintaining data consistency.</p>\n<h4 id=\"service-registration-algorithm\">Service Registration Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The registration process creates a new registry entry and initializes health checking for the instance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Generate unique instance ID</strong> using a combination of timestamp, service name, and random component to ensure global uniqueness across all registrations</li>\n<li><strong>Validate service instance data</strong> by checking required fields (name, host, port), validating host format and port range, and ensuring service name follows naming conventions</li>\n<li><strong>Acquire write lock</strong> on the registry&#39;s service map to ensure exclusive access during the modification operation</li>\n<li><strong>Check for duplicate registration</strong> by examining existing entries for the same service name and looking for identical host-port combinations within that service</li>\n<li><strong>Create registry entry</strong> with the validated service instance, initial health status set to &quot;unknown&quot;, current registration timestamp, and generated instance ID</li>\n<li><strong>Store entry in registry</strong> by adding it to the services map under the appropriate service name, creating the service name key if this is the first instance</li>\n<li><strong>Release write lock</strong> to allow other operations to proceed</li>\n<li><strong>Initialize health checking</strong> by scheduling the first health check for this instance and adding it to the health checker&#39;s monitoring list</li>\n<li><strong>Log registration event</strong> with service name, instance ID, and network address for debugging and auditing purposes</li>\n<li><strong>Return instance ID</strong> to the caller for use in future deregistration or update operations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The registration algorithm includes important safety checks. Duplicate detection prevents the same service instance from being registered multiple times, which could lead to double health checking or incorrect instance counts. The validation step catches configuration errors early before they can cause runtime problems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"service-deregistration-algorithm\">Service Deregistration Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The deregistration process removes an instance from active service and cleans up associated resources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Validate instance ID format</strong> to ensure it matches the expected structure and hasn&#39;t been corrupted</li>\n<li><strong>Acquire write lock</strong> on the registry&#39;s service map to prevent concurrent modifications during removal</li>\n<li><strong>Locate registry entry</strong> by searching through service name maps to find the entry with matching instance ID</li>\n<li><strong>Verify entry exists</strong> and return appropriate error if the instance ID is not found in the registry</li>\n<li><strong>Remove entry from services map</strong> and clean up the service name key if this was the last instance of that service type</li>\n<li><strong>Release write lock</strong> to restore concurrent access for other operations</li>\n<li><strong>Stop health checking</strong> by removing this instance from the health checker&#39;s monitoring schedule</li>\n<li><strong>Log deregistration event</strong> with service name, instance ID, and reason for removal (explicit vs. health failure)</li>\n<li><strong>Update registry statistics</strong> to reflect the reduced instance count and service availability</li>\n<li><strong>Return success confirmation</strong> to indicate the deregistration completed successfully</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The deregistration algorithm handles both explicit deregistration (when services shut down cleanly) and implicit deregistration (when health checks detect failures). The cleanup step is important for preventing memory leaks in long-running registry instances.</p>\n<h4 id=\"service-lookup-algorithm\">Service Lookup Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The lookup process finds healthy instances of a requested service and returns them in a client-friendly format:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Acquire read lock</strong> on the registry&#39;s service map to ensure consistent view of data during the lookup operation</li>\n<li><strong>Check if service name exists</strong> in the registry and return empty result if no instances have ever been registered for this service</li>\n<li><strong>Retrieve all instances</strong> for the requested service name from the services map</li>\n<li><strong>Filter for healthy instances</strong> by examining the health status of each registered instance and including only those marked as healthy</li>\n<li><strong>Sort instances by health score</strong> to provide deterministic ordering and potentially prioritize recently healthy instances</li>\n<li><strong>Release read lock</strong> to allow concurrent access to resume</li>\n<li><strong>Build service list response</strong> with healthy instances, total instance count, healthy instance count, and service metadata</li>\n<li><strong>Log lookup operation</strong> with service name, number of instances found, and requesting client information for observability</li>\n<li><strong>Return service list</strong> containing the filtered and formatted results</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The lookup algorithm implements <strong>read-preferring locking</strong> to allow multiple concurrent lookups while still providing consistency. The health filtering is the critical step that ensures clients only receive references to services that can actually handle requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fconcurrent-access.svg\" alt=\"Concurrent Registry Access\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p>The service registry core involves several critical design decisions that affect performance, correctness, and operational characteristics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Instance Identity and Uniqueness</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Services may start multiple instances on the same host, restart with different configurations, or run in containers with dynamic addresses. The registry needs a way to uniquely identify each service instance across these scenarios.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Host-port combination as ID, service-generated UUIDs, registry-generated sequential IDs, registry-generated composite IDs</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Registry-generated composite IDs combining timestamp, service name hash, and random component</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Host-port combinations fail when services restart on the same address. Service-generated UUIDs require coordination and may collide. Sequential IDs don&#39;t provide enough entropy.

Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid them during initial development and debugging.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Registration</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is not properly synchronizing access to the registry&#39;s internal data structures during registration. This often manifests as corrupted service lists, duplicate entries, or panics when multiple services register simultaneously. The issue occurs because developers assume registration is infrequent and don&#39;t consider concurrent access patterns.</p>\n<p>The problem becomes visible when running load tests or during startup scenarios where many services register simultaneously. Symptoms include inconsistent service counts, missing registrations, or runtime panics with map access violations.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Always acquire appropriate locks before modifying shared data structures. Use read-write mutexes to allow concurrent reads while protecting writes. Ensure lock granularity matches your consistency requirements.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Failed Deregistrations</strong></p>\n<p>Services that crash or lose network connectivity cannot perform explicit deregistration, leading to stale entries accumulating in the registry over time. Without proper cleanup mechanisms, the registry&#39;s memory usage grows unbounded, eventually causing performance degradation or crashes.</p>\n<p>This pitfall is particularly dangerous because it manifests slowly in production. Early testing with clean shutdowns won&#39;t reveal the issue, but long-running deployments with occasional service failures will experience gradual memory growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement TTL-based cleanup for all registrations. Run periodic background cleanup processes. Combine health check failures with automatic deregistration. Set reasonable upper bounds on registry size.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Health State During Updates</strong></p>\n<p>When the health checker updates instance health status, there&#39;s a window where lookup operations might see inconsistent data. For example, a lookup might return an instance that failed health checks but hasn&#39;t been removed yet, or miss an instance that just became healthy.</p>\n<p>This inconsistency can cause cascading failures where clients receive references to unhealthy services, leading to request timeouts and retry storms. The problem is particularly acute during network partitions or service deployment scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use atomic updates for health status changes. Design the health update process to be idempotent. Consider implementing eventual consistency patterns where appropriate, and ensure clients have proper timeout and retry logic.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Critical Paths</strong></p>\n<p>Registry operations that perform I/O, network calls, or expensive computations while holding locks can create severe performance bottlenecks. This commonly happens when developers add logging, metrics collection, or validation that makes external calls within locked sections.</p>\n<p>The symptom is high latency for all registry operations, even simple lookups, because operations queue behind slow critical sections. This can make the entire service discovery system unresponsive.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Minimize work performed while holding locks. Move expensive operations outside critical sections. Use asynchronous patterns for non-essential operations like logging and metrics. Profile lock contention regularly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Input Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to properly validate service registration data can lead to runtime errors, injection attacks, or data corruption. Common validation failures include accepting malformed hostnames, invalid port numbers, excessively long service names, or special characters that break downstream systems.</p>\n<p>These issues often surface when integrating with external systems or during security audits. Invalid data can propagate through the system, causing failures far from the original input point.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement comprehensive input validation for all registry operations. Validate hostname formats, port ranges, string lengths, and character sets. Sanitize input data and provide clear error messages for validation failures. Consider using schema validation libraries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides concrete technical recommendations and starter code for implementing the service registry core.

Checker</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 2 (Health Checking) - This section covers the background component that monitors service health and automatically removes failed instances from the registry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-security-guard-rounds\">Mental Model: The Security Guard Rounds</h3>\n<p>Think of the health checker as a security guard making regular rounds through an office building. Just as a security guard walks predetermined routes at scheduled intervals, checking that all doors are locked, lights are working, and areas are secure, the health checker periodically visits each registered service to verify it&#39;s still responding and functioning properly.</p>\n<p>When the security guard discovers a problem during rounds—perhaps a door is unlocked that should be locked, or a light has burned out—they take note and report it to building management. Similarly, when the health checker detects that a service isn&#39;t responding or is returning error responses, it records the failure and updates the registry to mark that instance as unhealthy.</p>\n<p>The security guard doesn&#39;t immediately sound an alarm after finding one small issue—they understand that temporary problems happen. Maybe someone just stepped out and forgot to lock their office door, or a light bulb chose that exact moment to fail. Instead, the guard makes note of the issue and checks again on the next round. Only after seeing the same problem persist across multiple rounds does the guard escalate it as a genuine security concern.</p>\n<p>This mirrors how the health checker handles service failures. A single failed health check doesn&#39;t immediately remove a service from the registry—networks have temporary hiccups, services might be momentarily overloaded, or a garbage collection pause might cause a timeout. The health checker maintains a <strong>failure count</strong> for each service instance and only marks it as unhealthy after seeing consecutive failures that exceed a configurable threshold.</p>\n<p>The security guard also adapts their rounds based on the building&#39;s needs. High-security areas might get checked more frequently than storage closets. Critical systems require more attention than auxiliary services. Similarly, the health checker allows different services to configure their own check intervals and failure thresholds based on their criticality and expected response patterns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight is that health checking is fundamentally about distinguishing between temporary service hiccups and genuine failures that require removing the service from active duty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"health-checker-interface\">Health Checker Interface</h3>\n<p>The health checker component exposes a well-defined interface that separates the concerns of health monitoring from the core registry operations. This interface defines the contract between the health checker and both the registry core and the external services it monitors.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>StartHealthChecker</code></td>\n<td><code>registry *ServiceRegistry</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Initializes and starts the background health checking process for all registered services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>StopHealthChecker</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Gracefully shuts down health checking, completing in-flight checks before stopping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CheckServiceHealth</code></td>\n<td><code>instance ServiceInstance</code></td>\n<td><code>HealthStatus, error</code></td>\n<td>Performs a single health check against the specified service instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UpdateCheckInterval</code></td>\n<td><code>serviceName string, interval time.Duration</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Modifies the health check frequency for a specific service type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GetHealthStats</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>HealthStats</code></td>\n<td>Returns aggregate health statistics across all monitored services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConfigureHealthCheck</code></td>\n<td><code>serviceName string, config HealthCheckConfig</code></td>\n<td><code>error</code></td>\n<td>Updates health check configuration for a specific service type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The interface design follows the principle of <strong>separation of concerns</strong>—the health checker focuses solely on monitoring and updating health status, while the registry core maintains the authoritative service data and handles lookups. This separation allows the health checker to operate as an independent background process without blocking registry operations.</p>\n<p>The <code>CheckServiceHealth</code> method performs the actual health verification logic and returns a <code>HealthStatus</code> struct that encapsulates both the current health state and metadata about the check itself:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Status</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Current health state: &quot;healthy&quot;, &quot;unhealthy&quot;, or &quot;unknown&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastCheck</code></td>\n<td><code>time.Time</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp of the most recent health check attempt</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>FailureCount</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Number of consecutive failed health checks for this instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ResponseTime</code></td>\n<td><code>time.Duration</code></td>\n<td>How long the most recent health check took to complete</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>LastError</code></td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Error message from the most recent failed check, empty if healthy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health checker maintains its own internal state to track check schedules and failure counts, but it delegates all registry updates to the registry core through well-defined callback methods. This ensures that the registry remains the single source of truth for service data while allowing the health checker to operate independently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"health-check-algorithms\">Health Check Algorithms</h3>\n<p>The health checker operates through several coordinated algorithms that handle different aspects of the health monitoring process. These algorithms work together to provide reliable failure detection while minimizing false positives from temporary network issues.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-check-scheduling-algorithm\">Health Check Scheduling Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The scheduling algorithm determines when to perform health checks for each registered service. Rather than checking all services simultaneously, which could create network congestion and registry contention, the scheduler spreads checks across time to ensure smooth operation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Initialize check schedule</strong>: When a new service registers, calculate its first check time by adding the configured <code>HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL</code> to the current time, plus a random jitter of up to 30 seconds to prevent thundering herd effects.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Maintain priority queue</strong>: Store all pending health checks in a time-ordered priority queue, with the next check time as the priority. This allows efficient retrieval of the next service that needs checking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Background scheduler loop</strong>: Run a continuous background goroutine that sleeps until the next scheduled check time, then wakes up to process due health checks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Batch processing</strong>: When multiple checks become due simultaneously (within a 1-second window), group them into batches and process them concurrently to improve throughput.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Reschedule after completion</strong>: After completing a health check, calculate the next check time based on the service&#39;s configured interval and add it back to the priority queue.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Handle registration changes</strong>: When a service deregisters, remove all its pending health checks from the schedule. When a service&#39;s check interval changes, update its next scheduled time accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The scheduling algorithm ensures that health checks are distributed evenly across time, preventing resource spikes while maintaining responsiveness to service failures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-check-execution-algorithm\">Health Check Execution Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The execution algorithm handles the actual process of checking a service&#39;s health and interpreting the results. This algorithm must handle various failure modes gracefully while distinguishing between different types of problems.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Prepare health check request</strong>: Construct an HTTP GET request to the service&#39;s health endpoint, typically <code>http://{host}:{port}/health</code>. Set appropriate timeout values based on the service&#39;s configured <code>HealthTimeout</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Execute request with timeout</strong>: Send the HTTP request using a context with deadline to ensure the check doesn&#39;t hang indefinitely. The timeout should be shorter than the check interval to prevent overlapping checks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Interpret response status</strong>: Evaluate the HTTP response according to standard health check conventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Status codes 200-299: Service is healthy</li>\n<li>Status codes 400-499: Service is unhealthy (client errors indicate service problems)</li>\n<li>Status codes 500-599: Service is unhealthy (server errors indicate service failures)</li>\n<li>Network timeouts or connection refused: Service is unhealthy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Parse response body</strong>: If the response includes a JSON body, parse it to extract additional health information such as dependency status, resource utilization, or detailed error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Calculate response metrics</strong>: Record the total response time and any relevant performance metrics that could indicate service degradation even when the service reports healthy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Handle check failures</strong>: When a health check fails, increment the service instance&#39;s failure count and record the error details. If the failure count exceeds the configured <code>MaxFailures</code> threshold, mark the instance as unhealthy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Handle check successes</strong>: When a health check succeeds, reset the failure count to zero and ensure the instance is marked as healthy in the registry.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The execution algorithm focuses on reliability and clear failure detection while providing detailed information for debugging when services become unhealthy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"registry-update-algorithm\">Registry Update Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The registry update algorithm handles the process of applying health check results to the service registry state. This algorithm must coordinate carefully with the registry core to ensure consistency and avoid race conditions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Acquire instance lock</strong>: Before updating health status, acquire a lock on the specific service instance to prevent concurrent modifications from registration/deregistration operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Validate instance still exists</strong>: Verify that the service instance still exists in the registry—it might have been deregistered while the health check was in progress.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Update health status fields</strong>: Apply the new health status information to the registry entry, including the check timestamp, failure count, and status.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Evaluate unhealthy threshold</strong>: If the failure count equals or exceeds <code>MaxFailures</code>, transition the instance from healthy to unhealthy status and remove it from active service lookups.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Evaluate recovery threshold</strong>: If an unhealthy instance succeeds a health check, immediately transition it back to healthy status and make it available for service lookups again.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Update registry statistics</strong>: Increment aggregate counters for total checks performed, current healthy/unhealthy counts, and average response times.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Release instance lock</strong>: Free the lock to allow other operations to proceed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Notify watchers</strong>: If the registry supports change notifications, emit events for health status changes that other components might need to react to.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The registry update algorithm ensures that health status changes are applied atomically and consistently, maintaining registry integrity even under concurrent access.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fhealth-check-flow.svg\" alt=\"Health Check Process Flow\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fservice-lifecycle.svg\" alt=\"Service Instance State Machine\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p>The health checker design involves several critical architectural decisions that significantly impact system behavior and reliability.

TCP checks only verify network connectivity without application-level health. Multi-protocol support adds significant complexity without clear immediate benefit.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables detailed health status reporting through HTTP response codes and JSON bodies.

When the health checker loses network connectivity to a cluster of services, it shouldn&#39;t immediately mark them all as unhealthy—this could cause cascading failures where healthy services become unavailable due to network issues rather than actual service problems.</p>\n<p>The issue occurs when the health checker runs from a single location and experiences network connectivity problems. For example, if the health checker is deployed in one availability zone and loses connectivity to services in another zone, it might incorrectly mark all those services as failed even though they&#39;re healthy and serving traffic from other clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement partition detection by monitoring the failure rate across all services. If more than a threshold percentage (e.g., 50%) of services fail simultaneously, treat this as a potential network partition and either pause health checking or mark the health checker itself as degraded rather than mass-deregistering services.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Timeout Too Short</strong></p>\n<p>Setting health check timeouts too aggressively can cause false failures when services experience temporary load spikes or garbage collection pauses. A common mistake is setting timeouts to very small values (e.g., 100ms) that don&#39;t account for normal operational variance in service response times.</p>\n<p>This becomes particularly problematic for services that might experience periodic background processing, garbage collection in managed languages, or brief CPU contention during normal operation. These temporary slowdowns don&#39;t indicate genuine service health problems but will trigger timeout failures if the health check timeout is too strict.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Set health check timeouts to be 2-3x the typical response time of the service&#39;s health endpoint under normal load. Monitor actual health check response times and adjust timeouts based on observed P95 or P99 latencies rather than average response times.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cascading Health Check Failures</strong></p>\n<p>A subtle issue occurs when health checks themselves consume significant resources on target services, and increased check frequency during failure scenarios overwhelms already-struggling services. This creates a positive feedback loop where service degradation triggers more frequent health checks, which consume more resources, leading to further degradation.</p>\n<p>This problem is especially severe when multiple health checkers monitor the same services (e.g., during rolling deployments or in multi-region setups), or when services implement expensive health check logic that queries databases or external dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Implement health check backoff for failing services rather than increasing frequency. Design health endpoints to be lightweight and avoid expensive operations like database queries. Consider implementing health check rate limiting on services to prevent overwhelming them during degradation scenarios.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Health Status Updates</strong></p>\n<p>Concurrent health checks and service registration/deregistration can create race conditions where health status updates apply to the wrong service instance or overwrite newer registration information. This often manifests as services that appear to flap between healthy and unhealthy states, or healthy services that get stuck in unhealthy status.</p>\n<p>The issue typically occurs when a service deregisters and re-registers quickly (e.g., during a rolling deployment) while health checks for the old instance are still in flight. The delayed health check update might apply to the new instance, incorrectly marking it as failed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use instance-specific identifiers that include registration timestamps or UUIDs to ensure health updates only apply to the correct service instance. Implement proper locking around health status updates and validate that the target instance still exists and matches before applying updates.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Health Check Resource Leaks</strong></p>\n<p>Failing to properly clean up resources from health check operations can lead to gradual resource exhaustion, especially in systems that monitor large numbers of services. Common leaks include unclosed HTTP connections, goroutines that don&#39;t terminate cleanly, or accumulating timeout contexts that don&#39;t get canceled.</p>\n<p>This problem often goes unnoticed during development with small numbers of services but becomes critical in production environments with hundreds or thousands of service instances being monitored continuously.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Use connection pooling for HTTP clients, implement proper context cancellation for timeout handling, and ensure goroutines have clear termination conditions. Add resource monitoring to track open connections, goroutines, and memory usage of the health checker component.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The health checker implementation requires careful coordination between background processing, HTTP client management, and registry integration.

id=\"http-api-layer\">HTTP API Layer</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 3 (HTTP API) - This section covers the REST API that exposes service registry operations over HTTP, building on the registry core (Milestone 1) and health checker (Milestone 2) to provide external access to service discovery functionality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-information-desk\">Mental Model: The Information Desk</h3>\n<p>Understanding the HTTP API layer becomes intuitive when you think of it as an <strong>information desk</strong> at a large corporate building or conference center. Just as visitors approach the information desk to find departments, get directions, or register for events, services and clients interact with our HTTP API to register themselves, discover other services, and check system health.</p>\n<p>The information desk receptionist doesn&#39;t actually store the building directory or manage the departments themselves - they have access to the building&#39;s central directory system (our registry core) and can check with security about which departments are currently operational (our health checker). The receptionist&#39;s job is to translate visitor requests into the right format, query the appropriate systems, and present the information in a way visitors can understand and use.</p>\n<p>Similarly, our HTTP API layer serves as the <strong>interface translator</strong> between external clients and our internal registry system. It accepts HTTP requests in standardized formats, validates the input (just as a receptionist might verify visitor credentials), translates the requests into internal operations, executes them against the registry core, and formats the responses back into HTTP-friendly JSON.</p>\n<p>The information desk analogy also highlights the <strong>stateless nature</strong> of our API - each visitor interaction is independent. The receptionist doesn&#39;t remember previous conversations with visitors, but can quickly look up any information needed from the central systems. This stateless design ensures our API can handle many concurrent requests efficiently and scale horizontally by adding more API servers behind a load balancer.</p>\n<p>Just as an information desk provides standardized procedures for common requests (registration forms, visitor badges, direction cards), our HTTP API provides <strong>consistent REST endpoints</strong> with predictable request/response formats. This consistency allows different types of clients - whether they&#39;re microservices registering themselves, load balancers looking up healthy instances, or monitoring tools checking system health - to interact with the service discovery system in a uniform way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"api-endpoints\">API Endpoints</h3>\n<p>The HTTP API exposes service registry operations through a carefully designed REST interface. Each endpoint serves a specific purpose in the service discovery workflow, from initial registration through ongoing health monitoring to final deregistration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fregistration-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Service Registration Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The API design follows REST principles with clear resource hierarchies and appropriate HTTP methods.

Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid production issues and provides better developer experience.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Insufficient Input Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations perform minimal validation on incoming requests, leading to data corruption, system crashes, or security vulnerabilities. For example, accepting empty service names allows invalid registrations that break lookup operations, while missing host validation can result in unreachable service instances being registered.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Invalid data in the registry corrupts the service discovery system. Services trying to connect to malformed addresses will fail, and empty names make services undiscoverable.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Implement comprehensive validation for every field. Service names should match naming conventions (alphanumeric plus hyphens), hosts should be valid IP addresses or hostnames, ports should be in valid ranges (1-65535), and health endpoints should be proper HTTP paths starting with &#39;/&#39;.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Responses</strong></p>\n<p>Different endpoints returning different error formats makes client error handling complex and unreliable. Some endpoints might return plain text errors, others JSON objects with different field names, leading to brittle client code that can&#39;t handle errors consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Clients need to implement multiple error parsing strategies, increasing complexity and bug potential. Inconsistent errors also make debugging and logging more difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use the standardized <code>ErrorResponse</code> format for all error conditions. Create helper functions like <code>WriteErrorResponse</code> that enforce consistent formatting. Document all possible error codes and ensure they&#39;re used consistently across endpoints.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions with Concurrent Requests</strong></p>\n<p>Multiple simultaneous requests can create race conditions, especially during registration and deregistration operations. For example, two services registering with the same name simultaneously might interfere with each other, or a deregistration might happen while a health check is updating the same instance.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Race conditions can corrupt registry state, cause instances to disappear unexpectedly, or create inconsistent health status. These issues are often intermittent and difficult to debug.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Ensure the registry core handles concurrent access properly with appropriate locking. Design API operations to be atomic - either they succeed completely or fail completely with no partial state changes.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Content-Type Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Accepting requests without validating the Content-Type header can lead to parsing errors or security issues. For example, accepting <code>text/plain</code> data when expecting JSON can cause unmarshaling failures that crash the handler.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Malformed requests can crash handlers, and missing content-type validation can be exploited for injection attacks or DOS scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Validate that POST requests include <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> header. Reject requests with missing or incorrect content types using HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Error Status Codes</strong></p>\n<p>Using generic HTTP 500 errors for all failures provides no guidance to clients about whether requests should be retried, what went wrong, or how to fix problems. This makes debugging difficult and prevents intelligent client retry logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Clients can&#39;t distinguish between retryable errors (network issues) and permanent errors (validation failures), leading to unnecessary retries or missing legitimate retry opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Use appropriate HTTP status codes: 400 for validation errors, 404 for not found, 409 for conflicts, 429 for rate limiting, 500 only for unexpected internal errors. Include detailed error information in the response body.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Request Handlers</strong></p>\n<p>Performing long-running operations like health checks directly in HTTP request handlers can cause request timeouts and poor user experience. For example, triggering an immediate health check during registration blocks the response until the check completes.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: HTTP clients expect reasonably fast responses. Blocking operations can cause timeouts, especially when network latency to health endpoints is high.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Keep request handlers fast by deferring expensive operations to background processes. Registration should return immediately after storing the instance, with health checking happening asynchronously.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The HTTP API layer requires careful integration of HTTP server components, request routing, input validation, and response formatting. The implementation should prioritize reliability, performance, and ease of maintenance while providing a developer-friendly interface.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology Recommendations</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP Server</td>\n<td><code>net/http</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>gin-gonic/gin</code> or <code>gorilla/mux</code> framework</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>JSON Handling</td>\n<td><code>encoding/json</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>json-iterator/go</code> for performance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Validation</td>\n<td>Manual validation with helper functions</td>\n<td><code>go-playground/validator</code> struct tags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Logging</td>\n<td><code>log</code> standard library</td>\n<td><code>logrus</code> or <code>zap</code> structured logging</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Middleware</td>\n<td>Custom middleware functions</td>\n<td>Framework-provided middleware stack</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The standard library approach provides excellent learning value and minimal dependencies, while the framework approach offers more convenience and advanced features for production use.</p>\n<h4 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h4>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>internal/api/\n  server.go              ← HTTP server setup and configuration\n  handlers.go           ← Request handler functions\n  middleware.go         ← Authentication, logging, CORS middleware\n  validation.go         ← Input validation helper functions\n  responses.go          ← Response formatting utilities\n  routes.go             ← Route definitions and URL patterns\n  server_test.go        ← Integration tests for HTTP endpoints\n  handlers_test.go      ← Unit tests for individual handlers</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This structure separates concerns clearly: server setup, request handling, validation, and response formatting each have dedicated files.

Tips</h4>\n<p><strong>HTTP Server Management:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>http.Server</code> struct with explicit timeouts to prevent resource leaks</li>\n<li>Implement graceful shutdown using <code>Shutdown(ctx)</code> method with context timeout</li>\n<li>Set reasonable <code>ReadTimeout</code> and <code>WriteTimeout</code> to prevent slow client attacks</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>JSON Handling:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode()</code> for request parsing to handle large payloads efficiently</li>\n<li>Always set <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> header before encoding responses</li>\n<li>Handle JSON marshaling errors gracefully - they indicate internal data corruption</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Error Handling:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distinguish between client errors (4xx) and server errors (5xx) consistently</li>\n<li>Log internal errors but don&#39;t expose internal details to clients</li>\n<li>Use structured error responses to enable programmatic error handling</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Concurrent Access:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The registry core handles concurrency, but ensure handler functions don&#39;t hold locks</li>\n<li>Keep handlers stateless - don&#39;t store request data in handler structs</li>\n<li>Use context values for request-scoped data like request IDs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-checkpoint\">Milestone Checkpoint</h4>\n<p>After implementing the HTTP API layer, verify functionality with these checkpoints:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Registration

id=\"interactions-and-data-flow\">Interactions and Data Flow</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This section shows how the components from service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API (Milestone 3) work together to create a complete service discovery system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Understanding how the three main components of our service discovery system interact is crucial for building a system that works reliably in production. While each component has distinct responsibilities, they must coordinate seamlessly to maintain an accurate, real-time view of service health across a distributed system. This section examines the key workflows that demonstrate these interactions: how services join the registry, how clients discover healthy services, and how the system continuously monitors and updates service health status.</p>\n<p>The interactions between components follow well-defined patterns that ensure data consistency and system reliability. The registry core serves as the central authority for all service data, while the health checker operates as a background process that continuously validates service availability. The HTTP API layer acts as the interface between external services and the internal components, translating REST requests into registry operations and health status queries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"service-registration-flow\">Service Registration Flow</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fregistration-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Service Registration Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The service registration flow represents the first interaction a new service has with the discovery system. This workflow establishes the service&#39;s identity, configures health monitoring, and makes the service available for discovery by other clients. Understanding this flow is essential because it sets up all the data structures and monitoring processes that will govern the service&#39;s lifecycle within the registry.</p>\n<p>When a service starts up and wants to announce its availability, it initiates a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations that span all three components of the system. The process begins with an HTTP request to the API layer, flows through the registry core for data storage and validation, and culminates with the health checker beginning continuous monitoring of the new service instance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"initial-registration-request\">Initial Registration Request</h4>\n<p>The registration process starts when a service sends an HTTP POST request to the <code>/services</code> endpoint. This request contains all the essential metadata that other services will need to communicate with the registering service. The HTTP API layer receives this request and immediately begins a series of validation and processing steps.</p>\n<p>The API layer first extracts the service instance data from the JSON request body, parsing fields like service name, host, port, health endpoint, and any associated tags or metadata. This raw data undergoes comprehensive validation to ensure it meets all system requirements and constraints. The validation process checks for required fields, validates network addresses and port ranges, ensures the health endpoint URL is well-formed, and verifies that any provided tags conform to naming conventions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Check</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Criteria</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Required Fields</td>\n<td>Name, Host, Port</td>\n<td>Must be present and non-empty</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Missing required field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Host Format</td>\n<td>Host</td>\n<td>Valid hostname or IP address</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid host format</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Port Range</td>\n<td>Port</td>\n<td>Integer between 1-65535</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid port range</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Endpoint</td>\n<td>HealthEndpoint</td>\n<td>Valid HTTP URL path</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid health endpoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Name</td>\n<td>Name</td>\n<td>Alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid service name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tags Format</td>\n<td>Tags</td>\n<td>Array of valid tag strings</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid tag format</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"registry-core-processing\">Registry Core Processing</h4>\n<p>Once validation succeeds, the API layer calls the registry core&#39;s <code>Register(instance)</code> method, passing the validated <code>ServiceInstance</code> structure. The registry core takes ownership of the registration process at this point, handling all the complex logic around instance identity, duplicate detection, and data storage.</p>\n<p>The registry core first generates a unique instance identifier for the new service registration. This identifier serves as the primary key for all future operations involving this specific service instance. The generation process combines the service name, host, and port with a timestamp and random component to ensure uniqueness even when services restart quickly or register multiple times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Instance Identity Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need unique identifiers for service instances that can handle rapid restarts and duplicate registrations</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Service-provided IDs (services generate their own identifiers)</li>\n<li>Host-port combinations (use network address as identifier)</li>\n<li>Registry-generated UUIDs (system creates unique identifiers)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Registry-generated UUIDs with deterministic fallback</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Registry-generated IDs prevent collisions and handle edge cases like rapid restarts, while deterministic fallback based on host-port ensures consistency for services that restart quickly</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Eliminates ID collision issues but requires registry to track more metadata; enables robust duplicate detection</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The registry core then checks for existing registrations that might conflict with the new instance. This duplicate detection process examines both exact matches (same host and port) and potential conflicts (same service name but different metadata). When an exact match is found, the registry updates the existing entry rather than creating a duplicate, ensuring the system maintains a clean view of service instances.</p>\n<h4 id=\"data-structure-creation-and-storage\">Data Structure Creation and Storage</h4>\n<p>With a unique instance ID established, the registry core creates the complete data structures that will represent this service throughout its lifecycle. The process begins with creating a <code>RegistryEntry</code> that combines the service instance metadata with health status tracking and registration timestamps.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Registry Entry Component</th>\n<th>Initial Value</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Instance</td>\n<td>Provided ServiceInstance data</td>\n<td>Service metadata and connection information</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health</td>\n<td>Uninitialized HealthStatus</td>\n<td>Placeholder for health monitoring data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RegisteredAt</td>\n<td>Current timestamp</td>\n<td>Track registration time for TTL calculations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>InstanceID</td>\n<td>Generated unique identifier</td>\n<td>Primary key for all registry operations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>HealthStatus</code> structure within the registry entry starts in an uninitialized state, with status set to &quot;unknown&quot; and all timing fields set to zero values. This reflects the fact that no health checks have been performed yet, and the service&#39;s actual availability is unknown until the first health check completes.</p>\n<p>The registry core stores this new entry in its internal data structures, typically using the instance ID as the primary key and maintaining secondary indexes by service name for efficient lookup operations. The storage operation must be thread-safe since multiple services might register simultaneously, requiring careful synchronization to prevent data corruption.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-check-initialization\">Health Check Initialization</h4>\n<p>After successful storage in the registry core, the registration process triggers initialization of health monitoring for the new service instance. The registry core notifies the health checker component about the new service through the <code>ScheduleHealthCheck(instanceID, instance)</code> method call.</p>\n<p>The health checker receives this notification and creates a <code>ScheduledCheck</code> entry for the new service instance. This entry defines when the first health check should occur, what interval should be used for subsequent checks, and how many consecutive failures are allowed before marking the service as unhealthy.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scheduled Check Field</th>\n<th>Initial Value</th>\n<th>Calculation Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>InstanceID</td>\n<td>From registration</td>\n<td>Direct copy from registry entry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ServiceName</td>\n<td>From ServiceInstance</td>\n<td>Used for service-specific health policies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NextCheck</td>\n<td>Current time + initial delay</td>\n<td>Prevents thundering herd on startup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interval</td>\n<td>From Config.HealthCheckInterval</td>\n<td>Default interval, may be service-specific</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FailureCount</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>No failures recorded yet</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health checker schedules the first health check with a small random delay to prevent all services from being checked simultaneously if many register at once. This jittering technique helps distribute the health check load and prevents system overload during bulk service registrations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"response-generation-and-client-notification\">Response Generation and Client Notification</h4>\n<p>With all internal processing complete, the registration flow concludes by generating a response to the original HTTP client. The API layer constructs a success response that includes the generated instance ID and confirmation of successful registration.</p>\n<p>The response follows the standard <code>SuccessResponse</code> format, providing the client with all information needed to manage its registration lifecycle. Most importantly, the response includes the instance ID that the service must use for any future deregistration requests.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Field</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>success</td>\n<td>true</td>\n<td>Indicates successful registration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>data.instanceID</td>\n<td>Generated unique ID</td>\n<td>Required for future deregistration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>data.healthEndpoint</td>\n<td>Confirmed health endpoint</td>\n<td>Shows what will be monitored</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>data.nextHealthCheck</td>\n<td>Estimated first check time</td>\n<td>When monitoring begins</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>message</td>\n<td>&quot;Service registered successfully&quot;</td>\n<td>Human-readable confirmation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"common-registration-edge-cases\">Common Registration Edge Cases</h4>\n<p>The registration flow must handle several edge cases that commonly occur in distributed systems. These scenarios require careful consideration to ensure the system behaves predictably and recovers gracefully from unusual conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Rapid Re-registration</strong>: When a service restarts quickly and attempts to register before its previous registration has been cleaned up, the system must detect this scenario and update the existing entry rather than creating a duplicate. The registry core uses the host-port combination to identify potential duplicates and merges the new registration data with any existing health history that might be relevant.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Failures</strong>: If the registration process fails after storing the service in the registry but before initializing health checks, the system must ensure consistency. The registry implements compensation logic that can detect and repair these partial states during the next cleanup cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Issues During Registration</strong>: When network problems cause the registration HTTP request to fail or timeout, services must implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff. The registry API is designed to be idempotent, so repeated registration requests with the same service data will not create duplicate entries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"service-lookup-flow\">Service Lookup Flow</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Flookup-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Service Discovery Sequence\"></p>\n<p>The service lookup flow represents how clients discover and retrieve information about available service instances. This workflow is typically the most frequent operation in a service discovery system, as services continuously need to find and communicate with their dependencies. The lookup flow demonstrates the coordination between the HTTP API layer and the registry core to provide clients with current, accurate information about healthy service instances.</p>\n<p>Unlike the registration flow, which modifies system state, the lookup flow is primarily a read operation that filters and returns existing data. However, this apparent simplicity masks important complexity around data consistency, health status filtering, and performance optimization for high-frequency access patterns.</p>\n<h4 id=\"client-lookup-request\">Client Lookup Request</h4>\n<p>The lookup process begins when a client sends an HTTP GET request to the <code>/services/{serviceName}</code> endpoint, where the service name identifies which type of service the client wants to discover. This request represents a client&#39;s need to find available instances of a particular service to establish communication.</p>\n<p>The HTTP API layer receives the lookup request and extracts the service name from the URL path. The API layer performs basic validation on the service name to ensure it matches expected formatting rules and doesn&#39;t contain any characters that might indicate injection attacks or malformed requests.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Check</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Error Response</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service name format</td>\n<td>Prevent injection attacks</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid service name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service name length</td>\n<td>Prevent abuse</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Service name too long</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Special characters</td>\n<td>Ensure URL safety</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Invalid characters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty name</td>\n<td>Basic requirement</td>\n<td>400 Bad Request - Service name required</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"registry-query-processing\">Registry Query Processing</h4>\n<p>After validating the request, the API layer calls the registry core&#39;s <code>Lookup(serviceName)</code> method to retrieve all instances of the requested service. This method triggers a multi-step process within the registry core that involves data retrieval, health filtering, and result preparation.</p>\n<p>The registry core first queries its internal data structures to find all registered instances with the specified service name. This operation uses the secondary index maintained by service name to efficiently locate relevant entries without scanning the entire registry. The initial query returns all registered instances regardless of their current health status.</p>\n<p>The query process must handle concurrent access carefully since lookup operations occur simultaneously with registrations, deregistrations, and health status updates. The registry core uses read-write locks to ensure that lookup operations can proceed concurrently with each other while being blocked only by write operations that modify the registry state.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-status-filtering\">Health Status Filtering</h4>\n<p>Once the registry core retrieves the raw list of service instances, it applies health status filtering to return only instances that are currently available for client connections. This filtering process examines the <code>HealthStatus</code> of each instance to determine whether it should be included in the response.</p>\n<p>The health filtering logic evaluates several criteria to determine instance availability:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Criteria</th>\n<th>Evaluation</th>\n<th>Include in Results</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Status field</td>\n<td>Must equal &quot;healthy&quot;</td>\n<td>Yes if healthy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last check time</td>\n<td>Within acceptable staleness window</td>\n<td>No if too old</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Failure count</td>\n<td>Below maximum threshold</td>\n<td>No if exceeded</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Registration TTL</td>\n<td>Not expired</td>\n<td>No if expired</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health endpoint</td>\n<td>Responding to checks</td>\n<td>No if unreachable</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The filtering process also considers the recency of health information to ensure clients don&#39;t receive stale data about service availability. If a service&#39;s health status hasn&#39;t been updated recently, it may be excluded from results even if its last known status was healthy, since network partitions or system issues might have prevented recent health checks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The critical insight here is that health filtering must balance freshness with availability - being too strict about health staleness can cause cascading failures when the health checker experiences temporary delays, while being too lenient can direct traffic to failed services.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"load-balancing-considerations\">Load Balancing Considerations</h4>\n<p>Although the core service discovery system doesn&#39;t implement load balancing algorithms, the lookup flow prepares data in ways that support client-side load balancing decisions. The registry core can optionally shuffle the order of returned instances to prevent clients from always connecting to the first instance in the list.</p>\n<p>The response includes metadata that helps clients make intelligent load balancing decisions, such as instance health scores, recent response times, and current failure counts. This information allows sophisticated clients to implement weighted load balancing or prefer instances with better health metrics.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Metadata Field</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Client Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ResponseTime</td>\n<td>Average health check latency</td>\n<td>Prefer faster instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FailureCount</td>\n<td>Recent failure history</td>\n<td>Avoid recently failed instances</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastCheck</td>\n<td>Health information freshness</td>\n<td>Assess data reliability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RegisteredAt</td>\n<td>Instance stability</td>\n<td>Prefer stable instances</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"response-construction-and-optimization\">Response Construction and Optimization</h4>\n<p>With health filtering complete, the registry core constructs a response containing the list of healthy service instances. The response uses the <code>ServiceList</code> structure to provide both the instance data and useful metadata about the overall service health.</p>\n<p>The API layer receives the filtered service list from the registry core and constructs an HTTP response using the standard <code>SuccessResponse</code> format. The response includes comprehensive information about each healthy instance, enabling clients to make connection decisions without requiring additional API calls.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Section</th>\n<th>Contents</th>\n<th>Client Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Instances array</td>\n<td>Healthy ServiceInstance objects</td>\n<td>Connection details for each instance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TotalCount</td>\n<td>All registered instances</td>\n<td>Understand service scale</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HealthyCount</td>\n<td>Currently available instances</td>\n<td>Assess service health</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ServiceName</td>\n<td>Requested service identifier</td>\n<td>Confirm response accuracy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"caching-and-performance-optimization\">Caching and Performance Optimization</h4>\n<p>The lookup flow includes several performance optimizations that reduce latency and system load for frequently accessed services. The API layer can implement response caching with short TTL values to serve repeated requests for the same service without querying the registry core.</p>\n<p>The caching strategy must balance performance with data freshness, ensuring clients receive reasonably current information about service availability. Cache invalidation occurs when services register, deregister, or experience health status changes, maintaining accuracy while providing performance benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Cache Strategy Decision Table:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cache Duration</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Recommended Use</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>5-10 seconds</td>\n<td>High performance, low registry load</td>\n<td>Possible stale data</td>\n<td>High-frequency lookups</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-2 seconds</td>\n<td>Good performance, fresher data</td>\n<td>Moderate registry load</td>\n<td>Standard lookups</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No caching</td>\n<td>Always fresh data</td>\n<td>High latency, high load</td>\n<td>Critical health-sensitive lookups</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"error-handling-and-fallback\">Error Handling and Fallback</h4>\n<p>The lookup flow implements comprehensive error handling to ensure clients receive useful information even when parts of the system experience problems. When the registry core encounters issues, the API layer returns appropriate HTTP status codes with detailed error information.</p>\n<p>Common error scenarios include service name not found, temporary registry unavailability, and health checker delays that prevent accurate health status determination. Each error condition requires different client-side handling strategies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>HTTP Status</th>\n<th>Client Recommendation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service not found</td>\n<td>404 Not Found</td>\n<td>Check service name, may not be registered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Registry unavailable</td>\n<td>503 Service Unavailable</td>\n<td>Retry with exponential backoff</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>All instances unhealthy</td>\n<td>200 OK with empty list</td>\n<td>Use cached instances or fallback service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stale health data</td>\n<td>200 OK with warning header</td>\n<td>Accept results but retry soon</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"health-check-flow\">Health Check Flow</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fhealth-check-flow.svg\" alt=\"Health Check Process Flow\"></p>\n<p>The health check flow represents the background process that continuously monitors service health and maintains the accuracy of the service registry. This workflow operates independently of client requests, running on a scheduled basis to verify that registered services are still available and responsive. The health check flow demonstrates the coordination between the health checker component and the registry core to maintain real-time service availability information.</p>\n<p>The health check process is fundamentally different from registration and lookup flows because it operates autonomously in the background, driven by timers and schedules rather than external requests. This background operation must be robust and efficient, since it runs continuously and affects the availability information that clients receive during service discovery.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-check-scheduling-and-coordination\">Health Check Scheduling and Coordination</h4>\n<p>The health check flow begins with the scheduler component within the health checker identifying which service instances require health verification. The scheduler maintains a priority queue of <code>ScheduledCheck</code> entries, ordered by the next check time for each service instance.</p>\n<p>The scheduling algorithm runs in a continuous loop, examining the priority queue to identify checks that are due for execution. When a check&#39;s scheduled time arrives, the scheduler removes it from the queue and initiates the health verification process. After completing a check, the scheduler calculates the next check time based on the service&#39;s configured interval and the check result.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scheduling Decision</th>\n<th>Condition</th>\n<th>Next Check Time</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Successful check</td>\n<td>Health endpoint responds</td>\n<td>Base interval</td>\n<td>Maintain normal monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First failure</td>\n<td>Single check failure</td>\n<td>Half interval</td>\n<td>Increase monitoring frequency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple failures</td>\n<td>Consecutive failures</td>\n<td>Quarter interval</td>\n<td>Rapid failure detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recovery</td>\n<td>Failed to healthy</td>\n<td>Base interval</td>\n<td>Return to normal monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service deregistered</td>\n<td>Instance removed</td>\n<td>Remove from queue</td>\n<td>Stop unnecessary checks</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The scheduler implements jittering to prevent synchronized health checks that could overwhelm either the health checker or the target services. Each check time includes a small random offset that spreads the load over time while maintaining the target check frequency.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-check-execution-process\">Health Check Execution Process</h4>\n<p>When a scheduled check becomes due, the health checker initiates the actual health verification process by calling the <code>CheckServiceHealth(instance)</code> method. This method orchestrates the communication with the target service&#39;s health endpoint and interprets the response to determine service availability.</p>\n<p>The health check execution follows a standardized protocol that works across different types of services and health endpoint implementations. The process begins by constructing an HTTP request to the service&#39;s health endpoint, setting appropriate timeouts and headers to ensure the check completes within a reasonable time frame.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>HTTP Request Component</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Method</td>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Standard health check protocol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>URL</td>\n<td>Service host + health endpoint path</td>\n<td>Target the service&#39;s health endpoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout</td>\n<td>Config.HealthTimeout (default 10s)</td>\n<td>Prevent hanging checks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User-Agent</td>\n<td>ServiceDiscovery/1.0 HealthChecker</td>\n<td>Identify health check requests</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accept</td>\n<td>application/json</td>\n<td>Support structured health responses</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health checker sends the HTTP request and waits for a response within the configured timeout period. The interpretation of the response follows standard HTTP health check conventions, where 2xx status codes indicate healthy services and any other status codes or timeouts indicate service problems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"response-interpretation-and-status-determination\">Response Interpretation and Status Determination</h4>\n<p>After receiving a response from the service&#39;s health endpoint, the health checker interprets the result to determine the service&#39;s current health status. This interpretation process considers both the HTTP status code and the response timing to make an accurate assessment of service availability.</p>\n<p>The health status determination follows a clear decision tree that maps different response scenarios to health outcomes:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Response Scenario</th>\n<th>HTTP Status</th>\n<th>Response Time</th>\n<th>Health Decision</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Normal response</td>\n<td>200-299</td>\n<td>Within timeout</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Service responding normally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Client error</td>\n<td>400-499</td>\n<td>Within timeout</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Health endpoint exists but has issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server error</td>\n<td>500-599</td>\n<td>Within timeout</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Service experiencing problems</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection refused</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Immediate</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Service not running or unreachable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timeout</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Exceeds limit</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Service too slow or unresponsive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network error</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Variable</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Network connectivity problems</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Health Check Response Interpretation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need consistent criteria for determining service health from HTTP responses</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Strict interpretation (only 200 OK is healthy)</li>\n<li>Lenient interpretation (any response is healthy)</li>\n<li>Configurable interpretation (per-service health criteria)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Moderate interpretation with 2xx as healthy, errors as unhealthy</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Balances false positives from strict interpretation with false negatives from lenient approach; provides predictable behavior across different service implementations</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Services must implement proper health endpoints that return appropriate status codes; reduces false unhealthy markings from minor issues</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The health checker also records timing information from each check, including the total response time and any error details. This metadata helps with debugging service issues and provides valuable information for monitoring and alerting systems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"health-status-update-and-registry-integration\">Health Status Update and Registry Integration</h4>\n<p>After determining the health status from the check response, the health checker updates the service&#39;s health information in the registry core through the <code>UpdateHealth(serviceName, instanceID, status)</code> method. This update process ensures that the latest health information is immediately available for service lookup operations.</p>\n<p>The health status update includes comprehensive information about the check result, not just a simple healthy/unhealthy determination. The <code>HealthStatus</code> structure captures all relevant details that might be useful for debugging or monitoring purposes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Health Status Field</th>\n<th>Updated Value</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Status</td>\n<td>&quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;unhealthy&quot;</td>\n<td>Primary availability indicator</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastCheck</td>\n<td>Current timestamp</td>\n<td>Track when information was gathered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FailureCount</td>\n<td>Increment on failure, reset on success</td>\n<td>Count consecutive failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ResponseTime</td>\n<td>Actual response duration</td>\n<td>Performance monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LastError</td>\n<td>Error description if applicable</td>\n<td>Debugging information</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The registry core receives the health update and immediately applies it to the stored <code>RegistryEntry</code> for the service instance. This update must be thread-safe since it occurs concurrently with lookup operations and other registry modifications.</p>\n<h4 id=\"failure-count-management-and-thresholds\">Failure Count Management and Thresholds</h4>\n<p>The health check flow implements sophisticated failure counting logic that distinguishes between temporary service hiccups and persistent failures. This approach prevents single failed checks from immediately marking services as unhealthy while still detecting genuine service problems quickly.</p>\n<p>The failure counting system tracks consecutive health check failures for each service instance. When a check succeeds, the failure count resets to zero. When a check fails, the failure count increments, and the system evaluates whether the service should be marked as unhealthy based on the configured failure threshold.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Count</th>\n<th>Health Status</th>\n<th>Lookup Visibility</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Visible</td>\n<td>Service responding normally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Visible</td>\n<td>Single failure might be transient</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Healthy</td>\n<td>Visible</td>\n<td>Two failures still might be temporary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3+ (at threshold)</td>\n<td>Unhealthy</td>\n<td>Hidden</td>\n<td>Persistent failure detected</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The failure threshold is configurable through the <code>Config.MaxFailures</code> setting, allowing operators to tune the sensitivity of failure detection based on their environment&#39;s characteristics. Networks with high latency or occasional packet loss might require higher thresholds, while reliable networks can use lower thresholds for faster failure detection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cleanup-and-deregistration-integration\">Cleanup and Deregistration Integration</h4>\n<p>The health check flow coordinates with the registry&#39;s cleanup processes to handle service instances that should no longer be monitored. When services deregister explicitly or when TTL expiration removes them from the registry, the health checker must stop monitoring those instances to prevent resource waste.</p>\n<p>The health checker maintains synchronization with the registry core through periodic reconciliation processes that identify orphaned health checks. These cleanup operations ensure that the health checker doesn&#39;t continue monitoring services that are no longer registered, preventing resource leaks and unnecessary network traffic.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleanup Trigger</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Action Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Explicit deregistration</td>\n<td>Registry notification</td>\n<td>Remove from schedule immediately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TTL expiration</td>\n<td>Registry cleanup notification</td>\n<td>Remove from schedule after grace period</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health check failures</td>\n<td>Failure count exceeds maximum</td>\n<td>Continue checking but mark unhealthy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network unreachability</td>\n<td>Extended failure period</td>\n<td>Reduce check frequency but continue</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"performance-optimization-and-resource-management\">Performance Optimization and Resource Management</h4>\n<p>The health check flow implements several performance optimizations to ensure it can scale to monitor large numbers of service instances without overwhelming system resources. These optimizations focus on efficient scheduling, connection reuse, and intelligent batching of health checks.</p>\n<p>The health checker uses HTTP connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each health check. This optimization is particularly important when monitoring many instances of the same service, as it allows multiple health checks to reuse the same underlying TCP connections.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Management Strategies:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Resource</th>\n<th>Optimization Technique</th>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP connections</td>\n<td>Connection pooling with per-host limits</td>\n<td>Reduce connection establishment overhead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory usage</td>\n<td>Bounded queues and periodic cleanup</td>\n<td>Prevent memory growth with large instance counts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CPU usage</td>\n<td>Configurable concurrency limits</td>\n<td>Prevent health checking from overwhelming the system</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network bandwidth</td>\n<td>Intelligent check distribution</td>\n<td>Spread network load over time</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The health checker also implements backpressure mechanisms that slow down health checking when system resources become constrained. These mechanisms help maintain system stability during peak load periods or when monitoring very large numbers of service instances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation

Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - Error handling spans across service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3), with each milestone introducing new failure modes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-hospital-emergency-response\">Mental Model: The Hospital Emergency Response</h3>\n<p>Think of our service discovery system like a hospital managing patient admissions and monitoring. The hospital (service registry) needs to handle three types of emergencies: communication failures (network issues), patient crises (service failures), and overcrowding (system overload). Just as a hospital has protocols for handling ambulance radio failures, distinguishing between minor ailments and critical conditions, and managing capacity during disasters, our system needs comprehensive error handling strategies.</p>\n<p>The triage nurse (error detection) must quickly identify the severity of each situation, the emergency response team (recovery mechanisms) must know exactly how to respond to each type of crisis, and the hospital administration (system protection) must prevent any single emergency from overwhelming the entire facility.</p>\n<p>Robust error handling in distributed systems requires understanding that failures are not exceptional cases—they are normal operating conditions that must be handled gracefully. Network partitions will occur, services will crash unexpectedly, and traffic spikes will strain system resources. The quality of a service discovery system is measured not by its performance during perfect conditions, but by its behavior when everything goes wrong simultaneously.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ffailure-scenarios.svg\" alt=\"Failure Scenario Flowchart\"></p>\n<p>The fundamental principle underlying all error handling in service discovery is <strong>failure isolation</strong>—ensuring that problems with individual services, network segments, or system components do not cascade into system-wide outages. This requires careful design of failure detection mechanisms, recovery procedures, and protective measures that maintain system stability even when multiple components are failing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"network-failure-scenarios\">Network Failure Scenarios</h3>\n<p>Network failures represent the most common and challenging class of problems in distributed systems. Unlike service failures, which affect individual components, network failures can partition the system and make it impossible to distinguish between a failed service and a healthy service that cannot be reached.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Principle</strong>: Network failures must be treated as temporary by default, with escalating responses based on failure duration and pattern analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"connection-timeout-handling\">Connection Timeout Handling</h4>\n<p>Connection timeouts occur when the health checker cannot establish a connection to a service&#39;s health endpoint within the configured timeout period. These failures can indicate network congestion, service overload, or actual service failure, making them particularly challenging to interpret correctly.</p>\n<p>The health checking system must implement <strong>progressive timeout handling</strong> that distinguishes between transient network issues and persistent service problems. When a connection timeout occurs, the system should not immediately mark the service as unhealthy, but instead implement a graduated response based on the pattern of failures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Timeout Scenario</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Response Strategy</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single timeout</td>\n<td>Connection establishment &gt; <code>HealthTimeout</code></td>\n<td>Increment failure count, schedule immediate retry</td>\n<td>No status change if under <code>MaxFailures</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intermittent timeouts</td>\n<td>Pattern of timeout/success alternating</td>\n<td>Extend check interval, reduce timeout sensitivity</td>\n<td>Monitor for pattern stabilization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sustained timeouts</td>\n<td>Multiple consecutive timeouts &gt; <code>MaxFailures</code></td>\n<td>Mark instance unhealthy, remove from active pool</td>\n<td>Continue background checking for recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Network partition</td>\n<td>All services in subnet timing out simultaneously</td>\n<td>Isolate affected network segment, maintain service state</td>\n<td>Restore services when connectivity returns</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The timeout detection algorithm follows this decision process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Timeout Detection</strong>: The <code>HealthCheckClient</code> monitors connection establishment time and request completion time separately</li>\n<li><strong>Pattern Analysis</strong>: The system maintains a sliding window of recent check results to identify timeout patterns</li>\n<li><strong>Escalation Logic</strong>: Based on timeout frequency and duration, the system chooses between immediate retry, delayed retry, or service marking</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery Detection</strong>: Background checks continue even for timed-out services to detect when connectivity is restored</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Timeout Escalation Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Network timeouts can indicate temporary congestion or permanent service failure, requiring different responses</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate marking, fixed backoff, adaptive backoff with pattern analysis</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Progressive escalation with pattern analysis and background recovery checks</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Prevents false positives from transient network issues while ensuring failed services are detected promptly</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex timeout logic but significantly reduced false positive rate and faster recovery</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"network-partition-recovery\">Network Partition Recovery</h4>\n<p>Network partitions occur when network connectivity is lost between the service registry and groups of services, creating &quot;split-brain&quot; scenarios where services remain healthy but appear failed to the health checker. Recovery from network partitions requires careful orchestration to prevent service registry thrashing.</p>\n<p>When connectivity is restored after a partition, the system must <strong>gradually reintegrate</strong> services rather than immediately marking all previously unreachable services as healthy. This prevents overwhelming recovered services with sudden traffic surges and allows time to verify actual service health.</p>\n<p>The partition recovery process involves several stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Partition Detection</strong>: Identify when multiple services in the same network segment fail simultaneously</li>\n<li><strong>State Preservation</strong>: Maintain service registration data for partitioned services rather than immediately removing them</li>\n<li><strong>Connectivity Restoration</strong>: Detect when network connectivity to the partitioned segment is restored</li>\n<li><strong>Gradual Reintegration</strong>: Slowly increase health check frequency and verify service health before marking services available</li>\n<li><strong>Traffic Ramping</strong>: Coordinate with load balancing to gradually increase traffic to recovered services</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Partition Phase</th>\n<th>System Behavior</th>\n<th>Health Check Strategy</th>\n<th>Service Availability</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Active partition</td>\n<td>Mark segment as partitioned, maintain registrations</td>\n<td>Suspend health checks for partitioned segment</td>\n<td>Remove partitioned services from active pool</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recovery detection</td>\n<td>Detect first successful health check in segment</td>\n<td>Resume health checks with extended intervals</td>\n<td>Keep services unavailable pending verification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Verification</td>\n<td>Verify multiple services in segment are responsive</td>\n<td>Standard health check interval</td>\n<td>Mark verified services as healthy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full recovery</td>\n<td>All segment services verified or expired</td>\n<td>Normal health checking resumes</td>\n<td>Full service availability restored</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"connection-pool-management\">Connection Pool Management</h4>\n<p>The health checking system maintains connection pools to service health endpoints to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections for each health check. However, connection pools can become a source of cascading failures if not managed properly during network issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection pool exhaustion</strong> occurs when many health checks fail with long timeouts, tying up connections and preventing new health checks from being performed. The system must implement <strong>adaptive connection management</strong> that adjusts pool sizes and connection timeouts based on current network conditions.</p>\n<p>The connection management strategy includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Pool Sizing</strong>: Adjust connection pool sizes based on health check success rates and response times</li>\n<li><strong>Connection Health</strong>: Monitor connection staleness and proactively close connections that may be broken</li>\n<li><strong>Failure Isolation</strong>: Isolate failing endpoints to prevent them from consuming excessive connection pool resources</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery Optimization</strong>: Prioritize connection pool resources for services showing signs of recovery</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"service-failure-detection\">Service Failure Detection</h3>\n<p>Service failures differ from network failures in that they represent actual problems with service functionality rather than connectivity issues. Accurate service failure detection requires distinguishing between different types of service problems and implementing appropriate responses for each.</p>\n<h4 id=\"temporary-vs-permanent-service-failures\">Temporary vs Permanent Service Failures</h4>\n<p>The most critical distinction in service failure detection is between <strong>temporary failures</strong> that will resolve automatically and <strong>permanent failures</strong> that require intervention. Temporary failures include resource exhaustion, dependency unavailability, or transient configuration issues.

The service registry must implement protective mechanisms to prevent cascade failures from propagating through the system.</p>\n<p>Cascade failure prevention strategies include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Circuit Breaker Integration</strong>: Coordinate with circuit breakers in client services to prevent overwhelming failing services</li>\n<li><strong>Gradual Degradation</strong>: Remove failing services from the registry gradually rather than immediately</li>\n<li><strong>Load Shedding Coordination</strong>: Communicate with load balancers to redirect traffic away from struggling services</li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Analysis</strong>: Track service dependencies to predict cascade failure propagation paths</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Cascade Failure Prevention</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Service failures can trigger cascade failures that overwhelm the entire system</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Immediate removal, gradual degradation, dependency-aware removal</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Gradual degradation with dependency analysis and load coordination</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Prevents sudden traffic shifts while maintaining system stability during failures</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex failure handling logic but significantly reduced cascade failure risk</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/service-discovery/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fconcurrent-access.svg\" alt=\"Concurrent Registry Access\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"system-overload-protection\">System Overload Protection</h3>\n<p>System overload occurs when the service registry itself becomes overwhelmed by the volume of registration requests, health checks, or service lookups. Unlike service failures, system overload affects the registry&#39;s ability to function correctly, potentially causing it to become a single point of failure for the entire system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"request-rate-limiting\">Request Rate Limiting</h4>\n<p>The HTTP API layer must implement <strong>adaptive rate limiting</strong> that protects the registry from excessive request volumes while maintaining service availability for legitimate clients. Rate limiting must be sophisticated enough to distinguish between normal traffic spikes and potential abuse or misconfiguration.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rate Limiting Strategy</th>\n<th>Trigger Condition</th>\n<th>Protection Mechanism</th>\n<th>Client Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Per-client limiting</td>\n<td>Individual client exceeds request threshold</td>\n<td>Return HTTP 429 with retry-after header</td>\n<td>Specific client must back off</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Global rate limiting</td>\n<td>Total system request rate exceeds capacity</td>\n<td>Apply global request throttling</td>\n<td>All clients experience slight delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Endpoint-specific limiting</td>\n<td>Specific API endpoints overwhelmed</td>\n<td>Limit access to expensive operations</td>\n<td>Registration/deregistration delayed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emergency throttling</td>\n<td>System resources critically low</td>\n<td>Aggressive request rejection</td>\n<td>Temporary service degradation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The rate limiting implementation uses a <strong>token bucket algorithm</strong> with adaptive refill rates based on system performance metrics. When system response times increase or resource utilization approaches critical levels, the token refill rate decreases automatically, providing back-pressure to clients.</p>\n<p>Rate limiting configuration includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Base Request Rate</strong>: Normal operating request rate per client and globally</li>\n<li><strong>Burst Allowance</strong>: Short-term burst capacity for handling traffic spikes</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Thresholds</strong>: Dynamic rate adjustments based on system performance</li>\n<li><strong>Priority Classes</strong>: Different rate limits for different types of operations (registration vs lookup)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"memory-management-and-cleanup\">Memory Management and Cleanup</h4>\n<p>The service registry maintains in-memory data structures for service instances, health status, and historical information. Without proper memory management, the registry can experience <strong>memory pressure</strong> that degrades performance and potentially causes crashes.</p>\n<p>Memory management strategies include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>TTL-Based Cleanup</strong>: Automatically remove expired service registrations and health check history</li>\n<li><strong>LRU Eviction</strong>: Remove least recently used service instances when memory pressure increases</li>\n<li><strong>Batch Cleanup Operations</strong>: Perform memory cleanup in batches to minimize performance impact</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Pressure Monitoring</strong>: Monitor memory utilization and trigger cleanup when thresholds are exceeded</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The cleanup process is coordinated by the <code>FlowCoordinator</code> component, which schedules regular cleanup cycles and triggers emergency cleanup when memory pressure is detected:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleanup Type</th>\n<th>Trigger Condition</th>\n<th>Cleanup Scope</th>\n<th>Performance Impact</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Regular TTL cleanup</td>\n<td>Scheduled interval (<code>CleanupInterval</code>)</td>\n<td>Expired registrations and health data</td>\n<td>Minimal, performed during low-traffic periods</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emergency cleanup</td>\n<td>Memory utilization &gt; 85%</td>\n<td>Aggressive cleanup of all expired data</td>\n<td>Moderate, may cause brief response delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Historical data pruning</td>\n<td>Health history size &gt; threshold</td>\n<td>Remove old health check results</td>\n<td>Low, performed in background</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Connection cleanup</td>\n<td>Connection pool exhaustion</td>\n<td>Close idle and stale connections</td>\n<td>Low, improves subsequent performance</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"graceful-degradation-strategies\">Graceful Degradation Strategies</h4>\n<p>When the service registry approaches resource limits, it must implement <strong>graceful degradation</strong> that maintains core functionality while temporarily reducing service quality. Graceful degradation prevents complete system failure by selectively disabling non-essential features.</p>\n<p>The degradation strategy prioritizes service registry operations in order of importance:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Critical Operations</strong>: Service lookup requests for existing healthy services (highest priority)</li>\n<li><strong>Important Operations</strong>: Service registration and health status updates</li>\n<li><strong>Background Operations</strong>: Health checking and cleanup processes</li>\n<li><strong>Optional Operations</strong>: Statistical reporting and historical data collection</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During resource pressure, the system progressively disables lower-priority operations while maintaining higher-priority functionality:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Degradation Level</th>\n<th>Resource Utilization</th>\n<th>Disabled Features</th>\n<th>Maintained Functionality</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Level 1</td>\n<td>70-80%</td>\n<td>Historical data collection, detailed statistics</td>\n<td>All core operations continue normally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level 2</td>\n<td>80-90%</td>\n<td>Background cleanup, non-essential health checks</td>\n<td>Core registry and essential health checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level 3</td>\n<td>90-95%</td>\n<td>New service registration, detailed health analysis</td>\n<td>Service lookup for existing services only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emergency</td>\n<td>&gt;95%</td>\n<td>All non-lookup operations</td>\n<td>Read-only service lookup with cached data</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Aggressive Resource Protection</strong>\nMany implementations make the mistake of implementing overly aggressive resource protection that degrades service quality unnecessarily. The system should tolerate brief resource spikes rather than immediately entering degradation mode. Use smoothed resource metrics over time windows rather than instantaneous measurements, and implement hysteresis in degradation thresholds (different thresholds for entering and exiting degradation modes) to prevent oscillation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"error-recovery-coordination\">Error Recovery Coordination</h4>\n<p>When multiple components of the service registry experience errors simultaneously, the system must coordinate recovery efforts to prevent conflicting recovery actions and resource competition. <strong>Recovery coordination</strong> ensures that system recovery is orderly and efficient.</p>\n<p>The <code>FlowCoordinator</code> manages system-wide error recovery through several mechanisms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Recovery Prioritization</strong>: Establish the order in which components should be recovered</li>\n<li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Ensure recovery operations do not overwhelm available system resources</li>\n<li><strong>State Synchronization</strong>: Coordinate state recovery between registry core, health checker, and API layer</li>\n<li><strong>Progress Monitoring</strong>: Track recovery progress and adjust strategy if recovery stalls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Recovery coordination follows this priority sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Registry Core Recovery</strong>: Restore service registration data from persistent storage or rebuild from known good state</li>\n<li><strong>Health Checker Recovery</strong>: Resume health checking for known services, starting with previously healthy instances</li>\n<li><strong>API Layer Recovery</strong>: Restore HTTP API functionality and begin accepting client requests</li>\n<li><strong>Background Process Recovery</strong>: Resume cleanup, statistics collection, and other non-essential operations</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: False Positive Health Failures</strong>\nOne of the most common mistakes in health checking implementation is creating systems that are too sensitive to transient network issues, resulting in healthy services being marked as failed due to temporary connectivity problems. This typically occurs when timeout values are set too low or when a single failed health check immediately marks a service as unhealthy. The solution is implementing failure thresholds that require multiple consecutive failures before marking a service unhealthy, and using appropriate timeout values that account for normal network latency variations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Response Formats</strong>\nMany implementations fail to maintain consistent error response formats across different failure scenarios, making it difficult for clients to handle errors programmatically. This leads to brittle client implementations that break when new error conditions are encountered. Always use the standardized <code>ErrorResponse</code> structure for all error conditions, ensuring that error codes and messages follow consistent patterns that clients can reliably parse and handle.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resource Leak During Error Conditions</strong>\nError handling paths often contain resource leaks because developers focus on the happy path and neglect proper cleanup in error scenarios. This is particularly problematic for network connections, file handles, and memory allocations that are created during failed operations. Implement comprehensive resource cleanup using defer statements or try-finally blocks, and ensure that all error paths release resources properly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cascade Failure Through Health Checking</strong>\nAggressive health checking can inadvertently contribute to cascade failures by overwhelming struggling services with health check requests when they are already under stress. This occurs when health check intervals are too frequent or when multiple health checkers probe the same service simultaneously. Implement exponential backoff for health check intervals when services are struggling, and coordinate health checking across multiple registry instances to prevent overlapping checks.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Error Recovery</strong>\nMany error recovery implementations use blocking operations that prevent the system from handling new requests while recovery is in progress. This extends outage duration unnecessarily and can make the system appear completely unavailable during recovery periods. Design error recovery as background operations that allow the system to continue serving requests with potentially degraded functionality rather than complete unavailability.</p>\n<h3

Handling Checkpoint</strong>:\nAfter implementing basic error handling for service registration, verify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration requests with invalid data return appropriate HTTP 400 errors with detailed error messages</li>\n<li>Duplicate registration attempts are handled gracefully without corrupting registry state</li>\n<li>Concurrent registration and deregistration operations don&#39;t cause race conditions</li>\n<li>Memory usage remains stable even with high registration/deregistration rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Test command: <code>curl -X POST localhost:8080/services -d &#39;{&quot;invalid&quot;:&quot;data&quot;}&#39; -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;</code>\nExpected: HTTP 400 response with structured error message explaining validation failure</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2 Error Handling Checkpoint</strong>:\nAfter implementing health check error handling, verify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Services with failing health checks are gradually removed from registry after configured failure threshold</li>\n<li>Network timeouts don&#39;t immediately mark healthy services as failed</li>\n<li>Health check system recovers gracefully from temporary network partitions</li>\n<li>System continues operating normally even when majority of services are failing health checks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Test command: Start service, stop service process, observe health check failure progression\nExpected: Service marked unhealthy after <code>MaxFailures</code> consecutive failures, background checking continues</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3 Error Handling Checkpoint</strong>:\nAfter implementing HTTP API error handling, verify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API returns consistent error response format for all error conditions</li>\n<li>Rate limiting prevents API overload during high request volumes</li>\n<li>System gracefully degrades functionality during resource pressure</li>\n<li>Error recovery restores full functionality after temporary failures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Test command: <code>ab -n 1000 -c 10 localhost:8080/services</code> (load testing)\nExpected: API remains responsive, rate limiting activates if needed, no crashes or data corruption</p>\n<p>The comprehensive error handling implementation ensures that the service discovery system remains stable and functional even when facing multiple simultaneous failure modes, providing the reliability required for production microservice environments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-strategy\">Testing Strategy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This section provides comprehensive testing approaches that validate service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-quality-control-inspector\">Mental Model: The Quality Control Inspector</h3>\n<p>Think of testing a service discovery system like a quality control inspector in a manufacturing plant with multiple production lines. The inspector has three levels of scrutiny: <strong>component testing</strong> (examining individual parts in isolation), <strong>integration testing</strong> (verifying that assembled components work together), and <strong>milestone validation</strong> (confirming that completed product stages meet specifications).</p>\n<p>Just as the inspector uses different tools and techniques for each level—magnifying glass for component defects, functional tests for assembled units, and full performance trials for finished products—our testing strategy employs unit tests with mocks for isolated components, integration tests for component interactions, and milestone checkpoints for end-to-end validation.</p>\n<p>The inspector must also verify that the system gracefully handles anomalies: what happens when a component fails, when supply chains are disrupted, or when demand exceeds capacity? Similarly, our testing strategy must validate error scenarios, network failures, and system overload conditions to ensure robust behavior under stress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unit-testing-approach\">Unit Testing Approach</h3>\n<p>Unit testing in service discovery focuses on testing individual components in complete isolation using test doubles and controlled data. Each component—<code>ServiceRegistry</code>, <code>HealthChecker</code>, and <code>Server</code>—has distinct responsibilities that can be verified independently without external dependencies or side effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Isolation Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The unit testing approach treats each component as a black box with well-defined interfaces. The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> component is tested by providing controlled <code>ServiceInstance</code> data and verifying that registration, deregistration, and lookup operations maintain correct internal state. Health checking logic is isolated by mocking the HTTP client and time-based scheduling, allowing tests to verify failure counting and threshold logic without actual network calls or waiting for real time intervals.</p>\n<p>The HTTP API layer requires mocking the underlying <code>ServiceRegistry</code> and <code>HealthChecker</code> dependencies, enabling tests to focus purely on request parsing, response formatting, and error handling. This isolation ensures that API tests remain fast and deterministic, independent of the complex state management and background processing in lower layers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Testing Principle</strong>: Unit tests must be completely deterministic and fast. Any test that depends on external systems, real network calls, actual time passage, or file system state is not a unit test—it&#39;s an integration test and belongs in a different test suite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Test Data Management</strong></p>\n<p>Unit tests require carefully constructed test data that covers both typical scenarios and edge cases. Test data should include valid <code>ServiceInstance</code> configurations with various combinations of tags, health endpoints, and metadata. Edge case data must test boundary conditions: empty service names, invalid port numbers, malformed health endpoints, and extremely long tag lists.</p>\n<p>Mock data for health checking should simulate various response scenarios: successful HTTP 200 responses, timeout conditions, connection refused errors, and malformed response bodies. The test data should also include time-based scenarios where health checks succeed initially but begin failing after a specific number of attempts, allowing verification of failure counting and threshold logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Mock and Test Double Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>Effective unit testing requires sophisticated mocking of external dependencies. The HTTP client used by <code>HealthChecker</code> must be replaced with a mock that can simulate network conditions: successful responses with configurable latency, various HTTP error codes, connection timeouts, and DNS resolution failures. The mock should track call patterns to verify that health checks are scheduled and executed according to configuration.</p>\n<p>Time-based operations require special attention in unit testing. Rather than using real time, tests should inject a controllable time source that allows advancing time instantly and verifying time-based behavior like TTL expiration, health check scheduling, and cleanup operations. This approach makes tests both faster and more reliable.</p>\n<p>The registry&#39;s background cleanup operations present particular testing challenges. Tests must verify that expired registrations are removed, that cleanup operations don&#39;t interfere with active registrations, and that cleanup frequency matches configuration. This requires mocking the cleanup scheduler and providing controlled time advancement.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Testing Patterns</strong></p>\n<p>Unit tests should follow consistent patterns that make them easy to understand and maintain. Each test should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: set up test data and mocks, execute the operation being tested, and verify expected outcomes. Setup and teardown should be handled by test fixtures to ensure clean state between test runs.</p>\n<p>State verification requires comprehensive assertions that check not only the direct return values but also the internal state changes. When testing <code>Register</code>, verify not only that the operation returns success but also that the service appears in subsequent <code>Lookup</code> calls, that health checking is initiated, and that the registration timestamp is recorded correctly.</p>\n<p>Error condition testing requires verifying both error return values and system state. When registration fails due to validation errors, verify that no partial state is left in the registry, that no health checks are scheduled for the invalid service, and that the error response contains appropriate diagnostic information.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Focus Area</th>\n<th>Mock Requirements</th>\n<th>Verification Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Registry Core</td>\n<td>Registration/lookup logic</td>\n<td>Time source, cleanup scheduler</td>\n<td>Service state, lookup results, expiration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Checker</td>\n<td>Failure detection logic</td>\n<td>HTTP client, time source</td>\n<td>Failure counts, status updates, scheduling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HTTP API</td>\n<td>Request/response handling</td>\n<td>Registry, health checker</td>\n<td>Status codes, response format, validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>Setting validation</td>\n<td>File system, environment</td>\n<td>Default values, override logic, validation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Handling</td>\n<td>Failure scenarios</td>\n<td>Various failure modes</td>\n<td>Error messages, state consistency, recovery</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Test Coverage Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Unit test coverage should focus on decision points and state transitions rather than raw line coverage. Every conditional branch in the registration logic should have tests that exercise both the true and false paths. State machines like health status transitions require tests for every valid state change and verification that invalid transitions are properly rejected.</p>\n<p>Boundary condition testing is particularly important for service discovery systems. Tests should verify behavior at configuration limits: maximum number of registered services, health check timeout boundaries, TTL expiration edge cases, and rate limiting thresholds. These boundary tests often reveal off-by-one errors and race conditions that are difficult to detect in normal operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Injection Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Unit tests must systematically verify error handling by injecting failures at every external dependency point. Mock the HTTP client to return various error conditions and verify that the health checker responds appropriately: temporary failures increment failure counts without immediate deregistration, while permanent failures trigger immediate removal from the active service list.</p>\n<p>Configuration error testing should verify that invalid configurations are detected early and result in clear error messages. Test scenarios should include missing required fields, invalid port ranges, negative timeout values, and conflicting settings. The system should fail fast with diagnostic information rather than attempting to operate with invalid configuration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing-scenarios\">Integration Testing Scenarios</h3>\n<p>Integration testing verifies that components work correctly together in realistic scenarios without mocks or test doubles. These tests validate the complete data flow from HTTP API requests through registry operations to health checking and back to API responses. Integration tests catch issues that unit tests miss: timing dependencies, protocol mismatches, and state synchronization problems.</p>\n<p><strong>End-to-End Workflow Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Integration tests must verify complete workflows from start to finish. The service registration workflow test begins with an HTTP POST request to register a service, verifies that the registry stores the service data correctly, confirms that health checking begins automatically, waits for the first health check to complete, and validates that the service appears in lookup results with correct health status.</p>\n<p>The service deregistration workflow test registers a service, confirms it&#39;s healthy and discoverable, sends a DELETE request to remove the service, verifies that health checking stops immediately, and confirms that the service no longer appears in lookup results. This test must also verify that any cached data is invalidated and that cleanup operations complete successfully.</p>\n<p>The health status change workflow test registers a service, waits for it to become healthy, stops the mock service to trigger health check failures, monitors the failure count progression, verifies that the service becomes unavailable after reaching the failure threshold, restarts the mock service, and confirms that the service recovers to healthy status.</p>\n<p><strong>Component Interaction Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Integration tests must verify that components communicate correctly through their defined interfaces. The registry-to-health-checker interaction test verifies that newly registered services are automatically added to the health check schedule, that configuration changes (like modified check intervals) are propagated correctly, and that deregistered services are removed from the checking schedule immediately.</p>\n<p>The health-checker-to-registry interaction test verifies that health status updates are applied correctly to registry state, that health check results trigger appropriate state transitions, and that registry queries return services with current health status. This test must also verify that health check operations don&#39;t interfere with concurrent registration and lookup operations.</p>\n<p>The API-to-registry interaction test verifies that HTTP requests are correctly translated to registry operations, that registry responses are properly formatted as HTTP responses, and that error conditions in the registry layer result in appropriate HTTP error codes and error messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Concurrent Operation Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Service discovery systems must handle concurrent operations correctly since multiple services may register, deregister, or be looked up simultaneously while health checking runs continuously in the background. Integration tests must verify that these concurrent operations don&#39;t corrupt shared state or cause deadlocks.</p>\n<p>The concurrent registration test launches multiple goroutines that simultaneously register different services and verifies that all registrations succeed, that no service data is lost or corrupted, and that health checking begins for all registered services. This test should also verify that the final registry state matches expectations regardless of the order in which registrations complete.</p>\n<p>The concurrent lookup test registers multiple services, then launches multiple goroutines that simultaneously perform service lookups while background processes modify service health status. The test verifies that lookup results are always consistent—no partially updated service information is returned—and that lookup operations don&#39;t interfere with health status updates.</p>\n<p>The registration-during-health-check test verifies that new service registrations work correctly even while health checking is actively running. This test should register an initial service, wait for health checking to begin, register additional services during active health checking, and verify that health checking coverage expands correctly to include the new services.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Test Scenario</th>\n<th>Components Involved</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n<th>Failure Modes Tested</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Complete Service Lifecycle</td>\n<td>API + Registry + Health Checker</td>\n<td>Registration → Health → Discovery → Deregistration</td>\n<td>Network failures during registration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Concurrent Service Operations</td>\n<td>API + Registry</td>\n<td>Multiple simultaneous operations complete correctly</td>\n<td>Race conditions in shared state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health Status Transitions</td>\n<td>Registry + Health Checker</td>\n<td>Healthy → Unhealthy → Healthy transitions work</td>\n<td>Health check timeouts and recovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API Error Handling</td>\n<td>API + Registry + Health Checker</td>\n<td>Proper error codes and messages</td>\n<td>Invalid requests and system failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration Changes</td>\n<td>All Components</td>\n<td>Runtime configuration updates apply correctly</td>\n<td>Configuration conflicts and validation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Network Failure Simulation</strong></p>\n<p>Integration tests must verify behavior under realistic network conditions. The network partition test starts multiple mock services, allows them to become healthy, simulates network connectivity loss to some services while maintaining connectivity to others, verifies that affected services are marked unhealthy while unaffected services remain available, restores network connectivity, and confirms that previously affected services recover to healthy status.</p>\n<p>The health check timeout test configures short health check timeouts, starts mock services that respond slowly, verifies that slow-responding services are marked unhealthy due to timeouts, improves mock service response times, and confirms that services recover when response times improve. This test validates that timeout handling works correctly and doesn&#39;t cause false positives.</p>\n<p>The DNS resolution failure test registers services using hostnames rather than IP addresses, simulates DNS resolution failures for some hostnames, verifies that affected services are marked unhealthy due to DNS failures, restores DNS resolution, and confirms service recovery. This test is crucial since many real deployments use service names rather than IP addresses.</p>\n<p><strong>Load and Stress Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Integration tests should verify system behavior under load conditions that might occur in production. The high registration volume test rapidly registers large numbers of services and verifies that all registrations succeed, that health checking scales appropriately to handle all registered services, that lookup performance remains acceptable, and that memory usage remains bounded.</p>\n<p>The high lookup volume test registers a moderate number of services and then performs a high volume of concurrent lookup operations while health checking continues in the background. This test verifies that lookup operations remain fast and consistent, that health checking isn&#39;t disrupted by lookup volume, and that the system doesn&#39;t degrade under query load.</p>\n<p>The configuration stress test repeatedly modifies configuration settings while the system is under moderate load, verifying that configuration changes are applied correctly, that existing operations continue to work during configuration updates, and that invalid configuration changes are rejected without affecting system operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Consistency Validation</strong></p>\n<p>Integration tests must verify that data remains consistent across all system components even under failure conditions. The consistency test performs a complex sequence of operations: register multiple services, wait for health status to stabilize, force some services to fail health checks, perform lookup operations to verify consistency, restart failed services, wait for recovery, and perform final validation that all data matches expected state.</p>\n<p>The recovery consistency test simulates system restart scenarios by stopping the registry service while maintaining mock services, restarting the registry, and verifying that the system recovers to a consistent state: previously registered services are restored from persistent state, health checking resumes correctly, and lookup operations return accurate results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"milestone-validation-checkpoints\">Milestone Validation Checkpoints</h3>\n<p>Each project milestone requires specific validation checkpoints that verify the implementation meets acceptance criteria and functions correctly in realistic scenarios. These checkpoints serve as comprehensive integration tests that validate not just individual features but the complete milestone functionality working together.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1: Service Registry Validation</strong></p>\n<p>The Milestone 1 checkpoint validates the core service registry functionality through a comprehensive test scenario. The validation begins by starting the registry service and verifying that it accepts HTTP requests on the configured port. The test then registers multiple service instances with different configurations: services with different names, multiple instances of the same service, services with various tag combinations, and services with different health endpoint configurations.</p>\n<p>Registration validation verifies that each service registration returns a unique instance ID, that the instance ID can be used for subsequent operations, that registered services appear in the complete service list, and that service metadata is stored and returned accurately. The test should also verify that registration timestamps are recorded correctly and that TTL expiration works as expected.</p>\n<p>Lookup validation tests service discovery functionality by querying for services by name and verifying that all registered instances are returned with correct metadata. The test should verify lookup behavior for non-existent services (empty result set), lookup behavior for services with multiple instances (all instances returned), and lookup performance under various query patterns.</p>\n<p>Deregistration validation verifies that services can be removed from the registry using their instance IDs, that deregistered services no longer appear in lookup results, that deregistered services are removed from the complete service list, and that deregistration of one instance doesn&#39;t affect other instances of the same service.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Check</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Test Method</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Service Registration</td>\n<td>Unique ID returned, service discoverable</td>\n<td>POST /services with valid data</td>\n<td>HTTP 201, valid instance ID, service in lookup results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Deregistration</td>\n<td>Service removed from registry</td>\n<td>DELETE /services/{name}/{id}</td>\n<td>HTTP 200, service not in lookup results</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Service Lookup</td>\n<td>All healthy instances returned</td>\n<td>GET /services/{name}</td>\n<td>HTTP 200, correct instance list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complete Service List</td>\n<td>All services visible</td>\n<td>GET /services</td>\n<td>HTTP 200, comprehensive service list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TTL Expiration</td>\n<td>Expired services auto-removed</td>\n<td>Wait beyond TTL period</td>\n<td>Expired services absent from lookup</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2: Health Checking Validation</strong></p>\n<p>The Milestone 2 checkpoint builds on Milestone 1 by adding health checking functionality. The validation starts multiple mock services that implement health endpoints returning HTTP 200 for healthy status. The test registers these services with the registry and verifies that health checking begins automatically with configured intervals.</p>\n<p>Health endpoint validation verifies that the health checker makes HTTP requests to the correct health endpoints, that successful health checks mark services as healthy, that healthy services appear in lookup results, and that health check timing follows configuration settings. The test should monitor actual HTTP requests to mock services to verify that health checking is working correctly.</p>\n<p>Failure detection validation tests the system&#39;s response to service failures by stopping mock services or configuring them to return error responses. The test verifies that consecutive health check failures increment the failure count, that services are marked unhealthy after reaching the failure threshold, that unhealthy services are excluded from lookup results, and that failure detection timing matches configuration.</p>\n<p>Recovery validation tests service recovery by restarting failed mock services and verifying that health checking detects the recovery, that failure counts reset after successful health checks, that services are marked healthy again, and that recovered services reappear in lookup results.</p>\n<p>Configuration validation tests health checking behavior with different configuration settings: various health check intervals, different failure thresholds, and different health check timeout values. The test should verify that configuration changes take effect correctly and that health checking behavior matches the configured parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3: HTTP API Validation</strong></p>\n<p>The Milestone 3 checkpoint validates the complete HTTP API functionality building on the registry core and health checking from previous milestones. The validation tests all API endpoints with various request types and verifies that the API correctly handles both success and error scenarios.</p>\n<p>API endpoint validation tests each endpoint with valid requests and verifies correct responses: POST /services successfully registers services and returns instance IDs, GET /services returns the complete list of services, GET /services/{name} returns instances for the specified service, DELETE /services/{name}/{id} successfully deregisters services, and GET /health returns system health status.</p>\n<p>Request validation testing verifies that the API properly validates input data and returns appropriate error responses for invalid requests: malformed JSON in registration requests, missing required fields, invalid port numbers, malformed URLs, and unsupported HTTP methods. The test should verify that error responses include helpful diagnostic information and use correct HTTP status codes.</p>\n<p>Response format validation verifies that all API responses use consistent JSON formatting, that success responses include expected data fields, that error responses follow a standard error format, and that HTTP status codes are used correctly throughout the API.</p>\n<p>Content negotiation validation tests that the API handles HTTP headers correctly: Content-Type verification for request bodies, Accept header handling for responses, and proper HTTP method handling for each endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-Milestone Integration Validation</strong></p>\n<p>The final validation checkpoint tests the complete system functionality with all milestones integrated together. This comprehensive test simulates realistic usage patterns that exercise service registration, health checking, and API operations simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The multi-service scenario registers multiple services of different types, waits for all services to become healthy, performs service discovery operations to verify all services are discoverable, simulates failure of some services, verifies that failed services are detected and excluded from discovery, recovers failed services, and verifies complete system recovery.</p>\n<p>The load testing scenario performs high-volume operations across all system components: rapid service registrations and deregistrations, high-frequency service lookups, concurrent API operations, and sustained operation under load. This test verifies that system performance remains acceptable under realistic load conditions.</p>\n<p>The persistence and recovery scenario stops and restarts the registry service while maintaining external mock services, verifies that the system recovers correctly after restart, checks that service states are restored accurately, and confirms that health checking resumes correctly after recovery.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Milestone</th>\n<th>Core Validation</th>\n<th>Performance Check</th>\n<th>Error Handling Check</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Milestone 1</td>\n<td>Registration/lookup accuracy</td>\n<td>Lookup latency under load</td>\n<td>Invalid registration handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milestone 2</td>\n<td>Health checking accuracy</td>\n<td>Health check scalability</td>\n<td>Network failure detection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Milestone 3</td>\n<td>API completeness</td>\n<td>API response times</td>\n<td>Request validation and errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Integrated</td>\n<td>End-to-end workflows</td>\n<td>System-wide performance</td>\n<td>Complete failure recovery</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Automated Validation Procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Each milestone checkpoint should be implementable as automated test suites that can be run repeatedly during development. The validation procedures should include setup scripts that start necessary mock services, configuration files that define test parameters, test execution scripts that run the validation scenarios, and cleanup procedures that restore the system to a clean state.</p>\n<p>The validation automation should produce clear pass/fail results for each checkpoint, detailed logs of test execution for debugging failed validations, performance metrics that can be tracked over time, and summary reports that highlight any regressions or improvements.</p>\n<p>Continuous integration should run these validation checkpoints automatically on code changes, ensuring that new development doesn&#39;t break existing milestone functionality. The checkpoints should also be runnable locally by developers to validate their implementations before committing changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Milestone validation checkpoints serve as both acceptance criteria verification and regression test suites. They provide concrete evidence that each milestone&#39;s functionality works correctly and continues to work as the system evolves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

Just as a detective follows clues systematically - examining physical evidence, interviewing witnesses, establishing timelines, and testing theories - debugging requires a methodical approach to gather symptoms, trace root causes, and verify solutions.</p>\n<p>The service discovery system leaves &quot;fingerprints&quot; everywhere: in logs, metrics, network traces, and registry state. Like a detective, you need to know where to look for these clues, how to interpret them, and how to piece together the story of what went wrong. Some problems are obvious &quot;smoking guns&quot; (server crashes, network failures), while others require careful investigation of subtle patterns (gradual memory leaks, race conditions, cascading failures).</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-symptoms-and-diagnosis\">Common Symptoms and Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>The first step in debugging is recognizing symptoms and mapping them to likely root causes. Service discovery systems exhibit predictable failure patterns, and understanding these patterns helps you quickly narrow down the investigation scope.</p>\n<p>The following diagnostic approach treats each symptom as a starting point for systematic investigation. Rather than randomly checking different components, this approach guides you through logical elimination of causes based on what you observe.</p>\n<h4 id=\"service-registration-issues\">Service Registration Issues</h4>\n<p>Service registration problems manifest in several distinct ways, each pointing to different underlying causes.

build upon the service registry foundation (Milestone 1), health checking capabilities (Milestone 2), and HTTP API (Milestone 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-growing-city\">Mental Model: The Growing City</h3>\n<p>Think of your service registry as a small town that&#39;s experiencing rapid growth. Right now, you have the basic infrastructure: a town hall (registry core) where residents register, a security patrol (health checker) that checks on everyone, and an information desk (HTTP API) that helps people find what they need. As the town grows into a city, you&#39;ll need additional infrastructure: multiple town halls working together (clustering), security systems (authentication and authorization), traffic management (load balancing), and specialized services (advanced health checks).</p>\n<p>Just as a city planner designs infrastructure that can be added incrementally without rebuilding the entire town, your current service registry architecture provides extension points that accommodate these enhancements without requiring fundamental rewrites. Each future extension represents a new city department that integrates with your existing infrastructure while adding specialized capabilities.</p>\n<p>The current design&#39;s modularity means these extensions can be added incrementally - you might start with simple authentication, then add clustering support, and later introduce advanced health checking protocols. Each enhancement builds upon the solid foundation you&#39;ve established while extending the system&#39;s capabilities to handle larger scale and more sophisticated requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"registry-clustering-and-high-availability\">Registry Clustering and High Availability</h3>\n<p>The most significant limitation of the current single-node design is that it represents a single point of failure. In production environments, service discovery systems must remain available even when individual nodes fail, network partitions occur, or maintenance activities require taking nodes offline.</p>\n<p>A clustered registry extension would distribute service registration data across multiple nodes, providing both high availability and horizontal scalability. This extension builds naturally on the current <code>ServiceRegistry</code> design by adding a clustering layer that manages data replication and consensus decisions across multiple registry instances.</p>\n<p><strong>Registry Cluster Architecture</strong></p>\n<p>The clustering extension introduces several new components that integrate with your existing registry core. A <code>ClusterManager</code> component would coordinate communication between registry nodes, while a <code>ConsensusEngine</code> ensures all nodes agree on service registration changes. The existing <code>ServiceRegistry</code> becomes a cluster member that participates in distributed decision-making while maintaining its current interface for local operations.</p>\n<p>Data consistency across cluster nodes requires implementing a consensus protocol like Raft or using distributed key-value stores like etcd or Consul as the backing storage. This extension point exists because your current registry design already abstracts service data through clear interfaces - adding clustering means implementing a new storage backend that happens to be distributed rather than local.</p>\n<p>The clustering extension would introduce these additional data structures:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Structure Name</th>\n<th>Fields</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ClusterNode</code></td>\n<td>NodeID string, Address string, Role string, Status string, LastSeen time.Time</td>\n<td>Represents a registry node in the cluster</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ClusterConfig</code></td>\n<td>Nodes []ClusterNode, ReplicationFactor int, ConsensusTimeout time.Duration</td>\n<td>Configuration for cluster behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ReplicationEntry</code></td>\n<td>Operation string, Data interface{}, Timestamp time.Time, NodeID string</td>\n<td>Represents a change to replicate across nodes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ConsensusResult</code></td>\n<td>Success bool, LeaderID string, Term int64, CommittedIndex int64</td>\n<td>Result of consensus operation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Cluster Operations and Consensus</strong></p>\n<p>Service registration in a clustered environment requires consensus among nodes to ensure all cluster members have consistent views of available services. When a service registers with any cluster node, that node proposes the registration to other cluster members through the consensus protocol.</p>\n<p>The consensus process follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A client sends a service registration request to any cluster node</li>\n<li>The receiving node validates the registration request locally</li>\n<li>The node proposes the registration operation to the cluster leader</li>\n<li>The leader replicates the operation to a majority of follower nodes</li>\n<li>Once a majority confirms the operation, the leader commits it</li>\n<li>All nodes apply the committed registration to their local registries</li>\n<li>The original node responds to the client with success</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach ensures that service registrations are consistent across the cluster even if individual nodes fail during the registration process. The existing <code>Register</code> method signature remains unchanged - clustering becomes an internal implementation detail that doesn&#39;t affect the public API.</p>\n<p><strong>Partition Tolerance and Split-Brain Prevention</strong></p>\n<p>Network partitions represent one of the most challenging aspects of distributed systems. When cluster nodes cannot communicate with each other, they must decide whether to continue accepting registrations (risking inconsistency) or reject them (sacrificing availability).</p>\n<p>The clustering extension would implement partition tolerance through quorum-based decision making. A cluster partition can continue operating only if it contains a majority of nodes, preventing split-brain scenarios where multiple partitions each believe they&#39;re authoritative.</p>\n<p>During a network partition, the minority partition would enter read-only mode, allowing service lookups but rejecting new registrations. This design choice prioritizes consistency over availability during partition events, which aligns with service discovery requirements where returning stale data is generally acceptable, but accepting inconsistent registrations causes serious problems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Service discovery systems typically favor consistency over availability during network partitions because returning slightly stale service information is much less problematic than having different parts of your infrastructure believe different services are available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Health Checking in Clustered Environments</strong></p>\n<p>Clustering introduces complexity to health checking because multiple nodes might attempt to health check the same service instances. The extension would implement distributed health checking coordination to avoid overwhelming services with redundant health checks while ensuring comprehensive coverage.</p>\n<p>A <code>DistributedHealthChecker</code> component would extend the existing <code>HealthChecker</code> by adding coordination logic that divides health checking responsibilities among cluster nodes. This could be implemented through consistent hashing, where each service instance is assigned to specific cluster nodes for health checking, or through leader-based coordination where a single node schedules all health checks but distributes the actual checking work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"security-and-authentication\">Security and Authentication</h3>\n<p>The current HTTP API accepts all requests without authentication or authorization, which is acceptable for development environments but inadequate for production deployments. A security extension would add multiple layers of protection while maintaining the existing API structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Authentication and Authorization</strong></p>\n<p>The security extension introduces authentication for both service registration and service lookup operations. Services registering themselves would need to prove their identity, while clients looking up services would need appropriate permissions to access service information.</p>\n<p>The extension would add these security-related data structures:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Structure Name</th>\n<th>Fields</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ServiceIdentity</code></td>\n<td>ServiceName string, Credentials string, Permissions []string, ExpiresAt time.Time</td>\n<td>Authentication information for a service</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AccessToken</code></td>\n<td>TokenID string, ServiceID string, Permissions []string, IssuedAt time.Time, ExpiresAt time.Time</td>\n<td>Bearer token for API access</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SecurityPolicy</code></td>\n<td>AllowedServices []string, RequiredPermissions map[string][]string, TokenTTL time.Duration</td>\n<td>Security configuration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AuditLogEntry</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp time.Time, ServiceID string, Operation string, Resource string, Success bool, ClientIP string</td>\n<td>Security audit trail</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Authentication could be implemented through multiple mechanisms: API keys for simple deployments, mutual TLS for high-security environments, or integration with external identity providers like OAuth 2.0 or service mesh identity systems.</p>\n<p>The security extension would modify existing HTTP API endpoints to require authentication headers and validate permissions before processing requests. Service registration would require &quot;register&quot; permission for the specific service name, while service lookup might require &quot;discover&quot; permission for the target service.</p>\n<p><strong>Mutual TLS and Certificate Management</strong></p>\n<p>For high-security environments, the extension would support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both the registry and connecting services verify each other&#39;s certificates. This provides strong cryptographic identity verification and encrypted communication channels.</p>\n<p>The mTLS extension would add certificate management capabilities to automatically issue, renew, and revoke certificates for registered services. This could integrate with certificate authorities like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider certificate services to provide a complete PKI solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Audit Logging and Compliance</strong></p>\n<p>Security extensions require comprehensive audit logging to track who accessed what services when. The extension would maintain detailed audit trails of all registry operations, including failed authentication attempts, successful service lookups, and administrative operations.</p>\n<p>Audit logs would capture sufficient information for compliance requirements and security incident investigation while being structured for automated analysis and alerting on suspicious patterns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-health-checking-protocols\">Advanced Health Checking Protocols</h3>\n<p>The current health checking implementation supports only HTTP endpoints with basic success/failure detection. Production environments often require more sophisticated health checking that can integrate with various protocols and provide nuanced health status information.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Protocol Health Checking</strong></p>\n<p>The advanced health checking extension would support multiple protocols beyond HTTP, including TCP socket checks, gRPC health checking protocol, database connection verification, and custom script-based checks.</p>\n<p>Each protocol would implement a common <code>HealthCheckProtocol</code> interface while providing protocol-specific configuration options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Protocol Type</th>\n<th>Configuration Fields</th>\n<th>Use Cases</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>HTTP</td>\n<td>Path string, Headers map[string]string, ExpectedStatus []int, Timeout time.Duration</td>\n<td>REST APIs, web services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TCP</td>\n<td>Port int, Timeout time.Duration</td>\n<td>Database connections, message queues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>gRPC</td>\n<td>ServiceName string, Timeout time.Duration</td>\n<td>gRPC microservices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Script</td>\n<td>Command string, Args []string, Timeout time.Duration, Environment map[string]string</td>\n<td>Custom application logic</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The extension would maintain the existing <code>HealthChecker</code> interface while adding protocol-specific implementations that can be configured per service instance. A service might use HTTP health checks for its API endpoint while also performing TCP checks on its database connection.</p>\n<p><strong>Composite Health Status</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced health checking introduces the concept of composite health status where a service instance reports multiple health dimensions. Instead of simple healthy/unhealthy status, services could report separate status for different subsystems.</p>\n<p>For example, a web service might report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API endpoint: healthy</li>\n<li>Database connection: degraded</li>\n<li>Cache connection: unhealthy</li>\n<li>Disk space: healthy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The composite status extension would allow services to continue receiving traffic for operations that don&#39;t require unhealthy subsystems while being removed from routing for operations that do require them.</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptive Health Checking</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of fixed check intervals, adaptive health checking adjusts check frequency based on service behavior patterns. Services that consistently pass health checks are checked less frequently, while services showing instability receive more frequent monitoring.</p>\n<p>The adaptive extension would implement algorithms that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase check frequency when services show signs of instability</li>\n<li>Reduce check frequency for consistently healthy services</li>\n<li>Implement exponential backoff for services that are clearly failed</li>\n<li>Provide burst checking during recovery periods</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach reduces system overhead while providing faster detection of service issues when they occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Check Circuit Breakers</strong></p>\n<p>When services become overloaded, aggressive health checking can make the situation worse by adding additional load. The circuit breaker extension would automatically reduce health check frequency or temporarily disable checks for services showing signs of overload.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker monitors health check response times and error rates, opening the circuit when thresholds are exceeded. During circuit-open periods, the registry assumes the service is unhealthy without performing actual checks, allowing the service to recover from overload conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"load-balancing-and-traffic-management\">Load Balancing and Traffic Management</h3>\n<p>The current registry returns all healthy service instances without providing guidance on how clients should distribute traffic among them. A traffic management extension would add intelligent load balancing recommendations and traffic steering capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Weighted Load Balancing</strong></p>\n<p>Services instances often have different capacities - some might run on larger machines or have better network connectivity. The load balancing extension would allow services to register with weight information that influences traffic distribution.</p>\n<p>The extension would add weight-aware service lookup that returns instances along with recommended traffic distribution ratios. Clients could use this information to implement weighted random selection or other load balancing algorithms that respect instance capacities.</p>\n<p><strong>Geographic and Zone-Aware Routing</strong></p>\n<p>In distributed deployments, services should prefer communicating with nearby instances to reduce latency and improve reliability. The geographic extension would add location awareness to service registration and intelligent proximity-based routing.</p>\n<p>Services would register with zone, region, and availability zone information. Client lookups could specify their own location and receive service instances sorted by proximity, with fallback to remote instances if local ones are unavailable.</p>\n<p><strong>Traffic Splitting and Canary Deployments</strong></p>\n<p>The traffic management extension would support sophisticated deployment patterns like canary releases and A/B testing by allowing services to register with version information and traffic splitting rules.</p>\n<p>A service deployment might register both v1.0 and v1.1 instances, with routing rules that direct 90% of traffic to v1.0 and 10% to v1.1. The registry would return instances according to these ratios, enabling gradual rollouts with automatic traffic distribution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"service-mesh-integration\">Service Mesh Integration</h3>\n<p>Modern microservice deployments increasingly use service mesh technologies like Istio, Linkerd, or Consul Connect. A service mesh integration extension would allow your registry to interoperate with these systems while providing additional service discovery capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidecar Proxy Integration</strong></p>\n<p>Service mesh deployments typically include sidecar proxies that handle service-to-service communication. The integration extension would support registering services through their sidecar proxies and coordinating with the service mesh control plane for traffic routing decisions.</p>\n<p>The extension would add support for service mesh protocols like Envoy&#39;s xDS (discovery service) protocol, allowing the registry to act as a data source for service mesh control planes. This enables hybrid deployments where some services use direct registry integration while others integrate through service mesh infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Policy Integration and Enforcement</strong></p>\n<p>Service meshes provide sophisticated traffic policies for security, reliability, and observability. The integration extension would respect service mesh policies when returning service discovery information, ensuring that registry responses align with mesh-level traffic management rules.</p>\n<p>For example, if the service mesh has configured circuit breakers or rate limits for specific service pairs, the registry integration would reflect this in service discovery responses, potentially filtering out instances that would violate mesh policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"observability-and-metrics\">Observability and Metrics</h3>\n<p>Production service discovery systems require comprehensive observability for monitoring, alerting, and capacity planning. The observability extension would add detailed metrics, distributed tracing, and operational dashboards.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics and Monitoring</strong></p>\n<p>The extension would expose detailed metrics about registry operations, health check performance, and service topology changes. These metrics would integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus, providing insights into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service registration and deregistration rates</li>\n<li>Health check success rates and response times</li>\n<li>API request patterns and error rates</li>\n<li>Registry resource utilization and performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The metrics would enable operational teams to understand registry behavior, detect performance issues, and plan capacity requirements for growing service deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed Tracing</strong></p>\n<p>For complex service interactions, distributed tracing provides insights into how service discovery operations contribute to overall request latency. The tracing extension would add trace spans for registry operations, allowing correlation with application traces.</p>\n<p>This enables debugging scenarios where application performance issues might be related to service discovery latency, health check delays, or registry overload conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-management-and-dynamic-updates\">Configuration Management and Dynamic Updates</h3>\n<p>The current system uses static configuration loaded at startup. A dynamic configuration extension would allow runtime updates to registry behavior without requiring restarts, enabling operational flexibility and rapid response to changing conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Configuration Updates</strong></p>\n<p>The extension would support updating health check intervals, timeout values, cleanup frequencies, and other operational parameters without service interruption. This capability is essential for production systems where configuration changes might be needed to respond to traffic patterns or performance issues.</p>\n<p>Configuration updates would be validated before application and provide rollback capabilities if updates cause problems. The system would maintain configuration history and support gradual rollout of configuration changes across clustered deployments.</p>\n<p><strong>Service-Specific Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>Different services often have different requirements for health checking frequency, timeout values, and failure thresholds. The extension would support service-specific configuration overrides that allow fine-tuning registry behavior for individual services or service categories.</p>\n<p>For example, critical services might have more aggressive health checking, while batch processing services might use longer timeouts and higher failure thresholds before being marked unhealthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-roadmap\">Implementation Roadmap</h3>\n<p>These extensions can be implemented incrementally, with each building upon the current architecture foundation. The recommended implementation order considers dependencies and operational value:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Security and Observability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic authentication and authorization</li>\n<li>Comprehensive metrics and monitoring</li>\n<li>Audit logging capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Advanced Health Checking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-protocol health checking</li>\n<li>Adaptive check intervals</li>\n<li>Composite health status</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 3: High Availability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registry clustering</li>\n<li>Distributed health checking</li>\n<li>Partition tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 4: Traffic Management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load balancing recommendations</li>\n<li>Geographic routing</li>\n<li>Service mesh integration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each phase provides immediate operational value while preparing the foundation for subsequent enhancements. The modular architecture ensures that extensions can be developed and deployed independently without disrupting existing functionality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-compatibility\">Architecture Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The current design&#39;s emphasis on clear interfaces and component separation makes it particularly well-suited for these extensions. The <code>ServiceRegistry</code> interface can accommodate clustered implementations, the <code>HealthChecker</code> component can support multiple protocols, and the HTTP API layer can add authentication middleware without changing core logic.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the extension points preserve backward compatibility, allowing existing clients to continue working while new clients take advantage of enhanced capabilities. This approach supports gradual migration and mixed-environment deployments where some services use basic features while others require advanced functionality.</p>\n<p>The modular design also supports partial deployment of extensions - an organization might implement security features immediately while deferring clustering until scale requirements justify the additional complexity. Each extension stands alone while integrating seamlessly with the core system and other extensions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-3) - This glossary provides definitions for terminology used across service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-reference-manual\">Mental Model: The Reference Manual</h3>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a reference manual for a complex piece of machinery.

Document\n\n\n## Overview\n\nA service registry system that allows microservices to announce their availability and discover other services dynamically. The key architectural challenge is maintaining an accurate, real-time view of service health across a distributed system where services can fail or become unreachable at any time.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the foundational understanding needed throughout the project.\n\n### Mental Model: The Phone Book Analogy\n\nThink of service discovery as maintaining a **dynamic phone book** for a bustling city where businesses constantly open, close, relocate, and change their phone numbers. In the traditional world, a phone book is published once a year and becomes outdated quickly. But imagine if you needed a phone book that updated itself in real-time, automatically removing businesses that closed down and adding new ones as they opened.\n\nIn a microservices architecture, each service is like a business in this city. When a new service instance starts up (like a new restaurant opening), it needs to announce itself to the registry: \"Hi, I'm the Payment Service, and I'm available at IP address 192.168.1.10 on port 8080.\" When clients need to make a payment, they consult this dynamic phone book to find all healthy instances of the Payment Service, just like you'd look up a restaurant's phone number before making a reservation.\n\nThe crucial difference from a traditional phone book is that services can fail, become overloaded, or lose network connectivity at any moment. A restaurant might close temporarily for renovations, or their phone lines might go down. In our service registry, we need to detect these situations automatically and stop directing traffic to unhealthy services. This is where **health checking** comes in – imagine having an army of inspectors who constantly call every business in the phone book to verify they're still operating and ready to serve customers.\n\nThe registry becomes the single source of truth that answers questions like: \"What are all the available instances of the User Service right now?\" or \"Is the Database Service healthy and ready to accept connections?\" Without this centralized knowledge, services would have to maintain their own lists of where to find other services, leading to configuration nightmares and stale information.\n\nThis mental model helps us understand the core challenges we're solving: **dynamic registration** (businesses announcing themselves), **real-time health monitoring** (checking if they're still operational), **efficient lookup** (finding services quickly when needed), and **automatic cleanup** (removing failed services from the directory).\n\n### Existing Solutions Comparison\n\nBefore building our own service registry, it's important to understand how existing solutions approach the service discovery problem. Each solution represents different trade-offs between complexity, performance, reliability, and operational overhead.\n\n#### DNS-Based Service Discovery\n\n**How It Works**: Traditional DNS can be extended for service discovery by creating DNS records for services, often using SRV records that specify both hostname and port information. Services register themselves by creating DNS entries, and clients discover services through DNS lookups.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of DNS-based discovery as using the existing postal system infrastructure. Every service gets a mailing address (DNS name), and when you want to reach a service, you look up its address in the postal directory (DNS server). The existing infrastructure handles the routing.\n\n| Aspect | Description | Trade-off |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Simplicity** | Leverages existing DNS infrastructure and client libraries | Very simple to implement and understand |\n| **Caching Behavior** | DNS responses are cached at multiple levels (client, resolver, authoritative) | Fast lookups but stale data during failures |\n| **Health Checking** | Limited to basic connectivity checks, no application-level health | Cannot detect application-specific failures |\n| **Update Propagation** | Bounded by DNS TTL settings, typically 30-300 seconds | Slow to reflect service changes and failures |\n| **Load Balancing** | Basic round-robin through multiple A records | Limited load balancing strategies |\n\n**Strengths**: DNS-based discovery works well for relatively stable services with long-lived instances. It requires minimal additional infrastructure since DNS is already ubiquitous. The approach integrates seamlessly with existing networking tools and doesn't require special client libraries.\n\n**Weaknesses**: The caching behavior that makes DNS fast also makes it inappropriate for dynamic environments where services frequently start, stop, or fail. A failed service might continue receiving traffic for minutes after it becomes unavailable. Additionally, DNS provides no visibility into service health beyond basic connectivity.\n\n#### Load Balancer-Centric Discovery\n\n**How It Works**: Services register themselves with a load balancer (like HAProxy, NGINX, or cloud load balancers), and clients connect to the load balancer instead of directly to service instances. The load balancer maintains the service registry internally and handles health checking, traffic distribution, and failover.\n\n**Mental Model**: Imagine a hotel concierge desk where all guests (clients) come to ask for services. The concierge maintains a current list of all available service providers (restaurants, tours, transportation) and their status. When you need something, you ask the concierge, and they direct you to an available provider. You never need to know all the providers yourself.\n\n| Aspect | Description | Trade-off |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Health Checking** | Built-in health checks with configurable protocols and intervals | Excellent health detection but centralized failure point |\n| **Performance** | Single network hop, connection pooling, traffic optimization | High performance but bottleneck at load balancer |\n| **Operational Complexity** | Requires load balancer configuration and management | Simpler for clients but complex operational overhead |\n| **Scalability** | Load balancer must handle all traffic for registered services | Excellent per-service scaling but limited by LB capacity |\n| **Visibility** | Rich metrics and monitoring through load balancer | Great observability but only at network level |\n\n**Strengths**: Load balancer-centric discovery provides excellent performance and reliability. The load balancer can perform sophisticated health checking, implement advanced routing strategies, and provide detailed traffic metrics. Clients have a simple experience – they just connect to a single, stable endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses**: This approach creates a potential bottleneck and single point of failure at the load balancer. It also adds network latency for every request and requires careful capacity planning for the load balancer itself. The operational complexity of managing load balancer configurations can become significant as the number of services grows.\n\n#### Service Mesh Solutions\n\n**How It Works**: A service mesh like Istio or Linkerd deploys a proxy (sidecar) alongside each service instance. These proxies form a mesh network that handles service-to-service communication, discovery, security, and observability. Services register with the mesh control plane, and proxies automatically discover and connect to other services.\n\n**Mental Model**: Think of a service mesh as a sophisticated telephone operator system from the early 1900s. Every service has a personal operator (the sidecar proxy) who knows how to reach every other service in the system. When your service wants to call another service, it talks to its operator, who handles finding the destination, establishing the connection, monitoring the call quality, and even encrypting the conversation.\n\n| Aspect | Description | Trade-off |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Feature Richness** | Comprehensive traffic management, security, observability | Powerful capabilities but high complexity |\n| **Transparency** | Services require minimal changes to benefit from mesh features | Easy adoption but hidden complexity |\n| **Resource Overhead** | Each service requires an additional proxy sidecar | Rich features but significant memory/CPU cost |\n| **Learning Curve** | Complex configuration and troubleshooting requirements | Advanced capabilities but steep learning curve |\n| **Operational Overhead** | Requires dedicated platform team to manage mesh infrastructure | Enterprise-grade features but substantial operational burden |\n\n**Strengths**: Service meshes provide the most comprehensive solution, handling not just service discovery but also security (mTLS), advanced traffic routing, observability, and policy enforcement. They offer fine-grained control over service communication and can be incrementally adopted without major application changes.\n\n**Weaknesses**: The complexity and resource overhead can be overwhelming, especially for smaller teams or simpler use cases. Each service instance requires additional memory and CPU for the sidecar proxy, and troubleshooting network issues becomes significantly more complex when every connection flows through multiple proxies.\n\n#### Dedicated Service Registry Solutions\n\n**How It Works**: Purpose-built service registries like Consul, etcd, or Eureka provide specialized APIs for service registration, discovery, and health checking. Services actively register themselves via API calls, and clients query the registry to discover healthy service instances.\n\n**Mental Model**: This is like having a specialized business directory service that's designed specifically for the needs of a rapidly changing marketplace. Unlike a general-purpose phone book, this directory is built from the ground up to handle businesses that frequently change locations, hours, and availability. It has dedicated staff (health checkers) who constantly verify business information and provides specialized search capabilities.\n\n| Aspect | Description | Trade-off |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Purpose-Built** | APIs designed specifically for service discovery use cases | Excellent fit for purpose but additional infrastructure |\n| **Flexibility** | Configurable health checking, metadata, and query capabilities | Highly customizable but requires configuration expertise |\n| **Consistency** | Strong consistency guarantees for registration data | Reliable state but potential availability trade-offs |\n| **Integration** | Rich client libraries and integration patterns | Easy to integrate but adds dependency |\n| **Scalability** | Designed to handle large numbers of services and frequent updates | Excellent scalability but requires proper deployment |\n\n**Strengths**: Dedicated registries excel at service discovery workflows and provide exactly the APIs and features needed for microservice architectures. They offer sophisticated health checking, rich metadata support, and strong consistency guarantees. The query capabilities are optimized for service discovery patterns.\n\n**Weaknesses**: Adding another infrastructure component increases operational complexity and introduces additional failure modes. Teams must learn registry-specific APIs and configuration patterns, and the registry itself becomes a critical dependency that must be highly available.\n\n#### Comparison Summary and Project Rationale\n\n| Solution | Best For | Avoid When | Complexity | Performance |\n|----------|----------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| **DNS** | Stable, long-lived services | Dynamic, frequently changing services | Low | Good |\n| **Load Balancer** | High-performance, centralized routing | Diverse service communication patterns | Medium | Excellent |\n| **Service Mesh** | Enterprise microservices with advanced requirements | Simple use cases, resource-constrained environments | High | Good |\n| **Dedicated Registry** | Purpose-built service discovery with flexibility | Minimal infrastructure, simple scenarios | Medium | Excellent |\n\n> **Design Insight**: For learning purposes, we're building a dedicated service registry because it best demonstrates the core concepts of service discovery without the abstractions of other approaches. Understanding how registration, health checking, and lookup work at the fundamental level provides the foundation for appreciating why other solutions make the trade-offs they do.\n\n**Why We're Building Our Own**: Our project implements a dedicated service registry approach because it provides the clearest learning path for understanding service discovery fundamentals. By building the registry, health checker, and API layer ourselves, we'll understand the challenges that existing solutions address: how to handle concurrent registrations, how to detect and respond to service failures, how to provide consistent views of service health, and how to design APIs that are both simple and powerful.\n\nThis hands-on experience with the core algorithms and data structures will make it much easier to understand the design decisions in production systems like Consul or Eureka. We'll encounter the same fundamental trade-offs around consistency vs. availability, push vs. pull health checking, and centralized vs. distributed architectures that influence all service discovery solutions.\n\nThe registry we build will be simpler than production systems but will demonstrate the essential concepts that apply regardless of implementation. Once you understand how service registration state machines work, how health check failures propagate through the system, and how to design APIs for efficient service lookup, you'll be well-equipped to work with any service discovery solution.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the scope and boundaries that guide design decisions throughout the project.\n\n### Mental Model: The Hotel Concierge Service\n\nThink of this service registry like a hotel concierge desk in a busy metropolitan hotel. The concierge maintains a comprehensive directory of all local services - restaurants, theaters, transportation options, and medical facilities. When guests need recommendations, they don't wander the streets hoping to stumble upon what they need. Instead, they ask the concierge, who provides current, accurate information about what's available and operational.\n\nHowever, the concierge doesn't just maintain a static phone book. They actively verify that recommended services are still operating - calling restaurants to confirm they're open, checking theater schedules, and removing temporarily closed businesses from their active recommendations. The concierge also doesn't handle the actual transactions; they don't make dinner reservations or buy theater tickets. Their job is purely to maintain accurate, up-to-date information about what services exist and how to reach them.\n\nThis analogy captures the essence of what we're building: a system that maintains current information about available services and provides reliable discovery, but doesn't handle the actual service-to-service communication or complex distributed coordination.\n\n### Primary Goals\n\nOur service registry aims to solve the fundamental **service discovery** problem in distributed systems by providing a centralized, authoritative source of truth about service availability. This system will enable microservices to dynamically discover and communicate with each other without hardcoded network locations or static configuration files.\n\n#### Goal 1: Reliable Service Registration and Discovery\n\nThe registry must provide a simple yet robust mechanism for services to announce their availability and for clients to discover healthy service instances. When a new instance of a payment service starts up, it should be able to register itself with minimal configuration. When an order service needs to process a payment, it should reliably discover available payment service instances without knowing their specific network locations in advance.\n\n| Operation | Requirement | Success Criteria |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n| Service Registration | Services can announce availability with metadata | Returns unique instance ID, stores host/port/tags |\n| Service Lookup | Clients can find healthy instances by service name | Returns list of available instances with connection details |\n| Service Deregistration | Services can cleanly remove themselves when shutting down | Instance no longer appears in lookup results |\n| Bulk Discovery | Clients can retrieve all available services and their instances | Returns complete registry state for debugging/monitoring |\n\nThe registration process must handle essential metadata including service name, network endpoint (host and port), optional tags for service variants, and unique instance identification. This metadata enables both basic discovery and more advanced routing patterns where clients might need specific service variants.\n\n#### Goal 2: Automated Health Monitoring and Failure Detection\n\nThe registry must automatically detect failed or unresponsive services and remove them from active discovery results. In dynamic environments where services can crash, become overloaded, or experience network partitions, stale registry information leads to connection failures and cascading errors throughout the system.\n\n| Health Check Type | Implementation | Failure Detection |\n|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| HTTP Health Endpoints | Poll `/health` endpoints at configurable intervals | Mark unhealthy after consecutive failures |\n| TCP Connectivity | Verify network connectivity to service ports | Detect network partitions and service crashes |\n| Response Latency | Monitor health check response times | Identify overloaded or degrading services |\n| Custom Protocols | Support gRPC health checking protocol | Enable health checks for non-HTTP services |\n\nThe **health checking** system operates as a background process that continuously monitors registered services. Rather than relying on services to actively maintain their registration (which fails when services crash unexpectedly), the registry proactively verifies service health and automatically removes unresponsive instances.\n\n#### Goal 3: HTTP API for Integration\n\nThe registry must expose all operations through a well-designed REST API that services and operational tools can easily integrate with. This API serves as the primary interface for service registration during startup, service discovery during runtime, and administrative operations for monitoring and debugging.\n\n| API Category | Endpoints | Purpose |\n|--------------|-----------|---------|\n| Service Management | `POST /services`, `DELETE /services/{name}/{id}` | Register and deregister service instances |\n| Service Discovery | `GET /services/{name}`, `GET /services` | Look up healthy instances and browse registry |\n| Health Monitoring | `GET /health/status`, `GET /health/services/{name}` | Monitor system health and troubleshoot issues |\n| Administrative | `GET /admin/stats`, `POST /admin/gc` | Operational monitoring and maintenance |\n\nThe API design emphasizes simplicity and discoverability. Services should be able to integrate with minimal client library dependencies, using standard HTTP clients and JSON serialization available in any programming language.\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nUnderstanding what this service registry will **not** provide is equally important for setting appropriate expectations and avoiding scope creep during implementation.\n\n#### Non-Goal 1: Service Mesh or Traffic Management\n\nThis registry is purely an information service - it maintains data about service locations but does not participate in actual service-to-service communication. We will not implement load balancing algorithms, circuit breakers, retry logic, or traffic shaping capabilities.\n\n| Service Mesh Feature | Why Not Included | Alternative Approach |\n|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Load Balancing | Client-side responsibility | Clients implement load balancing using registry data |\n| Circuit Breakers | Application-level concern | Services implement circuit breakers independently |\n| Traffic Splitting | Requires **sidecar proxy** infrastructure | Use service tags for blue/green deployments |\n| Mutual TLS | Complex PKI infrastructure | Services handle TLS termination directly |\n\nThe registry provides the data foundation that enables these features, but implementing them remains the responsibility of client applications or dedicated infrastructure components like service mesh **sidecar proxy** processes.\n\n#### Non-Goal 2: Distributed Consensus or Multi-Node Clustering\n\nThis implementation focuses on a single-node registry that can be deployed as a centralized service. We will not implement distributed consensus algorithms (like Raft or PBFT), multi-master replication, or automatic failover capabilities.\n\n| Distributed Feature | Complexity Introduced | Single-Node Alternative |\n|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Consensus Algorithms | Leader election, log replication, partition handling | Deploy multiple independent registries |\n| Data Replication | Consistency guarantees, conflict resolution | Use external backup/restore mechanisms |\n| Automatic Failover | Split-brain detection, membership management | Implement manual failover procedures |\n| Cross-Region Sync | Network partition tolerance, eventual consistency | Deploy regional registry instances |\n\nWhile this limits high availability, it dramatically simplifies the implementation and makes the system easier to reason about, debug, and operate. Production deployments can achieve redundancy through external mechanisms like database replication or deployment automation.\n\n#### Non-Goal 3: Complex Service Routing or Protocol Translation\n\nThe registry will not implement service routing logic, protocol translation, or advanced service composition patterns. These capabilities require deep integration with application protocols and business logic.\n\n| Advanced Feature | Implementation Complexity | Recommended Approach |\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Protocol Translation | HTTP ↔ gRPC conversion, message transformation | Use dedicated API gateways |\n| Service Composition | Workflow orchestration, transaction coordination | Implement in application layer |\n| Dynamic Routing | A/B testing, canary deployments, feature flags | Use service tags + client-side logic |\n| Request Transformation | Header manipulation, payload modification | Handle in reverse proxies or gateways |\n\nThe registry provides service metadata (including tags and version information) that enables client applications to implement these patterns, but it does not dictate how services should communicate or route requests.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: Registry Scope - Information Service vs Infrastructure Service**\n> - **Context**: Service registries can range from simple directories to full-featured service mesh control planes\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Full service mesh with traffic management\n>   2. Registry with basic load balancing\n>   3. Pure information service\n> - **Decision**: Implement as pure information service\n> - **Rationale**: Focuses implementation on core **service discovery** problem without coupling to specific communication patterns or load balancing strategies\n> - **Consequences**: Enables simple, reliable implementation but requires clients to handle traffic management\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Full Service Mesh | Complete solution, advanced traffic features | Extreme complexity, tight coupling |\n| Registry + Load Balancing | Moderate functionality, some traffic help | Still complex, assumes specific patterns |\n| Pure Information Service | Simple, focused, widely applicable | Clients must implement traffic logic |\n\n> **Decision: Single-Node vs Distributed Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Production registries often require high availability and geographic distribution\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Distributed consensus (Raft/etcd-style)\n>   2. Eventually consistent replication\n>   3. Single-node with external backup\n> - **Decision**: Single-node architecture\n> - **Rationale**: Distributed consensus adds significant complexity that obscures core learning objectives; single-node registry is still valuable for many use cases\n> - **Consequences**: Simpler implementation and debugging, but requires external solutions for high availability\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Distributed Consensus | High availability, automatic failover | Complex algorithms, difficult debugging |\n| Eventually Consistent | Good availability, simpler than consensus | Conflict resolution, temporary inconsistency |\n| Single-Node + Backup | Simple implementation, clear semantics | Manual failover, single point of failure |\n\n> **Decision: Health Check Responsibility - Active vs Passive**\n> - **Context**: Service health can be monitored by having services report status or by actively checking them\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. TTL-based heartbeats (services actively report)\n>   2. Active health checking (registry polls services)\n>   3. Hybrid approach\n> - **Decision**: Primary active health checking with TTL backup\n> - **Rationale**: Active checking provides more reliable failure detection since crashed services cannot send heartbeats\n> - **Consequences**: Registry must manage background checking processes but provides more accurate health status\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| TTL Heartbeats | Simple, low registry overhead | Fails when services crash ungracefully |\n| Active Health Checks | Reliable failure detection | Higher registry complexity and resource usage |\n| Hybrid Approach | Best of both worlds | Implementation complexity, potential conflicts |\n\n### Design Principles and Constraints\n\nThe following principles guide design decisions throughout the implementation and help resolve ambiguity when extending the system.\n\n#### Principle 1: Simplicity Over Completeness\n\nWhen choosing between adding features and maintaining simplicity, we prioritize simplicity. This registry should be easy to understand, debug, and extend. Complex features that benefit only specific use cases should be left for future extensions or external tools.\n\n> The goal is to build a service registry that a junior developer can understand completely after reading the code for a few hours, not a feature-complete service mesh that requires months to master.\n\n#### Principle 2: Explicit Over Implicit\n\nService registration, health check configuration, and failure modes should be explicit rather than hidden behind automatic discovery or complex heuristics. Services should clearly declare their endpoints and health check requirements rather than relying on convention-based discovery.\n\n#### Principle 3: Fail-Safe Over Fail-Fast\n\nWhen the registry encounters ambiguous situations (like temporary network partitions), it should err on the side of leaving services available rather than aggressively removing them. False positives (showing unhealthy services as healthy) are generally preferable to false negatives (removing healthy services).\n\n### Success Criteria and Acceptance Testing\n\nEach milestone includes specific acceptance criteria, but the overall system success can be measured through these key scenarios:\n\n| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Validation Method |\n|----------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Service Startup | New service registers and becomes discoverable within seconds | Automated integration test |\n| Service Failure | Failed service removed from discovery within configured timeout | Fault injection test |\n| Network Partition | Registry continues operating for existing services | Network simulation test |\n| High Load | Registry handles hundreds of concurrent lookups without degradation | Load testing with metrics |\n| API Usability | New developers can integrate services using only API documentation | User testing exercise |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| HTTP Server | Go `net/http` with `gorilla/mux` | Gin or Echo framework |\n| Data Storage | In-memory with Go maps | SQLite or embedded database |\n| Health Checking | Go `net/http.Client` with timeouts | Custom client pool with connection reuse |\n| Concurrency | Go `sync.RWMutex` for registry access | Channels and worker pools |\n| Serialization | Go `encoding/json` | Protocol Buffers or MessagePack |\n| Configuration | Command-line flags with Go `flag` | Configuration files with Viper |\n\n#### Core Project Structure\n\n```\nservice-discovery/\n  cmd/\n    registry/\n      main.go                 ← Entry point, CLI setup\n  internal/\n    registry/\n      registry.go            ← ServiceRegistry implementation\n      registry_test.go       ← Core registry tests\n    health/\n      checker.go             ← Health checking logic\n      checker_test.go        ← Health check tests\n    api/\n      handlers.go            ← HTTP API handlers\n      middleware.go          ← Request logging, CORS\n      api_test.go            ← API integration tests\n    models/\n      service.go             ← ServiceInstance and HealthStatus types\n  pkg/\n    client/\n      client.go              ← Client library for service integration\n  docker/\n    Dockerfile              ← Container deployment\n  docs/\n    api.md                  ← API documentation\n  examples/\n    sample-service/         ← Example service for testing\n```\n\n#### Configuration Management Skeleton\n\n```go\n// Config holds all registry configuration options\ntype Config struct {\n    // Server configuration\n    Port                int           `json:\"port\" default:\"8080\"`\n    Host               string        `json:\"host\" default:\"localhost\"`\n    \n    // Health checking configuration  \n    HealthCheckInterval time.Duration `json:\"health_check_interval\" default:\"10s\"`\n    HealthTimeout      time.Duration `json:\"health_timeout\" default:\"5s\"`\n    MaxFailures        int          `json:\"max_failures\" default:\"3\"`\n    \n    // Registry configuration\n    TTL                time.Duration `json:\"ttl\" default:\"60s\"`\n    CleanupInterval    time.Duration `json:\"cleanup_interval\" default:\"30s\"`\n}\n\n// LoadConfig reads configuration from environment and files\nfunc LoadConfig() (*Config, error) {\n    // TODO: Implement configuration loading from:\n    // 1.

Using Go maps without proper synchronization leads to data races and potential crashes.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Go maps are not thread-safe. Concurrent reads and writes cause undefined behavior and can crash the program.\n\n**How to fix:** Always protect registry state with `sync.RWMutex`. Use read locks for lookups and write locks for registration/deregistration.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Health Checks**\nImplementing health checks that block the main registry thread while waiting for HTTP responses. This causes the entire registry to become unresponsive during network timeouts.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** Health checks can take several seconds to timeout. Blocking the main thread prevents new registrations and lookups.\n\n**How to fix:** Run health checks in separate goroutines and communicate results through channels. Set aggressive timeouts on HTTP clients used for health checking.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Unbounded Growth**\nForgetting to clean up deregistered services or failed health check records. Over time, the registry accumulates stale data and consumes unbounded memory.\n\n**Why it's wrong:** In long-running deployments, memory usage grows without bound, eventually causing out-of-memory crashes.\n\n**How to fix:** Implement background cleanup processes that remove stale entries. Use TTL-based expiration for registration records and limit the size of health check history.\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section establishes the architectural foundation that supports service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API exposure (Milestone 3).\n\n### Component Overview\n\nThink of our service discovery system like a **modern hotel with smart operations**. The hotel has three key departments working together: the **Reception Desk** (Registry Core) maintains the guest registry and handles check-ins and check-outs, the **Security Team** (Health Checker) does regular rounds to verify guests are actually in their rooms and responsive, and the **Concierge Service** (HTTP API) provides a friendly interface for guests and external visitors to interact with hotel services. Each department has distinct responsibilities, but they must coordinate seamlessly to maintain an accurate, real-time picture of who's staying where and whether they're available.\n\n![System Component Architecture](./diagrams/system-components.svg)\n\nOur service discovery system consists of three primary components that work in concert to provide reliable service registration and discovery capabilities. Each component has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with others through carefully designed interfaces.\n\n**The Registry Core** serves as the authoritative source of truth for all service instance information. It maintains an in-memory data structure that maps service names to collections of registered instances, along with their current health status. This component handles the fundamental operations of service registration, deregistration, and lookup. When a service wants to announce its availability, the Registry Core assigns it a unique identifier, stores its metadata (name, host, port, tags, and health endpoint), and initializes its health status tracking. The Registry Core also enforces time-to-live (TTL) semantics, automatically removing instances that haven't sent heartbeats within the configured timeout period. All operations on the registry are thread-safe, allowing concurrent registrations, lookups, and health updates without data corruption.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight:** The Registry Core operates entirely in memory for maximum performance. This means lookup operations can respond in microseconds rather than milliseconds, which is crucial for high-throughput microservice environments where service discovery is on the critical path of every request.\n\n**The Health Checker** operates as a background component responsible for continuously monitoring the health of all registered service instances. It maintains a separate goroutine (or thread) for each health check protocol and schedules periodic health verification requests according to configurable intervals. When a health check fails, the Health Checker implements a failure counting mechanism rather than immediately marking the service as unhealthy, which protects against transient network issues. Only after consecutive failures exceed the configured threshold does it notify the Registry Core to mark the instance as unavailable. The Health Checker supports multiple protocols (HTTP, TCP, and gRPC) and can be extended with additional health check mechanisms as needed.\n\nThe Health Checker's relationship with the Registry Core is carefully designed to avoid tight coupling. Rather than directly modifying registry state, it communicates health status changes through a well-defined interface. This allows the Registry Core to maintain control over its data consistency and enables features like health status caching and batched updates.\n\n**The HTTP API Layer** provides the external interface through which services and clients interact with the service registry. It exposes REST endpoints for service registration, deregistration, lookup, and health status queries. This component handles HTTP request parsing, input validation, error handling, and response formatting. It translates between HTTP semantics and the internal operations of the Registry Core, ensuring that web clients can easily integrate with the service discovery system using standard HTTP tools and libraries.\n\nThe API layer implements proper HTTP status codes, content negotiation, and error responses to provide a developer-friendly experience. It also handles concerns like request logging, metrics collection, and rate limiting that are essential for production deployment but separate from the core service discovery logic.\n\n| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Interfaces | Data Ownership |\n|-----------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Registry Core | Service instance storage and lookup | `Register()`, `Deregister()`, `Lookup()`, `UpdateHealth()` | Service metadata, health status, instance mappings |\n| Health Checker | Continuous health monitoring | `StartHealthCheck()`, `StopHealthCheck()`, `CheckHealth()` | Health check schedules, failure counters |\n| HTTP API | External service interface | REST endpoints: `/services`, `/services/{name}`, `/health` | HTTP request/response handling |\n\n### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe codebase should be organized to reflect the logical separation of concerns between our three main components, while providing clear boundaries between public interfaces and internal implementation details. This structure supports both development clarity and testing isolation.\n\n```\nservice-discovery/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── server/\n│       └── main.go                    # Application entry point, configuration loading\n├── internal/\n│   ├── config/\n│   │   ├── config.go                  # Configuration structure and loading logic\n│   │   └── config_test.go             # Configuration parsing tests\n│   ├── registry/\n│   │   ├── registry.go                # Registry Core implementation\n│   │   ├── registry_test.go           # Unit tests for registry operations\n│   │   ├── models.go                  # ServiceInstance, HealthStatus data structures\n│   │   └── errors.go                  # Registry-specific error types\n│   ├── health/\n│   │   ├── checker.go                 # Health Checker implementation\n│   │   ├── checker_test.go            # Health checking unit tests\n│   │   ├── protocols.go               # HTTP, TCP, gRPC health check protocols\n│   │   └── scheduler.go               # Health check scheduling logic\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── server.go                  # HTTP server setup and routing\n│   │   ├── handlers.go                # REST endpoint handlers\n│   │   ├── handlers_test.go           # HTTP handler unit tests\n│   │   ├── middleware.go              # Logging, validation, error handling middleware\n│   │   └── responses.go               # HTTP response formatting utilities\n│   └── testutil/\n│       ├── fixtures.go                # Test data and mock services\n│       └── integration.go             # Integration test helpers\n├── pkg/\n│   └── client/\n│       ├── client.go                  # Service discovery client library\n│       └── client_test.go             # Client library tests\n├── docs/\n│   ├── api.md                         # REST API documentation\n│   └── examples/                      # Usage examples and tutorials\n├── docker/\n│   ├── Dockerfile                     # Container image definition\n│   └── docker-compose.yml             # Multi-service development setup\n├── go.mod                             # Go module definition\n├── go.sum                             # Dependency checksums\n├── Makefile                           # Build and test automation\n└── README.md                          # Project overview and setup instructions\n```\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Internal vs Pkg Organization**\n> - **Context**: Go projects need to decide what code should be publicly importable versus internal-only\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Everything in `pkg/` (fully public)\n>   2. Everything in `internal/` (fully private)\n>   3. Core logic in `internal/`, client library in `pkg/`\n> - **Decision**: Core service discovery logic in `internal/`, client library in `pkg/`\n> - **Rationale**: The service discovery server itself is an application, not a library. However, services need a client library to interact with it. This separation prevents external packages from importing server internals while providing a clean client interface.\n> - **Consequences**: Clear API boundaries, easier testing, prevents coupling between client and server implementations\n\nThe `internal/` directory structure reflects our three-component architecture. Each component gets its own package with clearly defined responsibilities:\n\n**Registry Package** (`internal/registry/`) contains the Registry Core implementation along with all data models used throughout the system. The `models.go` file defines `ServiceInstance`, `HealthStatus`, and other core data structures, ensuring consistent data representation across components. Custom error types in `errors.go` provide specific error handling for registry operations like duplicate registration or instance not found.\n\n**Health Package** (`internal/health/`) encapsulates all health checking logic. The separation between `checker.go` (core health checking logic) and `protocols.go` (protocol-specific implementations) allows easy extension with new health check types. The `scheduler.go` file handles the complex timing logic for periodic health checks, failure tracking, and backoff strategies.\n\n**API Package** (`internal/api/`) implements the HTTP interface layer. The separation between `server.go` (HTTP server setup) and `handlers.go` (request handling logic) follows standard web service patterns. Middleware components handle cross-cutting concerns like request logging, authentication, and error handling without cluttering the core handler logic.\n\nThe `pkg/client/` package provides a Go client library that other services can import to interact with the service registry. This client encapsulates the HTTP API calls and provides a more convenient, strongly-typed interface for service registration and discovery operations.\n\n| Directory | Purpose | Public/Private | Dependencies |\n|-----------|---------|----------------|--------------|\n| `cmd/server/` | Application entry point | Private | All internal packages |\n| `internal/registry/` | Registry Core logic | Private | `internal/config` only |\n| `internal/health/` | Health checking | Private | `internal/registry`, `internal/config` |\n| `internal/api/` | HTTP API handlers | Private | `internal/registry`, `internal/health` |\n| `internal/config/` | Configuration management | Private | Standard library only |\n| `pkg/client/` | Client library | Public | Standard library only |\n\nThis structure supports the development workflow across all three milestones. Milestone 1 (Service Registry) focuses primarily on `internal/registry/`, Milestone 2 (Health Checking) adds `internal/health/`, and Milestone 3 (HTTP API) completes the system with `internal/api/`. The clear separation allows incremental development and testing of each component without complex dependencies.\n\n> **Critical Implementation Note:** The dependency direction flows from API layer → Health Checker → Registry Core → Config. This prevents circular dependencies and ensures that the Registry Core remains the authoritative component that other layers build upon, rather than being tightly coupled to HTTP or health checking concerns.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance provides the foundation for organizing and building the service discovery system. The recommended technologies balance simplicity for learning with production readiness, while the file structure and starter code give you a solid foundation to build upon.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| HTTP Server | `net/http` with `gorilla/mux` |

Each **service instance** is like an employee record containing their name, desk location (host and port), department tags, and how to reach them for status updates (health endpoint). The **health status** is like a wellness tracker showing whether each employee is currently available, when they were last checked on, and how many consecutive sick days they've had. The **service registry** itself is like the HR database that maintains all employee records, tracks their wellness status, and provides lookup capabilities when other departments need to find someone.\n\nJust as an employee directory needs to handle new hires (registration), departures (deregistration), relocations (updates), and sick leave (health status changes), our data model must capture all the information needed to track service instances throughout their lifecycle. The key insight is that we're not just storing static information—we're maintaining a living directory that reflects the current state of our distributed system.\n\n![Data Model Relationships](./diagrams/data-model.svg)\n\n### Core Data Structures\n\nThe service discovery system centers around three primary data structures that work together to maintain a complete picture of service availability and health. Each structure serves a specific purpose while maintaining clear relationships with the others.\n\nThe `ServiceInstance` represents a single running instance of a service that has registered itself with our registry. This is the fundamental unit of service discovery—each instance contains all the information needed for other services to connect to it and verify its health. The structure captures both the networking details required for communication and the metadata needed for service selection and routing decisions.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| name | string | Service name used for discovery lookups (e.g., \"user-service\", \"payment-api\") |\n| host | string | Network host where the service instance is running (IP address or hostname) |\n| port | int | TCP port number on which the service instance is listening for requests |\n| tags | []string | Metadata labels for filtering and routing (e.g., \"production\", \"v2\", \"us-west\") |\n| health_endpoint | string | HTTP endpoint path for health checks (e.g., \"/health\", \"/status\") |\n\nThe `HealthStatus` tracks the current wellness state of each service instance. This structure is updated continuously by our health checking system and determines whether an instance should be included in discovery results. The health status provides both current state information and historical context about recent failures.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| status | string | Current health state: \"healthy\", \"unhealthy\", or \"unknown\" |\n| last_check | timestamp | When the most recent health check was performed |\n| failure_count | int | Number of consecutive failed health checks since last success |\n\nThe `ServiceRegistry` serves as the central repository that coordinates all service discovery operations. It maintains the complete mapping between service names and their instances, integrates with the health checking system, and provides thread-safe access to registry data. This structure represents the core state of our entire service discovery system.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| services | map[string][]RegistryEntry | Map from service names to lists of registered instances |\n| health_checker | HealthChecker | Component responsible for monitoring instance health |\n| config | Config | System configuration including timeouts, intervals, and limits |\n\n### Supporting Data Structures\n\nBeyond the core structures, several supporting types handle configuration, internal state management, and API interactions. These structures provide the scaffolding that enables the core components to work together effectively.\n\nThe `Config` structure centralizes all system configuration parameters, making it easy to adjust behavior without code changes. This structure determines how aggressively we check health, how long we wait for responses, and how quickly we clean up failed instances.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Port | int | HTTP port for the registry API server |\n| Host | string | Host address to bind the API server |\n| HealthCheckInterval | duration | How frequently to check each instance's health |\n| HealthTimeout | duration | Maximum time to wait for health check responses |\n| MaxFailures | int | Consecutive failures before marking instance unhealthy |\n| TTL | duration | Time-to-live for service registrations before automatic cleanup |\n| CleanupInterval | duration | How frequently to remove expired registrations |\n\nThe `RegistryEntry` serves as an internal structure that combines instance information with its health status. This structure is not exposed directly through APIs but provides the registry core with a unified view of each service instance's complete state.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| instance | ServiceInstance | The service instance registration details |\n| health | HealthStatus | Current health status and check history |\n| registered_at | timestamp | When this instance was first registered |\n| instance_id | string | Unique identifier for this specific instance |\n\n### API Response Structures\n\nThe HTTP API layer requires standardized response formats that provide consistent interfaces for clients. These structures ensure that all API responses follow the same patterns, making the system easier to integrate with and debug.\n\nThe `ServiceList` structure formats discovery query responses, providing clients with all the information needed to connect to healthy service instances. This structure includes both the instance details and sufficient metadata for clients to make intelligent routing decisions.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| service_name | string | Name of the requested service |\n| instances | []ServiceInstance | List of healthy instances available for connection |\n| total_count | int | Total number of registered instances (including unhealthy) |\n| healthy_count | int | Number of instances currently passing health checks |\n\nThe `ErrorResponse` provides standardized error reporting across all API endpoints. Consistent error formatting helps clients handle failures gracefully and provides operators with clear diagnostic information.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| error | string | Human-readable error message describing what went wrong |\n| error_code | string | Machine-readable error identifier for programmatic handling |\n| details | map[string]interface{} | Additional context information specific to the error type |\n\nThe `SuccessResponse` wraps successful API operations with metadata about the operation result. This structure provides confirmation of successful operations along with any relevant result data.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| success | bool | Always true for successful responses |\n| data | interface{} | The actual result data (varies by endpoint) |\n| message | string | Optional human-readable success message |\n\n### Data Relationships and Lifecycle\n\nUnderstanding how these data structures relate to each other reveals the complete picture of service discovery operations. The relationships between structures define the data flow and lifecycle management patterns that drive the entire system.\n\nEach `ServiceInstance` in the registry has a corresponding `HealthStatus` that tracks its current wellness state. This one-to-one relationship is maintained internally through the `RegistryEntry` structure, which acts as a container that keeps instance data and health information synchronized. When a service instance is registered, both the instance details and an initial health status are created together, ensuring they remain linked throughout the instance's lifetime.\n\nThe `ServiceRegistry` maintains collections of these linked instance-health pairs, organized by service name for efficient lookup operations. The registry structure serves as the authoritative source of truth about which services exist and which instances are currently available. This centralized approach ensures consistency across all discovery operations while providing the single point of control needed for health checking and cleanup operations.\n\nService instances progress through a well-defined lifecycle that's reflected in the data model. Upon registration, an instance starts with \"unknown\" health status until the first health check completes. Successful health checks transition the instance to \"healthy\" status, making it available for discovery queries. Failed health checks increment the failure count, and consecutive failures eventually transition the instance to \"unhealthy\" status, removing it from discovery results while keeping the registration record for potential recovery.\n\n> The critical insight here is that instance registration and health status are managed as a unified lifecycle—you cannot have healthy instances without registration, and you cannot have useful registrations without health tracking.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe data model design involves several key architectural decisions that significantly impact system behavior, performance, and maintainability. Each decision represents a trade-off between different approaches, and understanding these choices helps explain why the system behaves as it does.\n\n> **Decision: Embedded Health Status vs. Separate Health Store**\n> - **Context**: We need to track health status for each registered service instance, and we must decide whether to store health data alongside instance data or in a separate data structure.\n> - **Options Considered**: Embedded health in RegistryEntry, separate health map indexed by instance ID, external health database\n> - **Decision**: Embed health status directly in RegistryEntry structure\n> - **Rationale**: Co-locating instance and health data ensures atomic updates, simplifies lookup operations, and eliminates consistency issues between separate stores. The performance overhead is minimal since we access both pieces of data together in most operations.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables atomic health updates, simplifies concurrent access patterns, but increases memory usage per instance and couples health checking to registry storage.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Embedded health | Atomic updates, simpler lookups, consistency guaranteed | Higher memory usage, coupled storage |\n| Separate health map | Lower memory per instance, flexible health backends | Consistency challenges, complex updates |\n| External health database | Scalable storage, independent scaling | Network overhead, eventual consistency |\n\n> **Decision: Service Name as Primary Index vs. Instance ID**\n> - **Context**: The registry must support both service discovery (find instances by name) and health updates (update specific instances), requiring an indexing strategy that supports both access patterns efficiently.\n> - **Options Considered**: Service name primary index with linear instance search, instance ID primary index with reverse name lookup, dual indexing with both approaches\n> - **Decision**: Service name as primary index with instance ID for secondary access\n> - **Rationale**: Service discovery is the primary use case and must be optimized for performance. Health updates happen less frequently and can tolerate linear search within a service's instance list, which is typically small (under 100 instances per service).\n> - **Consequences**: Fast service discovery lookups, simple data structure, but slower instance-specific operations and potential for duplicate instance handling.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Service name primary | Fast discovery, simple structure | Slower instance updates |\n| Instance ID primary | Fast instance operations | Slow discovery, complex structure |\n| Dual indexing | Fast both operations | Memory overhead, consistency complexity |\n\n> **Decision: Failure Count vs. Failure History**\n> - **Context**: Health checking needs to distinguish between transient failures and persistent problems, requiring a decision about how much failure history to maintain for each instance.\n> - **Options Considered**: Simple failure counter, sliding window of recent checks, complete failure history with timestamps\n> - **Decision**: Simple failure counter with reset on success\n> - **Rationale**: A failure counter provides sufficient information to detect persistent failures while keeping memory usage constant. More complex history tracking adds little value since we only need to know \"is this instance consistently failing\" rather than detailed failure patterns.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables effective failure detection with minimal memory overhead, but loses information about failure patterns and recovery timing.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Simple counter | Low memory, easy logic | Limited failure insight |\n| Sliding window | Better failure patterns | Higher memory, complex logic |\n| Complete history | Full failure analysis | Memory growth, processing overhead |\n\n### Data Validation and Constraints\n\nThe data model enforces several validation rules and constraints that ensure system correctness and prevent common configuration errors. These constraints are checked at data creation time and help maintain registry integrity throughout system operation.\n\nService instance validation ensures that all networking information is properly formatted and reachable. The service name must follow DNS-compatible naming conventions since it's used for discovery lookups that may integrate with DNS-based systems. Host addresses must be valid IP addresses or resolvable hostnames, and port numbers must fall within the valid TCP port range (1-65535). Health endpoint paths must be valid HTTP paths starting with a forward slash.\n\nHealth status validation maintains consistency in status reporting and prevents invalid state transitions. The status field accepts only predefined values (\"healthy\", \"unhealthy\", \"unknown\") to ensure consistent interpretation across all system components. Failure counts must be non-negative integers, and timestamp fields must represent valid time values to prevent temporal inconsistencies in health tracking.\n\nConfiguration validation prevents system misconfiguration that could lead to performance problems or operational failures. Health check intervals must be positive values to ensure checks actually occur, and timeouts must be shorter than intervals to prevent check backlog. The maximum failure threshold must be at least 1 to ensure that failures can actually trigger status changes, and TTL values must be longer than health check intervals to prevent premature instance expiration.\n\n### Memory Management and Scaling Considerations\n\nThe data model's memory usage patterns directly impact system scalability and operational characteristics. Understanding these patterns helps operators plan capacity and detect potential memory issues before they impact system performance.\n\nEach service instance consumes a predictable amount of memory based on the string lengths in its service name, host address, tags, and health endpoint path. The base structure overhead is approximately 200-300 bytes per instance, with additional memory proportional to the total length of string fields. Tags have the highest variability in memory usage since they're user-defined and can vary significantly between deployments.\n\nHealth status tracking adds minimal memory overhead per instance, consuming approximately 50-100 bytes for status strings, timestamps, and failure counters. The memory usage remains constant over time since we don't maintain failure history beyond the current failure count, making memory consumption predictable and bounded.\n\nThe registry's memory usage scales linearly with the number of registered instances across all services. With typical instance metadata, the system can comfortably handle 10,000-50,000 service instances in memory on modern server hardware. Memory usage becomes a concern primarily in very large deployments or when instance metadata contains unusually long tag lists or host names.\n\n> A critical scaling insight is that memory usage per instance remains constant regardless of system age—we don't accumulate historical data that causes memory to grow over time, making the system's memory footprint predictable and stable.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nUnderstanding common mistakes in data model implementation helps avoid subtle bugs that can cause system-wide failures or performance degradation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mutable Shared Structures**\nMany implementations accidentally share data structures between concurrent operations, leading to race conditions where one operation modifies data while another is reading it. This typically manifests as inconsistent service lists returned from discovery queries or health status updates being lost. The fix requires ensuring that all public API methods return deep copies of data structures rather than direct references to internal state, and that all internal modifications use proper synchronization.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Unbounded Tag Lists**\nService instances with very large tag lists (hundreds of tags) can consume excessive memory and slow down registry operations. This often happens when automated systems generate tags containing detailed metadata or when unique identifiers are stored as tags rather than in dedicated fields. The solution involves validating tag list sizes during registration and providing guidance on appropriate tag usage patterns.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: String Interning Neglect**\nService names and common tag values are often repeated across many instances, but storing them as separate strings wastes memory and reduces cache locality. For example, 1000 instances of \"user-service\" store the service name 1000 times instead of referencing a single string. Implementing string interning for common values can significantly reduce memory usage in large deployments.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Timestamp Precision Inconsistency**\nMixing different timestamp precisions (seconds vs. milliseconds vs. nanoseconds) across the health checking system leads to incorrect timeout calculations and inconsistent health status updates. This typically manifests as health checks that timeout too quickly or too slowly. The fix requires standardizing on a single timestamp precision throughout the system and explicitly converting external timestamps to the internal format.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Instance Identity**\nFailing to assign unique identifiers to service instances makes it impossible to distinguish between multiple instances of the same service running on the same host with different ports. This leads to registration conflicts and incorrect health status updates. The solution requires generating unique instance IDs during registration and using these IDs for all instance-specific operations.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe data model implementation focuses on creating clean, thread-safe data structures that support the concurrent access patterns required by service discovery operations. The Go language provides excellent tools for building these structures with proper synchronization and memory management.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced

specific tests:\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - Basic Data Structures:**\n- Create a ServiceInstance with all fields populated and verify JSON serialization works correctly\n- Validate that service name validation rejects invalid names (empty, too long, invalid characters)\n- Test that host validation accepts both IP addresses and valid hostnames\n- Verify that tag validation prevents empty tags, duplicates, and oversized tag lists\n\n**Expected behavior:** All validation functions should return specific error messages explaining what's wrong with invalid input. JSON serialization should produce clean, readable output with all field names in snake_case.\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint - Health Status Integration:**\n- Create RegistryEntry instances with various health statuses and verify status transitions work correctly\n- Test that failure count increments properly and resets when health recovers\n- Verify that timestamp tracking accurately reflects check timing\n\n**Expected behavior:** Health status should transition between \"unknown\" → \"healthy\" → \"unhealthy\" based on check results. Failure counts should increment on consecutive failures and reset to 0 on successful checks.\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint - API Response Formatting:**\n- Generate ServiceList responses for services with mixed healthy/unhealthy instances\n- Create ErrorResponse objects with various error codes and verify JSON formatting\n- Test SuccessResponse wrapping of different data types\n\n**Expected behavior:** ServiceList should only include healthy instances in the instances array but report accurate total/healthy counts. Error responses should be consistently formatted with clear error messages.\n\n\n## Service Registry Core\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Service Registry) - This section covers the central component that handles service registration, deregistration, and lookup operations.\n\n### Mental Model: The Hotel Reception Desk\n\nBefore diving into technical details, let's build intuition about what the service registry core does by thinking of it like a hotel reception desk. When you arrive at a hotel, you approach the front desk to check in. The receptionist takes your information (name, room preferences, special requests), assigns you a room number, gives you a key card, and records your stay in their system. Throughout your stay, if someone calls asking for you, the receptionist can look up your room number and connect the call. When you check out, they remove your information from the active guest registry.\n\nThe service registry core works exactly like this hotel reception system. When a service instance starts up, it \"checks in\" by registering itself with the registry, providing its name, network address (host and port), and any special attributes (tags). The registry assigns it a unique instance ID and records all this information. When other services need to find instances of a particular service type, they ask the registry to \"look up\" that service name, and the registry returns a list of all currently registered instances, just like a receptionist providing room numbers for guests. When a service shuts down or fails, it gets \"checked out\" of the registry, either explicitly through deregistration or automatically through health check failures.\n\nThis mental model helps us understand the core responsibilities: **accepting registrations** (check-in), **providing lookups** (directory assistance), **maintaining current state** (guest registry), and **handling departures** (check-out). Just as a hotel reception desk must handle multiple guests simultaneously, our registry core must safely handle concurrent operations from many services registering, deregistering, and looking up other services at the same time.\n\n![Service Instance State Machine](./diagrams/service-lifecycle.svg)\n\n### Registry Interface\n\nThe service registry core exposes a clean interface that encapsulates all service management operations. This interface defines the contract between the registry and its clients (both internal components like the health checker and external clients via the HTTP API layer).\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `Register(instance ServiceInstance)` | `instance`: Service metadata including name, host, port, tags | `string`: Unique instance ID for this registration | Adds a new service instance to the registry with generated unique identifier and current timestamp |\n| `Deregister(instanceID string)` | `instanceID`: Unique identifier returned during registration | `error`: nil on success, error if instance not found | Removes the specified service instance from active registry and stops health checking |\n| `Lookup(serviceName string)` | `serviceName`: Name of service type to find | `ServiceList`: Container with healthy instances, counts, metadata | Returns all currently healthy instances of the specified service name |\n| `GetAllServices()` | None | `map[string]ServiceList`: Map of service name to instance list | Returns complete snapshot of all registered services and their healthy instances |\n| `UpdateHealth(serviceName, instanceID string, status HealthStatus)` | Service name, instance ID, new health status object | `error`: nil on success, error if instance not found | Updates health status for specified instance, used by health checker component |\n| `GetRegistryStats()` | None | `RegistryStats`: Counts and metrics about registry state | Returns statistics about total services, instances, health status distribution |\n| `Cleanup()` | None | `int`: Number of expired entries removed | Removes expired registrations based on TTL and cleanup policy |\n\nThe interface design follows several important principles. First, it uses **value objects** like `ServiceInstance` and `HealthStatus` to ensure data consistency and make the API self-documenting. Second, it separates **read operations** (`Lookup`, `GetAllServices`) from **write operations** (`Register`, `Deregister`, `UpdateHealth`) to enable different concurrency patterns. Third, it returns **structured data** rather than raw maps or slices, making it easier for callers to handle the results correctly.\n\nThe `Register` method returns a unique instance ID that becomes the handle for all future operations on that specific instance. This design choice is crucial because it allows multiple instances of the same service to run on the same host (perhaps on different ports) while maintaining distinct identities. The instance ID also provides a stable identifier even if service metadata changes.\n\nThe `Lookup` method intentionally returns only healthy instances, implementing the core service discovery principle that clients should never receive references to services that cannot handle requests. The health filtering happens transparently within the registry, so clients don't need to understand health status details.\n\n### Core Algorithms\n\nThe service registry core implements three fundamental algorithms that handle the primary use cases: registration, deregistration, and lookup. Each algorithm must handle concurrent access safely while maintaining data consistency.\n\n#### Service Registration Algorithm\n\nThe registration process creates a new registry entry and initializes health checking for the instance:\n\n1. **Generate unique instance ID** using a combination of timestamp, service name, and random component to ensure global uniqueness across all registrations\n2. **Validate service instance data** by checking required fields (name, host, port), validating host format and port range, and ensuring service name follows naming conventions\n3. **Acquire write lock** on the registry's service map to ensure exclusive access during the modification operation\n4. **Check for duplicate registration** by examining existing entries for the same service name and looking for identical host-port combinations within that service\n5. **Create registry entry** with the validated service instance, initial health status set to \"unknown\", current registration timestamp, and generated instance ID\n6. **Store entry in registry** by adding it to the services map under the appropriate service name, creating the service name key if this is the first instance\n7. **Release write lock** to allow other operations to proceed\n8. **Initialize health checking** by scheduling the first health check for this instance and adding it to the health checker's monitoring list\n9. **Log registration event** with service name, instance ID, and network address for debugging and auditing purposes\n10. **Return instance ID** to the caller for use in future deregistration or update operations\n\nThe registration algorithm includes important safety checks. Duplicate detection prevents the same service instance from being registered multiple times, which could lead to double health checking or incorrect instance counts. The validation step catches configuration errors early before they can cause runtime problems.\n\n#### Service Deregistration Algorithm\n\nThe deregistration process removes an instance from active service and cleans up associated resources:\n\n1. **Validate instance ID format** to ensure it matches the expected structure and hasn't been corrupted\n2. **Acquire write lock** on the registry's service map to prevent concurrent modifications during removal\n3. **Locate registry entry** by searching through service name maps to find the entry with matching instance ID\n4. **Verify entry exists** and return appropriate error if the instance ID is not found in the registry\n5. **Remove entry from services map** and clean up the service name key if this was the last instance of that service type\n6. **Release write lock** to restore concurrent access for other operations\n7. **Stop health checking** by removing this instance from the health checker's monitoring schedule\n8. **Log deregistration event** with service name, instance ID, and reason for removal (explicit vs. health failure)\n9. **Update registry statistics** to reflect the reduced instance count and service availability\n10. **Return success confirmation** to indicate the deregistration completed successfully\n\nThe deregistration algorithm handles both explicit deregistration (when services shut down cleanly) and implicit deregistration (when health checks detect failures). The cleanup step is important for preventing memory leaks in long-running registry instances.\n\n#### Service Lookup Algorithm\n\nThe lookup process finds healthy instances of a requested service and returns them in a client-friendly format:\n\n1. **Acquire read lock** on the registry's service map to ensure consistent view of data during the lookup operation\n2. **Check if service name exists** in the registry and return empty result if no instances have ever been registered for this service\n3. **Retrieve all instances** for the requested service name from the services map\n4. **Filter for healthy instances** by examining the health status of each registered instance and including only those marked as healthy\n5. **Sort instances by health score** to provide deterministic ordering and potentially prioritize recently healthy instances\n6. **Release read lock** to allow concurrent access to resume\n7. **Build service list response** with healthy instances, total instance count, healthy instance count, and service metadata\n8. **Log lookup operation** with service name, number of instances found, and requesting client information for observability\n9. **Return service list** containing the filtered and formatted results\n\nThe lookup algorithm implements **read-preferring locking** to allow multiple concurrent lookups while still providing consistency. The health filtering is the critical step that ensures clients only receive references to services that can actually handle requests.\n\n![Concurrent Registry Access](./diagrams/concurrent-access.svg)\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe service registry core involves several critical design decisions that affect performance, correctness, and operational characteristics.\n\n> **Decision: Instance Identity and Uniqueness**\n> - **Context**: Services may start multiple instances on the same host, restart with different configurations, or run in containers with dynamic addresses. The registry needs a way to uniquely identify each service instance across these scenarios.\n> - **Options Considered**: Host-port combination as ID, service-generated UUIDs, registry-generated sequential IDs, registry-generated composite IDs\n> - **Decision**: Registry-generated composite IDs combining timestamp, service name hash, and random component\n> - **Rationale**: Host-port combinations fail when services restart on the same address. Service-generated UUIDs require coordination and may collide. Sequential IDs don't provide enough entropy. Composite IDs provide uniqueness guarantees while encoding useful metadata.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables reliable instance tracking across restarts. Requires instance ID storage by services for deregistration. Provides debugging information through ID structure.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Host-Port ID | Simple, natural mapping | Fails on restart, no multi-port support |\n| Service UUID | Service controls identity | Collision risk, coordination needed |\n| Sequential ID | Simple implementation | Poor distribution, no metadata |\n| Composite ID | Unique, informative, scalable | Slightly more complex generation |\n\n> **Decision: Concurrent Access Pattern**\n> - **Context**: Multiple services will register, deregister, and lookup concurrently. Health checker will update instance status in background. Registry must maintain consistency while providing good performance.\n> - **Options Considered**: Single mutex for all operations, read-write mutex with coarse locking, fine-grained per-service locking, lock-free data structures\n> - **Decision**: Read-write mutex with service-level granularity\n> - **Rationale**: Single mutex creates contention bottleneck. Lock-free structures are complex and error-prone for beginners. Fine-grained locking provides good concurrency while remaining comprehensible.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables concurrent lookups of different services. Requires careful lock ordering to prevent deadlocks. Balances performance with implementation complexity.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Single Mutex | Simple, obviously correct | Poor concurrency, lookup bottleneck |\n| Coarse RW Mutex | Better read concurrency | Write operations still block everything |\n| Fine-grained Locks | Best concurrency | Complex deadlock prevention |\n| Lock-free | Maximum performance | High implementation complexity |\n\n> **Decision: TTL and Cleanup Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Services may crash without deregistering, leaving stale entries. Network partitions may prevent health checks. Registry needs automatic cleanup to prevent unbounded growth.\n> - **Options Considered**: No TTL with health-only cleanup, fixed TTL with periodic renewal, adaptive TTL based on health check intervals, hybrid health and TTL approach\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with fixed TTL and health check override\n> - **Rationale**: Health-only cleanup fails during network partitions. Fixed TTL may remove healthy services during temporary network issues. Adaptive TTL adds complexity. Hybrid provides safety net while respecting health status.\n> - **Consequences**: Prevents memory leaks from stale registrations. Requires services to periodically re-register. Provides graceful degradation during network issues.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Health-only | Respects actual service state | Fails during network partitions |\n| Fixed TTL | Guarantees cleanup | May remove healthy services |\n| Adaptive TTL | Adjusts to conditions | Complex tuning and implementation |\n| Hybrid | Safety with flexibility | Requires careful parameter tuning |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nImplementing a service registry involves several subtle issues that can cause serious problems in production. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid them during initial development and debugging.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Registration**\n\nA common mistake is not properly synchronizing access to the registry's internal data structures during registration. This often manifests as corrupted service lists, duplicate entries, or panics when multiple services register simultaneously. The issue occurs because developers assume registration is infrequent and don't consider concurrent access patterns.\n\nThe problem becomes visible when running load tests or during startup scenarios where many services register simultaneously. Symptoms include inconsistent service counts, missing registrations, or runtime panics with map access violations.\n\n**Fix**: Always acquire appropriate locks before modifying shared data structures. Use read-write mutexes to allow concurrent reads while protecting writes. Ensure lock granularity matches your consistency requirements.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks from Failed Deregistrations**\n\nServices that crash or lose network connectivity cannot perform explicit deregistration, leading to stale entries accumulating in the registry over time. Without proper cleanup mechanisms, the registry's memory usage grows unbounded, eventually causing performance degradation or crashes.\n\nThis pitfall is particularly dangerous because it manifests slowly in production. Early testing with clean shutdowns won't reveal the issue, but long-running deployments with occasional service failures will experience gradual memory growth.\n\n**Fix**: Implement TTL-based cleanup for all registrations. Run periodic background cleanup processes. Combine health check failures with automatic deregistration. Set reasonable upper bounds on registry size.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Health State During Updates**\n\nWhen the health checker updates instance health status, there's a window where lookup operations might see inconsistent data. For example, a lookup might return an instance that failed health checks but hasn't been removed yet, or miss an instance that just became healthy.\n\nThis inconsistency can cause cascading failures where clients receive references to unhealthy services, leading to request timeouts and retry storms. The problem is particularly acute during network partitions or service deployment scenarios.\n\n**Fix**: Use atomic updates for health status changes. Design the health update process to be idempotent. Consider implementing eventual consistency patterns where appropriate, and ensure clients have proper timeout and retry logic.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Critical Paths**\n\nRegistry operations that perform I/O, network calls, or expensive computations while holding locks can create severe performance bottlenecks. This commonly happens when developers add logging, metrics collection, or validation that makes external calls within locked sections.\n\nThe symptom is high latency for all registry operations, even simple lookups, because operations queue behind slow critical sections. This can make the entire service discovery system unresponsive.\n\n**Fix**: Minimize work performed while holding locks. Move expensive operations outside critical sections. Use asynchronous patterns for non-essential operations like logging and metrics. Profile lock contention regularly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Input Validation**\n\nFailing to properly validate service registration data can lead to runtime errors, injection attacks, or data corruption. Common validation failures include accepting malformed hostnames, invalid port numbers, excessively long service names, or special characters that break downstream systems.\n\nThese issues often surface when integrating with external systems or during security audits. Invalid data can propagate through the system, causing failures far from the original input point.\n\n**Fix**: Implement comprehensive input validation for all registry operations. Validate hostname formats, port ranges, string lengths, and character sets. Sanitize input data and provide clear error messages for validation failures. Consider using schema validation libraries.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete technical recommendations and starter code for implementing the service registry core. The focus is on Go-based implementation with alternatives noted for other languages.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Concurrency | `sync.RWMutex` for basic locking | `sync.Map` for high-concurrency scenarios |\n| ID Generation | `time.Now().UnixNano()` + `rand.Int63()` | UUID library with cryptographic randomness |\n| Data Storage | In-memory `map[string]interface{}` | Embedded database like BadgerDB or BoltDB |\n| Serialization | `encoding/json` for configuration | Protocol Buffers for performance-critical paths |\n| Logging | Standard `log` package | Structured logging with `logrus` or `zap` |\n| Configuration | Environment variables + flags | Configuration management library like Viper |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe service registry core should be organized as a self-contained package that can be imported by other components:\n\n```\nservice-discovery/\n├── cmd/\n│   └── registry/\n│       └── main.go                    ← Entry point for standalone registry\n├── internal/\n│   ├── registry/                      ← Core registry package\n│   │   ├── registry.go                ← Main ServiceRegistry implementation\n│   │   ├── registry_test.go           ← Unit tests for registry operations\n│   │   ├── types.go                   ← Data structures and interfaces\n│   │   ├── validation.go              ← Input validation utilities\n│   │   └── config.go                  ← Configuration management\n│   ├── health/                        ← Health checker component\n│   │   └── checker.go\n│   └── api/                           ← HTTP API layer\n│       └── handlers.go\n└── pkg/\n    └── client/                        ← Client library for services\n        └── client.go\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\nHere's complete, working infrastructure code that handles the non-core functionality:\n\n**Configuration Management (`internal/registry/config.go`)**:\n```go\npackage registry\n\nimport (\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n    \"strconv\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\ntype Config struct {\n    Port                int           `json:\"port\"`\n    Host               string        `json:\"host\"`\n    HealthCheckInterval time.Duration `json:\"health_check_interval\"`\n    HealthTimeout      time.Duration `json:\"health_timeout\"`\n    MaxFailures        int           `json:\"max_failures\"`\n    TTL                time.Duration `json:\"ttl\"`\n    CleanupInterval    time.Duration `json:\"cleanup_interval\"`\n}\n\nfunc LoadConfig() (*Config, error) {\n    config := &Config{\n        Port:                8080,\n        Host:               \"localhost\",\n        HealthCheckInterval: 30 * time.Second,\n        HealthTimeout:      5 * time.Second,\n        MaxFailures:        3,\n        TTL:               5 * time.Minute,\n        CleanupInterval:   1 * time.Minute,\n    }\n\n    // Command line flags override defaults\n    flag.IntVar(&config.Port, \"port\", config.Port, \"Registry HTTP port\")\n    flag.StringVar(&config.Host, \"host\", config.Host, \"Registry host address\")\n    flag.DurationVar(&config.HealthCheckInterval, \"health-interval\", config.HealthCheckInterval, \"Health check interval\")\n    flag.DurationVar(&config.HealthTimeout, \"health-timeout\", config.HealthTimeout, \"Health check timeout\")\n    flag.IntVar(&config.MaxFailures, \"max-failures\", config.MaxFailures, \"Max health check failures\")\n    flag.DurationVar(&config.TTL, \"ttl\", config.TTL, \"Registration TTL\")\n    flag.DurationVar(&config.CleanupInterval, \"cleanup-interval\", config.CleanupInterval, \"Cleanup interval\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    // Environment variables override flags\n    if port := os.Getenv(\"REGISTRY_PORT\");

Here's the skeleton with detailed guidance:\n\n**Main Registry Structure (`internal/registry/registry.go`)**:\n```go\npackage registry\n\nimport (\n    \"crypto/rand\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"sync\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\ntype ServiceRegistry struct {\n    // TODO: Add field for storing service entries (map[string]map[string]*RegistryEntry)\n    // TODO: Add field for protecting concurrent access (sync.RWMutex)\n    // TODO: Add field for configuration (*Config)\n    // TODO: Add field for cleanup ticker (*time.Ticker)\n}\n\n// NewServiceRegistry creates a new service registry with the given configuration\nfunc NewServiceRegistry(config *Config) *ServiceRegistry {\n    registry := &ServiceRegistry{\n        // TODO: Initialize services map\n        // TODO: Initialize mutex\n        // TODO: Store config\n    }\n    \n    // TODO: Start cleanup goroutine using config.CleanupInterval\n    // TODO: Set up cleanup ticker and background cleanup loop\n    \n    return registry\n}\n\n// Register adds a new service instance to the registry\nfunc (r *ServiceRegistry) Register(instance ServiceInstance) (string, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Validate the service instance using ValidateServiceInstance\n    // TODO 2: Generate unique instance ID using generateInstanceID helper\n    // TODO 3: Acquire write lock on registry mutex\n    // TODO 4: Check if service name exists in services map, create if needed\n    // TODO 5: Check for duplicate host:port combination in existing instances\n    // TODO 6: Create RegistryEntry with instance, initial health status, current time, instance ID\n    // TODO 7: Add entry to services map under service name and instance ID\n    // TODO 8: Release write lock\n    // TODO 9: Log registration event\n    // TODO 10: Return instance ID and nil error\n    \n    // Hint: Initial health status should be \"unknown\" with zero failure count\n    // Hint: Services map structure: services[serviceName][instanceID] = entry\n}\n\n// Deregister removes a service instance from the registry\nfunc (r *ServiceRegistry) Deregister(instanceID string) error {\n    // TODO 1: Validate instance ID format (non-empty, reasonable length)\n    // TODO 2: Acquire write lock on registry mutex\n    // TODO 3: Search through all services to find entry with matching instance ID\n    // TODO 4: If found, remove entry from the services map\n    // TODO 5: If service has no more instances, remove service name key entirely\n    // TODO 6: Release write lock\n    // TODO 7: Log deregistration event\n    // TODO 8: Return nil on success, error if instance ID not found\n    \n    // Hint: You'll need nested loops to search services[serviceName][instanceID]\n    // Hint: Use delete() to remove map entries\n}\n\n// Lookup returns all healthy instances of the specified service\nfunc (r *ServiceRegistry) Lookup(serviceName string) (*ServiceList, error) {\n    // TODO 1: Acquire read lock on registry mutex\n    // TODO 2: Check if service name exists in services map\n    // TODO 3: If not found, return empty ServiceList (not an error condition)\n    // TODO 4: Iterate through all instances for the service name\n    // TODO 5: Filter instances where health status is \"healthy\"\n    // TODO 6: Count total instances and healthy instances\n    // TODO 7: Release read lock\n    // TODO 8: Build ServiceList with results and return\n    \n    // Hint: ServiceList should include service name, healthy instances only, counts\n    // Hint: Empty result is valid -

Create a simple test program that registers a service instance\n2. Verify the registration returns a non-empty instance ID\n3. Perform a lookup for that service name and confirm the instance appears\n4. Deregister using the instance ID and verify lookup returns empty results\n5. Test concurrent registrations by starting multiple goroutines registering different services\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- Registration should complete in < 10ms for single instances\n- Lookup should return results in < 5ms for services with < 100 instances  \n- Concurrent operations should not cause panics or data corruption\n- Memory usage should remain stable during register/deregister cycles\n\n**Debugging Signs**:\n- If registrations hang: Check for deadlocks in mutex usage\n- If lookups return stale data: Verify proper locking around health updates\n- If memory grows continuously: Ensure cleanup process is running and working\n- If panics occur: Check for concurrent map access without proper locking\n\n\n## Health Checker\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Health Checking) - This section covers the background component that monitors service health and automatically removes failed instances from the registry.\n\n### Mental Model: The Security Guard Rounds\n\nThink of the health checker as a security guard making regular rounds through an office building. Just as a security guard walks predetermined routes at scheduled intervals, checking that all doors are locked, lights are working, and areas are secure, the health checker periodically visits each registered service to verify it's still responding and functioning properly.\n\nWhen the security guard discovers a problem during rounds—perhaps a door is unlocked that should be locked, or a light has burned out—they take note and report it to building management. Similarly, when the health checker detects that a service isn't responding or is returning error responses, it records the failure and updates the registry to mark that instance as unhealthy.\n\nThe security guard doesn't immediately sound an alarm after finding one small issue—they understand that temporary problems happen. Maybe someone just stepped out and forgot to lock their office door, or a light bulb chose that exact moment to fail. Instead, the guard makes note of the issue and checks again on the next round. Only after seeing the same problem persist across multiple rounds does the guard escalate it as a genuine security concern.\n\nThis mirrors how the health checker handles service failures. A single failed health check doesn't immediately remove a service from the registry—networks have temporary hiccups, services might be momentarily overloaded, or a garbage collection pause might cause a timeout. The health checker maintains a **failure count** for each service instance and only marks it as unhealthy after seeing consecutive failures that exceed a configurable threshold.\n\nThe security guard also adapts their rounds based on the building's needs. High-security areas might get checked more frequently than storage closets. Critical systems require more attention than auxiliary services. Similarly, the health checker allows different services to configure their own check intervals and failure thresholds based on their criticality and expected response patterns.\n\n> The key insight is that health checking is fundamentally about distinguishing between temporary service hiccups and genuine failures that require removing the service from active duty.\n\n### Health Checker Interface\n\nThe health checker component exposes a well-defined interface that separates the concerns of health monitoring from the core registry operations. This interface defines the contract between the health checker and both the registry core and the external services it monitors.\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `StartHealthChecker` | `registry *ServiceRegistry` | `error` | Initializes and starts the background health checking process for all registered services |\n| `StopHealthChecker` | None | `error` | Gracefully shuts down health checking, completing in-flight checks before stopping |\n| `CheckServiceHealth` | `instance ServiceInstance` | `HealthStatus, error` | Performs a single health check against the specified service instance |\n| `UpdateCheckInterval` | `serviceName string, interval time.Duration` | `error` | Modifies the health check frequency for a specific service type |\n| `GetHealthStats` | None | `HealthStats` | Returns aggregate health statistics across all monitored services |\n| `ConfigureHealthCheck` | `serviceName string, config HealthCheckConfig` | `error` | Updates health check configuration for a specific service type |\n\nThe interface design follows the principle of **separation of concerns**—the health checker focuses solely on monitoring and updating health status, while the registry core maintains the authoritative service data and handles lookups. This separation allows the health checker to operate as an independent background process without blocking registry operations.\n\nThe `CheckServiceHealth` method performs the actual health verification logic and returns a `HealthStatus` struct that encapsulates both the current health state and metadata about the check itself:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| `Status` | `string` | Current health state: \"healthy\", \"unhealthy\", or \"unknown\" |\n| `LastCheck` | `time.Time` | Timestamp of the most recent health check attempt |\n| `FailureCount` | `int` | Number of consecutive failed health checks for this instance |\n| `ResponseTime` | `time.Duration` | How long the most recent health check took to complete |\n| `LastError` | `string` | Error message from the most recent failed check, empty if healthy |\n\nThe health checker maintains its own internal state to track check schedules and failure counts, but it delegates all registry updates to the registry core through well-defined callback methods. This ensures that the registry remains the single source of truth for service data while allowing the health checker to operate independently.\n\n### Health Check Algorithms\n\nThe health checker operates through several coordinated algorithms that handle different aspects of the health monitoring process. These algorithms work together to provide reliable failure detection while minimizing false positives from temporary network issues.\n\n#### Health Check Scheduling Algorithm\n\nThe scheduling algorithm determines when to perform health checks for each registered service. Rather than checking all services simultaneously, which could create network congestion and registry contention, the scheduler spreads checks across time to ensure smooth operation.\n\n1. **Initialize check schedule**: When a new service registers, calculate its first check time by adding the configured `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` to the current time, plus a random jitter of up to 30 seconds to prevent thundering herd effects.\n\n2. **Maintain priority queue**: Store all pending health checks in a time-ordered priority queue, with the next check time as the priority. This allows efficient retrieval of the next service that needs checking.\n\n3. **Background scheduler loop**: Run a continuous background goroutine that sleeps until the next scheduled check time, then wakes up to process due health checks.\n\n4. **Batch processing**: When multiple checks become due simultaneously (within a 1-second window), group them into batches and process them concurrently to improve throughput.\n\n5. **Reschedule after completion**: After completing a health check, calculate the next check time based on the service's configured interval and add it back to the priority queue.\n\n6. **Handle registration changes**: When a service deregisters, remove all its pending health checks from the schedule. When a service's check interval changes, update its next scheduled time accordingly.\n\nThe scheduling algorithm ensures that health checks are distributed evenly across time, preventing resource spikes while maintaining responsiveness to service failures.\n\n#### Health Check Execution Algorithm\n\nThe execution algorithm handles the actual process of checking a service's health and interpreting the results. This algorithm must handle various failure modes gracefully while distinguishing between different types of problems.\n\n1. **Prepare health check request**: Construct an HTTP GET request to the service's health endpoint, typically `http://{host}:{port}/health`. Set appropriate timeout values based on the service's configured `HealthTimeout`.\n\n2. **Execute request with timeout**: Send the HTTP request using a context with deadline to ensure the check doesn't hang indefinitely. The timeout should be shorter than the check interval to prevent overlapping checks.\n\n3. **Interpret response status**: Evaluate the HTTP response according to standard health check conventions:\n   - Status codes 200-299: Service is healthy\n   - Status codes 400-499: Service is unhealthy (client errors indicate service problems)\n   - Status codes 500-599: Service is unhealthy (server errors indicate service failures)\n   - Network timeouts or connection refused: Service is unhealthy\n\n4. **Parse response body**: If the response includes a JSON body, parse it to extract additional health information such as dependency status, resource utilization, or detailed error messages.\n\n5. **Calculate response metrics**: Record the total response time and any relevant performance metrics that could indicate service degradation even when the service reports healthy.\n\n6. **Handle check failures**: When a health check fails, increment the service instance's failure count and record the error details. If the failure count exceeds the configured `MaxFailures` threshold, mark the instance as unhealthy.\n\n7. **Handle check successes**: When a health check succeeds, reset the failure count to zero and ensure the instance is marked as healthy in the registry.\n\nThe execution algorithm focuses on reliability and clear failure detection while providing detailed information for debugging when services become unhealthy.\n\n#### Registry Update Algorithm\n\nThe registry update algorithm handles the process of applying health check results to the service registry state. This algorithm must coordinate carefully with the registry core to ensure consistency and avoid race conditions.\n\n1. **Acquire instance lock**: Before updating health status, acquire a lock on the specific service instance to prevent concurrent modifications from registration/deregistration operations.\n\n2. **Validate instance still exists**: Verify that the service instance still exists in the registry—it might have been deregistered while the health check was in progress.\n\n3. **Update health status fields**: Apply the new health status information to the registry entry, including the check timestamp, failure count, and status.\n\n4. **Evaluate unhealthy threshold**: If the failure count equals or exceeds `MaxFailures`, transition the instance from healthy to unhealthy status and remove it from active service lookups.\n\n5. **Evaluate recovery threshold**: If an unhealthy instance succeeds a health check, immediately transition it back to healthy status and make it available for service lookups again.\n\n6. **Update registry statistics**: Increment aggregate counters for total checks performed, current healthy/unhealthy counts, and average response times.\n\n7. **Release instance lock**: Free the lock to allow other operations to proceed.\n\n8. **Notify watchers**: If the registry supports change notifications, emit events for health status changes that other components might need to react to.\n\nThe registry update algorithm ensures that health status changes are applied atomically and consistently, maintaining registry integrity even under concurrent access.\n\n![Health Check Process Flow](./diagrams/health-check-flow.svg)\n\n![Service Instance State Machine](./diagrams/service-lifecycle.svg)\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe health checker design involves several critical architectural decisions that significantly impact system behavior and reliability. Each decision represents a trade-off between different operational concerns.\n\n> **Decision: Health Check Protocol Support**\n> - **Context**: Services might expose health endpoints using different protocols (HTTP, TCP, gRPC) and the health checker needs to determine which protocols to support initially.\n> - **Options Considered**: HTTP-only, TCP socket checks only, Multi-protocol support from start\n> - **Decision**: Start with HTTP-only health checks, design interface to support additional protocols later\n> - **Rationale**: HTTP health checks are the most common pattern in microservices, provide rich status information through response codes and bodies, and have excellent tooling support. TCP checks only verify network connectivity without application-level health. Multi-protocol support adds significant complexity without clear immediate benefit.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables detailed health status reporting through HTTP response codes and JSON bodies. Requires all services to implement HTTP health endpoints. Creates a clear upgrade path for future protocol support.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| HTTP-only | Rich status info, standard pattern, simple implementation | Requires HTTP endpoint on all services |\n| TCP-only | Minimal service requirements, very fast checks | No application-level health info |\n| Multi-protocol | Supports diverse service types, maximum flexibility | Complex implementation, harder to maintain |\n\n> **Decision: Failure Threshold and Recovery**\n> - **Context**: The health checker must decide how many consecutive failures indicate a truly unhealthy service versus temporary network issues, and how quickly to restore services that recover.\n> - **Options Considered**: Single failure removal, Graduated failure thresholds, Configurable per-service thresholds\n> - **Decision**: Configurable per-service failure thresholds with immediate recovery on first success\n> - **Rationale**: Different services have different reliability characteristics—a database connection might tolerate fewer failures than a cache service. Immediate recovery ensures that temporarily unhealthy services return to service quickly once they recover.\n> - **Consequences**: Reduces false positives from network hiccups while allowing fine-tuned reliability requirements per service type. Requires more configuration complexity but provides operational flexibility.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Single failure | Simple, fast failure detection | High false positive rate from network blips |\n| Graduated thresholds | Balances reliability with false positives | Fixed behavior doesn't match all service types |\n| Configurable thresholds | Tunable per service needs, operational flexibility | More complex configuration and implementation |\n\n> **Decision: Check Interval Distribution**\n> - **Context**: When checking hundreds of services, simultaneous health checks could create network congestion and overwhelm the registry with concurrent updates.\n> - **Options Considered**: Fixed interval checks, Random jitter distribution, Adaptive interval based on service health\n> - **Decision**: Fixed intervals with random startup jitter, plus adaptive intervals for unhealthy services\n> - **Rationale**: Random jitter prevents thundering herd effects when many services start simultaneously. Adaptive intervals allow faster detection of recovery for unhealthy services without increasing load on healthy services.\n> - **Consequences**: Smooth resource utilization and better recovery detection. Adds complexity to the scheduling algorithm but significantly improves system scalability.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Fixed intervals | Simple implementation, predictable behavior | Can create resource spikes and contention |\n| Random jitter | Prevents thundering herds, smooth resource usage | Less predictable check timing |\n| Adaptive intervals | Optimizes check frequency based on health | Complex scheduling, harder to debug |\n\n> **Decision: Health Check State Persistence**\n> - **Context**: The health checker accumulates failure counts and health history that could be valuable for debugging, but storing this data adds complexity and memory overhead.\n> - **Options Considered**: In-memory only, Persistent health history, Hybrid approach with recent history\n> - **Decision**: In-memory state with configurable history retention for recent failures\n> - **Rationale**: Full persistence adds significant complexity without clear operational benefit for a beginner-level project. In-memory state with limited history provides debugging value while keeping the implementation simple.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables useful debugging information without storage complexity. Health state is lost on restart, but this is acceptable for a learning project. Creates a clear upgrade path for persistent health metrics.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| In-memory only | Simple implementation, no storage overhead | No historical data for debugging |\n| Persistent history | Rich debugging info, survives restarts | Complex storage, potential disk usage growth |\n| Hybrid approach | Balance of simplicity and debugging value | Some memory overhead, limited history |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nUnderstanding common mistakes in health checker implementation helps avoid reliability issues and operational problems that can affect the entire service discovery system.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Network Partition False Positives**\n\nA common mistake is treating network timeouts the same as service failures, leading to mass service deregistration during network partitions. When the health checker loses network connectivity to a cluster of services, it shouldn't immediately mark them all as unhealthy—this could cause cascading failures where healthy services become unavailable due to network issues rather than actual service problems.\n\nThe issue occurs when the health checker runs from a single location and experiences network connectivity problems. For example, if the health checker is deployed in one availability zone and loses connectivity to services in another zone, it might incorrectly mark all those services as failed even though they're healthy and serving traffic from other clients.\n\n**Fix**: Implement partition detection by monitoring the failure rate across all services. If more than a threshold percentage (e.g., 50%) of services fail simultaneously, treat this as a potential network partition and either pause health checking or mark the health checker itself as degraded rather than mass-deregistering services.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Timeout Too Short**\n\nSetting health check timeouts too aggressively can cause false failures when services experience temporary load spikes or garbage collection pauses. A common mistake is setting timeouts to very small values (e.g., 100ms) that don't account for normal operational variance in service response times.\n\nThis becomes particularly problematic for services that might experience periodic background processing, garbage collection in managed languages, or brief CPU contention during normal operation. These temporary slowdowns don't indicate genuine service health problems but will trigger timeout failures if the health check timeout is too strict.\n\n**Fix**: Set health check timeouts to be 2-3x the typical response time of the service's health endpoint under normal load. Monitor actual health check response times and adjust timeouts based on observed P95 or P99 latencies rather than average response times.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cascading Health Check Failures**\n\nA subtle issue occurs when health checks themselves consume significant resources on target services, and increased check frequency during failure scenarios overwhelms already-struggling services. This creates a positive feedback loop where service degradation triggers more frequent health checks, which consume more resources, leading to further degradation.\n\nThis problem is especially severe when multiple health checkers monitor the same services (e.g., during rolling deployments or in multi-region setups), or when services implement expensive health check logic that queries databases or external dependencies.\n\n**Fix**: Implement health check backoff for failing services rather than increasing frequency. Design health endpoints to be lightweight and avoid expensive operations like database queries. Consider implementing health check rate limiting on services to prevent overwhelming them during degradation scenarios.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Health Status Updates**\n\nConcurrent health checks and service registration/deregistration can create race conditions where health status updates apply to the wrong service instance or overwrite newer registration information. This often manifests as services that appear to flap between healthy and unhealthy states, or healthy services that get stuck in unhealthy status.\n\nThe issue typically occurs when a service deregisters and re-registers quickly (e.g., during a rolling deployment) while health checks for the old instance are still in flight. The delayed health check update might apply to the new instance, incorrectly marking it as failed.\n\n**Fix**: Use instance-specific identifiers that include registration timestamps or UUIDs to ensure health updates only apply to the correct service instance. Implement proper locking around health status updates and validate that the target instance still exists and matches before applying updates.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Health Check Resource Leaks**\n\nFailing to properly clean up resources from health check operations can lead to gradual resource exhaustion, especially in systems that monitor large numbers of services. Common leaks include unclosed HTTP connections, goroutines that don't terminate cleanly, or accumulating timeout contexts that don't get canceled.\n\nThis problem often goes unnoticed during development with small numbers of services but becomes critical in production environments with hundreds or thousands of service instances being monitored continuously.\n\n**Fix**: Use connection pooling for HTTP clients, implement proper context cancellation for timeout handling, and ensure goroutines have clear termination conditions. Add resource monitoring to track open connections, goroutines, and memory usage of the health checker component.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe health checker implementation requires careful coordination between background processing, HTTP client management, and registry integration. This section provides the foundational components and structure needed to build a reliable health monitoring system.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

the following behavior:\n\n**Unit Test Verification:**\n```bash\ngo test ./internal/health/... -v\n```\n\nExpected output should show all health checking functions working correctly with mock services.\n\n**Integration Test Verification:**\n\n1. **Start a test service** with a `/health` endpoint that returns HTTP 200\n2. **Register the service** with your registry \n3. **Start the health checker** and verify it begins checking the service\n4. **Stop the test service** and verify the health checker marks it as unhealthy after the configured failure threshold\n5. **Restart the test service** and verify it gets marked healthy again immediately\n\n**Manual Verification Steps:**\n\n1. Check health statistics show increasing check counts: `curl http://localhost:8080/stats`\n2. Verify healthy services appear in lookup results: `curl http://localhost:8080/services/test-service`\n3. Verify unhealthy services disappear from lookup results after failure threshold\n4. Verify health checker logs show periodic check activity and status changes\n\n**Signs Something Is Wrong:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Check This |\n|---------|---------------|------------|\n| Health checks never execute | Scheduler not starting properly | Check for goroutine startup errors and timer initialization |\n| All services marked unhealthy immediately | Health check timeout too short | Verify health endpoint response times vs configured timeout |\n| Services flapping between healthy/unhealthy | Race condition in status updates | Check for proper locking around health status modifications |\n| Memory usage growing continuously | Resource leaks in HTTP client | Verify HTTP connections are properly closed and pooled |\n| Health checks hang indefinitely | Missing context timeouts | Ensure all HTTP requests use context with deadline |\n\n\n## HTTP API Layer\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3 (HTTP API) - This section covers the REST API that exposes service registry operations over HTTP, building on the registry core (Milestone 1) and health checker (Milestone 2) to provide external access to service discovery functionality.\n\n### Mental Model: The Information Desk\n\nUnderstanding the HTTP API layer becomes intuitive when you think of it as an **information desk** at a large corporate building or conference center. Just as visitors approach the information desk to find departments, get directions, or register for events, services and clients interact with our HTTP API to register themselves, discover other services, and check system health.\n\nThe information desk receptionist doesn't actually store the building directory or manage the departments themselves - they have access to the building's central directory system (our registry core) and can check with security about which departments are currently operational (our health checker). The receptionist's job is to translate visitor requests into the right format, query the appropriate systems, and present the information in a way visitors can understand and use.\n\nSimilarly, our HTTP API layer serves as the **interface translator** between external clients and our internal registry system. It accepts HTTP requests in standardized formats, validates the input (just as a receptionist might verify visitor credentials), translates the requests into internal operations, executes them against the registry core, and formats the responses back into HTTP-friendly JSON.\n\nThe information desk analogy also highlights the **stateless nature** of our API - each visitor interaction is independent. The receptionist doesn't remember previous conversations with visitors, but can quickly look up any information needed from the central systems. This stateless design ensures our API can handle many concurrent requests efficiently and scale horizontally by adding more API servers behind a load balancer.\n\nJust as an information desk provides standardized procedures for common requests (registration forms, visitor badges, direction cards), our HTTP API provides **consistent REST endpoints** with predictable request/response formats. This consistency allows different types of clients - whether they're microservices registering themselves, load balancers looking up healthy instances, or monitoring tools checking system health - to interact with the service discovery system in a uniform way.\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nThe HTTP API exposes service registry operations through a carefully designed REST interface. Each endpoint serves a specific purpose in the service discovery workflow, from initial registration through ongoing health monitoring to final deregistration.\n\n![Service Registration Sequence](./diagrams/registration-sequence.svg)\n\nThe API design follows REST principles with clear resource hierarchies and appropriate HTTP methods. The base path `/services` represents the collection of all registered services, while specific operations are accessed through sub-paths and different HTTP methods.\n\n| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Request Body | Response |\n|----------|---------|---------|--------------|----------|\n| `/services` | POST | Register new service instance | `ServiceInstance` | `SuccessResponse` with instance ID |\n| `/services` | GET | List all registered services | None | `ServiceList` array |\n| `/services/{name}` | GET | Get healthy instances of service | None | `ServiceList` for specific service |\n| `/services/{name}/{id}` | DELETE | Deregister specific instance | None | `SuccessResponse` |\n| `/health` | GET | Get system health overview | None | `RegistryStats` |\n| `/health/{name}` | GET | Get health status for service | None | Service health details |\n| `/health/{name}/{id}` | GET | Get health status for instance | None | `HealthStatus` |\n\n![Service Discovery Sequence](./diagrams/lookup-sequence.svg)\n\n#### Service Registration Endpoint\n\nThe POST `/services` endpoint accepts new service registrations and returns a unique instance identifier. The request body must contain a complete `ServiceInstance` object with all required fields validated before registration proceeds.\n\n**Request Format:**\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| Name | string | Yes | Service name for lookup operations |\n| Host | string | Yes | IP address or hostname where service runs |\n| Port | int | Yes | Port number where service accepts connections |\n| Tags | []string | No | Metadata tags for filtering and categorization |\n| HealthEndpoint | string | No | HTTP path for health checks (defaults to \"/health\") |\n\n**Response Format:**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| success | bool | Always true for successful registrations |\n| data | object | Contains instanceID and registration timestamp |\n| message | string | Human-readable success message |\n\nThe registration endpoint performs several validation steps before accepting a service instance. It verifies that required fields are present and properly formatted, checks that the host:port combination is valid, and ensures the health endpoint path starts with a forward slash if provided.\n\n#### Service Lookup Endpoints\n\nThe GET `/services` endpoint returns a complete listing of all registered services, while GET `/services/{name}` returns only healthy instances of a specific service. Both endpoints filter results to exclude instances marked as unhealthy by the health checker.\n\n**Service List Response Format:**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| ServiceName | string | Name of the service (empty for all-services endpoint) |\n| Instances | []ServiceInstance | Array of healthy service instances |\n| TotalCount | int | Total registered instances (including unhealthy) |\n| HealthyCount | int | Number of instances currently healthy |\n\nThe lookup operations are optimized for read performance since they represent the most frequent API operations. The registry core maintains pre-filtered lists of healthy instances to avoid computing health status during each lookup request.\n\n#### Service Deregistration Endpoint\n\nThe DELETE `/services/{name}/{id}` endpoint removes a specific service instance from the registry. Both the service name and instance ID must match for the deregistration to proceed, providing protection against accidental removals.\n\n**Deregistration Response:**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| success | bool | True if instance was found and removed |\n| message | string | Confirmation message with instance details |\n\nDeregistration immediately removes the instance from active service lists and cancels any scheduled health checks. The operation is idempotent - attempting to deregister an already-removed instance returns success with an appropriate message.\n\n#### Health Status Endpoints\n\nThe health endpoints provide visibility into the current state of the service discovery system. The GET `/health` endpoint returns overall system statistics, while service-specific endpoints provide detailed health information for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\n**System Health Response (`RegistryStats`):**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| TotalServices | int | Number of distinct service names registered |\n| TotalInstances | int | Total service instances across all services |\n| HealthyInstances | int | Number of instances passing health checks |\n| HealthBreakdown | map[string]int | Health status counts by service name |\n| LastCleanup | time.Time | Timestamp of last TTL cleanup operation |\n\n**Instance Health Response (`HealthStatus`):**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| Status | string | \"healthy\", \"unhealthy\", or \"unknown\" |\n| LastCheck | time.Time | Timestamp of most recent health check |\n| FailureCount | int | Consecutive failed health checks |\n| ResponseTime | time.Duration | Response time of last successful check |\n| LastError | string | Error message from most recent failed check |\n\n#### Error Response Format\n\nAll endpoints use a standardized error response format to provide consistent error handling for clients. Error responses include both machine-readable error codes and human-readable messages.\n\n**Error Response Format (`ErrorResponse`):**\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| error | string | Human-readable error message |\n| error_code | string | Machine-readable error code for programmatic handling |\n| details | map[string]interface{} | Additional context about the error |\n\nCommon error codes include `VALIDATION_ERROR` for invalid request data, `NOT_FOUND` for non-existent services or instances, `INTERNAL_ERROR` for system failures, and `RATE_LIMITED` for excessive request rates.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe HTTP API design involves several critical decisions that affect usability, performance, and maintainability. Each decision represents a trade-off between competing concerns and requirements.\n\n> **Decision: REST API Design Pattern**\n> - **Context**: Need to choose API design pattern for exposing registry operations over HTTP\n> - **Options Considered**: REST with JSON, GraphQL, gRPC with HTTP/2, Custom HTTP protocol\n> - **Decision**: REST API with JSON request/response bodies\n> - **Rationale**: REST provides the best balance of simplicity, tooling support, and developer familiarity. JSON is universally supported and human-readable. GraphQL adds unnecessary complexity for our straightforward CRUD operations. gRPC requires code generation and is less accessible for debugging and testing.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables easy integration with any HTTP client, supports standard tooling (curl, Postman), but may have slightly higher overhead than binary protocols\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| REST + JSON | Universal client support, human-readable, extensive tooling | Larger payload size, text parsing overhead |\n| GraphQL | Flexible queries, single endpoint | Complex for simple operations, learning curve |\n| gRPC + HTTP/2 | Type safety, performance, streaming | Code generation required, debugging complexity |\n\n> **Decision: Resource Hierarchy Structure**\n> - **Context**: Need to organize API endpoints in a logical, RESTful manner\n> - **Options Considered**: Flat namespace (/register, /lookup), Resource-based (/services, /health), Verb-based (/api/register-service)\n> - **Decision**: Resource-based hierarchy with `/services` as primary collection\n> - **Rationale**: Resource-based design follows REST principles, provides intuitive URL structure, and scales well as we add new resource types. HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) clearly indicate operations.\n> - **Consequences**: Clean, predictable URLs that developers can guess, but requires understanding of REST conventions\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Resource-based | REST compliance, intuitive, scalable | Requires REST knowledge |\n| Flat namespace | Simple, explicit | Doesn't scale, non-standard |\n| Verb-based | Clear intent | Violates REST principles, verbose |\n\n> **Decision: Error Response Standardization**\n> - **Context**: Need consistent error handling across all API endpoints\n> - **Options Considered**: HTTP status codes only, Custom error format, RFC 7807 Problem Details, Simple JSON errors\n> - **Decision**: Standardized JSON error format with error codes and details\n> - **Rationale**: Provides both human-readable messages and machine-readable error codes for programmatic handling. Includes details object for additional context. More accessible than RFC 7807 while still being structured.\n> - **Consequences**: Consistent error handling for clients, but requires discipline to use the format consistently across all endpoints\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Status codes only | Simple, HTTP-native | Limited error information |\n| Custom JSON format | Flexible, informative | Must document format |\n| RFC 7807 | Standardized | Complex, less familiar |\n\n> **Decision: Instance Identity in URLs**\n> - **Context**: Need to identify specific service instances for deregistration operations\n> - **Options Considered**: Auto-generated UUIDs, Host:port combinations, Sequential IDs, Client-provided IDs\n> - **Decision**: Auto-generated UUIDs returned during registration\n> - **Rationale**: UUIDs are globally unique, prevent collisions, and don't expose system internals. Host:port combinations can collide if services restart quickly. Sequential IDs expose registration order and volume.\n> - **Consequences**: Clients must store the returned instance ID for later deregistration, but we avoid all collision scenarios\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| UUIDs | Globally unique, secure | Must be stored by client |\n| Host:port | Intuitive, self-contained | Collision risk on restart |\n| Sequential IDs | Simple, compact | Exposes system internals |\n\n> **Decision: Health Check Integration**\n> - **Context**: Need to decide how health status affects API responses\n> - **Options Considered**: Always return all instances, Filter unhealthy automatically, Provide health flags, Separate health endpoints\n> - **Decision**: Filter unhealthy instances automatically in lookup operations, provide separate health endpoints for monitoring\n> - **Rationale**: Service lookup should return only usable instances by default. Monitoring tools need access to health details, but service clients want pre-filtered results for simplicity.\n> - **Consequences**: Lookup operations are immediately usable, but monitoring requires separate API calls\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Auto-filter unhealthy | Simple for clients | Less visibility |\n| Include health flags | Full visibility | More complex responses |\n| Separate health endpoints | Clean separation | Multiple API calls needed |\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\nHTTP API implementations often suffer from common mistakes that affect reliability, security, and maintainability. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid production issues and provides better developer experience.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Insufficient Input Validation**\n\nMany implementations perform minimal validation on incoming requests, leading to data corruption, system crashes, or security vulnerabilities. For example, accepting empty service names allows invalid registrations that break lookup operations, while missing host validation can result in unreachable service instances being registered.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Invalid data in the registry corrupts the service discovery system. Services trying to connect to malformed addresses will fail, and empty names make services undiscoverable.\n\n**How to fix**: Implement comprehensive validation for every field. Service names should match naming conventions (alphanumeric plus hyphens), hosts should be valid IP addresses or hostnames, ports should be in valid ranges (1-65535), and health endpoints should be proper HTTP paths starting with '/'.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Responses**\n\nDifferent endpoints returning different error formats makes client error handling complex and unreliable. Some endpoints might return plain text errors, others JSON objects with different field names, leading to brittle client code that can't handle errors consistently.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Clients need to implement multiple error parsing strategies, increasing complexity and bug potential. Inconsistent errors also make debugging and logging more difficult.\n\n**How to fix**: Use the standardized `ErrorResponse` format for all error conditions. Create helper functions like `WriteErrorResponse` that enforce consistent formatting. Document all possible error codes and ensure they're used consistently across endpoints.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions with Concurrent Requests**\n\nMultiple simultaneous requests can create race conditions, especially during registration and deregistration operations. For example, two services registering with the same name simultaneously might interfere with each other, or a deregistration might happen while a health check is updating the same instance.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Race conditions can corrupt registry state, cause instances to disappear unexpectedly, or create inconsistent health status. These issues are often intermittent and difficult to debug.\n\n**How to fix**: Ensure the registry core handles concurrent access properly with appropriate locking. Design API operations to be atomic - either they succeed completely or fail completely with no partial state changes.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Content-Type Validation**\n\nAccepting requests without validating the Content-Type header can lead to parsing errors or security issues. For example, accepting `text/plain` data when expecting JSON can cause unmarshaling failures that crash the handler.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Malformed requests can crash handlers, and missing content-type validation can be exploited for injection attacks or DOS scenarios.\n\n**How to fix**: Validate that POST requests include `Content-Type: application/json` header. Reject requests with missing or incorrect content types using HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Error Status Codes**\n\nUsing generic HTTP 500 errors for all failures provides no guidance to clients about whether requests should be retried, what went wrong, or how to fix problems. This makes debugging difficult and prevents intelligent client retry logic.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: Clients can't distinguish between retryable errors (network issues) and permanent errors (validation failures), leading to unnecessary retries or missing legitimate retry opportunities.\n\n**How to fix**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes: 400 for validation errors, 404 for not found, 409 for conflicts, 429 for rate limiting, 500 only for unexpected internal errors. Include detailed error information in the response body.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Request Handlers**\n\nPerforming long-running operations like health checks directly in HTTP request handlers can cause request timeouts and poor user experience. For example, triggering an immediate health check during registration blocks the response until the check completes.\n\n**Why it's wrong**: HTTP clients expect reasonably fast responses. Blocking operations can cause timeouts, especially when network latency to health endpoints is high.\n\n**How to fix**: Keep request handlers fast by deferring expensive operations to background processes. Registration should return immediately after storing the instance, with health checking happening asynchronously.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe HTTP API layer requires careful integration of HTTP server components, request routing, input validation, and response formatting. The implementation should prioritize reliability, performance, and ease of maintenance while providing a developer-friendly interface.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| HTTP Server | `net/http` standard library | `gin-gonic/gin` or `gorilla/mux` framework |\n| JSON Handling | `encoding/json` standard library | `json-iterator/go` for performance |\n| Input Validation | Manual validation with helper functions | `go-playground/validator` struct tags |\n| Logging | `log` standard library | `logrus` or `zap` structured logging |\n| Middleware | Custom middleware functions | Framework-provided middleware stack |\n\nThe standard library approach provides excellent learning value and minimal dependencies, while the framework approach offers more convenience and advanced features for production use.\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\ninternal/api/\n  server.go              ← HTTP server setup and configuration\n  handlers.go           ← Request handler functions\n  middleware.go         ← Authentication, logging, CORS middleware\n  validation.go         ← Input validation helper functions\n  responses.go          ← Response formatting utilities\n  routes.go             ← Route definitions and URL patterns\n  server_test.go        ← Integration tests for HTTP endpoints\n  handlers_test.go      ← Unit tests for individual handlers\n```\n\nThis structure separates concerns clearly: server setup, request handling, validation, and response formatting each have dedicated files. The separation makes the codebase easier to navigate and test.\n\n#### HTTP Server Infrastructure\n\nThe following complete HTTP server infrastructure handles common concerns like JSON marshaling, error responses, and request logging, allowing you to focus on the core handler logic.\n\n```go\npackage api\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n

  w.Header().Set(\"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\", \"Content-Type\")\n        \n        if r.Method == \"OPTIONS\" {\n            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n            return\n        }\n        \n        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n    })\n}\n```\n\n#### Response Formatting Utilities\n\nThese utilities ensure consistent response formatting across all endpoints and simplify error handling in request handlers.\n\n```go\n// WriteJSONResponse sends a JSON response with the specified status code\nfunc WriteJSONResponse(w http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, data interface{}) {\n    w.Header().Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n    w.WriteHeader(statusCode)\n    \n    if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(data); err != nil {\n        log.Printf(\"Error encoding JSON

http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, message string, errorCode string) {\n    response := ErrorResponse{\n        error:      message,\n        error_code: errorCode,\n        details:    make(map[string]interface{}),\n    }\n    WriteJSONResponse(w, statusCode, response)\n}\n\n// WriteSuccessResponse sends a standardized success response\nfunc WriteSuccessResponse(w http.ResponseWriter, data interface{}, message string) {\n    response := SuccessResponse{\n        success: true,\n        data:    data,\n        message: message,\n    }\n    WriteJSONResponse(w, http.StatusOK, response)\n}\n\n// WriteValidationError sends a 400 error with validation details\nfunc WriteValidationError(w http.ResponseWriter, field string, problem string) {\n    response := ErrorResponse{\n        error:      fmt.Sprintf(\"Validation failed for field '%s': %s\", field, problem),\n        error_code: \"VALIDATION_ERROR\",\n        details: map[string]interface{}{\n            \"field\": field,\n            \"problem\": problem,\n        },\n    }\n    WriteJSONResponse(w, http.StatusBadRequest, response)\n}\n```\n\n#### Input Validation Functions\n\nComplete validation functions that check all service instance fields according to the requirements established in previous sections.\n\n```go\n// ValidateServiceInstance performs comprehensive validation of service instance data\nfunc ValidateServiceInstance(instance ServiceInstance) error {\n    if strings.TrimSpace(instance.Name) == \"\" {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"service name cannot be empty\")\n    }\n    \n    if !isValidServiceName(instance.Name) {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"service name must contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens\")\n    }\n    \n    if strings.TrimSpace(instance.Host) == \"\" {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"host cannot be empty\")\n    }\n    \n    if !isValidHost(instance.Host) {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"host must be a valid IP address or hostname\")\n    }\n    \n    if instance.Port <= 0 || instance.Port > 65535 {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"port must be between 1 and 65535\")\n    }\n    \n    if instance.HealthEndpoint != \"\" && !strings.HasPrefix(instance.HealthEndpoint, \"/\") {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"health endpoint must start with '/'\")\n    }\n    \n    return nil\n}\n\n// isValidServiceName checks service name format\nfunc isValidServiceName(name string) bool {\n    if len(name) == 0 || len(name) > 63 {\n        return false\n    }\n    \n    for _, char := range name {\n        if !((char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') || \n             (char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z') || \n             (char >= '0' && char <= '9') || \n             char == '-') {\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return true\n}\n\n// isValidHost checks if host is valid IP or hostname\nfunc isValidHost(host string) bool {\n    // Simple validation - in production, use net.ParseIP and more sophisticated hostname validation\n    return len(host) > 0 && len(host) < 255 && !strings.Contains(host, \" \")\n}\n```\n\n#### Core Handler Skeletons\n\nThe following handler skeletons provide the structure for implementing each endpoint while leaving the core logic for you to complete based on the algorithm descriptions from previous sections.\n\n```go\n// handleServices routes between POST (register) and GET (list all)\nfunc (s *Server) handleServices(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    switch r.Method {\n    case http.MethodPost:\n        s.handleServiceRegistration(w, r)\n    case http.MethodGet:\n        s.handleListAllServices(w, r)\n    default:\n        WriteErrorResponse(w, http.StatusMethodNotAllowed, \"Method not allowed\", \"METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED\")\n    }\n}\n\n// handleServiceRegistration processes POST /services requests\nfunc (s *Server) handleServiceRegistration(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // TODO 1: Validate Content-Type header is application/json\n    // TODO 2: Parse JSON request body into ServiceInstance struct\n    // TODO 3: Validate the service instance using ValidateServiceInstance()\n    // TODO 4: Call s.registry.Register() to register the instance\n    // TODO 5: Return success response with instance ID and registration time\n    // Hint: Use json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode() for parsing\n    //

http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    pathParts := strings.Split(strings.Trim(r.URL.Path, \"/\"), \"/\")\n    if len(pathParts) < 2 {\n        WriteErrorResponse(w, http.StatusNotFound, \"Invalid path\", \"INVALID_PATH\")\n        return\n    }\n    \n    serviceName := pathParts[1]\n    \n    if len(pathParts) == 2 {\n        // /services/{name}\n        if r.Method == http.MethodGet {\n            s.handleServiceLookup(w, r, serviceName)\n        } else {\n            WriteErrorResponse(w, http.StatusMethodNotAllowed, \"Method not allowed\",

   // Hint: This endpoint should never fail - return best available information\n}\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Implementation Tips\n\n**HTTP Server Management:**\n- Use `http.Server` struct with explicit timeouts to prevent resource leaks\n- Implement graceful shutdown using `Shutdown(ctx)` method with context timeout\n- Set reasonable `ReadTimeout` and `WriteTimeout` to prevent slow client attacks\n\n**JSON Handling:**\n- Use `json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode()` for request parsing to handle large payloads efficiently\n- Always set `Content-Type: application/json` header before encoding responses\n- Handle JSON marshaling errors gracefully - they indicate internal data corruption\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Distinguish between client errors (4xx) and server errors (5xx) consistently\n- Log internal errors but don't expose internal details to clients\n- Use structured error responses to enable programmatic error handling\n\n**Concurrent Access:**\n- The registry core handles concurrency, but ensure handler functions don't hold locks\n- Keep handlers stateless - don't store request data in handler structs\n- Use context values for request-scoped data like request IDs\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the HTTP API layer, verify functionality with these checkpoints:\n\n**Basic Registration Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/services \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"Name\":\"web-api\",\"Host\":\"192.168.1.100\",\"Port\":8080,\"HealthEndpoint\":\"/health\"}'\n```\nExpected: JSON response with `success: true` and an `instanceID` in the data field.\n\n**Service Lookup Test:**\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/services/web-api\n```\nExpected: JSON response with `ServiceList` containing the registered instance and `HealthyCount: 1`.\n\n**All Services List Test:**\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/services\n```\nExpected: Array of `ServiceList` objects, including the registered service.\n\n**Health Status Test:**\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/health\n```\nExpected: `RegistryStats` showing `TotalServices: 1`, `TotalInstances: 1`, and appropriate health breakdown.\n\n**Deregistration Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/services/web-api/{instanceID}\n```\nExpected: Success response, followed by empty results from lookup endpoints.\n\n**Error Handling Tests:**\n- Send malformed JSON - should return 400 with validation error\n- Look up non-existent service - should return empty list (not 404)\n- Use unsupported HTTP methods - should return 405 Method Not Allowed\n- Send requests without Content-Type - should return 400\n\nSigns of correct implementation:\n- All endpoints return consistent JSON format using `SuccessResponse` or `ErrorResponse`\n- Validation errors include specific field names and problems\n- Concurrent requests don't interfere with each other\n- Health filtering works correctly (unhealthy instances don't appear in lookups)\n- System health endpoint provides accurate statistics\n\n\n## Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section shows how the components from service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API (Milestone 3) work together to create a complete service discovery system.\n\nUnderstanding how the three main components of our service discovery system interact is crucial for building a system that works reliably in production. While each component has distinct responsibilities, they must coordinate seamlessly to maintain an accurate, real-time view of service health across a distributed system. This section examines the key workflows that demonstrate these interactions: how services join the registry, how clients discover healthy services, and how the system continuously monitors and updates service health status.\n\nThe interactions between components follow well-defined patterns that ensure data consistency and system reliability. The registry core serves as the central authority for all service data, while the health checker operates as a background process that continuously validates service availability. The HTTP API layer acts as the interface between external services and the internal components, translating REST requests into registry operations and health status queries.\n\n### Service Registration Flow\n\n![Service Registration Sequence](./diagrams/registration-sequence.svg)\n\nThe service registration flow represents the first interaction a new service has with the discovery system. This workflow establishes the service's identity, configures health monitoring, and makes the service available for discovery by other clients. Understanding this flow is essential because it sets up all the data structures and monitoring processes that will govern the service's lifecycle within the registry.\n\nWhen a service starts up and wants to announce its availability, it initiates a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations that span all three components of the system. The process begins with an HTTP request to the API layer, flows through the registry core for data storage and validation, and culminates with the health checker beginning continuous monitoring of the new service instance.\n\n#### Initial Registration Request\n\nThe registration process starts when a service sends an HTTP POST request to the `/services` endpoint. This request contains all the essential metadata that other services will need to communicate with the registering service. The HTTP API layer receives this request and immediately begins a series of validation and processing steps.\n\nThe API layer first extracts the service instance data from the JSON request body, parsing fields like service name, host, port, health endpoint, and any associated tags or metadata. This raw data undergoes comprehensive validation to ensure it meets all system requirements and constraints. The validation process checks for required fields, validates network addresses and port ranges, ensures the health endpoint URL is well-formed, and verifies that any provided tags conform to naming conventions.\n\n| Validation Check | Field | Criteria | Error Response |\n|------------------|-------|----------|----------------|\n| Required Fields | Name, Host, Port | Must be present and non-empty | 400 Bad Request - Missing required field |\n| Host Format | Host | Valid hostname or IP address | 400 Bad Request - Invalid host format |\n| Port Range | Port | Integer between 1-65535 | 400 Bad Request - Invalid port range |\n| Health Endpoint | HealthEndpoint | Valid HTTP URL path | 400 Bad Request - Invalid health endpoint |\n| Service Name | Name | Alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores | 400 Bad Request - Invalid service name |\n| Tags Format | Tags | Array of valid tag strings | 400 Bad Request - Invalid tag format |\n\n#### Registry Core Processing\n\nOnce validation succeeds, the API layer calls the registry core's `Register(instance)` method, passing the validated `ServiceInstance` structure. The registry core takes ownership of the registration process at this point, handling all the complex logic around instance identity, duplicate detection, and data storage.\n\nThe registry core first generates a unique instance identifier for the new service registration. This identifier serves as the primary key for all future operations involving this specific service instance. The generation process combines the service name, host, and port with a timestamp and random component to ensure uniqueness even when services restart quickly or register multiple times.\n\n> **Decision: Instance Identity Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Need unique identifiers for service instances that can handle rapid restarts and duplicate registrations\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Service-provided IDs (services generate their own identifiers)\n>   - Host-port combinations (use network address as identifier)\n>   - Registry-generated UUIDs (system creates unique identifiers)\n> - **Decision**: Registry-generated UUIDs with deterministic fallback\n> - **Rationale**: Registry-generated IDs prevent collisions and handle edge cases like rapid restarts, while deterministic fallback based on host-port ensures consistency for services that restart quickly\n> - **Consequences**: Eliminates ID collision issues but requires registry to track more metadata; enables robust duplicate detection\n\nThe registry core then checks for existing registrations that might conflict with the new instance. This duplicate detection process examines both exact matches (same host and port) and potential conflicts (same service name but different metadata). When an exact match is found, the registry updates the existing entry rather than creating a duplicate, ensuring the system maintains a clean view of service instances.\n\n#### Data Structure Creation and Storage\n\nWith a unique instance ID established, the registry core creates the complete data structures that will represent this service throughout its lifecycle. The process begins with creating a `RegistryEntry` that combines the service instance metadata with health status tracking and registration timestamps.\n\n| Registry Entry Component | Initial Value | Purpose |\n|-------------------------|---------------|---------|\n| Instance | Provided ServiceInstance data | Service metadata and connection information |\n| Health | Uninitialized HealthStatus | Placeholder for health monitoring data |\n| RegisteredAt | Current timestamp | Track registration time for TTL calculations |\n| InstanceID | Generated unique identifier | Primary key for all registry operations |\n\nThe `HealthStatus` structure within the registry entry starts in an uninitialized state, with status set to \"unknown\" and all timing fields set to zero values. This reflects the fact that no health checks have been performed yet, and the service's actual availability is unknown until the first health check completes.\n\nThe registry core stores this new entry in its internal data structures, typically using the instance ID as the primary key and maintaining secondary indexes by service name for efficient lookup operations. The storage operation must be thread-safe since multiple services might register simultaneously, requiring careful synchronization to prevent data corruption.\n\n#### Health Check Initialization\n\nAfter successful storage in the registry core, the registration process triggers initialization of health monitoring for the new service instance. The registry core notifies the health checker component about the new service through the `ScheduleHealthCheck(instanceID, instance)` method call.\n\nThe health checker receives this notification and creates a `ScheduledCheck` entry for the new service instance. This entry defines when the first health check should occur, what interval should be used for subsequent checks, and how many consecutive failures are allowed before marking the service as unhealthy.\n\n| Scheduled Check Field | Initial Value | Calculation Method |\n|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| InstanceID | From registration | Direct copy from registry entry |\n| ServiceName | From ServiceInstance | Used for service-specific health policies |\n| NextCheck | Current time + initial delay | Prevents thundering herd on startup |\n| Interval | From Config.HealthCheckInterval | Default interval, may be service-specific |\n| FailureCount | 0 | No failures recorded yet |\n\nThe health checker schedules the first health check with a small random delay to prevent all services from being checked simultaneously if many register at once. This jittering technique helps distribute the health check load and prevents system overload during bulk service registrations.\n\n#### Response Generation and Client Notification\n\nWith all internal processing complete, the registration flow concludes by generating a response to the original HTTP client. The API layer constructs a success response that includes the generated instance ID and confirmation of successful registration.\n\nThe response follows the standard `SuccessResponse` format, providing the client with all information needed to manage its registration lifecycle. Most importantly, the response includes the instance ID that the service must use for any future deregistration requests.\n\n| Response Field | Value | Purpose |\n|----------------|-------|---------|\n| success | true | Indicates successful registration |\n| data.instanceID | Generated unique ID | Required for future deregistration |\n| data.healthEndpoint | Confirmed health endpoint | Shows what will be monitored |\n| data.nextHealthCheck | Estimated first check time | When monitoring begins |\n| message | \"Service registered successfully\" | Human-readable confirmation |\n\n#### Common Registration Edge Cases\n\nThe registration flow must handle several edge cases that commonly occur in distributed systems. These scenarios require careful consideration to ensure the system behaves predictably and recovers gracefully from unusual conditions.\n\n**Rapid Re-registration**: When a service restarts quickly and attempts to register before its previous registration has been cleaned up, the system must detect this scenario and update the existing entry rather than creating a duplicate. The registry core uses the host-port combination to identify potential duplicates and merges the new registration data with any existing health history that might be relevant.\n\n**Partial Failures**: If the registration process fails after storing the service in the registry but before initializing health checks, the system must ensure consistency. The registry implements compensation logic that can detect and repair these partial states during the next cleanup cycle.\n\n**Network Issues During Registration**: When network problems cause the registration HTTP request to fail or timeout, services must implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff. The registry API is designed to be idempotent, so repeated registration requests with the same service data will not create duplicate entries.\n\n### Service Lookup Flow\n\n![Service Discovery Sequence](./diagrams/lookup-sequence.svg)\n\nThe service lookup flow represents how clients discover and retrieve information about available service instances. This workflow is typically the most frequent operation in a service discovery system, as services continuously need to find and communicate with their dependencies. The lookup flow demonstrates the coordination between the HTTP API layer and the registry core to provide clients with current, accurate information about healthy service instances.\n\nUnlike the registration flow, which modifies system state, the lookup flow is primarily a read operation that filters and returns existing data. However, this apparent simplicity masks important complexity around data consistency, health status filtering, and performance optimization for high-frequency access patterns.\n\n#### Client Lookup Request\n\nThe lookup process begins when a client sends an HTTP GET request to the `/services/{serviceName}` endpoint, where the service name identifies which type of service the client wants to discover. This request represents a client's need to find available instances of a particular service to establish communication.\n\nThe HTTP API layer receives the lookup request and extracts the service name from the URL path. The API layer performs basic validation on the service name to ensure it matches expected formatting rules and doesn't contain any characters that might indicate injection attacks or malformed requests.\n\n| Validation Check | Purpose | Error Response |\n|------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Service name format | Prevent injection attacks | 400 Bad Request - Invalid service name |\n| Service name length | Prevent abuse | 400 Bad Request - Service name too long |\n| Special characters | Ensure URL safety | 400 Bad Request - Invalid characters |\n| Empty name | Basic requirement | 400 Bad Request - Service name required |\n\n#### Registry Query Processing\n\nAfter validating the request, the API layer calls the registry core's `Lookup(serviceName)` method to retrieve all instances of the requested service. This method triggers a multi-step process within the registry core that involves data retrieval, health filtering, and result preparation.\n\nThe registry core first queries its internal data structures to find all registered instances with the specified service name. This operation uses the secondary index maintained by service name to efficiently locate relevant entries without scanning the entire registry. The initial query returns all registered instances regardless of their current health status.\n\nThe query process must handle concurrent access carefully since lookup operations occur simultaneously with registrations, deregistrations, and health status updates. The registry core uses read-write locks to ensure that lookup operations can proceed concurrently with each other while being blocked only by write operations that modify the registry state.\n\n#### Health Status Filtering\n\nOnce the registry core retrieves the raw list of service instances, it applies health status filtering to return only instances that are currently available for client connections. This filtering process examines the `HealthStatus` of each instance to determine whether it should be included in the response.\n\nThe health filtering logic evaluates several criteria to determine instance availability:\n\n| Health Criteria | Evaluation | Include in Results |\n|----------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Status field | Must equal \"healthy\" | Yes if healthy |\n| Last check time | Within acceptable staleness window | No if too old |\n| Failure count | Below maximum threshold | No if exceeded |\n| Registration TTL | Not expired | No if expired |\n| Health endpoint | Responding to checks | No if unreachable |\n\nThe filtering process also considers the recency of health information to ensure clients don't receive stale data about service availability. If a service's health status hasn't been updated recently, it may be excluded from results even if its last known status was healthy, since network partitions or system issues might have prevented recent health checks.\n\n> **The critical insight here is that health filtering must balance freshness with availability - being too strict about health staleness can cause cascading failures when the health checker experiences temporary delays, while being too lenient can direct traffic to failed services.**\n\n#### Load Balancing Considerations\n\nAlthough the core service discovery system doesn't implement load balancing algorithms, the lookup flow prepares data in ways that support client-side load balancing decisions. The registry core can optionally shuffle the order of returned instances to prevent clients from always connecting to the first instance in the list.\n\nThe response includes metadata that helps clients make intelligent load balancing decisions, such as instance health scores, recent response times, and current failure counts. This information allows sophisticated clients to implement weighted load balancing or prefer instances with better health metrics.\n\n| Metadata Field | Purpose | Client Usage |\n|----------------|---------|--------------|\n| ResponseTime | Average health check latency | Prefer faster instances |\n| FailureCount | Recent failure history | Avoid recently failed instances |\n| LastCheck | Health information freshness | Assess data reliability |\n| RegisteredAt | Instance stability | Prefer stable instances |\n\n#### Response Construction and Optimization\n\nWith health filtering complete, the registry core constructs a response containing the list of healthy service instances. The response uses the `ServiceList` structure to provide both the instance data and useful metadata about the overall service health.\n\nThe API layer receives the filtered service list from the registry core and constructs an HTTP response using the standard `SuccessResponse` format. The response includes comprehensive information about each healthy instance, enabling clients to make connection decisions without requiring additional API calls.\n\n| Response Section | Contents | Client Benefit |\n|------------------|----------|----------------|\n| Instances array | Healthy ServiceInstance objects | Connection details for each instance |\n| TotalCount | All registered instances | Understand service scale |\n| HealthyCount | Currently available instances | Assess service health |\n| ServiceName | Requested service identifier | Confirm response accuracy |\n\n#### Caching and Performance Optimization\n\nThe lookup flow includes several performance optimizations that reduce latency and system load for frequently accessed services. The API layer can implement response caching with short TTL values to serve repeated requests for the same service without querying the registry core.\n\nThe caching strategy must balance performance with data freshness, ensuring clients receive reasonably current information about service availability. Cache invalidation occurs when services register, deregister, or experience health status changes, maintaining accuracy while providing performance benefits.\n\n**Cache Strategy Decision Table:**\n\n| Cache Duration | Pros | Cons | Recommended Use |\n|----------------|------|------|-----------------|\n| 5-10 seconds | High performance, low registry load | Possible stale data | High-frequency lookups |\n| 1-2 seconds | Good performance, fresher data | Moderate registry load | Standard lookups |\n| No caching | Always fresh data | High latency, high load | Critical health-sensitive lookups |\n\n#### Error Handling and Fallback\n\nThe lookup flow implements comprehensive error handling to ensure clients receive useful information even when parts of the system experience problems. When the registry core encounters issues, the API layer returns appropriate HTTP status codes with detailed error information.\n\nCommon error scenarios include service name not found, temporary registry unavailability, and health checker delays that prevent accurate health status determination. Each error condition requires different client-side handling strategies.\n\n| Error Condition | HTTP Status | Client Recommendation |\n|----------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Service not found | 404 Not Found | Check service name, may not be registered |\n| Registry unavailable | 503 Service Unavailable | Retry with exponential backoff |\n| All instances unhealthy | 200 OK with empty list | Use cached instances or fallback service |\n| Stale health data | 200 OK with warning header | Accept results but retry soon |\n\n### Health Check Flow\n\n![Health Check Process Flow](./diagrams/health-check-flow.svg)\n\nThe health check flow represents the background process that continuously monitors service health and maintains the accuracy of the service registry. This workflow operates independently of client requests, running on a scheduled basis to verify that registered services are still available and responsive. The health check flow demonstrates the coordination between the health checker component and the registry core to maintain real-time service availability information.\n\nThe health check process is fundamentally different from registration and lookup flows because it operates autonomously in the background, driven by timers and schedules rather than external requests. This background operation must be robust and efficient, since it runs continuously and affects the availability information that clients receive during service discovery.\n\n#### Health Check Scheduling and Coordination\n\nThe health check flow begins with the scheduler component within the health checker identifying which service instances require health verification. The scheduler maintains a priority queue of `ScheduledCheck` entries, ordered by the next check time for each service instance.\n\nThe scheduling algorithm runs in a continuous loop, examining the priority queue to identify checks that are due for execution. When a check's scheduled time arrives, the scheduler removes it from the queue and initiates the health verification process. After completing a check, the scheduler calculates the next check time based on the service's configured interval and the check result.\n\n| Scheduling Decision | Condition | Next Check Time | Rationale |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Successful check | Health endpoint responds | Base interval | Maintain normal monitoring |\n| First failure | Single check failure | Half interval | Increase monitoring frequency |\n| Multiple failures | Consecutive failures | Quarter interval | Rapid failure detection |\n| Recovery | Failed to healthy | Base interval | Return to normal monitoring |\n| Service deregistered | Instance removed | Remove from queue | Stop unnecessary checks |\n\nThe scheduler implements jittering to prevent synchronized health checks that could overwhelm either the health checker or the target services. Each check time includes a small random offset that spreads the load over time while maintaining the target check frequency.\n\n#### Health Check Execution Process\n\nWhen a scheduled check becomes due, the health checker initiates the actual health verification process by calling the `CheckServiceHealth(instance)` method. This method orchestrates the communication with the target service's health endpoint and interprets the response to determine service availability.\n\nThe health check execution follows a standardized protocol that works across different types of services and health endpoint implementations. The process begins by constructing an HTTP request to the service's health endpoint, setting appropriate timeouts and headers to ensure the check completes within a reasonable time frame.\n\n| HTTP Request Component | Value | Purpose |\n|-----------------------|-------|---------|\n| Method | GET | Standard health check protocol |\n| URL | Service host + health endpoint path | Target the service's health endpoint |\n| Timeout | Config.HealthTimeout (default 10s) | Prevent hanging checks |\n| User-Agent | ServiceDiscovery/1.0 HealthChecker | Identify health check requests |\n| Accept | application/json | Support structured health responses |\n\nThe health checker sends the HTTP request and waits for a response within the configured timeout period. The interpretation of the response follows standard HTTP health check conventions, where 2xx status codes indicate healthy services and any other status codes or timeouts indicate service problems.\n\n#### Response Interpretation and Status Determination\n\nAfter receiving a response from the service's health endpoint, the health checker interprets the result to determine the service's current health status. This interpretation process considers both the HTTP status code and the response timing to make an accurate assessment of service availability.\n\nThe health status determination follows a clear decision tree that maps different response scenarios to health outcomes:\n\n| Response Scenario | HTTP Status | Response Time | Health Decision | Rationale |\n|------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Normal response | 200-299 | Within timeout | Healthy | Service responding normally |\n| Client error | 400-499 | Within timeout | Healthy | Health endpoint exists but has issues |\n| Server error | 500-599 | Within timeout | Unhealthy | Service experiencing problems |\n| Connection refused | N/A | Immediate | Unhealthy | Service not running or unreachable |\n| Timeout | N/A | Exceeds limit | Unhealthy | Service too slow or unresponsive |\n| Network error | N/A | Variable | Unhealthy | Network connectivity problems |\n\n> **Decision: Health Check Response Interpretation**\n> - **Context**: Need consistent criteria for determining service health from HTTP responses\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Strict interpretation (only 200 OK is healthy)\n>   - Lenient interpretation (any response is healthy)\n>   - Configurable interpretation (per-service health criteria)\n> - **Decision**: Moderate interpretation with 2xx as healthy, errors as unhealthy\n> - **Rationale**: Balances false positives from strict interpretation with false negatives from lenient approach; provides predictable behavior across different service implementations\n> - **Consequences**: Services must implement proper health endpoints that return appropriate status codes; reduces false unhealthy markings from minor issues\n\nThe health checker also records timing information from each check, including the total response time and any error details. This metadata helps with debugging service issues and provides valuable information for monitoring and alerting systems.\n\n#### Health Status Update and Registry Integration\n\nAfter determining the health status from the check response, the health checker updates the service's health information in the registry core through the `UpdateHealth(serviceName, instanceID, status)` method. This update process ensures that the latest health information is immediately available for service lookup operations.\n\nThe health status update includes comprehensive information about the check result, not just a simple healthy/unhealthy determination. The `HealthStatus` structure captures all relevant details that might be useful for debugging or monitoring purposes.\n\n| Health Status Field | Updated Value | Purpose |\n|--------------------|---------------|---------|\n| Status | \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy\" | Primary availability indicator |\n| LastCheck | Current timestamp | Track when information was gathered |\n| FailureCount | Increment on failure, reset on success | Count consecutive failures |\n| ResponseTime | Actual response duration | Performance monitoring |\n| LastError | Error description if applicable | Debugging information |\n\nThe registry core receives the health update and immediately applies it to the stored `RegistryEntry` for the service instance. This update must be thread-safe since it occurs concurrently with lookup operations and other registry modifications.\n\n#### Failure Count Management and Thresholds\n\nThe health check flow implements sophisticated failure counting logic that distinguishes between temporary service hiccups and persistent failures. This approach prevents single failed checks from immediately marking services as unhealthy while still detecting genuine service problems quickly.\n\nThe failure counting system tracks consecutive health check failures for each service instance. When a check succeeds, the failure count resets to zero. When a check fails, the failure count increments, and the system evaluates whether the service should be marked as unhealthy based on the configured failure threshold.\n\n| Failure Count | Health Status | Lookup Visibility | Rationale |\n|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| 0 | Healthy | Visible | Service responding normally |\n| 1 | Healthy | Visible | Single failure might be transient |\n| 2 | Healthy | Visible | Two failures still might be temporary |\n| 3+ (at threshold) | Unhealthy | Hidden | Persistent failure detected |\n\nThe failure threshold is configurable through the `Config.MaxFailures` setting, allowing operators to tune the sensitivity of failure detection based on their environment's characteristics. Networks with high latency or occasional packet loss might require higher thresholds, while reliable networks can use lower thresholds for faster failure detection.\n\n#### Cleanup and Deregistration Integration\n\nThe health check flow coordinates with the registry's cleanup processes to handle service instances that should no longer be monitored. When services deregister explicitly or when TTL expiration removes them from the registry, the health checker must stop monitoring those instances to prevent resource waste.\n\nThe health checker maintains synchronization with the registry core through periodic reconciliation processes that identify orphaned health checks. These cleanup operations ensure that the health checker doesn't continue monitoring services that are no longer registered, preventing resource leaks and unnecessary network traffic.\n\n| Cleanup Trigger | Detection Method | Action Taken |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Explicit deregistration | Registry notification | Remove from schedule immediately |\n| TTL expiration | Registry cleanup notification | Remove from schedule after grace period |\n| Health check failures | Failure count exceeds maximum | Continue checking but mark unhealthy |\n| Network unreachability | Extended failure period | Reduce check frequency but continue |\n\n#### Performance Optimization and Resource Management\n\nThe health check flow implements several performance optimizations to ensure it can scale to monitor large numbers of service instances without overwhelming system resources. These optimizations focus on efficient scheduling, connection reuse, and intelligent batching of health checks.\n\nThe health checker uses HTTP connection pooling to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each health check. This optimization is particularly important when monitoring many instances of the same service, as it allows multiple health checks to reuse the same underlying TCP connections.\n\n**Resource Management Strategies:**\n\n| Resource | Optimization Technique | Benefit |\n|----------|----------------------|---------|\n| HTTP connections | Connection pooling with per-host limits | Reduce connection establishment overhead |\n| Memory usage | Bounded queues and periodic cleanup | Prevent memory growth with large instance counts |\n| CPU usage | Configurable concurrency limits | Prevent health checking from overwhelming the system |\n| Network bandwidth | Intelligent check distribution | Spread network load over time |\n\nThe health checker also implements backpressure mechanisms that slow down health checking when system resources become constrained. These mechanisms help maintain system stability during peak load periods or when monitoring very large numbers of service instances.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology

registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3), with each milestone introducing new failure modes.\n\n### Mental Model: The Hospital Emergency Response\n\nThink of our service discovery system like a hospital managing patient admissions and monitoring. The hospital (service registry) needs to handle three types of emergencies: communication failures (network issues), patient crises (service failures), and overcrowding (system overload). Just as a hospital has protocols for handling ambulance radio failures, distinguishing between minor ailments and critical conditions, and managing capacity during disasters, our system needs comprehensive error handling strategies.\n\nThe triage nurse (error detection) must quickly identify the severity of each situation, the emergency response team (recovery mechanisms) must know exactly how to respond to each type of crisis, and the hospital administration (system protection) must prevent any single emergency from overwhelming the entire facility.\n\nRobust error handling in distributed systems requires understanding that failures are not exceptional cases—they are normal operating conditions that must be handled gracefully. Network partitions will occur, services will crash unexpectedly, and traffic spikes will strain system resources. The quality of a service discovery system is measured not by its performance during perfect conditions, but by its behavior when everything goes wrong simultaneously.\n\n![Failure Scenario Flowchart](./diagrams/failure-scenarios.svg)\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying all error handling in service discovery is **failure isolation**—ensuring that problems with individual services, network segments, or system components do not cascade into system-wide outages. This requires careful design of failure detection mechanisms, recovery procedures, and protective measures that maintain system stability even when multiple components are failing.\n\n### Network Failure Scenarios\n\nNetwork failures represent the most common and challenging class of problems in distributed systems. Unlike service failures, which affect individual components, network failures can partition the system and make it impossible to distinguish between a failed service and a healthy service that cannot be reached.\n\n> **Critical Design Principle**: Network failures must be treated as temporary by default, with escalating responses based on failure duration and pattern analysis.\n\n#### Connection Timeout Handling\n\nConnection timeouts occur when the health checker cannot establish a connection to a service's health endpoint within the configured timeout period. These failures can indicate network congestion, service overload, or actual service failure, making them particularly challenging to interpret correctly.\n\nThe health checking system must implement **progressive timeout handling** that distinguishes between transient network issues and persistent service problems. When a connection timeout occurs, the system should not immediately mark the service as unhealthy, but instead implement a graduated response based on the pattern of failures.\n\n| Timeout Scenario | Detection Method | Response Strategy | Recovery Action |\n|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Single timeout | Connection establishment > `HealthTimeout` | Increment failure count, schedule immediate retry | No status change if under `MaxFailures` |\n| Intermittent timeouts | Pattern of timeout/success alternating | Extend check interval, reduce timeout sensitivity | Monitor for pattern stabilization |\n| Sustained timeouts | Multiple consecutive timeouts > `MaxFailures` | Mark instance unhealthy, remove from active pool | Continue background checking for recovery |\n| Network partition | All services in subnet timing out simultaneously | Isolate affected network segment, maintain service state | Restore services when connectivity returns |\n\nThe timeout detection algorithm follows this decision process:\n\n1. **Timeout Detection**: The `HealthCheckClient` monitors connection establishment time and request completion time separately\n2. **Pattern Analysis**: The system maintains a sliding window of recent check results to identify timeout patterns\n3. **Escalation Logic**: Based on timeout frequency and duration, the system chooses between immediate retry, delayed retry, or service marking\n4. **Recovery Detection**: Background checks continue even for timed-out services to detect when connectivity is restored\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Timeout Escalation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Network timeouts can indicate temporary congestion or permanent service failure, requiring different responses\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate marking, fixed backoff, adaptive backoff with pattern analysis\n> - **Decision**: Progressive escalation with pattern analysis and background recovery checks\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents false positives from transient network issues while ensuring failed services are detected promptly\n> - **Consequences**: More complex timeout logic but significantly reduced false positive rate and faster recovery\n\n#### Network Partition Recovery\n\nNetwork partitions occur when network connectivity is lost between the service registry and groups of services, creating \"split-brain\" scenarios where services remain healthy but appear failed to the health checker. Recovery from network partitions requires careful orchestration to prevent service registry thrashing.\n\nWhen connectivity is restored after a partition, the system must **gradually reintegrate** services rather than immediately marking all previously unreachable services as healthy. This prevents overwhelming recovered services with sudden traffic surges and allows time to verify actual service health.\n\nThe partition recovery process involves several stages:\n\n1. **Partition Detection**: Identify when multiple services in the same network segment fail simultaneously\n2. **State Preservation**: Maintain service registration data for partitioned services rather than immediately removing them\n3. **Connectivity Restoration**: Detect when network connectivity to the partitioned segment is restored\n4. **Gradual Reintegration**: Slowly increase health check frequency and verify service health before marking services available\n5. **Traffic Ramping**: Coordinate with load balancing to gradually increase traffic to recovered services\n\n| Partition Phase | System Behavior | Health Check Strategy | Service Availability |\n|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Active partition | Mark segment as partitioned, maintain registrations | Suspend health checks for partitioned segment | Remove partitioned services from active pool |\n| Recovery detection | Detect first successful health check in segment | Resume health checks with extended intervals | Keep services unavailable pending verification |\n| Verification | Verify multiple services in segment are responsive | Standard health check interval | Mark verified services as healthy |\n| Full recovery | All segment services verified or expired | Normal health checking resumes | Full service availability restored |\n\n#### Connection Pool Management\n\nThe health checking system maintains connection pools to service health endpoints to avoid the overhead of establishing new connections for each health check. However, connection pools can become a source of cascading failures if not managed properly during network issues.\n\n**Connection pool exhaustion** occurs when many health checks fail with long timeouts, tying up connections and preventing new health checks from being performed. The system must implement **adaptive connection management** that adjusts pool sizes and connection timeouts based on current network conditions.\n\nThe connection management strategy includes:\n\n- **Dynamic Pool Sizing**: Adjust connection pool sizes based on health check success rates and response times\n- **Connection Health**: Monitor connection staleness and proactively close connections that may be broken\n- **Failure Isolation**: Isolate failing endpoints to prevent them from consuming excessive connection pool resources\n- **Recovery Optimization**: Prioritize connection pool resources for services showing signs of recovery\n\n### Service Failure Detection\n\nService failures differ from network failures in that they represent actual problems with service functionality rather than connectivity issues. Accurate service failure detection requires distinguishing between different types of service problems and implementing appropriate responses for each.\n\n#### Temporary vs Permanent Service Failures\n\nThe most critical distinction in service failure detection is between **temporary failures** that will resolve automatically and **permanent failures** that require intervention. Temporary failures include resource exhaustion, dependency unavailability, or transient configuration issues. Permanent failures include application crashes, critical resource failures, or configuration errors that prevent service startup.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The key to accurate failure classification is observing failure patterns over time rather than making decisions based on individual health check results.\n\n| Failure Type | Characteristics | Detection Pattern | Response Strategy |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Temporary resource exhaustion | High response times, occasional timeouts | Gradual degradation followed by recovery | Maintain registration, mark temporarily unhealthy |\n| Dependency failure | Consistent error responses with specific codes | Immediate failure, consistent error pattern | Mark unhealthy, increase check interval |\n| Application crash | Connection refused, no response | Immediate connection failure | Mark unhealthy, attempt restart notification |\n| Configuration error | Consistent HTTP 500 errors | Immediate failure, consistent error response | Mark permanently failed, require manual intervention |\n| Resource leak | Progressively slower responses | Gradual response time increase | Alert for intervention, prepare for restart |\n\nThe service failure classification algorithm analyzes multiple dimensions of health check results:\n\n1. **Response Time Trends**: Monitor whether response times are increasing, stable, or improving over time\n2. **Error Code Patterns**: Analyze HTTP status codes and error messages to identify specific failure modes\n3. **Failure Consistency**: Determine whether failures are consistent or intermittent\n4. **Recovery Indicators**: Look for signs that a service is attempting to recover or has stabilized in a failed state\n\n#### Health Endpoint Response Analysis\n\nService health endpoints can provide detailed information about service status beyond simple success/failure indicators. Sophisticated health checking analyzes response content, timing patterns, and metadata to make more accurate health determinations.\n\nThe `HealthCheckResult` structure captures comprehensive information about each health check attempt:\n\n| Field | Type | Purpose | Analysis Usage |\n|-------|------|---------|----------------|\n| Success | bool | Basic success/failure indicator | Primary health determination |\n| ResponseTime | time.Duration | Request completion time | Performance trend analysis |\n| StatusCode | int | HTTP response status code | Error classification and pattern detection |\n| Error | string | Detailed error information | Failure mode identification |\n| CheckTime | time.Time | When check was performed | Temporal pattern analysis |\n\nAdvanced health endpoint analysis includes:\n\n- **Response Content Parsing**: Parse JSON health responses to extract detailed service status information\n- **Performance Correlation**: Correlate response times with service load and resource utilization\n- **Error Message Classification**: Categorize error messages to identify specific failure modes\n- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor health metric trends to predict service failures before they occur\n\n#### Cascade Failure Prevention\n\nOne of the most dangerous scenarios in service discovery is **cascade failure**, where the failure of one service triggers failures in dependent services, ultimately leading to system-wide outages. The service registry must implement protective mechanisms to prevent cascade failures from propagating through the system.\n\nCascade failure prevention strategies include:\n\n1. **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Coordinate with circuit breakers in client services to prevent overwhelming failing services\n2. **Gradual Degradation**: Remove failing services from the registry gradually rather than immediately\n3. **Load Shedding Coordination**: Communicate with load balancers to redirect traffic away from struggling services\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: Track service dependencies to predict cascade failure propagation paths\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Cascade Failure Prevention**\n> - **Context**: Service failures can trigger cascade failures that overwhelm the entire system\n> - **Options Considered**: Immediate removal, gradual degradation, dependency-aware removal\n> - **Decision**: Gradual degradation with dependency analysis and load coordination\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents sudden traffic shifts while maintaining system stability during failures\n> - **Consequences**: More complex failure handling logic but significantly reduced cascade failure risk\n\n![Concurrent Registry Access](./diagrams/concurrent-access.svg)\n\n### System Overload Protection\n\nSystem overload occurs when the service registry itself becomes overwhelmed by the volume of registration requests, health checks, or service lookups. Unlike service failures, system overload affects the registry's ability to function correctly, potentially causing it to become a single point of failure for the entire system.\n\n#### Request Rate Limiting\n\nThe HTTP API layer must implement **adaptive rate limiting** that protects the registry from excessive request volumes while maintaining service availability for legitimate clients. Rate limiting must be sophisticated enough to distinguish between normal traffic spikes and potential abuse or misconfiguration.\n\n| Rate Limiting Strategy | Trigger Condition | Protection Mechanism | Client Impact |\n|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| Per-client limiting | Individual client exceeds request threshold | Return HTTP 429 with retry-after header | Specific client must back off |\n| Global rate limiting | Total system request rate exceeds capacity | Apply global request throttling | All clients experience slight delays |\n| Endpoint-specific limiting | Specific API endpoints overwhelmed | Limit access to expensive operations | Registration/deregistration delayed |\n| Emergency throttling | System resources critically low | Aggressive request rejection | Temporary service degradation |\n\nThe rate limiting implementation uses a **token bucket algorithm** with adaptive refill rates based on system performance metrics. When system response times increase or resource utilization approaches critical levels, the token refill rate decreases automatically, providing back-pressure to clients.\n\nRate limiting configuration includes:\n\n- **Base Request Rate**: Normal operating request rate per client and globally\n- **Burst Allowance**: Short-term burst capacity for handling traffic spikes\n- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic rate adjustments based on system performance\n- **Priority Classes**: Different rate limits for different types of operations (registration vs lookup)\n\n#### Memory Management and Cleanup\n\nThe service registry maintains in-memory data structures for service instances, health status, and historical information. Without proper memory management, the registry can experience **memory pressure** that degrades performance and potentially causes crashes.\n\nMemory management strategies include:\n\n1. **TTL-Based Cleanup**: Automatically remove expired service registrations and health check history\n2. **LRU Eviction**: Remove least recently used service instances when memory pressure increases\n3. **Batch Cleanup Operations**: Perform memory cleanup in batches to minimize performance impact\n4. **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Monitor memory utilization and trigger cleanup when thresholds are exceeded\n\nThe cleanup process is coordinated by the `FlowCoordinator` component, which schedules regular cleanup cycles and triggers emergency cleanup when memory pressure is detected:\n\n| Cleanup Type | Trigger Condition | Cleanup Scope | Performance Impact |\n|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Regular TTL cleanup | Scheduled interval (`CleanupInterval`) | Expired registrations and health data | Minimal, performed during low-traffic periods |\n| Emergency cleanup | Memory utilization > 85% | Aggressive cleanup of all expired data | Moderate, may cause brief response delays |\n| Historical data pruning | Health history size > threshold | Remove old health check results | Low, performed in background |\n| Connection cleanup | Connection pool exhaustion | Close idle and stale connections | Low, improves subsequent performance |\n\n#### Graceful Degradation Strategies\n\nWhen the service registry approaches resource limits, it must implement **graceful degradation** that maintains core functionality while temporarily reducing service quality. Graceful degradation prevents complete system failure by selectively disabling non-essential features.\n\nThe degradation strategy prioritizes service registry operations in order of importance:\n\n1. **Critical Operations**: Service lookup requests for existing healthy services (highest priority)\n2. **Important Operations**: Service registration and health status updates\n3. **Background Operations**: Health checking and cleanup processes\n4. **Optional Operations**: Statistical reporting and historical data collection\n\nDuring resource pressure, the system progressively disables lower-priority operations while maintaining higher-priority functionality:\n\n| Degradation Level | Resource Utilization | Disabled Features | Maintained Functionality |\n|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Level 1 | 70-80% | Historical data collection, detailed statistics | All core operations continue normally |\n| Level 2 | 80-90% | Background cleanup, non-essential health checks | Core registry and essential health checking |\n| Level 3 | 90-95% | New service registration, detailed health analysis | Service lookup for existing services only |\n| Emergency | >95% | All non-lookup operations | Read-only service lookup with cached data |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Aggressive Resource Protection**\nMany implementations make the mistake of implementing overly aggressive resource protection that degrades service quality unnecessarily. The system should tolerate brief resource spikes rather than immediately entering degradation mode. Use smoothed resource metrics over time windows rather than instantaneous measurements, and implement hysteresis in degradation thresholds (different thresholds for entering and exiting degradation modes) to prevent oscillation.\n\n#### Error Recovery Coordination\n\nWhen multiple components of the service registry experience errors simultaneously, the system must coordinate recovery efforts to prevent conflicting recovery actions and resource competition. **Recovery coordination** ensures that system recovery is orderly and efficient.\n\nThe `FlowCoordinator` manages system-wide error recovery through several mechanisms:\n\n1. **Recovery Prioritization**: Establish the order in which components should be recovered\n2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure recovery operations do not overwhelm available system resources\n3. **State Synchronization**: Coordinate state recovery between registry core, health checker, and API layer\n4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track recovery progress and adjust strategy if recovery stalls\n\nRecovery coordination follows this priority sequence:\n\n1. **Registry Core Recovery**: Restore service registration data from persistent storage or rebuild from known good state\n2. **Health Checker Recovery**: Resume health checking for known services, starting with previously healthy instances\n3. **API Layer Recovery**: Restore HTTP API functionality and begin accepting client requests\n4. **Background Process Recovery**: Resume cleanup, statistics collection, and other non-essential operations\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: False Positive Health Failures**\nOne of the most common mistakes in health checking implementation is creating systems that are too sensitive to transient network issues, resulting in healthy services being marked as failed due to temporary connectivity problems. This typically occurs when timeout values are set too low or when a single failed health check immediately marks a service as unhealthy. The solution is implementing failure thresholds that require multiple consecutive failures before marking a service unhealthy, and using appropriate timeout values that account for normal network latency variations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Response Formats**\nMany implementations fail to maintain consistent error response formats across different failure scenarios, making it difficult for clients to handle errors programmatically. This leads to brittle client implementations that break when new error conditions are encountered. Always use the standardized `ErrorResponse` structure for all error conditions, ensuring that error codes and messages follow consistent patterns that clients can reliably parse and handle.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Leak During Error Conditions**\nError handling paths often contain resource leaks because developers focus on the happy path and neglect proper cleanup in error scenarios. This is particularly problematic for network connections, file handles, and memory allocations that are created during failed operations. Implement comprehensive resource cleanup using defer statements or try-finally blocks, and ensure that all error paths release resources properly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cascade Failure Through Health Checking**\nAggressive health checking can inadvertently contribute to cascade failures by overwhelming struggling services with health check requests when they are already under stress. This occurs when health check intervals are too frequent or when multiple health checkers probe the same service simultaneously. Implement exponential backoff for health check intervals when services are struggling, and coordinate health checking across multiple registry instances to prevent overlapping checks.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Error Recovery**\nMany error recovery implementations use blocking operations that prevent the system from handling new requests while recovery is in progress. This extends outage duration unnecessarily and can make the system appear completely unavailable during recovery periods. Design error recovery as background operations that allow the system to continue serving requests with potentially degraded functionality rather than complete unavailability.\n\n### Implementation

providing the reliability required for production microservice environments.\n\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section provides comprehensive testing approaches that validate service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3).\n\n### Mental Model: The Quality Control Inspector\n\nThink of testing a service discovery system like a quality control inspector in a manufacturing plant with multiple production lines. The inspector has three levels of scrutiny: **component testing** (examining individual parts in isolation), **integration testing** (verifying that assembled components work together), and **milestone validation** (confirming that completed product stages meet specifications).\n\nJust as the inspector uses different tools and techniques for each level—magnifying glass for component defects, functional tests for assembled units, and full performance trials for finished products—our testing strategy employs unit tests with mocks for isolated components, integration tests for component interactions, and milestone checkpoints for end-to-end validation.\n\nThe inspector must also verify that the system gracefully handles anomalies: what happens when a component fails, when supply chains are disrupted, or when demand exceeds capacity? Similarly, our testing strategy must validate error scenarios, network failures, and system overload conditions to ensure robust behavior under stress.\n\n### Unit Testing Approach\n\nUnit testing in service discovery focuses on testing individual components in complete isolation using test doubles and controlled data. Each component—`ServiceRegistry`, `HealthChecker`, and `Server`—has distinct responsibilities that can be verified independently without external dependencies or side effects.\n\n**Component Isolation Strategy**\n\nThe unit testing approach treats each component as a black box with well-defined interfaces. The `ServiceRegistry` component is tested by providing controlled `ServiceInstance` data and verifying that registration, deregistration, and lookup operations maintain correct internal state. Health checking logic is isolated by mocking the HTTP client and time-based scheduling, allowing tests to verify failure counting and threshold logic without actual network calls or waiting for real time intervals.\n\nThe HTTP API layer requires mocking the underlying `ServiceRegistry` and `HealthChecker` dependencies, enabling tests to focus purely on request parsing, response formatting, and error handling. This isolation ensures that API tests remain fast and deterministic, independent of the complex state management and background processing in lower layers.\n\n> **Critical Testing Principle**: Unit tests must be completely deterministic and fast. Any test that depends on external systems, real network calls, actual time passage, or file system state is not a unit test—it's an integration test and belongs in a different test suite.\n\n**Test Data Management**\n\nUnit tests require carefully constructed test data that covers both typical scenarios and edge cases. Test data should include valid `ServiceInstance` configurations with various combinations of tags, health endpoints, and metadata. Edge case data must test boundary conditions: empty service names, invalid port numbers, malformed health endpoints, and extremely long tag lists.\n\nMock data for health checking should simulate various response scenarios: successful HTTP 200 responses, timeout conditions, connection refused errors, and malformed response bodies. The test data should also include time-based scenarios where health checks succeed initially but begin failing after a specific number of attempts, allowing verification of failure counting and threshold logic.\n\n**Mock and Test Double Strategy**\n\nEffective unit testing requires sophisticated mocking of external dependencies. The HTTP client used by `HealthChecker` must be replaced with a mock that can simulate network conditions: successful responses with configurable latency, various HTTP error codes, connection timeouts, and DNS resolution failures. The mock should track call patterns to verify that health checks are scheduled and executed according to configuration.\n\nTime-based operations require special attention in unit testing. Rather than using real time, tests should inject a controllable time source that allows advancing time instantly and verifying time-based behavior like TTL expiration, health check scheduling, and cleanup operations. This approach makes tests both faster and more reliable.\n\nThe registry's background cleanup operations present particular testing challenges. Tests must verify that expired registrations are removed, that cleanup operations don't interfere with active registrations, and that cleanup frequency matches configuration. This requires mocking the cleanup scheduler and providing controlled time advancement.\n\n**Core Testing Patterns**\n\nUnit tests should follow consistent patterns that make them easy to understand and maintain. Each test should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: set up test data and mocks, execute the operation being tested, and verify expected outcomes. Setup and teardown should be handled by test fixtures to ensure clean state between test runs.\n\nState verification requires comprehensive assertions that check not only the direct return values but also the internal state changes. When testing `Register`, verify not only that the operation returns success but also that the service appears in subsequent `Lookup` calls, that health checking is initiated, and that the registration timestamp is recorded correctly.\n\nError condition testing requires verifying both error return values and system state. When registration fails due to validation errors, verify that no partial state is left in the registry, that no health checks are scheduled for the invalid service, and that the error response contains appropriate diagnostic information.\n\n| Test Category | Focus Area | Mock Requirements | Verification Points |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Registry Core | Registration/lookup logic | Time source, cleanup scheduler | Service state, lookup results, expiration |\n| Health Checker | Failure detection logic | HTTP client, time source | Failure counts, status updates, scheduling |\n| HTTP API | Request/response handling | Registry, health checker | Status codes, response format, validation |\n| Configuration | Setting validation | File system, environment | Default values, override logic, validation |\n| Error Handling | Failure scenarios | Various failure modes | Error messages, state consistency, recovery |\n\n**Test Coverage Requirements**\n\nUnit test coverage should focus on decision points and state transitions rather than raw line coverage. Every conditional branch in the registration logic should have tests that exercise both the true and false paths. State machines like health status transitions require tests for every valid state change and verification that invalid transitions are properly rejected.\n\nBoundary condition testing is particularly important for service discovery systems. Tests should verify behavior at configuration limits: maximum number of registered services, health check timeout boundaries, TTL expiration edge cases, and rate limiting thresholds. These boundary tests often reveal off-by-one errors and race conditions that are difficult to detect in normal operation.\n\n**Error Injection Testing**\n\nUnit tests must systematically verify error handling by injecting failures at every external dependency point. Mock the HTTP client to return various error conditions and verify that the health checker responds appropriately: temporary failures increment failure counts without immediate deregistration, while permanent failures trigger immediate removal from the active service list.\n\nConfiguration error testing should verify that invalid configurations are detected early and result in clear error messages. Test scenarios should include missing required fields, invalid port ranges, negative timeout values, and conflicting settings. The system should fail fast with diagnostic information rather than attempting to operate with invalid configuration.\n\n### Integration Testing Scenarios\n\nIntegration testing verifies that components work correctly together in realistic scenarios without mocks or test doubles. These tests validate the complete data flow from HTTP API requests through registry operations to health checking and back to API responses. Integration tests catch issues that unit tests miss: timing dependencies, protocol mismatches, and state synchronization problems.\n\n**End-to-End Workflow Validation**\n\nIntegration tests must verify complete workflows from start to finish. The service registration workflow test begins with an HTTP POST request to register a service, verifies that the registry stores the service data correctly, confirms that health checking begins automatically, waits for the first health check to complete, and validates that the service appears in lookup results with correct health status.\n\nThe service deregistration workflow test registers a service, confirms it's healthy and discoverable, sends a DELETE request to remove the service, verifies that health checking stops immediately, and confirms that the service no longer appears in lookup results. This test must also verify that any cached data is invalidated and that cleanup operations complete successfully.\n\nThe health status change workflow test registers a service, waits for it to become healthy, stops the mock service to trigger health check failures, monitors the failure count progression, verifies that the service becomes unavailable after reaching the failure threshold, restarts the mock service, and confirms that the service recovers to healthy status.\n\n**Component Interaction Testing**\n\nIntegration tests must verify that components communicate correctly through their defined interfaces. The registry-to-health-checker interaction test verifies that newly registered services are automatically added to the health check schedule, that configuration changes (like modified check intervals) are propagated correctly, and that deregistered services are removed from the checking schedule immediately.\n\nThe health-checker-to-registry interaction test verifies that health status updates are applied correctly to registry state, that health check results trigger appropriate state transitions, and that registry queries return services with current health status. This test must also verify that health check operations don't interfere with concurrent registration and lookup operations.\n\nThe API-to-registry interaction test verifies that HTTP requests are correctly translated to registry operations, that registry responses are properly formatted as HTTP responses, and that error conditions in the registry layer result in appropriate HTTP error codes and error messages.\n\n**Concurrent Operation Testing**\n\nService discovery systems must handle concurrent operations correctly since multiple services may register, deregister, or be looked up simultaneously while health checking runs continuously in the background. Integration tests must verify that these concurrent operations don't corrupt shared state or cause deadlocks.\n\nThe concurrent registration test launches multiple goroutines that simultaneously register different services and verifies that all registrations succeed, that no service data is lost or corrupted, and that health checking begins for all registered services. This test should also verify that the final registry state matches expectations regardless of the order in which registrations complete.\n\nThe concurrent lookup test registers multiple services, then launches multiple goroutines that simultaneously perform service lookups while background processes modify service health status. The test verifies that lookup results are always consistent—no partially updated service information is returned—and that lookup operations don't interfere with health status updates.\n\nThe registration-during-health-check test verifies that new service registrations work correctly even while health checking is actively running. This test should register an initial service, wait for health checking to begin, register additional services during active health checking, and verify that health checking coverage expands correctly to include the new services.\n\n| Integration Test Scenario | Components Involved | Success Criteria | Failure Modes Tested |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Complete Service Lifecycle | API + Registry + Health Checker | Registration → Health → Discovery → Deregistration | Network failures during registration |\n| Concurrent Service Operations | API + Registry | Multiple simultaneous operations complete correctly | Race conditions in shared state |\n| Health Status Transitions | Registry + Health Checker | Healthy → Unhealthy → Healthy transitions work | Health check timeouts and recovery |\n| API Error Handling | API + Registry + Health Checker | Proper error codes and messages | Invalid requests and system failures |\n| Configuration Changes | All Components | Runtime configuration updates apply correctly | Configuration conflicts and validation |\n\n**Network Failure Simulation**\n\nIntegration tests must verify behavior under realistic network conditions. The network partition test starts multiple mock services, allows them to become healthy, simulates network connectivity loss to some services while maintaining connectivity to others, verifies that affected services are marked unhealthy while unaffected services remain available, restores network connectivity, and confirms that previously affected services recover to healthy status.\n\nThe health check timeout test configures short health check timeouts, starts mock services that respond slowly, verifies that slow-responding services are marked unhealthy due to timeouts, improves mock service response times, and confirms that services recover when response times improve. This test validates that timeout handling works correctly and doesn't cause false positives.\n\nThe DNS resolution failure test registers services using hostnames rather than IP addresses, simulates DNS resolution failures for some hostnames, verifies that affected services are marked unhealthy due to DNS failures, restores DNS resolution, and confirms service recovery. This test is crucial since many real deployments use service names rather than IP addresses.\n\n**Load and Stress Testing**\n\nIntegration tests should verify system behavior under load conditions that might occur in production. The high registration volume test rapidly registers large numbers of services and verifies that all registrations succeed, that health checking scales appropriately to handle all registered services, that lookup performance remains acceptable, and that memory usage remains bounded.\n\nThe high lookup volume test registers a moderate number of services and then performs a high volume of concurrent lookup operations while health checking continues in the background. This test verifies that lookup operations remain fast and consistent, that health checking isn't disrupted by lookup volume, and that the system doesn't degrade under query load.\n\nThe configuration stress test repeatedly modifies configuration settings while the system is under moderate load, verifying that configuration changes are applied correctly, that existing operations continue to work during configuration updates, and that invalid configuration changes are rejected without affecting system operation.\n\n**Data Consistency Validation**\n\nIntegration tests must verify that data remains consistent across all system components even under failure conditions. The consistency test performs a complex sequence of operations: register multiple services, wait for health status to stabilize, force some services to fail health checks, perform lookup operations to verify consistency, restart failed services, wait for recovery, and perform final validation that all data matches expected state.\n\nThe recovery consistency test simulates system restart scenarios by stopping the registry service while maintaining mock services, restarting the registry, and verifying that the system recovers to a consistent state: previously registered services are restored from persistent state, health checking resumes correctly, and lookup operations return accurate results.\n\n### Milestone Validation Checkpoints\n\nEach project milestone requires specific validation checkpoints that verify the implementation meets acceptance criteria and functions correctly in realistic scenarios. These checkpoints serve as comprehensive integration tests that validate not just individual features but the complete milestone functionality working together.\n\n**Milestone 1: Service Registry Validation**\n\nThe Milestone 1 checkpoint validates the core service registry functionality through a comprehensive test scenario. The validation begins by starting the registry service and verifying that it accepts HTTP requests on the configured port. The test then registers multiple service instances with different configurations: services with different names, multiple instances of the same service, services with various tag combinations, and services with different health endpoint configurations.\n\nRegistration validation verifies that each service registration returns a unique instance ID, that the instance ID can be used for subsequent operations, that registered services appear in the complete service list, and that service metadata is stored and returned accurately. The test should also verify that registration timestamps are recorded correctly and that TTL expiration works as expected.\n\nLookup validation tests service discovery functionality by querying for services by name and verifying that all registered instances are returned with correct metadata. The test should verify lookup behavior for non-existent services (empty result set), lookup behavior for services with multiple instances (all instances returned), and lookup performance under various query patterns.\n\nDeregistration validation verifies that services can be removed from the registry using their instance IDs, that deregistered services no longer appear in lookup results, that deregistered services are removed from the complete service list, and that deregistration of one instance doesn't affect other instances of the same service.\n\n| Validation Check | Expected Behavior | Test Method | Success Criteria |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Service Registration | Unique ID returned, service discoverable | POST /services with valid data | HTTP 201, valid instance ID, service in lookup results |\n| Service Deregistration | Service removed from registry | DELETE /services/{name}/{id} | HTTP 200, service not in lookup results |\n| Service Lookup | All healthy instances returned | GET /services/{name} | HTTP 200, correct instance list |\n| Complete Service List | All services visible | GET /services | HTTP 200, comprehensive service list |\n| TTL Expiration | Expired services auto-removed | Wait beyond TTL period | Expired services absent from lookup |\n\n**Milestone 2: Health Checking Validation**\n\nThe Milestone 2 checkpoint builds on Milestone 1 by adding health checking functionality. The validation starts multiple mock services that implement health endpoints returning HTTP 200 for healthy status. The test registers these services with the registry and verifies that health checking begins automatically with configured intervals.\n\nHealth endpoint validation verifies that the health checker makes HTTP requests to the correct health endpoints, that successful health checks mark services as healthy, that healthy services appear in lookup results, and that health check timing follows configuration settings. The test should monitor actual HTTP requests to mock services to verify that health checking is working correctly.\n\nFailure detection validation tests the system's response to service failures by stopping mock services or configuring them to return error responses. The test verifies that consecutive health check failures increment the failure count, that services are marked unhealthy after reaching the failure threshold, that unhealthy services are excluded from lookup results, and that failure detection timing matches configuration.\n\nRecovery validation tests service recovery by restarting failed mock services and verifying that health checking detects the recovery, that failure counts reset after successful health checks, that services are marked healthy again, and that recovered services reappear in lookup results.\n\nConfiguration validation tests health checking behavior with different configuration settings: various health check intervals, different failure thresholds, and different health check timeout values. The test should verify that configuration changes take effect correctly and that health checking behavior matches the configured parameters.\n\n**Milestone 3: HTTP API Validation**\n\nThe Milestone 3 checkpoint validates the complete HTTP API functionality building on the registry core and health checking from previous milestones. The validation tests all API endpoints with various request types and verifies that the API correctly handles both success and error scenarios.\n\nAPI endpoint validation tests each endpoint with valid requests and verifies correct responses: POST /services successfully registers services and returns instance IDs, GET /services returns the complete list of services, GET /services/{name} returns instances for the specified service, DELETE /services/{name}/{id} successfully deregisters services, and GET /health returns system health status.\n\nRequest validation testing verifies that the API properly validates input data and returns appropriate error responses for invalid requests: malformed JSON in registration requests, missing required fields, invalid port numbers, malformed URLs, and unsupported HTTP methods. The test should verify that error responses include helpful diagnostic information and use correct HTTP status codes.\n\nResponse format validation verifies that all API responses use consistent JSON formatting, that success responses include expected data fields, that error responses follow a standard error format, and that HTTP status codes are used correctly throughout the API.\n\nContent negotiation validation tests that the API handles HTTP headers correctly: Content-Type verification for request bodies, Accept header handling for responses, and proper HTTP method handling for each endpoint.\n\n**Cross-Milestone Integration Validation**\n\nThe final validation checkpoint tests the complete system functionality with all milestones integrated together. This comprehensive test simulates realistic usage patterns that exercise service registration, health checking, and API operations simultaneously.\n\nThe multi-service scenario registers multiple services of different types, waits for all services to become healthy, performs service discovery operations to verify all services are discoverable, simulates failure of some services, verifies that failed services are detected and excluded from discovery, recovers failed services, and verifies complete system recovery.\n\nThe load testing scenario performs high-volume operations across all system components: rapid service registrations and deregistrations, high-frequency service lookups, concurrent API operations, and sustained operation under load. This test verifies that system performance remains acceptable under realistic load conditions.\n\nThe persistence and recovery scenario stops and restarts the registry service while maintaining external mock services, verifies that the system recovers correctly after restart, checks that service states are restored accurately, and confirms that health checking resumes correctly after recovery.\n\n| Milestone | Core Validation | Performance Check | Error Handling Check |\n|-----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Milestone 1 | Registration/lookup accuracy | Lookup latency under load | Invalid registration handling |\n| Milestone 2 | Health checking accuracy | Health check scalability | Network failure detection |\n| Milestone 3 | API completeness | API response times | Request validation and errors |\n| Integrated | End-to-end workflows | System-wide performance | Complete failure recovery |\n\n**Automated Validation Procedures**\n\nEach milestone checkpoint should be implementable as automated test suites that can be run repeatedly during development. The validation procedures should include setup scripts that start necessary mock services, configuration files that define test parameters, test execution scripts that run the validation scenarios, and cleanup procedures that restore the system to a clean state.\n\nThe validation automation should produce clear pass/fail results for each checkpoint, detailed logs of test execution for debugging failed validations, performance metrics that can be tracked over time, and summary reports that highlight any regressions or improvements.\n\nContinuous integration should run these validation checkpoints automatically on code changes, ensuring that new development doesn't break existing milestone functionality. The checkpoints should also be runnable locally by developers to validate their implementations before committing changes.\n\n> **Key Insight**: Milestone validation checkpoints serve as both acceptance criteria verification and regression test suites. They provide concrete evidence that each milestone's functionality works correctly and continues to work as the system evolves.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Debugging Test Failures**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis Steps | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Unit tests timeout | Infinite loop or deadlock | Add debug logging, check mutex usage | Fix locking logic, add timeouts |\n| Integration tests fail intermittently | Race conditions or timing issues | Run tests with `-race` flag | Add proper synchronization |\n| Mock services not responding | Port conflicts or server startup issues | Check server.URL() output, verify ports | Use httptest.NewServer for automatic ports |\n| Health checks never complete | Health checker not started or configured incorrectly | Verify health checker Start() called | Check background goroutine startup |\n| API tests return wrong status codes | Request formatting or handler errors | Log request/response bodies | Fix JSON marshaling or handler logic |\n\n\n## Debugging Guide\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section provides systematic approaches to diagnose and resolve issues across service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3).\n\n### Mental Model: The Detective Investigation\n\nThink of debugging a service discovery system like a detective investigating a crime scene. Just as a detective follows clues systematically - examining physical evidence, interviewing witnesses, establishing timelines, and testing theories - debugging requires a methodical approach to gather symptoms, trace root causes, and verify solutions.\n\nThe service discovery system leaves \"fingerprints\" everywhere: in logs, metrics, network traces, and registry state. Like a detective, you need to know where to look for these clues, how to interpret them, and how to piece together the story of what went wrong. Some problems are obvious \"smoking guns\" (server crashes, network failures), while others require careful investigation of subtle patterns (gradual memory leaks, race conditions, cascading failures).\n\n### Common Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nThe first step in debugging is recognizing symptoms and mapping them to likely root causes. Service discovery systems exhibit predictable failure patterns, and understanding these patterns helps you quickly narrow down the investigation scope.\n\nThe following diagnostic approach treats each symptom as a starting point for systematic investigation. Rather than randomly checking different components, this approach guides you through logical elimination of causes based on what you observe.\n\n#### Service Registration Issues\n\nService registration problems manifest in several distinct ways, each pointing to different underlying causes. The key is distinguishing between client-side issues (service can't register), server-side issues (registry can't process registrations), and infrastructure issues (network or resource problems).\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Expected Findings |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Services can't register (HTTP 500 errors) | Registry internal error, database corruption, or resource exhaustion | Check registry logs for panic/error messages, verify memory/disk usage, test registry internal state consistency | Error logs showing specific failure, high memory usage, or corrupted registry data structures |\n| Services register but disappear immediately | TTL too short, aggressive cleanup process, or immediate deregistration | Check `Config.TTL` and `Config.CleanupInterval` settings, examine cleanup logs for premature removals | TTL expiration logs shortly after registration, cleanup process removing recent entries |\n| Duplicate service registrations accepted | Missing instance identity validation or concurrent registration race condition | Test registering same service details multiple times, check for proper `InstanceID` generation and validation | Multiple `RegistryEntry` records with identical service details but different `InstanceID` values |\n| Registration requests timeout | Network issues, registry overload, or blocking operations in registration path | Check network connectivity, measure registration response times, examine registry performance metrics | High response times, network packet loss, or registry CPU/memory spikes during registration |\n| Services register with wrong metadata | Client-side configuration errors or API request construction issues | Compare actual registration requests (via logs/traces) with expected service configuration | Discrepancies between intended service configuration and actual `ServiceInstance` fields in registry |\n\n#### Service Discovery Issues\n\nService discovery problems typically involve clients unable to find services or receiving stale/incorrect service information. These issues often indicate problems with the lookup logic, health filtering, or data consistency.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Expected Findings |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Clients receive empty service lists | Health checker marking all instances unhealthy, incorrect service name filtering, or registry data loss | Check health status of registered instances, verify service name matching logic, confirm registry contains expected services | All instances showing unhealthy status, service name mismatches, or empty registry state |\n| Clients receive unhealthy service instances | Health filtering not working, stale health data, or health checker not running | Examine `HealthStatus` records for registered instances, verify health checker is active and updating status | Unhealthy instances not filtered from lookup results, outdated `LastCheck` timestamps |\n| Service lookup returns inconsistent results | Race conditions between health updates and lookups, or concurrent modification of registry state | Test concurrent lookup requests, examine locking mechanisms around registry access, check for data races | Different results from simultaneous lookup calls, missing synchronization in registry operations |\n| Service discovery extremely slow | Inefficient lookup algorithms, registry size issues, or blocking operations during lookup | Measure lookup response times across different registry sizes, profile lookup operations for performance bottlenecks | Lookup times increasing with registry size, blocking operations in lookup path |\n| Clients find services that don't exist | Stale registry data, failed deregistrations, or cleanup process not running | Check for orphaned registry entries, verify deregistration is working correctly, examine cleanup process status | Registry contains entries for services that are no longer running |\n\n#### Health Checking Issues\n\nHealth checking problems affect service availability detection and can cause healthy services to be marked as failed or failed services to remain in the registry. These issues require examining both the health checking logic and the services being checked.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Expected Findings |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Healthy services marked as unhealthy | Health check timeout too short, network latency issues, or service temporarily overloaded | Measure actual response times from health endpoints, compare with `HealthTimeout` configuration, check service load | Health endpoint response times exceeding timeout threshold, high service CPU/memory usage |\n| Unhealthy services not removed | Health checker not running, failure threshold too high, or health check interval too long | Verify health checker background process is active, examine `MaxFailures` and `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` settings | Health checker stopped/crashed, failure counts not reaching threshold, infrequent health checks |\n| Health checks failing with connection errors | Service health endpoints not responding, incorrect health endpoint URLs, or network connectivity issues | Test health endpoints manually (curl/wget), verify `HealthEndpoint` URLs in service registrations | Connection refused errors, invalid URLs, or network unreachability |\n| Health checking consuming too many resources | Health check interval too aggressive, too many concurrent checks, or inefficient health check implementation | Monitor health checker CPU/memory usage, examine check frequency and concurrency settings | High resource usage correlating with health check activity, excessive concurrent HTTP requests |\n| Health status not updating | Health checker database update failures, locking issues preventing status updates, or health checker crash/restart loop | Check health checker logs for update errors, examine registry locking mechanisms, verify health checker process stability | Database write errors, deadlocks in registry updates, frequent health checker restarts |\n\n#### HTTP API Issues\n\nAPI problems typically manifest as request failures, incorrect responses, or performance issues. These problems require examining both the HTTP layer implementation and the underlying registry/health checker integration.\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Expected Findings |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| API requests return HTTP 500 errors | Unhandled exceptions in request handlers, underlying registry errors, or resource exhaustion | Examine server error logs, check registry/health checker status, monitor server resource usage | Specific error messages in logs, registry operation failures, high server resource consumption |\n| API requests hang or timeout | Blocking operations in request handlers, database deadlocks, or insufficient server concurrency | Profile request handling performance, check for blocking operations, examine server concurrency settings | Long-running operations in request path, database lock waits, server thread pool exhaustion |\n| API returns malformed JSON responses | Serialization errors, null pointer dereferences in response construction, or data corruption | Test API responses for JSON validity, check response construction code for null handling | Invalid JSON syntax, missing fields in responses, or serialization exceptions |\n| API authentication/validation failures | Input validation logic errors, malformed request bodies, or missing required fields | Send test requests with various input combinations, examine request validation code | Validation rejecting valid requests or accepting invalid requests |\n| API performance degrades with load | Inefficient request handling, lack of caching, or resource contention under concurrent load | Load test API endpoints, profile performance under various request volumes | Response times increasing with concurrent requests, resource bottlenecks under load |\n\n### Debugging Techniques\n\nEffective debugging requires both reactive techniques (diagnosing problems when they occur) and proactive techniques (building observability into the system). The service discovery system has multiple layers where problems can occur, so debugging techniques must address each layer systematically.\n\n#### Registry State Inspection\n\nThe registry core maintains the authoritative state of all services and their health status. When debugging service discovery issues, examining registry state provides ground truth about what the system believes to be true.\n\n**Registry Snapshot Analysis**: Create diagnostic endpoints that expose complete registry state for inspection. This should include not just the service instances, but also metadata like registration timestamps, health check history, and internal counters.\n\n| Component | Inspection Method | Key Information | Warning Signs |\n|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| `ServiceRegistry.services` | Export complete registry map | Service count, instance distribution, registration age | Empty registry, uneven distribution, very old or very new timestamps |\n| `RegistryEntry` records | List all entries with full details | Instance metadata, health status, registration/update times | Missing health data, stale timestamps, inconsistent metadata |\n| Health status data | Export `HealthStatus` for all instances | Check results, failure counts, response times | High failure counts, very old `LastCheck` times, inconsistent status |\n| Internal metrics | Expose `RegistryStats` and counters | Registration/deregistration rates, cleanup activity | Unusual activity patterns, growing counters without corresponding business activity |\n\n**State Consistency Verification**: Implement validation functions that check registry state consistency. These should verify that all references are valid, timestamps are reasonable, and health data aligns with registration data.\n\n**Historical State Tracking**: Maintain a circular buffer of recent registry changes to help diagnose timing issues and understand the sequence of events leading to a problem.\n\n#### Health Check Tracing\n\nHealth checking involves complex interactions between the health checker, external services, and the registry. Tracing health check operations helps identify where the process breaks down.\n\n**Health Check Execution Tracing**: Log detailed information about each health check operation, including timing, network operations, and decision points.\n\n| Trace Point | Information to Capture | Purpose |\n|-------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Check initiation | Instance ID, scheduled time, check type | Verify checks are being scheduled and initiated correctly |\n| HTTP request | Request URL, headers, timeout settings | Confirm correct endpoints and request configuration |\n| HTTP response | Status code, response time, response body (truncated) | Diagnose service-side issues and response validation |\n| Health decision | Pass/fail decision, failure count updates, registry update actions | Understand how check results translate to health status |\n| Error conditions | Network errors, timeout details, retry logic execution | Identify infrastructure and transient failure patterns |\n\n**Health Check Timing Analysis**: Track timing patterns to identify scheduling issues, cascade failures, or resource contention in health checking.\n\n**Synthetic Health Checks**: Implement test health checks against known services to validate that the health checking mechanism itself is working correctly.\n\n#### Network and HTTP Debugging\n\nNetwork issues are common in distributed systems and can manifest as various service discovery problems. Network debugging techniques help isolate connectivity, performance, and protocol issues.\n\n**HTTP Request/Response Logging**: Implement detailed HTTP request and response logging for both incoming API requests and outgoing health check requests. This should include headers, timing information, and error details.\n\n**Connection Pool Monitoring**: Track HTTP connection pool status, including active connections, connection reuse rates, and connection errors.\n\n| Metric | Normal Range | Problem Indicators | Likely Causes |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Active connections | Steady, reasonable number | Rapidly growing, very high numbers | Connection leaks, services not closing connections |\n| Connection reuse rate | High percentage for repeated requests | Low reuse, frequent new connections | Connection pool configuration issues, network instability |\n| Connection errors | Low, occasional errors | Frequent connection refused/timeout errors | Network issues, service overload, firewall problems |\n| Response times | Consistent, within expected ranges | High variability, increasing trends | Network latency, service performance issues |\n\n**Network Connectivity Testing**: Implement diagnostic tools that test basic network connectivity to registered services independent of health checking.\n\n#### Concurrent Operation Analysis\n\nService discovery systems must handle multiple concurrent operations safely. Race conditions, deadlocks, and resource contention can cause subtle, intermittent problems.\n\n**Concurrency Pattern Detection**: Log concurrent operations with correlation IDs to identify patterns that lead to race conditions or resource contention.\n\n**Lock Contention Analysis**: Monitor locking patterns in the registry to identify bottlenecks where multiple operations compete for the same resources.\n\n**Resource Usage Patterns**: Track resource usage (memory, CPU, file descriptors) over time to identify leaks or resource exhaustion patterns.\n\n### Logging and Observability\n\nEffective logging and observability are essential for both debugging problems and preventing them. The service discovery system should provide comprehensive visibility into its operations while avoiding log spam that makes debugging harder.\n\n#### Structured Logging Strategy\n\nStructured logging uses consistent formats and fields that enable automated analysis and correlation of log events across system components.\n\n**Core Logging Fields**: Every log entry should include standard fields that enable correlation and filtering.\n\n| Field | Type | Purpose | Example Values |\n|-------|------|---------|---------------|\n| `timestamp` | ISO8601 | Precise event timing | `2024-01-15T14:30:25.123Z` |\n| `level` | String | Log severity | `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG` |\n| `component` | String | Source component | `registry-core`, `health-checker`, `http-api` |\n| `operation` | String | Operation being performed | `service-registration`, `health-check`, `service-lookup` |\n| `instance_id` | String | Service instance identifier | `svc-web-001-uuid` |\n| `service_name` | String | Service name being operated on | `user-service`, `payment-api` |\n| `request_id` | String | Request correlation ID | `req-12345-abcde` |\n| `client_addr` | String | Client IP address | `192.168.1.100:45678` |\n\n**Operation-Specific Logging**: Each major operation should log its lifecycle with sufficient detail for debugging.\n\n**Service Registration Logging**:\n- Registration initiation: Log complete `ServiceInstance` details being registered\n- Validation results: Log validation failures with specific field errors\n- Registration success: Log assigned `InstanceID` and next health check schedule\n- Registration failure: Log specific error reasons and any partial state created\n\n**Health Check Logging**:\n- Check scheduling: Log when checks are scheduled and their target times\n- Check execution: Log HTTP request details, response status, and timing\n- Status changes: Log when service health status transitions between healthy/unhealthy\n- Check failures: Log detailed error information including network errors and timeouts\n\n**Service Lookup Logging**:\n- Lookup requests: Log service name and any filtering criteria\n- Lookup results: Log number of total vs. healthy instances returned\n- Lookup performance: Log query execution time and cache hit/miss status\n- Lookup errors: Log specific errors in registry access or filtering logic\n\n#### Observability Metrics\n\nMetrics provide quantitative data about system behavior that complements qualitative log information. Service discovery metrics should cover both operational health and business functionality.\n\n**System Health Metrics**: Track overall system performance and resource usage.\n\n| Metric | Type | Description | Alert Thresholds |\n|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|\n| `registry_total_services` | Gauge | Number of distinct service names | Sudden drops (service outages) |\n| `registry_total_instances` | Gauge | Number of registered service instances | Large changes (mass failures/deployments) |\n| `registry_healthy_instances` | Gauge | Number of instances passing health checks | Drop below critical service levels |\n| `health_check_duration_seconds` | Histogram | Time to complete health check cycles | P99 > health check interval |\n| `api_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | HTTP API request processing time | P95 > acceptable response time |\n| `registry_memory_usage_bytes` | Gauge | Memory consumed by registry data | Approaching system memory limits |\n\n**Business Logic Metrics**: Track metrics that reflect the core functionality and user experience.\n\n| Metric | Type | Description | Business Impact |\n|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|\n| `service_registrations_total` | Counter | Total service registrations processed | Service deployment activity |\n| `service_deregistrations_total` | Counter | Total service deregistrations processed | Service shutdown activity |\n| `health_checks_total` | Counter | Total health checks performed | Health monitoring coverage |\n| `failed_health_checks_total` | Counter | Health checks that failed | Service reliability issues |\n| `service_lookup_requests_total` | Counter | Service discovery requests | Service discovery usage |\n| `service_lookup_empty_responses_total` | Counter | Lookups returning no healthy instances | Service availability problems |\n\n#### Distributed Tracing Integration\n\nWhen service discovery is part of a larger microservice ecosystem, distributed tracing helps understand how service discovery operations affect overall request flows.\n\n**Trace Span Creation**: Create trace spans for major service discovery operations that can be correlated with application request traces.\n\n**Registry Operation Spans**: Each registry operation (register, deregister, lookup) should create a trace span with relevant attributes like service name, instance count, and operation result.\n\n**Health Check Spans**: Health check operations should create spans that show the relationship between health checking activity and service availability in application traces.\n\n**Cross-Service Correlation**: Include trace context in health check requests so that health check failures can be correlated with application request failures.\n\n#### Log Aggregation and Analysis\n\nEffective debugging requires the ability to search, filter, and correlate log events across the entire system.\n\n**Log Correlation Patterns**: Design logging to support common debugging queries.\n\n| Debugging Question | Required Log Correlation | Search Strategy |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| \"What happened to service X?\" | All operations affecting a specific service name | Filter by `service_name` field across all components |\n| \"Why did this registration fail?\" | Registration attempt through completion/failure | Follow `request_id` through registration pipeline |\n| \"When did this service become unhealthy?\" | Health check history for specific instance | Filter by `instance_id` in health checker logs |\n| \"What's causing API slowdowns?\" | API request timing and concurrent operations | Correlate `api_request_duration` with `operation` and timestamp |\n| \"Why are services disappearing?\" | Deregistration and cleanup activity | Search for deregistration events and cleanup operations |\n\n**Alerting Integration**: Configure alerts based on log patterns that indicate serious problems requiring immediate attention.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Structured Logging | Standard library with JSON formatting (`encoding/json`) | Structured logging library (logrus, zap) |\n| Metrics Collection | Simple counters with periodic export | Prometheus metrics with automatic scraping |\n| Health Tracing | Basic logging with timing information | OpenTelemetry tracing with span creation |\n| Log Aggregation | File-based logs with log rotation | Centralized logging (ELK stack, Loki) |\n| Debugging Interface | HTTP endpoints exposing internal state | Admin dashboard with real-time data |\n\n#### Debugging Infrastructure\n\n**Registry State Inspection Utilities**:\n\n```go\npackage debug\n\nimport (\n

Verification\n\nAfter implementing debugging infrastructure:\n\n**Verify Registry State Inspection**:\n1. Start the service registry with debug endpoints enabled\n2. Register several test services using the HTTP API\n3. Access `GET /debug/registry` - should return complete registry state as JSON\n4. Verify all registered services appear with correct metadata\n5. Register an unhealthy service - verify it appears in debug output with health status\n\n**Verify Health Check Tracing**:\n1. Register services with valid and invalid health endpoints\n2. Wait for health check cycles to complete\n3. Check logs for structured health check trace entries\n4. Verify health transitions are logged when services become unhealthy\n5. Confirm health check timing and error details are captured\n\n**Verify Structured Logging**:\n1. Perform various operations (register, lookup, deregister services)\n2. Verify all operations produce structured JSON log entries\n3. Confirm log entries include correlation fields (request_id, instance_id)\n4. Test log filtering by component and operation type\n5. Verify error conditions produce appropriate error-level log entries\n\nSigns that debugging infrastructure is working correctly:\n- Debug endpoints return comprehensive, accurate system state\n- All major operations produce structured log entries with correlation IDs\n- Health check failures include detailed error information and timing\n- Log entries can be easily filtered and searched by service, operation, or time range\n- System metrics show accurate counts of services, instances, and operations\n\n\n## Future Extensions\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This section outlines potential enhancements that build upon the service registry foundation (Milestone 1), health checking capabilities (Milestone 2), and HTTP API (Milestone 3).\n\n### Mental Model: The Growing City\n\nThink of your service registry as a small town that's experiencing rapid growth. Right now, you have the basic infrastructure: a town hall (registry core) where residents register, a security patrol (health checker) that checks on everyone, and an information desk (HTTP API) that helps people find what they need. As the town grows into a city, you'll need additional infrastructure: multiple town halls working together (clustering), security systems (authentication and authorization), traffic management (load balancing), and specialized services (advanced health checks).\n\nJust as a city planner designs infrastructure that can be added incrementally without rebuilding the entire town, your current service registry architecture provides extension points that accommodate these enhancements without requiring fundamental rewrites. Each future extension represents a new city department that integrates with your existing infrastructure while adding specialized capabilities.\n\nThe current design's modularity means these extensions can be added incrementally - you might start with simple authentication, then add clustering support, and later introduce advanced health checking protocols. Each enhancement builds upon the solid foundation you've established while extending the system's capabilities to handle larger scale and more sophisticated requirements.\n\n### Registry Clustering and High Availability\n\nThe most significant limitation of the current single-node design is that it represents a single point of failure. In production environments, service discovery systems must remain available even when individual nodes fail, network partitions occur, or maintenance activities require taking nodes offline.\n\nA clustered registry extension would distribute service registration data across multiple nodes, providing both high availability and horizontal scalability. This extension builds naturally on the current `ServiceRegistry` design by adding a clustering layer that manages data replication and consensus decisions across multiple registry instances.\n\n**Registry Cluster Architecture**\n\nThe clustering extension introduces several new components that integrate with your existing registry core. A `ClusterManager` component would coordinate communication between registry nodes, while a `ConsensusEngine` ensures all nodes agree on service registration changes. The existing `ServiceRegistry` becomes a cluster member that participates in distributed decision-making while maintaining its current interface for local operations.\n\nData consistency across cluster nodes requires implementing a consensus protocol like Raft or using distributed key-value stores like etcd or Consul as the backing storage. This extension point exists because your current registry design already abstracts service data through clear interfaces - adding clustering means implementing a new storage backend that happens to be distributed rather than local.\n\nThe clustering extension would introduce these additional data structures:\n\n| Structure Name | Fields | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `ClusterNode` | NodeID string, Address string, Role string, Status string, LastSeen time.Time | Represents a registry node in the cluster |\n| `ClusterConfig` | Nodes []ClusterNode, ReplicationFactor int, ConsensusTimeout time.Duration | Configuration for cluster behavior |\n| `ReplicationEntry` | Operation string, Data interface{}, Timestamp time.Time, NodeID string | Represents a change to replicate across nodes |\n| `ConsensusResult` | Success bool, LeaderID string, Term int64, CommittedIndex int64 | Result of consensus operation |\n\n**Cluster Operations and Consensus**\n\nService registration in a clustered environment requires consensus among nodes to ensure all cluster members have consistent views of available services. When a service registers with any cluster node, that node proposes the registration to other cluster members through the consensus protocol.\n\nThe consensus process follows these steps:\n\n1. A client sends a service registration request to any cluster node\n2. The receiving node validates the registration request locally\n3. The node proposes the registration operation to the cluster leader\n4. The leader replicates the operation to a majority of follower nodes\n5. Once a majority confirms the operation, the leader commits it\n6. All nodes apply the committed registration to their local registries\n7. The original node responds to the client with success\n\nThis approach ensures that service registrations are consistent across the cluster even if individual nodes fail during the registration process. The existing `Register` method signature remains unchanged - clustering becomes an internal implementation detail that doesn't affect the public API.\n\n**Partition Tolerance and Split-Brain Prevention**\n\nNetwork partitions represent one of the most challenging aspects of distributed systems. When cluster nodes cannot communicate with each other, they must decide whether to continue accepting registrations (risking inconsistency) or reject them (sacrificing availability).\n\nThe clustering extension would implement partition tolerance through quorum-based decision making. A cluster partition can continue operating only if it contains a majority of nodes, preventing split-brain scenarios where multiple partitions each believe they're authoritative.\n\nDuring a network partition, the minority partition would enter read-only mode, allowing service lookups but rejecting new registrations. This design choice prioritizes consistency over availability during partition events, which aligns with service discovery requirements where returning stale data is generally acceptable, but accepting inconsistent registrations causes serious problems.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Service discovery systems typically favor consistency over availability during network partitions because returning slightly stale service information is much less problematic than having different parts of your infrastructure believe different services are available.\n\n**Health Checking in Clustered Environments**\n\nClustering introduces complexity to health checking because multiple nodes might attempt to health check the same service instances. The extension would implement distributed health checking coordination to avoid overwhelming services with redundant health checks while ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n\nA `DistributedHealthChecker` component would extend the existing `HealthChecker` by adding coordination logic that divides health checking responsibilities among cluster nodes. This could be implemented through consistent hashing, where each service instance is assigned to specific cluster nodes for health checking, or through leader-based coordination where a single node schedules all health checks but distributes the actual checking work.\n\n### Security and Authentication\n\nThe current HTTP API accepts all requests without authentication or authorization, which is acceptable for development environments but inadequate for production deployments. A security extension would add multiple layers of protection while maintaining the existing API structure.\n\n**Service Authentication and Authorization**\n\nThe security extension introduces authentication for both service registration and service lookup operations. Services registering themselves would need to prove their identity, while clients looking up services would need appropriate permissions to access service information.\n\nThe extension would add these security-related data structures:\n\n| Structure Name | Fields | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `ServiceIdentity` | ServiceName string, Credentials string, Permissions []string, ExpiresAt time.Time | Authentication information for a service |\n| `AccessToken` | TokenID string, ServiceID string, Permissions []string, IssuedAt time.Time, ExpiresAt time.Time | Bearer token for API access |\n| `SecurityPolicy` | AllowedServices []string, RequiredPermissions map[string][]string, TokenTTL time.Duration | Security configuration |\n| `AuditLogEntry` | Timestamp time.Time, ServiceID string, Operation string, Resource string, Success bool, ClientIP string | Security audit trail |\n\nAuthentication could be implemented through multiple mechanisms: API keys for simple deployments, mutual TLS for high-security environments, or integration with external identity providers like OAuth 2.0 or service mesh identity systems.\n\nThe security extension would modify existing HTTP API endpoints to require authentication headers and validate permissions before processing requests. Service registration would require \"register\" permission for the specific service name, while service lookup might require \"discover\" permission for the target service.\n\n**Mutual TLS and Certificate Management**\n\nFor high-security environments, the extension would support mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both the registry and connecting services verify each other's certificates. This provides strong cryptographic identity verification and encrypted communication channels.\n\nThe mTLS extension would add certificate management capabilities to automatically issue, renew, and revoke certificates for registered services. This could integrate with certificate authorities like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider certificate services to provide a complete PKI solution.\n\n**Audit Logging and Compliance**\n\nSecurity extensions require comprehensive audit logging to track who accessed what services when. The extension would maintain detailed audit trails of all registry operations, including failed authentication attempts, successful service lookups, and administrative operations.\n\nAudit logs would capture sufficient information for compliance requirements and security incident investigation while being structured for automated analysis and alerting on suspicious patterns.\n\n### Advanced Health Checking Protocols\n\nThe current health checking implementation supports only HTTP endpoints with basic success/failure detection. Production environments often require more sophisticated health checking that can integrate with various protocols and provide nuanced health status information.\n\n**Multi-Protocol Health Checking**\n\nThe advanced health checking extension would support multiple protocols beyond HTTP, including TCP socket checks, gRPC health checking protocol, database connection verification, and custom script-based checks.\n\nEach protocol would implement a common `HealthCheckProtocol` interface while providing protocol-specific configuration options:\n\n| Protocol Type | Configuration Fields | Use Cases |\n|---|---|---|\n| HTTP | Path string, Headers map[string]string, ExpectedStatus []int, Timeout time.Duration | REST APIs, web services |\n| TCP | Port int, Timeout time.Duration | Database connections, message queues |\n| gRPC | ServiceName string, Timeout time.Duration | gRPC microservices |\n| Script | Command string, Args []string, Timeout time.Duration, Environment map[string]string | Custom application logic |\n\nThe extension would maintain the existing `HealthChecker` interface while adding protocol-specific implementations that can be configured per service instance. A service might use HTTP health checks for its API endpoint while also performing TCP checks on its database connection.\n\n**Composite Health Status**\n\nAdvanced health checking introduces the concept of composite health status where a service instance reports multiple health dimensions. Instead of simple healthy/unhealthy status, services could report separate status for different subsystems.\n\nFor example, a web service might report:\n- API endpoint: healthy\n- Database connection: degraded\n- Cache connection: unhealthy\n- Disk space: healthy\n\nThe composite status extension would allow services to continue receiving traffic for operations that don't require unhealthy subsystems while being removed from routing for operations that do require them.\n\n**Adaptive Health Checking**\n\nInstead of fixed check intervals, adaptive health checking adjusts check frequency based on service behavior patterns. Services that consistently pass health checks are checked less frequently, while services showing instability receive more frequent monitoring.\n\nThe adaptive extension would implement algorithms that:\n1. Increase check frequency when services show signs of instability\n2. Reduce check frequency for consistently healthy services\n3. Implement exponential backoff for services that are clearly failed\n4. Provide burst checking during recovery periods\n\nThis approach reduces system overhead while providing faster detection of service issues when they occur.\n\n**Health Check Circuit Breakers**\n\nWhen services become overloaded, aggressive health checking can make the situation worse by adding additional load. The circuit breaker extension would automatically reduce health check frequency or temporarily disable checks for services showing signs of overload.\n\nThe circuit breaker monitors health check response times and error rates, opening the circuit when thresholds are exceeded. During circuit-open periods, the registry assumes the service is unhealthy without performing actual checks, allowing the service to recover from overload conditions.\n\n### Load Balancing and Traffic Management\n\nThe current registry returns all healthy service instances without providing guidance on how clients should distribute traffic among them. A traffic management extension would add intelligent load balancing recommendations and traffic steering capabilities.\n\n**Weighted Load Balancing**\n\nServices instances often have different capacities - some might run on larger machines or have better network connectivity. The load balancing extension would allow services to register with weight information that influences traffic distribution.\n\nThe extension would add weight-aware service lookup that returns instances along with recommended traffic distribution ratios. Clients could use this information to implement weighted random selection or other load balancing algorithms that respect instance capacities.\n\n**Geographic and Zone-Aware Routing**\n\nIn distributed deployments, services should prefer communicating with nearby instances to reduce latency and improve reliability. The geographic extension would add location awareness to service registration and intelligent proximity-based routing.\n\nServices would register with zone, region, and availability zone information. Client lookups could specify their own location and receive service instances sorted by proximity, with fallback to remote instances if local ones are unavailable.\n\n**Traffic Splitting and Canary Deployments**\n\nThe traffic management extension would support sophisticated deployment patterns like canary releases and A/B testing by allowing services to register with version information and traffic splitting rules.\n\nA service deployment might register both v1.0 and v1.1 instances, with routing rules that direct 90% of traffic to v1.0 and 10% to v1.1. The registry would return instances according to these ratios, enabling gradual rollouts with automatic traffic distribution.\n\n### Service Mesh Integration\n\nModern microservice deployments increasingly use service mesh technologies like Istio, Linkerd, or Consul Connect. A service mesh integration extension would allow your registry to interoperate with these systems while providing additional service discovery capabilities.\n\n**Sidecar Proxy Integration**\n\nService mesh deployments typically include sidecar proxies that handle service-to-service communication. The integration extension would support registering services through their sidecar proxies and coordinating with the service mesh control plane for traffic routing decisions.\n\nThe extension would add support for service mesh protocols like Envoy's xDS (discovery service) protocol, allowing the registry to act as a data source for service mesh control planes. This enables hybrid deployments where some services use direct registry integration while others integrate through service mesh infrastructure.\n\n**Policy Integration and Enforcement**\n\nService meshes provide sophisticated traffic policies for security, reliability, and observability. The integration extension would respect service mesh policies when returning service discovery information, ensuring that registry responses align with mesh-level traffic management rules.\n\nFor example, if the service mesh has configured circuit breakers or rate limits for specific service pairs, the registry integration would reflect this in service discovery responses, potentially filtering out instances that would violate mesh policies.\n\n### Observability and Metrics\n\nProduction service discovery systems require comprehensive observability for monitoring, alerting, and capacity planning. The observability extension would add detailed metrics, distributed tracing, and operational dashboards.\n\n**Metrics and Monitoring**\n\nThe extension would expose detailed metrics about registry operations, health check performance, and service topology changes. These metrics would integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus, providing insights into:\n\n- Service registration and deregistration rates\n- Health check success rates and response times\n- API request patterns and error rates\n- Registry resource utilization and performance\n\nThe metrics would enable operational teams to understand registry behavior, detect performance issues, and plan capacity requirements for growing service deployments.\n\n**Distributed Tracing**\n\nFor complex service interactions, distributed tracing provides insights into how service discovery operations contribute to overall request latency. The tracing extension would add trace spans for registry operations, allowing correlation with application traces.\n\nThis enables debugging scenarios where application performance issues might be related to service discovery latency, health check delays, or registry overload conditions.\n\n### Configuration Management and Dynamic Updates\n\nThe current system uses static configuration loaded at startup. A dynamic configuration extension would allow runtime updates to registry behavior without requiring restarts, enabling operational flexibility and rapid response to changing conditions.\n\n**Hot Configuration Updates**\n\nThe extension would support updating health check intervals, timeout values, cleanup frequencies, and other operational parameters without service interruption. This capability is essential for production systems where configuration changes might be needed to respond to traffic patterns or performance issues.\n\nConfiguration updates would be validated before application and provide rollback capabilities if updates cause problems. The system would maintain configuration history and support gradual rollout of configuration changes across clustered deployments.\n\n**Service-Specific Configuration**\n\nDifferent services often have different requirements for health checking frequency, timeout values, and failure thresholds. The extension would support service-specific configuration overrides that allow fine-tuning registry behavior for individual services or service categories.\n\nFor example, critical services might have more aggressive health checking, while batch processing services might use longer timeouts and higher failure thresholds before being marked unhealthy.\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\nThese extensions can be implemented incrementally, with each building upon the current architecture foundation. The recommended implementation order considers dependencies and operational value:\n\n**Phase 1: Security and Observability**\n- Basic authentication and authorization\n- Comprehensive metrics and monitoring\n- Audit logging capabilities\n\n**Phase 2: Advanced Health Checking**\n- Multi-protocol health checking\n- Adaptive check intervals\n- Composite health status\n\n**Phase 3: High Availability**\n- Registry clustering\n- Distributed health checking\n- Partition tolerance\n\n**Phase 4: Traffic Management**\n- Load balancing recommendations\n- Geographic routing\n- Service mesh integration\n\nEach phase provides immediate operational value while preparing the foundation for subsequent enhancements. The modular architecture ensures that extensions can be developed and deployed independently without disrupting existing functionality.\n\n### Architecture Compatibility\n\nThe current design's emphasis on clear interfaces and component separation makes it particularly well-suited for these extensions. The `ServiceRegistry` interface can accommodate clustered implementations, the `HealthChecker` component can support multiple protocols, and the HTTP API layer can add authentication middleware without changing core logic.\n\nMost importantly, the extension points preserve backward compatibility, allowing existing clients to continue working while new clients take advantage of enhanced capabilities. This approach supports gradual migration and mixed-environment deployments where some services use basic features while others require advanced functionality.\n\nThe modular design also supports partial deployment of extensions - an organization might implement security features immediately while deferring clustering until scale requirements justify the additional complexity. Each extension stands alone while integrating seamlessly with the core system and other extensions.\n\n\n## Glossary\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-3) - This glossary provides definitions for terminology used across service registration (Milestone 1), health checking (Milestone 2), and HTTP API operations (Milestone 3).\n\n### Mental Model: The Reference Manual\n\nThink of this glossary as a reference manual for a complex piece of machinery. When you're working with an industrial system like a manufacturing robot, you need a comprehensive manual that defines every component, every operation, and every technical term. The manual doesn't just list parts—it explains how they work, why they're designed that way, and how they interact with other components. Similarly, this glossary serves as your reference manual for the service discovery system, providing not just definitions but context for how each concept fits into the larger architecture.\n\n###

concepts (e.g., `type InstanceID string`) to enforce terminology in code\n- Use struct tags to ensure JSON serialization uses glossary-defined field names\n- Implement `String()` methods that use proper terminology in debug output\n\n**Terminology Validation:**\n- Run terminology consistency checks as part of CI/CD pipelines\n- Use linters to enforce preferred terms over aliases in code comments\n- Generate glossary updates automatically from code documentation\n- Validate API documentation against glossary definitions\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**After completing the glossary:**\n- All project documentation uses consistent terminology\n- Code comments reference glossary terms appropriately  \n- API documentation includes links to relevant definitions\n- Team members understand domain-specific vocabulary\n\n**Validation Commands:**\n```bash\n# Check terminology consistency in documentation\ngo run ./cmd/glossary-check ./docs/\n\n# Generate API documentation with glossary links  \ngo run ./cmd/doc-generator -output ./docs/api-reference.md\n\n# Validate code comments against glossary\ngo run ./cmd/terminology-lint ./internal/...\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n- Documentation uses preferred terms consistently (not aliases)\n- Technical discussions reference common vocabulary\n- New team members can quickly understand domain concepts\n- API responses use standardized field names and error messages\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Issue | Likely Cause | Diagnosis | Fix |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|-----|\n| Inconsistent terminology in logs | Multiple developers using different terms | Grep logs for term variations | Standardize logging messages, use glossary terms |\n| Confusing API responses | Field names don't match documentation | Compare JSON output to glossary | Update response serialization to use standard terms |\n| Documentation conflicts | Glossary out of sync with implementation | Cross-reference docs with code | Update glossary, regenerate documentation |\n| Team communication issues | Different understanding of concepts | Review meeting transcripts for term usage | Conduct glossary review session, align on definitions |\n"}
