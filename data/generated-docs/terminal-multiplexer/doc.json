Dozens of callers want to make phone calls simultaneously, but there&#39;s only one operator sitting at the central console. The operator&#39;s job is to connect each caller to their desired destination, manage multiple conversations at once, and switch between them seamlessly. When Caller A wants to talk, the operator plugs their line into the main console. When Caller B needs attention, the operator switches the connection. From each caller&#39;s perspective, they have the operator&#39;s full attention, even though the operator is actually juggling many conversations.</p>\n<p>A <strong>terminal multiplexer</strong> works exactly like this switchboard operator, but instead of routing phone calls, it routes terminal input and output between multiple shell sessions. You have one physical terminal (your keyboard and screen), but you want to run multiple shell sessions - perhaps editing code in one, running tests in another, monitoring logs in a third, and debugging in a fourth. The multiplexer sits between your physical terminal and these multiple shell processes, creating the illusion that each shell has its own dedicated terminal.</p>\n<p>When you type commands, the multiplexer routes your keystrokes to whichever shell session currently has &quot;focus&quot; - just like the operator connecting your voice to the right phone line. When shells produce output (listing files, showing error messages, displaying program results), the multiplexer captures that output and displays it on your screen, switching between different sessions as you request. Each shell process believes it has a real terminal attached, complete with the ability to move the cursor, change colors, and clear the screen, but it&#39;s actually communicating with a &quot;fake&quot; terminal that the multiplexer creates and manages.</p>\n<p>The technical term for these fake terminals is <strong>pseudo-terminals</strong> or <strong>PTYs</strong>. Think of a PTY as a telephone extension - it looks and behaves exactly like a real phone from the caller&#39;s perspective, but it&#39;s actually connected to the central switchboard system. The multiplexer creates one PTY for each shell session, managing the illusion that each has its own dedicated terminal hardware.</p>\n<p>Just as the switchboard operator needs to understand telephone protocols (how to establish connections, handle busy signals, manage conference calls), the multiplexer needs to understand terminal protocols - the special codes that programs send to control cursor position, change text colors, clear the screen, and handle window resizing. This is where <strong>terminal emulation</strong> comes in: the multiplexer must speak the same language as both the physical terminal and the shell processes.</p>\n<p>The switchboard analogy extends to window management as well. Imagine the operator has a large control panel that can be divided into sections, with each section showing the status of different phone conversations simultaneously. Similarly, a terminal multiplexer can split your screen into multiple <strong>panes</strong>, each showing a different shell session. You can see multiple conversations at once, resize the sections to give more space to important ones, and switch focus between them with keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<p>This mental model helps explain why building a terminal multiplexer is technically challenging: you&#39;re essentially building a sophisticated communications system that must maintain the illusion of multiple dedicated terminals while actually sharing a single physical terminal. Every keystroke, escape sequence, and terminal capability must be correctly routed and translated between the different abstraction layers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existing-approaches-comparison\">Existing Approaches Comparison</h3>\n<p>The terminal multiplexing space has several mature solutions, each representing different architectural approaches and feature sets. Understanding their design decisions helps illuminate the core challenges and trade-offs in this problem domain.</p>\n<p><strong>GNU Screen</strong> represents the original approach to terminal multiplexing, developed in 1987 when terminal hardware was expensive and remote connections were unreliable. Screen&#39;s primary innovation was <strong>session persistence</strong> - the ability to detach from a terminal session and reattach later, potentially from a different machine. This was revolutionary for users connecting over slow dial-up or unreliable network connections.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>GNU Screen Approach</th>\n<th>Strengths</th>\n<th>Limitations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Architecture</td>\n<td>Single-process session manager</td>\n<td>Simple, stable, well-tested</td>\n<td>Limited window management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Model</td>\n<td>Linear window list (Ctrl-a n/p)</td>\n<td>Easy to understand and navigate</td>\n<td>No panes or splits within windows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Emulation</td>\n<td>Basic ANSI/VT100 support</td>\n<td>Compatible with most applications</td>\n<td>Limited color and Unicode support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>Simple RC file format</td>\n<td>Easy to configure</td>\n<td>Limited customization options</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Management</td>\n<td>Strong detach/reattach support</td>\n<td>Survives network disconnections</td>\n<td>Sessions tied to single user</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Usage</td>\n<td>Low memory footprint</td>\n<td>Runs on minimal hardware</td>\n<td>Single-threaded performance limits</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Screen&#39;s architecture is fundamentally a <strong>session container</strong> - it creates a persistent environment that outlives individual terminal connections. When you run Screen, it forks into a daemon process that manages all the PTYs and shell processes. Your terminal connects to this daemon as a client. If the connection breaks, the daemon continues running, keeping all your shells alive. This design priority explains why Screen has limited window management features - it was built for persistence first, convenience second.</p>\n<p><strong>tmux</strong> (Terminal Multiplexer) emerged in 2007 as a modern reimplementation of Screen&#39;s concepts with a focus on <strong>advanced window management</strong> and a cleaner architecture. tmux&#39;s key innovation was treating terminal multiplexing as primarily a layout and presentation problem rather than just a session persistence problem.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>tmux Approach</th>\n<th>Strengths</th>\n<th>Limitations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Architecture</td>\n<td>Client-server with multiple sessions</td>\n<td>Clean separation, multiple clients</td>\n<td>More complex setup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Model</td>\n<td>Sessions → Windows → Panes hierarchy</td>\n<td>Very flexible layouts</td>\n<td>Steeper learning curve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Emulation</td>\n<td>Modern terminal support (256 colors, UTF-8)</td>\n<td>Excellent compatibility</td>\n<td>Higher resource usage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>Rich scripting and customization</td>\n<td>Extremely configurable</td>\n<td>Configuration complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Management</td>\n<td>Multiple named sessions</td>\n<td>Better organization</td>\n<td>Overkill for simple use cases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Layout Engine</td>\n<td>Dynamic pane splitting and resizing</td>\n<td>Professional workspace feel</td>\n<td>Can be overwhelming</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>tmux&#39;s architecture centers around a <strong>three-level hierarchy</strong>: sessions contain windows, windows contain panes. This allows for much more sophisticated organization - you might have a &quot;development&quot; session with windows for &quot;editing&quot;, &quot;testing&quot;, and &quot;debugging&quot;, where each window has multiple panes showing different tools. The tmux server can host multiple sessions simultaneously, and multiple clients can connect to different sessions or even the same session from different terminals.</p>\n<p>The layout engine in tmux is particularly sophisticated. Instead of Screen&#39;s simple linear window switching, tmux implements a <strong>tree-based layout algorithm</strong> where panes can be split recursively in both horizontal and vertical directions. Each pane maintains its own PTY and screen buffer, but they share screen real estate dynamically. When you resize the terminal, tmux recalculates the entire layout tree and adjusts all panes proportionally.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal Multiplexer in IDE Context</strong> represents a third approach seen in modern development environments. Tools like VS Code&#39;s integrated terminal, iTerm2&#39;s tmux integration, and terminal emulators with built-in multiplexing take a <strong>native integration</strong> approach rather than running as separate processes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>IDE Integration Approach</th>\n<th>Strengths</th>\n<th>Limitations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Architecture</td>\n<td>Embedded in larger application</td>\n<td>Seamless user experience</td>\n<td>Tied to specific environment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Model</td>\n<td>Tabs and splits native to UI</td>\n<td>Familiar interface patterns</td>\n<td>Less keyboard-driven</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Emulation</td>\n<td>Full terminal emulator built-in</td>\n<td>Perfect rendering compatibility</td>\n<td>High development complexity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>GUI preferences integration</td>\n<td>User-friendly setup</td>\n<td>Less scriptable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Management</td>\n<td>Application lifecycle tied</td>\n<td>Simple mental model</td>\n<td>No detach/reattach capability</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>Native code integration</td>\n<td>Fast rendering and input</td>\n<td>Memory usage of full application</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This approach treats terminal multiplexing as a <strong>user interface problem</strong> rather than a systems programming problem. Instead of creating PTYs and managing processes directly, these solutions embed full terminal emulators within larger graphical applications. The benefit is seamless integration with other development tools, but the cost is loss of the lightweight, universal nature of traditional multiplexers.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Alternatives</strong> like Zellij, Wezterm, and other recent multiplexers represent a fourth wave focused on <strong>user experience modernization</strong> while maintaining the core architectural patterns established by tmux.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature Category</th>\n<th>Screen (1987)</th>\n<th>tmux (2007)</th>\n<th>Modern Tools (2020+)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Session Persistence</td>\n<td>✓ Strong</td>\n<td>✓ Strong</td>\n<td>✓ Strong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pane Management</td>\n<td>✗ Windows only</td>\n<td>✓ Hierarchical</td>\n<td>✓ Advanced layouts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Visual Polish</td>\n<td>✗ Basic</td>\n<td>~ Good</td>\n<td>✓ Excellent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>~ Simple</td>\n<td>~ Powerful but complex</td>\n<td>✓ User-friendly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Plugin Ecosystem</td>\n<td>✗ Limited</td>\n<td>✓ Rich</td>\n<td>✓ Growing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Learning Curve</td>\n<td>✓ Gentle</td>\n<td>✗ Steep</td>\n<td>~ Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Usage</td>\n<td>✓ Minimal</td>\n<td>~ Moderate</td>\n<td>~ Higher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maturity</td>\n<td>✓ Battle-tested</td>\n<td>✓ Mature</td>\n<td>✗ Newer, less proven</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Architectural Insight</strong>: The evolution from Screen to tmux to modern multiplexers reflects a fundamental tension between <strong>simplicity and capability</strong>. Screen prioritized reliability and minimal resource usage. tmux prioritized flexibility and power. Modern tools prioritize user experience and discoverability. Each represents valid engineering trade-offs for different use cases and user populations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Core Technical Challenges Across All Approaches</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of architectural approach, all terminal multiplexers must solve the same fundamental technical challenges:</p>\n<p><strong>PTY Management Complexity</strong>: Every multiplexer must create and manage pseudo-terminal pairs, which involves intricate systems programming. The PTY subsystem has many subtle requirements around process groups, session leadership, controlling terminals, and signal handling. A single mistake in PTY setup can cause shells to behave incorrectly or not start at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal Protocol Compatibility</strong>: Modern terminal applications use hundreds of different escape sequences for cursor control, color management, window manipulation, and feature negotiation. The multiplexer must parse these sequences accurately and either handle them directly (for screen management commands) or pass them through to the underlying terminal (for display commands). Incorrect parsing leads to garbled output or broken application behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Input/Output Performance</strong>: A multiplexer sits in the critical path between user input and program output. Any latency introduced by the multiplexer directly impacts the user experience. High-performance applications like text editors, games, or real-time monitoring tools are particularly sensitive to input lag or output buffering delays.</p>\n<p><strong>Layout and Rendering Coordination</strong>: When managing multiple panes, the multiplexer must solve complex geometric problems: how to divide available screen space, handle terminal resizing, manage scrolling and scrollback buffers, and composite multiple data streams into a single output stream without visual artifacts.</p>\n<p><strong>Process Lifecycle Management</strong>: Each shell session represents a separate process tree that must be properly managed. This includes handling process creation, signal forwarding, exit status collection, and cleanup of resources when processes terminate. The multiplexer must also handle edge cases like orphaned processes, zombie processes, and cascading failures.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Principle</strong>: The fundamental challenge of terminal multiplexing is <strong>maintaining multiple illusions simultaneously</strong>. Each shell process must believe it has a dedicated terminal, each user must feel they&#39;re interacting directly with their programs, and the underlying terminal must receive a coherent stream of properly formatted output. The multiplexer succeeds when these illusions are invisible to all parties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This context establishes why building a terminal multiplexer is an advanced systems programming project: it requires deep understanding of Unix process management, terminal protocols, event-driven programming, and user interface design, all while maintaining high performance and rock-solid reliability. The implementation must get low-level details exactly right while presenting a clean, intuitive interface to users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This implementation guidance focuses on establishing the foundational understanding and development environment needed to tackle the terminal multiplexer project.</p>\n<p><strong>A.

You need to decide what essential gear to pack (goals), what luxury items would be nice but aren&#39;t necessary (non-goals), and what equipment is completely out of scope for this particular adventure (explicit exclusions). Just as a successful camping trip requires clear boundaries on what you&#39;re trying to accomplish - whether it&#39;s a lightweight backpacking expedition or a comfortable car camping experience - building a terminal multiplexer requires explicit decisions about what functionality to include and what to leave for future versions.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that every feature you choose NOT to implement is as important as every feature you choose to implement. Non-goals aren&#39;t failures or limitations - they&#39;re conscious architectural decisions that keep the project focused, manageable, and aligned with its learning objectives. A terminal multiplexer could theoretically include dozens of advanced features, but for a learning project, we must ruthlessly prioritize the core concepts that provide the most educational value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"functional-requirements\">Functional Requirements</h3>\n<p>The terminal multiplexer will implement a focused set of core features that demonstrate the essential concepts of PTY management, terminal emulation, and window management. These requirements are carefully chosen to build understanding progressively, with each feature depending on and reinforcing the concepts learned in previous milestones.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pty-management-and-session-handling\">PTY Management and Session Handling</h4>\n<p>The multiplexer must create and manage pseudo-terminal pairs that allow multiple shell sessions to run independently within a single terminal interface. This represents the fundamental capability that distinguishes a multiplexer from a simple shell - the ability to virtualize terminal access across multiple processes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PTY Creation</td>\n<td>Allocate master/slave PTY pairs using <code>posix_openpt</code> or equivalent system calls</td>\n<td>Returns valid file descriptors for both master and slave devices</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Spawning</td>\n<td>Fork child processes and execute shell commands with PTY as controlling terminal</td>\n<td>Child process runs shell with correct terminal environment variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Size Handling</td>\n<td>Forward terminal size changes to child processes using <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl</td>\n<td>Pane resizing updates child PTY dimensions and shell applications respond correctly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Lifecycle</td>\n<td>Monitor child process status and handle termination gracefully</td>\n<td>Detect process exit via <code>SIGCHLD</code> and clean up PTY resources</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O Multiplexing</td>\n<td>Read output from multiple PTY masters and write input to active PTY</td>\n<td>Select-based event loop handles multiple file descriptors without blocking</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The PTY management system forms the foundation for all higher-level multiplexer functionality. Without reliable PTY creation and process management, features like window splitting and terminal emulation become meaningless. Each <code>pty_session_t</code> structure represents one virtualized terminal that believes it has exclusive access to a real terminal device.</p>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-emulation-and-display\">Terminal Emulation and Display</h4>\n<p>The multiplexer must parse and interpret terminal escape sequences to maintain accurate virtual screen buffers for each pane. This functionality transforms the raw character stream from shell processes into structured display information that can be rendered and manipulated.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Requirement</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Success Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>ANSI Escape Parsing</td>\n<td>Parse CSI sequences, control characters, and OSC commands from PTY output</td>\n<td>Correctly interpret cursor movement, text attributes, and screen manipulation commands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cursor Management</td>\n<td>Track cursor position and handle movement commands (up, down, left, right)</td>\n<td>Cursor position accurately reflects terminal state after escape sequence processing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Buffer Maintenance</td>\n<td>Maintain virtual screen buffer with character cells and attributes for each pane</td>\n<td>Screen buffer accurately represents what should be displayed in pane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Text Attributes</td>\n<td>Support bold, underline, reverse video, and 256-color text rendering</td>\n<td>Text attributes applied correctly to character cells in screen buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scrollback Buffer</td>\n<td>Retain lines that scroll off the top of the visible screen area</td>\n<td>Users can review previous output up to <code>MAX_SCROLLBACK</code> lines</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTF-8 Support</td>\n<td>Handle multi-byte UTF-8 character sequences correctly</td>\n<td>Non-ASCII characters display properly without corruption</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The terminal emulation component bridges the gap between the raw byte streams from PTY devices and the structured display information needed for rendering. Each <code>screen_buffer_t</code> represents the current visual state of one pane, including both visible content and scrollback history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: Terminal emulation is not just about parsing escape sequences - it&#39;s about maintaining a stateful model of what the terminal display should look like. The escape sequences are commands that modify this state, and the screen buffer is the authoritative representation of the current display.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"window-management-and-layout\">Window Management and Layout</h4>\n<p>The multiplexer must support splitting the terminal into multiple panes, each containing an independent shell session.

By limiting scope to PTY management, terminal emulation, window management, and basic user interface, learners can focus on mastering the essential techniques that make terminal multiplexing possible.</p>\n<p>Each excluded feature represents a potential future learning project.

Each included feature directly supports one or more of the core learning objectives: PTY handling, terminal escape sequences, and process management.</p>\n<p>The milestone structure maps directly to these requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Milestone 1 (PTY Creation)</strong> addresses PTY management and session handling requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 2 (Terminal Emulation)</strong> addresses terminal emulation and display requirements  </li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 3 (Window Management)</strong> addresses window management and layout requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Milestone 4 (Key Bindings and UI)</strong> addresses user interface and key binding requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Error handling and robustness requirements span all milestones, ensuring that each component includes appropriate failure detection and recovery mechanisms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Validation Principle</strong>: Every functional requirement must satisfy two criteria: (1) it teaches a fundamental concept in terminal multiplexing, and (2) it can be implemented and tested within the milestone structure. Every non-goal must satisfy two criteria: (1) excluding it doesn&#39;t prevent learning the core concepts, and (2) including it would add complexity that outweighs its educational value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The resulting feature set provides a complete, working terminal multiplexer that demonstrates all essential concepts while remaining implementable as a learning project. Users will be able to split panes, run multiple shell sessions, navigate between panes, and perform basic terminal operations - sufficient functionality to understand how production multiplexers work internally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>This section provides concrete direction for translating the goals and requirements into working code, focusing on the architectural decisions and technology choices that support the defined scope.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology Recommendations</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PTY Management</td>\n<td><code>posix_openpt()</code> with manual setup</td>\n<td><code>forkpty()</code> from libutil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal I/O</td>\n<td><code>select()</code> with blocking I/O</td>\n<td><code>epoll</code>/<code>kqueue</code> async I/O</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Escape Parsing</td>\n<td>Hand-written state machine</td>\n<td>libvterm or similar library</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Buffers</td>\n<td>2D character arrays</td>\n<td>Optimized line-based storage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Layout Management</td>\n<td>Recursive tree with fixed splits</td>\n<td>Dynamic layout with weights</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Configuration</td>\n<td>Compile-time constants</td>\n<td>Runtime config file parsing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For this learning project, consistently choose the simple options. The goal is understanding the underlying mechanisms, not building the most efficient implementation. Using <code>posix_openpt()</code> teaches PTY allocation explicitly, while <code>forkpty()</code> hides the educational details.

shows shell prompt, can execute commands</li>\n<li>Test command: <code>ls -la</code> should show directory listing in pane</li>\n<li>Verification: <code>ps aux | grep bash</code> shows child shell process</li>\n<li>Signs of trouble: &quot;No PTY&quot; errors indicate allocation failure, zombie processes indicate cleanup issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2 Checkpoint - Terminal Emulation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test command: <code>echo -e &quot;\\033[31mRed Text\\033[0m&quot;</code> should show colored text</li>\n<li>Test cursor movement: <code>echo -e &quot;\\033[10;5HPositioned&quot;</code> should place text at specific location</li>\n<li>Test clear screen: <code>clear</code> command should blank the pane</li>\n<li>Verification: Screen buffer contents match expected terminal state</li>\n<li>Signs of trouble: Garbled text indicates parser issues, missing colors indicate attribute handling problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3 Checkpoint - Window Management:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key sequence: Prefix key + <code>%</code> should create vertical split</li>\n<li>Key sequence: Prefix key + <code>&quot;</code> should create horizontal split</li>\n<li>Key sequence: Prefix key + arrow keys should switch between panes</li>\n<li>Verification: Each pane runs independent shell, borders drawn correctly</li>\n<li>Signs of trouble: Overlapping content indicates rendering issues, shared input indicates focus problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4 Checkpoint - Complete Interface:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Status bar

id=\"language-specific-implementation-notes\">Language-Specific Implementation Notes</h4>\n<p>For C implementation, key technical considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PTY Allocation</strong>: Use <code>posix_openpt()</code> rather than opening <code>/dev/ptmx</code> directly for portability</li>\n<li><strong>Signal Handling</strong>: Install <code>SIGCHLD</code> handler to detect child process termination: <code>signal(SIGCHLD, child_handler)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Non-blocking I/O</strong>: Use <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)</code> on PTY master to prevent blocking reads</li>\n<li><strong>Terminal Control</strong>: Save terminal state with <code>tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &amp;original)</code> before entering raw mode</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Use <code>calloc()</code> for screen buffers to ensure clean initialization</li>\n<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Check all system call return values - PTY operations can fail in various ways</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"common-implementation-pitfalls\">Common Implementation Pitfalls</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Likely Cause</th>\n<th>How to

Architecture</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - this section establishes the architectural foundation that guides implementation across the entire project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"component-overview-the-four-main-components\">Component Overview: The Four Main Components</h3>\n<h4 id=\"mental-model-the-orchestra-conductor\">Mental Model: The Orchestra Conductor</h4>\n<p>Think of a terminal multiplexer as an orchestra conductor coordinating four specialized musicians. Each musician has a distinct role but must work in perfect harmony to create a seamless performance. The <strong>PTY Manager</strong> is like the string section - creating the fundamental sound (shell sessions) that everything else builds upon. The <strong>Terminal Emulator</strong> acts as the woodwinds - interpreting and translating the musical score (escape sequences) into meaningful display changes. The <strong>Window Manager</strong> serves as the brass section - providing structure and visual organization that makes the performance coherent to the audience. Finally, the <strong>Input Handler</strong> functions as the percussion - keeping time and routing control signals that coordinate the entire ensemble.</p>\n<p>Just as a conductor must understand each section&#39;s capabilities and limitations while maintaining perfect timing between them, our multiplexer architecture must carefully orchestrate data flow between these four components while preserving the illusion that each shell session has a dedicated terminal.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-pty-manager-component\">The PTY Manager Component</h4>\n<p>The <strong>PTY Manager</strong> serves as the foundation of our terminal multiplexer, responsible for creating and maintaining the pseudo-terminal pairs that enable shell sessions to run independently. This component encapsulates all the complex details of PTY allocation, process spawning, and session lifecycle management that form the core of Milestone 1.</p>\n<p>The PTY Manager maintains a collection of active sessions, each represented by a <code>pty_session_t</code> structure that tracks the master and slave file descriptors, child process ID, and session state. When a new pane is created, the PTY Manager allocates a fresh pseudo-terminal pair using <code>posix_openpt()</code>, configures the terminal attributes to match the current terminal settings, and forks a child process that will run the shell session.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Key Data Structures</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PTY Allocation</td>\n<td>Create master/slave PTY pairs with proper permissions</td>\n<td><code>pty_session_t</code> with <code>master_fd</code>, <code>slave_fd</code> fields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Spawning</td>\n<td>Fork child processes and exec shells with PTY as controlling terminal</td>\n<td><code>child_pid</code>, <code>process_running</code> fields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Lifecycle</td>\n<td>Track process state, handle SIGCHLD, manage session termination</td>\n<td><code>exit_status</code> field, signal handlers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O Management</td>\n<td>Provide read/write interface for PTY master file descriptors</td>\n<td>Buffer management, non-blocking I/O</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Sizing</td>\n<td>Forward TIOCSWINSZ ioctl calls to adjust PTY dimensions</td>\n<td>Window size change propagation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The PTY Manager abstracts away the complexity of pseudo-terminal management from other components. When the Window Manager needs to create a new pane, it simply calls <code>pty_session_create()</code> and receives a ready-to-use session structure. When the Terminal Emulator needs to send input to a shell, it uses <code>pty_session_write()</code> without concerning itself with file descriptor management or process state.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: The PTY Manager acts as a protective barrier between the multiplexer and the underlying Unix process model. By encapsulating all PTY and process management logic in this component, we can change process handling strategies (like adding process group management or session persistence) without affecting the rest of the system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"the-terminal-emulator-component\">The Terminal Emulator Component</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Terminal Emulator</strong> transforms the raw output streams from shell processes into structured screen representations that can be displayed and manipulated. This component implements the complex logic of Milestone 2, parsing ANSI escape sequences and maintaining virtual screen buffers for each active pane.</p>\n<p>At its heart, the Terminal Emulator contains a finite state machine that processes character streams byte by byte, distinguishing between printable characters that should appear on screen and control sequences that modify cursor position, text attributes, or screen content. The parser maintains state across multiple input chunks, handling cases where escape sequences span buffer boundaries or arrive incomplete.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parser State</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Transitions</th>\n<th>Actions Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>NORMAL_TEXT</td>\n<td>Processing regular printable characters</td>\n<td>ESC → ESCAPE_START</td>\n<td>Add characters to screen buffer at cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ESCAPE_START</td>\n<td>Detected ESC byte, waiting for sequence type</td>\n<td>&#39;[&#39; → CSI_PARAMS, &#39;O&#39; → SS3_SEQUENCE</td>\n<td>Set up sequence parsing context</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Collecting numeric parameters for CSI sequences</td>\n<td>&#39;0&#39;-&#39;9&#39;, &#39;;&#39; → CSI_PARAMS, &#39;A&#39;-&#39;Z&#39; → NORMAL_TEXT</td>\n<td>Build parameter list, execute cursor/display commands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OSC_SEQUENCE</td>\n<td>Processing Operating System Command sequences</td>\n<td>&#39;\\x07&#39; or &#39;\\x1b\\&#39; → NORMAL_TEXT</td>\n<td>Handle title changes, color settings</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Each pane maintains its own <code>screen_buffer_t</code> structure that represents the current display state. The screen buffer contains a two-dimensional array of <code>terminal_cell_t</code> structures, each storing a character along with its display attributes (bold, underline, colors). The Terminal Emulator updates this buffer in response to parsed escape sequences, handling cursor movement, text insertion, line scrolling, and screen clearing operations.</p>\n<p>The Terminal Emulator also manages a scrollback buffer that preserves lines that scroll off the top of the visible area. This buffer enables users to review previous command output and supports copy mode functionality where users can select and copy text from the scrollback history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Architecture Decision</strong>: We maintain separate screen buffers per pane rather than trying to multiplex output at the character level. This design allows each pane to have independent scrollback history, cursor state, and display attributes while simplifying the rendering logic that composes multiple panes into terminal output.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"the-window-manager-component\">The Window Manager Component</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Window Manager</strong> orchestrates the visual layout of multiple panes within the terminal window, implementing the sophisticated space allocation and rendering logic required for Milestone 3. This component treats the terminal screen as a canvas that must be dynamically partitioned among competing panes while providing visual feedback about pane boundaries and focus state.</p>\n<p>The Window Manager employs a tree-based layout algorithm where each node represents either a leaf pane containing a shell session or an internal split node that divides available space between its children. Split nodes can be either horizontal (dividing space top-to-bottom) or vertical (dividing space left-to-right), creating a recursive partitioning system that can represent arbitrarily complex layouts.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Layout Node Type</th>\n<th>Data Fields</th>\n<th>Responsibilities</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Leaf Pane</td>\n<td><code>session_ptr</code>, <code>screen_buffer</code>, <code>is_focused</code></td>\n<td>Render single pane content with borders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horizontal Split</td>\n<td><code>top_child</code>, <code>bottom_child</code>, <code>split_ratio</code></td>\n<td>Divide height between children, handle resize</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vertical Split</td>\n<td><code>left_child</code>, <code>right_child</code>, <code>split_ratio</code></td>\n<td>Divide width between children, handle resize</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When the terminal window is resized, the Window Manager recalculates the entire layout tree, propagating new dimensions down to leaf panes and updating the corresponding PTY sizes through <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl calls. This ensures that shell programs receive accurate terminal dimensions and can adjust their output accordingly.</p>\n<p>The Window Manager&#39;s rendering pipeline processes the layout tree in depth-first order, compositing each pane&#39;s screen buffer into the final terminal output. It draws border characters between adjacent panes, highlights the currently focused pane with visual indicators, and reserves space for a status bar that displays pane information and system status.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Space Management Philosophy</strong>: The Window Manager treats screen real estate as a precious resource that must be allocated fairly while respecting minimum usability constraints. Each pane must be large enough to display at least one line of shell output, but beyond that minimum, space is distributed proportionally based on user-initiated resize operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"the-input-handler-component\">The Input Handler Component</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Input Handler</strong> manages the critical task of routing keyboard input between the multiplexer&#39;s control functions and the active shell sessions, implementing the sophisticated input processing required for Milestone 4. This component must operate in raw terminal mode to capture all keystrokes while providing a clean abstraction that separates multiplexer commands from normal terminal input.</p>\n<p>The Input Handler implements a two-mode system: <strong>pass-through mode</strong> where keystrokes are forwarded directly to the focused pane&#39;s shell, and <strong>command mode</strong> triggered by a configurable prefix key (typically Ctrl-b). In command mode, the Input Handler interprets subsequent keystrokes as multiplexer commands for pane management, window navigation, and system control.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Input Mode</th>\n<th>Trigger</th>\n<th>Key Bindings</th>\n<th>Destination</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Pass-through</td>\n<td>Default state</td>\n<td>All keys except prefix</td>\n<td>Active pane&#39;s PTY session</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Command Mode</td>\n<td>Prefix key pressed</td>\n<td>&#39;c&#39; → new pane, &#39;h/j/k/l&#39; → navigate, &#39;%&#39; → vsplit</td>\n<td>Window Manager operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copy Mode</td>\n<td>Command + &#39;[&#39;</td>\n<td>Arrow keys → cursor, Space → select, Enter → copy</td>\n<td>Screen buffer navigation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Input Handler maintains a registry of key bindings that maps keystroke sequences to multiplexer functions. This registry supports both single-character commands and multi-character sequences, allowing for sophisticated key binding schemes that don&#39;t conflict with normal shell usage. The component also handles special keys like arrow keys and function keys that generate multi-byte escape sequences.</p>\n<p>Raw terminal mode management represents one of the Input Handler&#39;s most critical responsibilities. When the multiplexer starts, it must save the current terminal attributes using <code>tcgetattr()</code>, switch to raw mode to disable line buffering and special character processing, and ensure that original terminal settings are restored even if the program exits unexpectedly due to signals or errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Input Routing Complexity</strong>: The challenge isn&#39;t just capturing keystrokes - it&#39;s maintaining the illusion that each shell session has a dedicated terminal while intercepting just enough input to provide multiplexer functionality. This requires careful coordination between raw terminal mode, signal handling, and prefix key detection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"component-interaction-patterns\">Component Interaction Patterns</h3>\n<p>The four components interact through well-defined interfaces that maintain clear separation of concerns while enabling efficient data flow. The PTY Manager produces character streams from shell processes, the Terminal Emulator consumes these streams and produces structured screen buffers, the Window Manager consumes screen buffers and produces terminal output, and the Input Handler coordinates the entire process by routing commands and managing system state.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Data Flow Path</th>\n<th>Source Component</th>\n<th>Destination Component</th>\n<th>Data Format</th>\n<th>Frequency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Shell Output</td>\n<td>PTY Manager</td>\n<td>Terminal Emulator</td>\n<td>Raw byte streams with escape sequences</td>\n<td>Continuous during shell activity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Updates</td>\n<td>Terminal Emulator</td>\n<td>Window Manager</td>\n<td>Structured screen buffers with cursor state</td>\n<td>After each escape sequence batch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Rendering</td>\n<td>Window Manager</td>\n<td>Terminal (stdout)</td>\n<td>Composed display with borders and status</td>\n<td>On screen buffer changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User Input</td>\n<td>Input Handler</td>\n<td>PTY Manager</td>\n<td>Filtered keystroke streams</td>\n<td>Real-time during user interaction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Control Commands</td>\n<td>Input Handler</td>\n<td>Window Manager</td>\n<td>Split, resize, focus commands</td>\n<td>On prefix key sequences</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Event-Driven Coordination</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Components need to coordinate without tight coupling while maintaining responsive performance</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Direct method calls, message passing, shared memory, event-driven with select()</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Event-driven architecture using select() for I/O multiplexing with direct method calls for control operations</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Select-based I/O handles multiple PTY file descriptors efficiently while direct calls provide synchronous control operations without message passing overhead</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables responsive input handling and efficient resource utilization but requires careful state management across components</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"recommended-module-structure\">Recommended Module Structure</h3>\n<p>The terminal multiplexer implementation should be organized into focused modules that correspond directly to the architectural components while providing clean separation between interface definitions and implementation details.

This creates circular dependencies that make the code difficult to compile and test. Always design dependencies to flow in one direction: Control Layer → Presentation Layer → Processing Layer → Session Layer → Foundation Layer.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Exposing Implementation Details Through Headers</strong>\nAnother frequent error is putting internal data structures or helper functions in public header files. This creates unnecessary coupling where changes to internal implementation require recompiling all dependent modules. Keep implementation details in <code>.c</code> files and only expose the minimal interface needed by other components.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Handling Across Modules</strong>\nDifferent modules using different error reporting mechanisms (return codes vs. global variables vs. callbacks) makes the system difficult to debug and maintain. Establish consistent error handling patterns early and enforce them across all modules through code review and testing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Monolithic Data Structures</strong>\nCreating giant structures that contain fields for multiple components violates encapsulation and makes the code harder to understand.

Model</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - this section defines the core data structures that underpin PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-information-warehouse\">Mental Model: The Information Warehouse</h3>\n<p>Think of the terminal multiplexer&#39;s data model as a well-organized warehouse that stores different types of information in specialized containers. Just as a warehouse has sections for raw materials, work-in-progress items, and finished products, our multiplexer organizes data into distinct categories: session information (tracking active shell processes), visual state (what appears on screen), layout information (how panes are arranged), and system state (terminal configuration).</p>\n<p>Each &quot;container&quot; in our warehouse serves a specific purpose and has a defined structure. The <strong>session containers</strong> hold everything needed to communicate with shell processes - file descriptors, process IDs, and status information. The <strong>visual containers</strong> store the current appearance of each terminal screen - every character, color, and cursor position. The <strong>layout containers</strong> define how multiple sessions share screen real estate. Finally, the <strong>system containers</strong> preserve the original terminal configuration so we can restore it when exiting.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that these containers must work together seamlessly. When a shell process writes output, it flows from session containers through parsing logic into visual containers, which then get composited by layout containers for display. This separation of concerns allows each component to focus on its specific responsibility while maintaining clear interfaces between them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/terminal-multiplexer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fdata-model.svg\" alt=\"Core Data Structures\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"session-and-pane-structures\">Session and Pane Structures</h3>\n<p>The session and pane structures form the foundation for managing multiple shell processes and organizing them visually. These structures bridge the gap between the low-level pseudo-terminal interfaces and the higher-level windowing abstractions that users interact with.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pty-session-structure\">PTY Session Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>pty_session_t</code> structure encapsulates everything needed to manage a single shell session running in a pseudo-terminal. This structure serves as the primary interface between the multiplexer and individual shell processes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>master_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for PTY master device, used for reading shell output and writing user input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>slave_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for PTY slave device, connected to child process stdin/stdout/stderr</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>child_pid</code></td>\n<td><code>pid_t</code></td>\n<td>Process ID of the shell process running in this session</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>process_running</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Flag indicating whether child process is still alive and responsive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exit_status</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Exit code from child process after termination (valid only when process_running is false)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The master file descriptor serves as the multiplexer&#39;s primary interface to the shell process. All data written to the master appears on the slave&#39;s stdout, and all data written to the slave&#39;s stdin appears when reading from the master. This bidirectional pipe abstraction allows the multiplexer to intercept and process all terminal I/O.</p>\n<p>The slave file descriptor is typically only used during session creation to configure terminal attributes and establish the controlling terminal relationship. Once the child process starts, the multiplexer closes its copy of the slave descriptor, leaving only the child process with access.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The <code>process_running</code> flag provides a fast path for checking process liveness without making system calls. It&#39;s updated asynchronously when SIGCHLD signals arrive, avoiding the need to call <code>waitpid()</code> on every I/O operation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"pane-structure\">Pane Structure</h4>\n<p>Panes represent the visual organization of sessions within the terminal window. Each pane contains a session, screen buffer, and layout information that determines how it appears to the user.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier for this pane within the current window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>session</code></td>\n<td><code>pty_session_t</code></td>\n<td>PTY session running in this pane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>buffer</code></td>\n<td><code>screen_buffer_t</code></td>\n<td>Virtual screen buffer storing current display state</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>x</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Left column position of pane within terminal (0-based)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>y</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Top row position of pane within terminal (0-based)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>width</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Width of pane content area in characters (excluding borders)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>height</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Height of pane content area in characters (excluding borders)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>has_focus</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Whether this pane currently receives keyboard input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>needs_redraw</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Flag indicating pane content has changed and requires re-rendering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>border_style</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Border appearance (none, simple, double-line)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The coordinate system uses zero-based indexing with the origin at the top-left corner of the terminal. The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields represent the usable content area, excluding any border characters. This separation simplifies the rendering logic by providing consistent dimensions regardless of border style.</p>\n<p>The <code>needs_redraw</code> flag implements a simple optimization to avoid unnecessary rendering. Components set this flag when modifying pane content, and the renderer clears it after updating the display. This prevents wasted CPU cycles re-rendering unchanged panes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Embedding the session directly in the pane structure (rather than using a pointer or ID reference) simplifies memory management and ensures session lifetime matches pane lifetime. This prevents dangling pointer bugs that could occur if sessions were managed separately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"window-structure\">Window Structure</h4>\n<p>Windows provide the top-level container for organizing multiple panes. Each window maintains its own pane layout and can be switched independently.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>id</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Unique identifier for this window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td><code>char[64]</code></td>\n<td>Human-readable name displayed in status bar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>panes</code></td>\n<td><code>pane_t[MAX_PANES]</code></td>\n<td>Array of panes within this window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pane_count</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Number of active panes in the panes array</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>active_pane</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Index of currently focused pane in panes array</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>layout_tree</code></td>\n<td><code>layout_node_t*</code></td>\n<td>Root of binary tree describing pane split structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>last_activity</code></td>\n<td><code>time_t</code></td>\n<td>Timestamp of most recent activity in any pane</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The panes array uses a fixed-size allocation to simplify memory management and prevent fragmentation. The <code>MAX_PANES</code> constant (16) provides reasonable flexibility while avoiding the complexity of dynamic allocation.</p>\n<p>The layout tree represents the hierarchical structure of pane splits. Each internal node represents a split (horizontal or vertical), while leaf nodes represent individual panes. This tree structure enables efficient resize calculations and maintains split proportions when the terminal size changes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"layout-node-structure\">Layout Node Structure</h4>\n<p>Layout nodes form a binary tree that describes how panes are arranged within a window. This tree-based approach provides flexible layout capabilities while maintaining efficient resize and rendering operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>type</code></td>\n<td><code>layout_type_t</code></td>\n<td>Node type: LAYOUT_LEAF (pane), LAYOUT_HSPLIT (horizontal), or LAYOUT_VSPLIT (vertical)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pane_id</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Pane identifier (valid only for leaf nodes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>split_ratio</code></td>\n<td><code>float</code></td>\n<td>Proportion of space allocated to left/top child (0.0 to 1.0)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>left</code></td>\n<td><code>layout_node_t*</code></td>\n<td>Left or top child node (NULL for leaf nodes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>right</code></td>\n<td><code>layout_node_t*</code></td>\n<td>Right or bottom child node (NULL for leaf nodes)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>parent</code></td>\n<td><code>layout_node_t*</code></td>\n<td>Parent node (NULL for root)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The split ratio determines how available space is divided between child nodes. A ratio of 0.3 allocates 30% of space to the left/top child and 70% to the right/bottom child. This proportional system maintains layout balance when the terminal is resized.</p>\n<p>Parent pointers enable efficient upward traversal during resize operations. When a pane requests a size change, the algorithm walks up the tree to find the appropriate split node and adjusts ratios accordingly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"terminal-state-structures\">Terminal State Structures</h3>\n<p>Terminal state structures maintain the visual representation of shell output and the system-level terminal configuration. These structures bridge the gap between raw character streams from shell processes and the formatted display that users see.</p>\n<h4 id=\"screen-buffer-structure\">Screen Buffer Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>screen_buffer_t</code> structure represents the complete visual state of a single terminal session. It maintains both the currently visible screen and the scrollback history that users can navigate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>cells</code></td>\n<td><code>terminal_cell_t**</code></td>\n<td>2D array of screen cells, indexed as cells[row][column]</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>width</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Screen buffer width in characters (matches pane width)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>height</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Screen buffer height in characters (matches pane height)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cursor_x</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Current cursor column position (0-based)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>cursor_y</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Current cursor row position (0-based)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scroll_offset</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Number of lines scrolled up from bottom of scrollback</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scrollback</code></td>\n<td><code>terminal_cell_t**</code></td>\n<td>Scrollback buffer storing lines that scrolled off screen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>scrollback_lines</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Current number of lines stored in scrollback buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>current_attributes</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Active text attributes (bold, underline, reverse)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>current_fg_color</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Active foreground color (0-15 for standard colors)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>current_bg_color</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Active background color (0-15 for standard colors)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The cells array provides random access to any screen position for efficient cursor movement and text rendering. The two-dimensional indexing simplifies coordinate calculations and bounds checking during escape sequence processing.</p>\n<p>The scrollback buffer operates as a circular buffer that preserves lines as they scroll off the top of the visible screen. The <code>scroll_offset</code> field allows users to navigate this history without losing the current screen state. When <code>scroll_offset</code> is zero, the user sees the live terminal output. Positive values show historical lines.</p>\n<p>Current attribute fields maintain the terminal&#39;s text formatting state. These values apply to all subsequently written characters until modified by escape sequences. Separating these from individual cell attributes enables efficient processing of long runs of similarly formatted text.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: Using a 2D array rather than a single linear buffer simplifies indexing calculations and reduces the likelihood of buffer overflow bugs. The memory overhead is minimal compared to the safety benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-cell-structure\">Terminal Cell Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>terminal_cell_t</code> structure represents a single character position on the terminal screen, including the character itself and all associated display attributes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ch</code></td>\n<td><code>char</code></td>\n<td>Unicode character at this cell position (UTF-8 encoded)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>attributes</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Bitmask of text attributes (bold, underline, reverse video)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fg_color</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Foreground color index (0-255 for extended color support)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>bg_color</code></td>\n<td><code>byte</code></td>\n<td>Background color index (0-255 for extended color support)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The character field stores a single UTF-8 code unit. For multi-byte Unicode characters, the first cell contains the complete UTF-8 sequence while subsequent cells in the character are marked with a special continuation value. This approach maintains simple indexing while supporting international characters.</p>\n<p>The attributes field uses individual bits to represent different text formatting options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Attribute</th>\n<th>Bit Position</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>ATTR_BOLD</code></td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Bold or bright text rendering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ATTR_UNDERLINE</code></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Underlined text decoration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ATTR_REVERSE</code></td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Swap foreground and background colors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Color fields support both the standard 16-color palette and extended 256-color mode. Standard colors use values 0-15, while extended colors utilize the full 0-255 range. The special value <code>COLOR_DEFAULT</code> (9) indicates the terminal&#39;s default color scheme should be used.</p>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-state-structure\">Terminal State Structure</h4>\n<p>The <code>terminal_state_t</code> structure preserves the original terminal configuration to enable proper restoration when the multiplexer exits. Raw terminal mode significantly alters the terminal&#39;s behavior, making restoration critical for system stability.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>original_termios</code></td>\n<td><code>struct termios</code></td>\n<td>Terminal attributes before entering raw mode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>raw_mode_active</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Flag indicating whether raw mode is currently enabled</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>termios</code> structure contains all terminal configuration parameters, including input processing flags, output processing flags, control character definitions, and line discipline settings. Preserving this complete state ensures perfect restoration regardless of the user&#39;s custom terminal configuration.</p>\n<p>The <code>raw_mode_active</code> flag prevents double-initialization and ensures proper cleanup. Attempting to enter raw mode when already active, or restore mode when not active, can cause undefined behavior or system instability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-structure-relationships\">Data Structure Relationships</h3>\n<p>Understanding how these structures interconnect is crucial for implementing the multiplexer correctly. The relationships follow a clear hierarchy that mirrors the user&#39;s conceptual model of the system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ownership-and-lifetime-management\">Ownership and Lifetime Management</h4>\n<p>Windows own panes, panes own sessions and screen buffers, and sessions own PTY file descriptors. This ownership hierarchy ensures proper resource cleanup and prevents memory leaks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Window Lifetime</strong>: Created when user creates new window, destroyed when user closes window or multiplexer exits</li>\n<li><strong>Pane Lifetime</strong>: Created when splitting existing pane or creating first pane in window, destroyed when user closes pane</li>\n<li><strong>Session Lifetime</strong>: Created with pane, destroyed when shell process exits or pane is closed</li>\n<li><strong>Buffer Lifetime</strong>: Matches pane lifetime, allocated during pane creation, freed during pane cleanup</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"data-flow-patterns\">Data Flow Patterns</h4>\n<p>Data flows through these structures in predictable patterns that correspond to the main multiplexer operations:</p>\n<p><strong>Shell Output Processing</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data arrives on PTY master file descriptor in <code>pty_session_t</code></li>\n<li>Escape sequence parser processes raw bytes and updates <code>screen_buffer_t</code></li>\n<li>Window manager composites multiple buffers for display</li>\n<li>Terminal output renderer converts screen buffers to terminal escape sequences</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>User Input Processing</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Raw keyboard input arrives from terminal</li>\n<li>Input handler checks for prefix key combinations and command mode</li>\n<li>Regular input routes to active pane&#39;s <code>pty_session_t</code></li>\n<li>Data writes to PTY master file descriptor reach shell process</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Window Management Operations</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Split commands create new <code>pane_t</code> and <code>pty_session_t</code> structures</li>\n<li>Layout tree updates with new <code>layout_node_t</code> reflecting split</li>\n<li>Existing panes resize to accommodate new pane</li>\n<li>Screen buffers resize to match new pane dimensions</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Embedded vs Referenced Structures</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Structures can either embed related structures directly or reference them through pointers/IDs</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ul>\n<li>Direct embedding (session embedded in pane)</li>\n<li>Pointer references (pane points to session)</li>\n<li>ID-based lookup (pane stores session ID)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use direct embedding for session-in-pane, pointer references for layout tree</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Embedding simplifies lifetime management and prevents null pointer dereferences.

Related data is co-located, and frequently accessed fields are positioned early in structures to improve cache performance.</p>\n<p>Fixed-size arrays (like the panes array in windows) prevent heap fragmentation that could occur with dynamic allocation. The <code>MAX_PANES</code> limit is generous enough for typical usage while keeping memory usage predictable.</p>\n<p>Circular buffer management for scrollback uses efficient modular arithmetic rather than shifting array contents. This provides O(1) insertion performance regardless of scrollback buffer size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Fixed vs Dynamic Array Sizes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Collections like panes within windows could use fixed arrays or dynamic allocation</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Fixed arrays with compile-time maximums</li>\n<li>Dynamic arrays with reallocation</li>\n<li>Linked lists with individual node allocation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Fixed arrays with reasonable limits (<code>MAX_PANES</code> = 16)</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Eliminates allocation failures, prevents fragmentation, simplifies memory management, provides predictable performance</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Memory usage slightly higher, but eliminates entire classes of runtime errors and complexity</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Screen Buffer Organization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Screen buffers could be organized as 2D arrays, linear arrays, or sparse data structures</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>2D array indexed as <code>buffer[row][column]</code></li>\n<li>Linear array with calculated offsets</li>\n<li>Sparse representation storing only non-blank cells</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: 2D array with direct indexing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simplifies coordinate calculations, eliminates offset bugs, provides O(1) random access, matches natural mental model</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Uses more memory for sparse screens, but provides simpler and more reliable implementation</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: UTF-8 Character Handling</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Unicode characters can span multiple bytes, requiring special handling in terminal cells</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ul>\n<li>Store complete UTF-8 sequences in each cell</li>\n<li>Use wide characters (wchar_t) for internal representation</li>\n<li>Mark continuation cells with special values</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Store UTF-8 in first cell, mark continuations with special marker</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Maintains byte-oriented processing, supports full Unicode range, preserves simple indexing model</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires special handling during cursor movement and editing operations</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting to Initialize Screen Buffer Cells</strong>\nWhen allocating a new screen buffer, uninitialized cells may contain random memory values that appear as garbage characters on screen. Always initialize cells with space characters, default colors, and no attributes. Use <code>memset()</code> or explicit loops to ensure clean initialization.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Buffer Overflow During Screen Resize</strong>\nWhen terminal dimensions change, existing screen buffers may be smaller than the new size. Accessing cells beyond the old dimensions causes buffer overflows. Always reallocate and initialize screen buffers before updating width/height fields.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Cursor Position Tracking</strong>\nThe cursor position in the screen buffer must stay synchronized with the PTY&#39;s actual cursor position. Escape sequences that move the cursor must update both the internal tracking variables and send appropriate sequences to the PTY. Mismatches cause visual artifacts and incorrect text placement.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Layout Tree Management</strong>\nLayout nodes are dynamically allocated and form a tree structure with complex ownership relationships. Failing to properly traverse and free the entire tree during cleanup causes memory leaks. Implement recursive cleanup functions that handle both leaf and internal nodes correctly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Process Status Updates</strong>\nThe <code>process_running</code> flag is updated asynchronously by signal handlers when child processes exit. Reading this flag without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions where the multiplexer thinks a process is still running after it has exited. Use atomic operations or proper locking when accessing process status.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Scrollback Buffer Circular Index Errors</strong>\nCircular buffers require careful index management to wrap correctly at buffer boundaries. Off-by-one errors in modular arithmetic cause buffer overruns or incorrect data retrieval. Always use consistent wrap-around logic and validate indices before array access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology

establishes the foundational PTY management capabilities that enable all subsequent terminal multiplexer functionality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-process-nursery\">Mental Model: The Process Nursery</h3>\n<p>Understanding PTYs requires thinking of the PTY Manager as a <strong>process nursery</strong> that creates isolated environments where child processes believe they have dedicated terminals. Just as a hospital nursery provides controlled environments for newborns, the PTY Manager creates controlled terminal environments for shell processes.</p>\n<p>In the physical world, a terminal was historically a physical device with a keyboard and screen connected to a mainframe computer. Modern operating systems simulate this hardware relationship using <strong>pseudo-terminals</strong> (PTYs), which consist of a master-slave pair. The master side acts like the &quot;computer end&quot; of the terminal connection, while the slave side acts like the &quot;terminal hardware&quot; that the shell process sees.</p>\n<p>Think of the PTY Manager as operating a nursery where each &quot;crib&quot; (PTY pair) contains a sleeping child process (shell). The nursery attendant (PTY Manager) can communicate with each child through a window (master file descriptor) while the child believes it has its own private room (slave terminal). When a child writes to what it thinks is its terminal screen, those writes actually go to the master side where our multiplexer can intercept, process, and route them. Similarly, when we want to send keyboard input to a specific child, we write to the master and the operating system delivers it to the slave as if it came from a real keyboard.</p>\n<p>This isolation is crucial because each shell process needs to believe it has complete control over its terminal. It needs to set terminal attributes, handle terminal signals, and manage cursor positioning without interference from other shells. The PTY Manager maintains this illusion while secretly coordinating multiple such environments through a single real terminal interface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pty-manager-interface\">PTY Manager Interface</h3>\n<p>The PTY Manager provides a clean interface for creating, managing, and destroying pseudo-terminal sessions. Each session encapsulates a shell process running in its own controlled terminal environment. The interface abstracts away the complex details of PTY allocation, process forking, and file descriptor management.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_create</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code>, <code>shell_command: char*</code></td>\n<td><code>tmux_error_t</code></td>\n<td>Creates new PTY pair, forks child process, and starts shell with proper session setup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_read</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code>, <code>buffer: char*</code>, <code>size: size_t</code></td>\n<td><code>ssize_t</code></td>\n<td>Reads output from shell process via PTY master, returns bytes read or -1 on error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_write</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code>, <code>data: char*</code>, <code>length: size_t</code></td>\n<td><code>ssize_t</code></td>\n<td>Sends input to shell process via PTY master, returns bytes written or -1 on error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_resize</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code>, <code>width: int</code>, <code>height: int</code></td>\n<td><code>tmux_error_t</code></td>\n<td>Updates PTY terminal size and notifies child process via SIGWINCH signal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_is_alive</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Checks if child process is still running using non-blocking waitpid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_get_exit_status</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Returns exit status of terminated child process, or -1 if still running</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_terminate</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code>, <code>signal: int</code></td>\n<td><code>tmux_error_t</code></td>\n<td>Sends signal to child process (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pty_session_destroy</code></td>\n<td><code>session: pty_session_t*</code></td>\n<td><code>tmux_error_t</code></td>\n<td>Cleans up PTY file descriptors, reaps child process, and frees resources</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>pty_session_t</code> structure maintains all state necessary for managing a single shell session:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>master_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for PTY master device, used for reading shell output and writing input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>slave_fd</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>File descriptor for PTY slave device, typically closed after fork in parent process</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>child_pid</code></td>\n<td><code>pid_t</code></td>\n<td>Process ID of forked shell child, used for signal delivery and status monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>process_running</code></td>\n<td><code>bool</code></td>\n<td>Flag indicating whether child process is still alive, updated by SIGCHLD handler</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>exit_status</code></td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Exit code returned by child process after termination, obtained via waitpid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The interface design prioritizes simplicity and safety. Each function returns explicit error codes rather than relying on global errno values.

File descriptor ownership is clear: the PTY Manager owns the master descriptor while the child process owns the slave.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pty-creation-and-management\">PTY Creation and Management</h3>\n<p>The PTY creation process involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of system calls that must be executed in the correct order to establish proper session leadership and terminal ownership. The algorithm handles the complex interaction between PTY allocation, process forking, and session management.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/terminal-multiplexer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fpty-creation-flow.svg\" alt=\"PTY Creation and Process Spawning Flow\"></p>\n<p>The PTY creation algorithm follows these essential steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>PTY Master Allocation</strong>: The system allocates a PTY master device using <code>posix_openpt(O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY)</code>. The <code>O_NOCTTY</code> flag prevents the PTY from becoming the controlling terminal of the current process. This returns a file descriptor for the master side of the PTY pair.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>PTY Master Configuration</strong>: The master device requires permission and ownership setup through <code>grantpt()</code> and <code>unlockpt()</code> system calls. These functions configure the slave device permissions and make it available for opening by child processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Slave Device Path Resolution</strong>: The <code>ptsname()</code> function returns the filesystem path to the corresponding slave device (typically <code>/dev/pts/N</code> where N is a number). This path will be used by the child process to open its terminal device.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Fork</strong>: The parent process forks using <code>fork()</code>, creating an identical child process. At this point, both processes have access to the master file descriptor, but only the child will open and use the slave.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Child Process Session Setup</strong>: The child process must establish itself as a session leader before opening the slave terminal. It calls <code>setsid()</code> to create a new session and process group, making itself the session leader with no controlling terminal.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Slave Terminal Acquisition</strong>: The child opens the slave device using the path obtained from <code>ptsname()</code>. This open operation establishes the slave PTY as the child&#39;s controlling terminal because the child is a session leader without an existing controlling terminal.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Standard File Descriptor Redirection</strong>: The child duplicates the slave file descriptor to stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr (2) using <code>dup2()</code>. This ensures all shell I/O operations use the PTY slave device.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Shell Process Execution</strong>: The child executes the shell program using <code>execve()</code> or similar, replacing its process image with the shell while preserving the PTY file descriptors and session relationship.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Cleanup</strong>: The parent process closes its copy of the slave file descriptor (since it will never use it) and stores the master descriptor and child PID in the session structure for ongoing management.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The terminal attribute configuration requires special attention. The PTY slave initially inherits default terminal settings that may not be appropriate for shell interaction. The child process typically configures terminal attributes using <code>tcsetattr()</code> to enable features like canonical input processing, signal generation, and proper character echo behavior.</p>\n<p>Window size initialization is critical for proper shell operation. Many shell programs and applications query terminal dimensions to format their output appropriately. The PTY Manager must set initial window size using the <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl on the master file descriptor, typically matching the current terminal&#39;s dimensions.</p>\n<p>Signal handling configuration affects both parent and child processes. The parent must install a <code>SIGCHLD</code> handler to detect child process termination asynchronously. The child inherits the parent&#39;s signal disposition but may modify signal handling after becoming a session leader, particularly for terminal-related signals like <code>SIGINT</code>, <code>SIGTSTP</code>, and <code>SIGWINCH</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"architecture-decision-records\">Architecture Decision Records</h3>\n<p>The PTY Manager design involves several critical architectural decisions that affect system reliability, performance, and complexity. Each decision represents a trade-off between different technical approaches with distinct advantages and limitations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: PTY Allocation Method</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Multiple system interfaces exist for PTY allocation, including BSD-style <code>openpty()</code>, System V-style <code>getpt()</code>, and POSIX <code>posix_openpt()</code>.

Unlike <code>openpty()</code>, it doesn&#39;t hide important setup steps, making the code more educational and debuggable.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires explicit calls to <code>grantpt()</code> and <code>unlockpt()</code>, but provides better error handling granularity and clearer understanding of the PTY setup process.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Option</th>\n<th>Pros</th>\n<th>Cons</th>\n<th>Chosen?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>openpty()</code></td>\n<td>Handles setup automatically, very simple API</td>\n<td>Hides important setup steps, less portable</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>posix_openpt()</code></td>\n<td>POSIX standard, explicit control, good error handling</td>\n<td>Requires manual grantpt/unlockpt calls</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Direct <code>/dev/ptmx</code></td>\n<td>Maximum control, no library dependencies</td>\n<td>Non-portable, complex permission handling</td>\n<td>No</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Child Process Monitoring Strategy</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: The parent process must track child process lifecycle to detect termination, collect exit status, and prevent zombie processes.

These pitfalls often manifest as mysterious hangs, broken terminal behavior, or resource leaks that are difficult to debug without understanding the underlying PTY semantics.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting setsid() in Child Process</strong></p>\n<p>Many developers attempt to open the PTY slave device in the child process without first calling <code>setsid()</code> to establish session leadership. This causes the <code>open()</code> call to fail because a process can only acquire a controlling terminal if it&#39;s a session leader without an existing controlling terminal.</p>\n<p>The symptom is that child processes fail to start properly, often with &quot;Operation not permitted&quot; errors when attempting to open the slave device. The root cause is that the child process inherited the parent&#39;s session and process group, making it ineligible to acquire a new controlling terminal.</p>\n<p>The fix requires calling <code>setsid()</code> in the child process before opening the slave device. This system call creates a new session with the child as session leader, creates a new process group, and detaches from any existing controlling terminal. After <code>setsid()</code>, the child can successfully open the PTY slave and establish it as the controlling terminal.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks Across Fork</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is failing to close unused file descriptors after forking, leading to resource leaks and communication problems. The parent process should never hold the slave file descriptor, and the child should close the master descriptor immediately after fork.</p>\n<p>When file descriptors leak across the fork boundary, several problems occur. The parent holding a slave descriptor prevents proper EOF detection when the child terminates. The child holding a master descriptor can interfere with the parent&#39;s I/O operations and prevents proper cleanup.</p>\n<p>The solution is disciplined descriptor management: immediately after fork, the parent closes the slave descriptor and keeps only the master. The child closes the master descriptor and uses only the slave for its stdin/stdout/stderr redirection. This creates clean ownership boundaries and prevents interference.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Terminal Attribute Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>PTY slave devices inherit default terminal attributes that are often inappropriate for interactive shell use. Failing to configure attributes like canonical mode, echo settings, and signal generation leads to shells that behave strangely or don&#39;t respond to user input properly.</p>\n<p>The child process should configure terminal attributes using <code>tcgetattr()</code> and <code>tcsetattr()</code> after opening the slave device but before executing the shell. Common settings include enabling canonical input processing (so users can edit command lines), configuring appropriate echo behavior, and ensuring signal generation for Ctrl-C and similar key combinations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Improper SIGCHLD Handling</strong></p>\n<p>Inadequate child process monitoring leads to zombie processes that consume system resources and prevent accurate session status tracking. The <code>SIGCHLD</code> signal handler must properly reap terminated children using <code>waitpid()</code> while avoiding race conditions.</p>\n<p>The signal handler should use <code>waitpid(-1, &amp;status, WNOHANG)</code> in a loop to collect all available child exit statuses without blocking. The <code>WNOHANG</code> flag prevents blocking if no children have terminated, while the loop ensures multiple simultaneous child terminations are handled correctly.</p>\n<p>Race conditions occur when the main program checks child status while the signal handler is also accessing the same data structures. Use atomic operations or careful locking to coordinate between the signal handler and main program when updating session status.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect Window Size Propagation</strong></p>\n<p>Terminal applications rely on accurate window size information obtained through the <code>TIOCGWINSZ</code> ioctl. When the real terminal is resized, this information must be propagated to all PTY sessions, and child processes must be notified via <code>SIGWINCH</code> signals.</p>\n<p>The multiplexer should install a <code>SIGWINCH</code> handler that updates the window size for all active PTY sessions using the <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl on each master file descriptor. The kernel automatically delivers <code>SIGWINCH</code> to child processes when their controlling terminal size changes, so no explicit signal sending is required.</p>\n<p>Failure to propagate size changes results in applications that format output for incorrect dimensions, leading to broken display layouts and poor user experience. Terminal-based editors and pagers are particularly sensitive to accurate size information.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking I/O in Event Loop</strong></p>\n<p>Using blocking I/O operations when reading from PTY master file descriptors can cause the entire multiplexer to hang when one shell produces no output. This destroys the multiplexer&#39;s responsiveness and makes it unusable for managing multiple sessions.</p>\n<p>All PTY I/O must be non-blocking, typically achieved by setting the <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> flag on master file descriptors and using <code>select()</code>, <code>poll()</code>, or similar mechanisms to determine when I/O operations can proceed without blocking.</p>\n<p>When <code>read()</code> returns <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, this indicates no data is currently available, not an error condition. The event loop should simply move on to check other file descriptors rather than retrying the read operation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Error Recovery</strong></p>\n<p>PTY operations can fail in various ways that require graceful handling rather than program termination. Common failure modes include PTY allocation failures (when the system runs out of PTY devices), child process exec failures, and I/O errors on master file descriptors.</p>\n<p>When PTY allocation fails, the session creation should return an appropriate error code rather than crashing. When child process execution fails, the parent should detect this condition (usually through immediate child termination) and clean up resources appropriately.</p>\n<p>I/O errors on master file descriptors often indicate that the child process has terminated and closed the slave device. This is a normal condition that should result in session cleanup rather than error propagation to the user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The PTY Manager implementation requires careful attention to system call ordering, error handling, and resource management.

id=\"terminal-emulator-component\">Terminal Emulator Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 2 (Terminal Emulation) - this section implements the core terminal emulation capabilities that parse escape sequences and maintain virtual screen buffers for each pane</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-display-interpreter\">Mental Model: The Display Interpreter</h3>\n<p>Understanding terminal emulation requires thinking of it as a specialized interpreter that translates a mixed stream of text and control codes into a two-dimensional display representation. Imagine you&#39;re a projectionist at an old movie theater who receives a continuous stream of film frames mixed with handwritten notes about projector settings. The film frames represent regular text characters that should appear on screen, while the handwritten notes are escape sequences that tell you to adjust the projector focus (cursor movement), change the lighting (text attributes), or switch reels (clear screen operations).</p>\n<p>Just as the projectionist must separate the film frames from the control notes and apply the settings appropriately, the terminal emulator must parse the incoming byte stream to distinguish between printable characters and escape sequences. The projectionist maintains a mental model of the current screen state - what&#39;s currently being displayed, where the focus is, what lighting settings are active - and updates this state based on both the film frames and control notes. Similarly, the terminal emulator maintains a virtual screen buffer that tracks every character position, cursor location, and text attributes, updating this representation as it processes the input stream.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that terminal emulation is fundamentally a <strong>stateful translation process</strong>. Unlike a simple text display that just shows characters as they arrive, a terminal emulator must maintain persistent state about cursor position, text attributes, scrolling regions, and screen contents. Each incoming byte might be part of a multi-byte escape sequence, requiring the emulator to buffer partial sequences until complete commands can be parsed and executed. This stateful nature means the terminal emulator serves as the authoritative source of truth about what each pane&#39;s display should look like at any given moment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"escape-sequence-parser\">Escape Sequence Parser</h3>\n<p>The escape sequence parser forms the core intelligence of the terminal emulator, responsible for distinguishing between regular text and control commands in the incoming byte stream. Modern terminal applications use ANSI escape sequences, which begin with the escape character (ASCII 27) followed by specific character patterns that encode commands for cursor movement, text formatting, and screen manipulation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/terminal-multiplexer/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fescape-sequence-parser.svg\" alt=\"Escape Sequence Parser State Machine\"></p>\n<p>The parser operates as a finite state machine that processes input bytes one at a time, transitioning between different parsing states based on the characters encountered. This approach handles the complexity of escape sequences that can span multiple bytes and include optional numeric parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Parser State Machine</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Current State</th>\n<th>Input Character</th>\n<th>Next State</th>\n<th>Action Taken</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Regular ASCII (32-126)</td>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Add character to screen buffer at cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Escape (27)</td>\n<td>ESCAPE</td>\n<td>Begin escape sequence, prepare parameter buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ESCAPE</td>\n<td>&#39;[&#39; (CSI introducer)</td>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Enter Control Sequence Introducer parsing mode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ESCAPE</td>\n<td>&#39;]&#39; (OSC introducer)</td>\n<td>OSC_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Enter Operating System Command parsing mode</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ESCAPE</td>\n<td>Any other char</td>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Execute single-character escape, return to normal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Digits (0-9)</td>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Accumulate numeric parameter value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>&#39;;&#39; (parameter separator)</td>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Store current parameter, prepare for next</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CSI_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Letter (A-Z, a-z)</td>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Execute CSI command with parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OSC_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Any char except BEL/ESC</td>\n<td>OSC_PARAMS</td>\n<td>Accumulate OSC string parameter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OSC_PARAMS</td>\n<td>BEL (7) or ESC+&#39;&#39;</td>\n<td>NORMAL</td>\n<td>Execute OSC command with string parameter</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The parser maintains several pieces of state to handle the complexity of escape sequence processing. The parameter buffer stores numeric values extracted from sequences like <code>\\033[2;5H</code> (move cursor to row 2, column 5), while the command buffer accumulates the complete escape sequence for logging and debugging purposes. The parser also tracks whether it&#39;s in the middle of parsing a multi-byte UTF-8 character, since Unicode characters can span 2-4 bytes and must be handled atomically.</p>\n<p><strong>Core Escape Sequence Types</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Sequence Pattern</th>\n<th>Command Type</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nA</code></td>\n<td>Cursor Up</td>\n<td>n = lines</td>\n<td>Move cursor up n lines (default 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nB</code></td>\n<td>Cursor Down</td>\n<td>n = lines</td>\n<td>Move cursor down n lines (default 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nC</code></td>\n<td>Cursor Right</td>\n<td>n = columns</td>\n<td>Move cursor right n columns (default 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nD</code></td>\n<td>Cursor Left</td>\n<td>n = columns</td>\n<td>Move cursor left n columns (default 1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[r;cH</code></td>\n<td>Cursor Position</td>\n<td>r = row, c = col</td>\n<td>Move cursor to absolute position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nJ</code></td>\n<td>Clear Display</td>\n<td>n = mode</td>\n<td>Clear screen (0=below, 1=above, 2=all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nK</code></td>\n<td>Clear Line</td>\n<td>n = mode</td>\n<td>Clear line (0=right, 1=left, 2=all)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[nm</code></td>\n<td>Set Attributes</td>\n<td>n = attr code</td>\n<td>Set text attributes (bold, color, etc.)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[s</code></td>\n<td>Save Cursor</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>Save current cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>\\033[u</code></td>\n<td>Restore Cursor</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>Restore previously saved cursor position</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: State Machine vs. Regular Expression Parser</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to parse complex, nested escape sequences with optional parameters and variable length</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Finite state machine with explicit state tracking</li>\n<li>Regular expression matching against buffered input</li>\n<li>Recursive descent parser with lookahead</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Finite state machine with byte-by-byte processing</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: State machine handles incomplete sequences gracefully, processes input in real-time without buffering requirements, and provides clear error recovery paths.

Network delays or PTY buffering can cause escape sequences to arrive in fragments, requiring the parser to suspend processing mid-sequence and resume when additional bytes arrive.

When the screen scrolls up (either due to newline characters when the cursor is on the bottom row, or explicit scroll escape sequences), the top line of the visible screen transfers to the bottom of the scrollback buffer.

Understanding these common pitfalls helps avoid bugs that may not surface during basic testing but cause problems with specific shell environments or terminal-based applications.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete UTF-8 Character Handling</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is treating each incoming byte as a complete character without considering UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. When UTF-8 characters arrive fragmented across multiple read operations from the PTY, the terminal emulator may attempt to display partial characters, resulting in corrupted text display or invalid character encoding.</p>\n<p>The error manifests when processing output from applications that generate Unicode text, particularly when the PTY buffer boundaries split multi-byte characters. For example, a 3-byte UTF-8 character might arrive as two bytes in one read() call and the final byte in the next call. Treating the first two bytes as separate characters corrupts both the incomplete character and subsequent display.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Implement a UTF-8 decoder state machine that buffers partial characters until complete sequences are received. Validate UTF-8 sequences and replace invalid encodings with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) rather than displaying garbage.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cursor Bounds Checking Inconsistencies</strong> </p>\n<p>Many implementations inconsistently handle cursor movement that would place the cursor outside the valid screen area. Some escape sequences should clamp cursor coordinates to valid ranges, while others should be ignored entirely, and the behavior often depends on terminal mode settings.</p>\n<p>The most common error is applying uniform bounds checking to all cursor operations. For example, absolute cursor positioning (<code>\\033[H</code>) should clamp coordinates to valid ranges, while relative movement (<code>\\033[A</code>) should stop at screen edges without wrapping. Additionally, some applications rely on cursor coordinates being preserved even when temporarily invalid, expecting the cursor to become visible again after screen resize or scroll operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Implement escape sequence specific bounds handling that matches the expected behavior of target terminal types (typically VT100/ANSI). Maintain separate &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; cursor positions when necessary, and carefully test with applications that use cursor positioning heavily (vim, emacs, htop).</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Escape Sequence Parameter Default Values</strong></p>\n<p>ANSI escape sequences often have optional parameters with specific default values when omitted. A frequent mistake is using zero as the default for all parameters, when many sequences use 1 as the default value (e.g., cursor movement distances).</p>\n<p>This error causes applications to behave incorrectly when they omit parameters and expect standard default behavior. For example, <code>\\033[A</code> (cursor up with no parameter) should move up one line, not zero lines. Similarly, <code>\\033[J</code> (clear screen) should clear from cursor to end when the parameter is omitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Implement parameter parsing that distinguishes between explicit zero values and missing parameters, applying the correct default value for each escape sequence type. Reference terminal documentation or existing implementations to verify default values for each supported sequence.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Screen Buffer Memory Management During Resize</strong></p>\n<p>Terminal resize operations require careful handling of existing screen content and scrollback history. Common errors include losing scrollback content, corrupting character data during buffer reallocation, or failing to update cursor positions relative to the new screen dimensions.</p>\n<p>When the terminal width changes, existing line content may need to be rewrapped to fit the new dimensions. Lines that were previously wrapped due to width constraints may need to be joined, while long lines may need new wrap points. Height changes affect how much scrollback content remains accessible and whether the cursor position remains valid.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Implement resize operations as atomic transactions that preserve content integrity. Save cursor position relative to content rather than absolute coordinates, handle line rewrapping carefully, and ensure scrollback content transfers correctly to new buffer structures.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Access</strong></p>\n<p>If the terminal emulator processes PTY input on a different thread from display rendering, race conditions can occur when the screen buffer is modified while being rendered. This leads to corrupted display output or crashes when render code accesses invalid memory.</p>\n<p>The issue is particularly problematic during high-throughput scenarios where PTY output arrives faster than the display can be updated. Without proper synchronization, render operations may see partially updated screen state or encounter buffer reallocations mid-render.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Use proper synchronization primitives (mutexes, read-write locks) to protect screen buffer access, or use a single-threaded event loop design that serializes all buffer modifications. If using separate threads, consider double-buffering techniques where updates occur on a background buffer that&#39;s atomically swapped during render operations.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Attribute State Persistence Across Operations</strong></p>\n<p>Terminal text attributes (bold, color, etc.) should persist across cursor movements and other non-printing operations, but many implementations incorrectly reset attributes during certain escape sequence processing. This causes applications that set formatting and then move the cursor to lose their formatting state.</p>\n<p>The error typically occurs in parsers that treat attribute-setting sequences as separate from cursor operations, rather than understanding that attribute state is global terminal state that persists until explicitly changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct approach</strong>: Maintain attribute state separately from cursor operations and screen content. Only modify attribute state when processing specific attribute-setting escape sequences (<code>\\033[m</code> and variations), and ensure that cursor movement, scrolling, and other operations preserve the current attribute state for subsequent character insertion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The terminal emulator component bridges parsed escape sequences and visual display, requiring careful attention to state management, performance, and compatibility. This implementation focuses on correctness and clarity while providing the necessary performance for real-time terminal applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology

implementing the terminal emulator component, verify correct operation with these tests:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Character Display</strong>: Run <code>echo &quot;Hello World&quot;</code> and confirm characters appear at correct cursor positions with proper advancement. Test UTF-8 characters with <code>echo &quot;Ñoël 中文&quot;</code> to verify multi-byte character handling.</p>\n<p><strong>Cursor Movement</strong>: Test cursor positioning with <code>printf &quot;\\033[5;10HTest&quot;</code> (should place &quot;Test&quot; at row 5, column 10). Verify bounds checking with coordinates outside screen area.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen Clearing</strong>: Test <code>clear</code> command or <code>printf &quot;\\033[2J&quot;</code> to verify screen clearing operation. Test line clearing with <code>printf &quot;\\033[K&quot;</code> at various cursor positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Text Attributes</strong>: Test color and formatting with <code>printf &quot;\\033[1;31mBold Red\\033[0m Normal&quot;</code>. Verify attribute persistence across cursor movements.</p>\n<p><strong>High-throughput Output</strong>: Test with <code>cat /dev/urandom | hexdump -C</code> or similar to verify parser handles rapid escape sequence streams without corruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs of Problems</strong>: Characters appearing in wrong positions indicate cursor logic errors. Corrupted display during rapid output suggests parser state machine issues. Missing colors/attributes indicate attribute handling problems. Crashes during UTF-8 text suggest character decoder issues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"window-manager-component\">Window Manager Component</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 3 (Window Management) - this section implements the pane splitting, layout calculation, and multi-pane rendering capabilities that allow multiple shell sessions to share screen real estate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-space-organizer\">Mental Model: The Space Organizer</h3>\n<p>Understanding the window manager component requires thinking about it as a sophisticated space organizer, similar to how a building architect divides floor space among different rooms and tenants. Just as an architect must efficiently partition a fixed building footprint among competing space requirements while maintaining proper circulation and structural integrity, the window manager must dynamically partition the finite terminal screen real estate among multiple competing shell sessions while maintaining usable dimensions and clear visual separation.</p>\n<p>Consider the analogy of a newspaper layout editor working on a fixed page size. The editor receives requests for different article spaces—some need wide columns for text, others need square regions for photos, and advertisements demand specific aspect ratios. The editor must split the available page space using horizontal and vertical dividers, ensuring each allocated region meets minimum size requirements while maximizing space utilization. When new content arrives, existing allocations must be resized to make room, but no region can shrink below its minimum viable dimensions.</p>\n<p>The window manager operates under similar constraints with additional complexity. Unlike a static newspaper layout, the terminal window manager must handle dynamic changes—new panes appear when users split existing ones, panes disappear when shells exit, users actively resize regions, and the entire terminal window itself may change size when the user resizes their terminal emulator. Each pane contains a living shell session that expects a consistent rectangular screen area and becomes confused if its dimensions change unexpectedly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: The window manager&#39;s primary responsibility is maintaining the illusion that each shell session has its own dedicated terminal, while actually coordinating shared access to a single physical terminal display. This requires careful synchronization between logical pane boundaries and the actual character grid positions where each pane&#39;s content appears.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The space organization challenge becomes particularly complex because terminal displays operate on discrete character cell boundaries rather than pixel coordinates. A pane cannot be positioned at arbitrary screen coordinates—it must align to character boundaries and have dimensions measured in complete character cells. This discretization constraint means resize operations often involve distributing leftover space or adjusting multiple panes simultaneously to accommodate the character grid limitations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pane-layout-algorithm\">Pane Layout Algorithm</h3>\n<p>The window manager implements a hierarchical space partitioning system based on a binary tree data structure called the layout tree. Each node in the layout tree represents either a concrete pane containing a shell session or an abstract split that divides space between two child regions. This tree structure naturally models the recursive splitting behavior users expect—split a window horizontally, then split one of the resulting halves vertically, then split one of those quarters horizontally again.</p>\n<p>The fundamental layout data structure is the <code>layout_node_t</code>, which serves dual purposes depending on its type.

Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid frustrating debugging sessions and ensures robust operation across diverse terminal environments.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect PTY Size Propagation</strong></p>\n<p>Many developers forget that splitting a pane requires updating the PTY dimensions for the affected shell sessions. When a pane&#39;s screen dimensions change due to splitting or resizing, the associated PTY must be notified via the <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl call, otherwise the shell process continues to believe it has the old terminal dimensions.</p>\n<p>This manifests as applications within the pane formatting their output for incorrect line widths, causing text to wrap unexpectedly or leaving blank space. Text editors become particularly confused and may display content incorrectly or crash when their assumed terminal size doesn&#39;t match the actual available space.</p>\n<p>The fix requires calling <code>pty_session_resize()</code> immediately after any layout calculation that changes pane dimensions. The resize notification must occur before any new output appears in the pane to ensure the shell process updates its internal state correctly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Border Character Coordinate Confusion</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake involves failing to account for border character space when calculating usable pane content areas. Developers often calculate pane positions correctly but forget that border characters consume screen real estate, leading to content overflow into adjacent panes or border characters.</p>\n<p>For example, a pane positioned at (5, 10) with dimensions 20x8 actually has usable content space from (6, 11) to (23, 16) due to the border characters around the perimeter. Applications that ignore this adjustment will overwrite border characters or have their content clipped unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>The solution involves maintaining separate calculations for pane layout coordinates (including borders) and content coordinates (excluding borders). Always subtract 2 from both width and height when configuring PTY dimensions, and offset content positioning by +1 in both x and y directions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Floating Point Split Ratio Precision</strong></p>\n<p>Using floating point arithmetic for split ratios can introduce subtle rounding errors that accumulate during resize operations. When a user resizes the terminal window multiple times, small precision errors can cause pane dimensions to drift from their intended proportions.</p>\n<p>This problem becomes particularly evident when users expect symmetric layouts (50/50 splits) but observe that repeated resize operations gradually make one pane larger than the other. The accumulated error eventually becomes visible and violates user expectations about layout behavior.</p>\n<p>The fix involves implementing split ratio normalization that periodically adjusts ratios to eliminate accumulated errors. Additionally, using fixed-point arithmetic or rational number representation for split ratios can eliminate floating point precision issues entirely.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-Pane Updates</strong></p>\n<p>When multiple PTY sessions generate output simultaneously, race conditions can occur during screen buffer updates and rendering. Without proper synchronization, the window manager might read partially updated screen buffers or composite inconsistent pane states into the final output.</p>\n<p>This manifests as visual glitches where panes display mixed content from different time points, or rendering artifacts where border characters disappear temporarily. The problem becomes more severe under heavy output load when multiple shell sessions are active simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The solution requires implementing proper locking around screen buffer updates and ensuring that the rendering pipeline operates on consistent snapshots of all pane states. Consider using a double-buffering approach where PTY output updates a background buffer while rendering operates on a stable foreground buffer.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Layout Tree Operations</strong></p>\n<p>Layout tree manipulation, particularly node insertion and deletion during pane creation and destruction, often introduces memory leaks if not handled carefully. When a pane closes, its layout node must be removed from the tree, but developers frequently forget to properly deallocate the node structure or update parent pointers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when the last remaining pane in a split closes, the split node becomes redundant and should be removed to prevent tree degeneration. Failing to clean up these unnecessary nodes causes memory usage to grow over time and can lead to degraded layout calculation performance.</p>\n<p>The fix requires implementing careful tree cleanup logic that recursively removes unnecessary split nodes and properly deallocates all associated memory. Consider using reference counting or garbage collection techniques to ensure proper cleanup of complex tree structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls

Just like a traffic controller must decide whether to direct each car to continue straight through the intersection or pull them aside for inspection, the Input Handler must decide what to do with each keystroke that arrives from the user&#39;s keyboard.</p>\n<p>Most keystrokes are like regular traffic - they should flow straight through to the active pane&#39;s shell process without any interference. When you type <code>ls -la</code> in your shell, those characters need to reach the shell process as quickly and transparently as possible, just like most cars need to flow through the intersection without stopping.</p>\n<p>However, some keystrokes are special - they&#39;re like emergency vehicles that need different treatment. When the user presses the prefix key (typically Ctrl-b, similar to tmux), it&#39;s like an ambulance arriving at the intersection. The traffic controller must immediately recognize this special vehicle and route it to the appropriate emergency facility rather than letting it continue with normal traffic.</p>\n<p>The Input Handler operates in two distinct modes, much like a traffic intersection can switch between normal flow and emergency response mode. In <strong>normal mode</strong>, keystrokes flow directly to the active pane&#39;s PTY master file descriptor, where they&#39;re forwarded to the shell process. The Input Handler acts as a transparent conduit, adding minimal latency to the user&#39;s typing experience.</p>\n<p>In <strong>command mode</strong>, triggered by the prefix key, the Input Handler temporarily stops forwarding input to the shell and instead interprets keystrokes as multiplexer commands. This is like the traffic controller holding all normal traffic while they coordinate the emergency response. During this time, keys like &#39;h&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;l&#39; become navigation commands to switch between panes, &#39;&quot;&#39; becomes a horizontal split command, and &#39;%&#39; becomes a vertical split command.</p>\n<p>The critical insight here is that the Input Handler must maintain <strong>context awareness</strong> - it needs to know not just what key was pressed, but also what state the multiplexer is currently in. Just like a traffic controller must track whether they&#39;re in normal mode or emergency mode, the Input Handler tracks whether it&#39;s in normal input mode or command mode. This state determines the entire interpretation and routing of subsequent input.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Input Handler&#39;s dual-mode operation creates a clean separation between user interaction with the multiplexer itself versus user interaction with the shell processes running inside panes. This separation is essential for maintaining the illusion that each pane contains an independent terminal session.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"key-binding-system\">Key Binding System</h3>\n<p>The <strong>key binding system</strong> forms the core of user interaction with the terminal multiplexer, translating raw keyboard input into multiplexer commands and routing decisions. This system must handle the complexity of distinguishing between input intended for the multiplexer versus input intended for the shell processes running in individual panes.</p>\n<p>The system operates around a <strong>prefix key mechanism</strong>, borrowed from established multiplexers like tmux and screen. The prefix key acts as an escape sequence that signals the transition from normal input mode to command mode. When the user presses the prefix key (typically Ctrl-b), the Input Handler captures this keystroke and enters a temporary command interpretation state where the next keystroke will be interpreted as a multiplexer command rather than shell input.</p>\n<h4 id=\"prefix-key-state-management\">Prefix Key State Management</h4>\n<p>The prefix key implementation requires careful state tracking to handle timing and multi-keystroke sequences correctly. The Input Handler maintains a prefix state that transitions through several phases during command processing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Next Keystroke Handling</th>\n<th>Timeout Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>PREFIX_INACTIVE</code></td>\n<td>Normal input mode, keys route to active pane</td>\n<td>Standard shell input forwarding</td>\n<td>No timeout active</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>PREFIX_DETECTED</code></td>\n<td>Prefix key pressed, awaiting command key</td>\n<td>Interpret as multiplexer command</td>\n<td>Reset to inactive after 500ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>PREFIX_CONSUMING</code></td>\n<td>Processing multi-key command sequence</td>\n<td>Continue command sequence parsing</td>\n<td>Extend timeout for sequence completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>PREFIX_INVALID</code></td>\n<td>Invalid command sequence detected</td>\n<td>Return to normal mode, may echo error</td>\n<td>Reset immediately to inactive</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The prefix key detection logic must handle several edge cases that commonly trip up implementations. First, the prefix key combination (such as Ctrl-b) generates a specific byte sequence that must be distinguished from other control sequences. The implementation cannot simply check for the ASCII value 2 (Ctrl-b) because this same byte might appear as part of a legitimate escape sequence being sent to a shell program.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Prefix Key Timeout Mechanism</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: After detecting a prefix key, the system must decide how long to wait for the subsequent command key before reverting to normal mode</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: No timeout (wait indefinitely), short timeout (100-200ms), medium timeout (500ms), long timeout (1-2 seconds)</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: 500ms timeout with configurable override</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: 500ms provides enough time for deliberate command entry without leaving the system in command mode if user accidentally hits prefix key.

Immediate commands execute directly upon pressing the command key, providing fast access to common operations like pane switching and splitting. Extended commands, triggered by keys like &#39;:&#39;, enter a sub-mode where the user can type longer command sequences with arguments.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multi-key-command-sequences\">Multi-Key Command Sequences</h4>\n<p>Some multiplexer operations require more complex input than a single command key can provide. <strong>Multi-key command sequences</strong> handle operations that need additional parameters or confirmation, such as pane resizing with specific dimensions or window renaming with custom text.</p>\n<p>The multi-key system extends the prefix state machine to handle <strong>command continuation states</strong>. When a command key indicates that additional input is required, the Input Handler transitions to a specialized parsing mode that interprets subsequent keystrokes according to the specific command&#39;s requirements.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Command Sequence</th>\n<th>State Progression</th>\n<th>Input Interpretation</th>\n<th>Completion Trigger</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Resize pane</td>\n<td>PREFIX_DETECTED → RESIZE_MODE</td>\n<td>Arrow keys adjust dimensions</td>\n<td>Enter key or timeout</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rename window</td>\n<td>PREFIX_DETECTED → TEXT_INPUT</td>\n<td>Alphanumeric characters build name</td>\n<td>Enter key or Escape</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goto window</td>\n<td>PREFIX_DETECTED → NUMBER_INPUT</td>\n<td>Digits build window index</td>\n<td>Enter key or invalid digit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copy mode</td>\n<td>PREFIX_DETECTED → COPY_MODE</td>\n<td>Vi-style navigation commands</td>\n<td>&#39;q&#39; key or Escape</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Multi-key sequences require <strong>input validation</strong> at each step to provide immediate feedback when users enter invalid commands or parameters. The validation logic must distinguish between incomplete input (where more keystrokes are expected) and invalid input (where the current sequence cannot be completed).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Command Key Modifier Support</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Users may want to use modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) in combination with command keys to expand the available command vocabulary</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: No modifiers (single keys only), Ctrl combinations, Alt combinations, all modifier combinations</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Support Ctrl combinations for extended commands, avoid Alt due to terminal compatibility issues</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Ctrl combinations are reliably detected across terminal types and provide sufficient expansion of command space.

In normal terminal operation, the terminal driver performs significant input and output processing, including line buffering, echo handling, and signal generation for control characters like Ctrl-C. A terminal multiplexer must bypass this processing to gain direct access to all keyboard input, including control sequences and special keys.</p>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-mode-transitions\">Terminal Mode Transitions</h4>\n<p>The transition between normal and raw terminal modes involves manipulating the <strong>terminal attributes</strong> through the <code>termios</code> interface.

Understanding these common pitfalls and their solutions is essential for building a robust multiplexer.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Restoration</strong></p>\n<p>Many implementations fail to properly restore terminal attributes when the multiplexer exits, leaving the terminal in raw mode. This makes the terminal unusable because input characters are no longer echoed and line editing features don&#39;t work.</p>\n<p>The root cause typically involves missing restoration in signal handlers or failing to handle unexpected exit paths. When a user presses Ctrl-C or the system sends SIGTERM, the multiplexer may exit without executing normal cleanup code. The terminal remains in raw mode because no code ran to restore the original <code>termios</code> attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: After multiplexer exit, typing characters in the terminal produces no visible output, and pressing Enter doesn&#39;t execute commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement restoration in multiple places: normal exit paths, signal handlers, and <code>atexit()</code> registered functions. Use a global flag to track whether restoration has already occurred to prevent double-restoration issues.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// Implementation Guidance will show the complete restoration pattern</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Signal Forwarding to Wrong Process Group</strong></p>\n<p>A common error involves sending signals directly to individual shell processes rather than their process groups. This causes problems when shells spawn child processes (like running <code>vim</code> or <code>make</code>), because the signals only reach the shell itself, not the currently running foreground job.</p>\n<p>This happens because developers often store only the shell&#39;s process ID from the <code>fork()</code> call and use it directly with <code>kill()</code>. However, terminals normally send signals to process groups using negative PIDs, ensuring all related processes receive the signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: Pressing Ctrl-C in a pane only interrupts the shell but not programs running within the shell. For example, a long-running <code>grep</code> command continues running even after Ctrl-C.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Use negative PIDs with <code>kill()</code> to send signals to process groups, and ensure each PTY session establishes its own process group using <code>setsid()</code> in the child process.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: UTF-8 Sequence Fragmentation</strong></p>\n<p>Raw terminal input can fragment multi-byte UTF-8 characters across multiple read operations, especially under system load or with network-based terminals. Implementations that process bytes individually without buffering incomplete sequences will misinterpret UTF-8 characters as multiple invalid single-byte characters.</p>\n<p>This creates visual corruption when users type non-ASCII characters, and can desynchronize the input parser when UTF-8 fragments are misinterpreted as escape sequence components.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: Non-ASCII characters appear as question marks or random symbols, especially when typing quickly or during system load.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement UTF-8 sequence buffering that accumulates bytes until a complete Unicode codepoint is assembled. The parser should track the expected length of multi-byte sequences and defer processing until all bytes arrive.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Escape Sequence State Confusion</strong></p>\n<p>Input parsers often fail to handle escape sequences that arrive fragmented or interleaved with other input. For example, the up arrow key generates the sequence <code>\\e[A</code>, but this might arrive as separate reads of <code>\\e</code>, <code>[</code>, and <code>A</code>. If other input arrives between these bytes, the parser can lose synchronization.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some applications send escape sequences that the multiplexer doesn&#39;t recognize, leading to parser state corruption where subsequent input is misinterpreted.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: Special keys like arrows occasionally don&#39;t work, or typing immediately after pressing special keys produces incorrect characters in the shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement a robust state machine with timeout-based recovery. If an escape sequence doesn&#39;t complete within a reasonable time (typically 50-100ms), treat accumulated bytes as separate characters and reset parser state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Command Mode State Leakage</strong></p>\n<p>Implementations sometimes fail to properly exit command mode when errors occur or when users press unexpected keys. This leaves the multiplexer stuck in command mode, where all subsequent input is interpreted as multiplexer commands rather than shell input.</p>\n<p>This typically happens when the command key handler encounters an invalid command but doesn&#39;t reset the prefix state, or when multi-key sequences are interrupted by unexpected input.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: After pressing the prefix key and making a mistake, all subsequent typing is ignored by the shell, and characters like &#39;h&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, &#39;k&#39;, &#39;l&#39; switch between panes instead of appearing as shell input.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement explicit state reset logic in all command processing paths, including error paths and timeout handlers. Any unrecognized command should immediately return to normal mode with appropriate error feedback.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Terminal Size Propagation Failures</strong></p>\n<p>When terminal window resizing occurs, the multiplexer must update the PTY sizes for all sessions to reflect the new dimensions. Implementations often miss this step or update only the currently active pane, causing programs in other panes to have incorrect assumptions about terminal size.</p>\n<p>This creates display corruption in programs that use full-screen interfaces like <code>vim</code>, <code>less</code>, or <code>htop</code>, which rely on accurate terminal dimensions for screen layout.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection</strong>: After resizing the terminal window, full-screen programs in inactive panes have incorrect display layout with text wrapping at wrong positions or status bars in wrong locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Handle <code>SIGWINCH</code> signals by updating PTY dimensions for all sessions using the <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl, not just the active pane. Also send <code>SIGWINCH</code> to all child process groups to notify programs of the size change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The Input Handler bridges the gap between raw terminal input and structured multiplexer commands, requiring careful integration of several low-level Unix interfaces. This implementation guidance provides complete starter code for terminal mode management and skeleton code for the core input processing logic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technology-recommendations\">Technology Recommendations</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced Option</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Terminal Control</td>\n<td><code>termios.h</code> with basic flags</td>\n<td><code>termios.h</code> with full attribute management</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handling</td>\n<td>Basic <code>signal()</code> registration</td>\n<td>Advanced <code>sigaction()</code> with masks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Parsing</td>\n<td>Character-by-character state machine</td>\n<td>Buffered parsing with lookahead</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTF-8 Support</td>\n<td>Basic ASCII-only implementation</td>\n<td>Full Unicode with <code>wchar.h</code> support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key Bindings</td>\n<td>Static array of command mappings</td>\n<td>Dynamic hash table with user configuration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"recommended-file-structure\">Recommended File Structure</h4>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">src</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">/</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  input</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">/</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    input_handler.h          ← public interface and types</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    input_handler.c          ← main input processing logic  </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    terminal_mode.c          ← raw mode management</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    key_bindings.c           ← command key mapping and prefix handling</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    utf8_decoder.c           ← UTF</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">-</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">8</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> sequence processing</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    escape_parser.c          ← escape sequence state machine</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  multiplexer.c              ← main event loop integration</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  tests</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">/</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    test_input_handler.c     ← unit tests </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">for</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> input processing</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    test_terminal_mode.c     ← terminal mode transition tests</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"complete-terminal-mode-management-code\">Complete Terminal Mode Management Code</h4>\n<p>This infrastructure handles the critical terminal mode transitions and restoration logic.

describes how components orchestrate together to create a functioning terminal multiplexer, building on PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-orchestra-conductor\">Mental Model: The Orchestra Conductor</h3>\n<p>Think of the terminal multiplexer&#39;s main event loop as an orchestra conductor coordinating multiple musicians. Just as a conductor listens for cues from different sections and coordinates their timing to create harmonious music, the event loop listens for input from multiple sources (PTY sessions, user keyboard, terminal resize signals) and orchestrates their processing to create a seamless user experience. The conductor doesn&#39;t play every instrument—instead, it routes information between specialists (PTY manager for process communication, terminal emulator for display rendering, window manager for layout) while maintaining perfect timing and synchronization.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that a terminal multiplexer is fundamentally an <strong>event-driven system</strong> where multiple asynchronous data sources must be coordinated without blocking. Unlike a simple shell that processes one command at a time, our multiplexer must simultaneously handle output from multiple shell sessions, user input, terminal resize events, and child process termination—all while maintaining responsive user interaction and consistent display state.</p>\n<h3 id=\"main-event-loop\">Main Event Loop</h3>\n<p>The <strong>main event loop</strong> forms the beating heart of the terminal multiplexer, using <code>select()</code>-based I/O multiplexing to handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously without blocking. This approach allows the multiplexer to remain responsive to user input while processing output from multiple PTY sessions and handling system events.</p>\n<p>The event loop operates on a <strong>unified file descriptor set</strong> that includes the standard input for user keyboard input, all active PTY master file descriptors for shell session output, and a signal file descriptor for handling terminal resize and child process termination events. The <code>select()</code> system call blocks until at least one file descriptor becomes ready for reading, at which point the loop processes all ready descriptors before returning to wait for the next events.</p>\n<h4 id=\"event-loop-architecture\">Event Loop Architecture</h4>\n<p>The event loop maintains several critical data structures to track active file descriptors and their associated processing handlers. The main loop uses a <code>fd_set</code> structure for the <code>select()</code> call, with parallel arrays mapping file descriptor numbers to their corresponding pane identifiers and processing functions. This design enables efficient dispatch of I/O events to the appropriate component handlers without linear searches or complex lookup structures.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>File Descriptors</th>\n<th>Event Types</th>\n<th>Processing Handler</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>User Input</td>\n<td>STDIN_FILENO (0)</td>\n<td>Keyboard input, special keys</td>\n<td><code>input_handler_process_input()</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PTY Sessions</td>\n<td>master_fd for each pane</td>\n<td>Shell output, process termination</td>\n<td><code>pty_session_read()</code> → <code>escape_parser_process_byte()</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handler</td>\n<td>signalfd or pipe</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD, SIGWINCH</td>\n<td>Signal dispatch to appropriate component</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Timer Events</td>\n<td>timerfd (optional)</td>\n<td>Prefix key timeout, rendering throttle</td>\n<td>Timeout-based state transitions</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"event-processing-pipeline\">Event Processing Pipeline</h4>\n<p>The event loop follows a structured processing pipeline that ensures consistent ordering and prevents race conditions between different event types. The pipeline prioritizes signal events (like child process termination) over I/O events to ensure system state remains consistent before processing new data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Signal Event Processing</strong>: Handle <code>SIGCHLD</code> for child process termination and <code>SIGWINCH</code> for terminal resize events before processing any I/O, ensuring system state consistency.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>User Input Processing</strong>: Process keyboard input from stdin, routing through the input handler&#39;s prefix key detection and command mode logic to determine routing destination.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>PTY Output Processing</strong>: Read data from all ready PTY master file descriptors, feeding the raw bytes through the terminal emulator&#39;s escape sequence parser to update screen buffers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Screen Composition</strong>: After processing all input events, determine if any panes need redrawing based on their <code>needs_redraw</code> flags and compose the final terminal output.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Terminal Output</strong>: Write the composed frame to stdout using a single write operation to minimize terminal flickering and ensure atomic display updates.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Insight</strong>: The event loop processes ALL ready file descriptors in each iteration before composing output, rather than rendering after each individual PTY read. This batching approach prevents excessive screen updates when multiple panes have simultaneous output, significantly improving performance and reducing visual artifacts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"file-descriptor-management\">File Descriptor Management</h4>\n<p>The event loop must dynamically manage its file descriptor set as panes are created and destroyed during the multiplexer session. When a new pane is created, its PTY master file descriptor is added to the <code>select()</code> set and the corresponding mapping tables are updated. When a pane is closed, the file descriptor is removed from the set and its entry in the mapping tables is cleared.</p>\n<p>The event loop maintains a <strong>maximum file descriptor tracker</strong> to optimize the <code>select()</code> call, since <code>select()</code> requires specifying the highest-numbered file descriptor plus one. This value is recalculated whenever file descriptors are added or removed, ensuring efficient operation even with sparse file descriptor numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">typedef</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> struct</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">    fd_set read_fds;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    int</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> max_fd;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    int</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> pane_fd_map</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[MAX_PANES];</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">     // Maps fd to pane_id</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    int</span><span style=\"color:#FFAB70\"> fd_pane_map</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">[FD_SETSIZE];</span><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">    // Maps pane_id to fd</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">    window_manager_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> window_manager;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">    input_handler_t</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">*</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> input_handler;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">    bool</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> shutdown_requested;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">} </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">event_loop_t</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"error-handling-and-recovery\">Error Handling and Recovery</h4>\n<p>The event loop implements robust error handling for file descriptor failures, including <code>EAGAIN</code> for temporary unavailability, <code>EBADF</code> for invalid file descriptors (indicating closed PTY sessions), and <code>EINTR</code> for interrupted system calls.

This approach simplifies reasoning about data flow and makes the system more testable and debuggable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"event-flow-coordination\">Event Flow Coordination</h4>\n<p>The multiplexer implements <strong>event flow coordination</strong> to ensure that related events are processed in the correct order and that component state remains consistent.

The PTY is closed before layout updates to prevent the event loop from attempting to read from a closed file descriptor, and layout updates complete before rendering to ensure consistent display state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"state-synchronization\">State Synchronization</h3>\n<p>Maintaining consistent state across components presents one of the most challenging aspects of terminal multiplexer implementation. The system must coordinate <strong>distributed state</strong> including pane focus, terminal attributes, layout dimensions, and process lifecycle while handling asynchronous events that can affect multiple components simultaneously.</p>\n<h4 id=\"focus-management\">Focus Management</h4>\n<p><strong>Focus state</strong> determines which pane receives user input and affects visual rendering through focus highlighting. The focus management system must coordinate between the input handler (which routes keystrokes), window manager (which renders focus indicators), and event loop (which handles focus change commands).</p>\n<p>The window manager maintains the <strong>canonical focus state</strong> through its <code>active_pane_id</code> field, with other components querying this authoritative source rather than maintaining duplicate state. Focus changes trigger a coordinated update sequence that ensures all components reflect the new focus state consistently.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus Change Protocol</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Step</th>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>State Update</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Input Handler</td>\n<td>Detects focus change command (arrow keys after prefix)</td>\n<td>None - validation only</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Window Manager</td>\n<td>Validates target pane exists and is reachable</td>\n<td>Updates <code>active_pane_id</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Window Manager</td>\n<td>Marks old and new focus panes for redraw</td>\n<td>Sets <code>needs_redraw</code> flags</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Event Loop</td>\n<td>Triggers rendering cycle</td>\n<td>Coordinates screen composition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Rendering System</td>\n<td>Updates focus highlighting in terminal output</td>\n<td>Visual focus indicators</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-size-synchronization\">Terminal Size Synchronization</h4>\n<p>Terminal size changes affect multiple components and require careful coordination to maintain consistent state.

This confuses users and makes debugging difficult. Always update the canonical focus state first, then propagate updates to all dependent components in dependency order.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Size Propagation</strong>\nFailing to propagate terminal size changes to all PTY sessions causes shell programs to render output for the old terminal size, leading to display corruption and line wrapping issues. Ensure that every active PTY receives a <code>TIOCSWINSZ</code> ioctl with the new dimensions before processing any new output from shell sessions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Stale File Descriptor Mappings</strong>\nWhen panes are destroyed, developers often forget to update the file descriptor mapping tables used by the event loop, causing the <code>select()</code> call to continue monitoring closed file descriptors. This leads to busy loops and resource leaks. Always update both the <code>fd_set</code> for <code>select()</code> and the mapping arrays when adding or removing PTY file descriptors.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Event Loop</strong>\nIncluding blocking system calls (like <code>sleep()</code> or blocking I/O) in the event loop prevents the multiplexer from responding to other events, causing apparent hangs and poor responsiveness. Use non-blocking alternatives and timeout-based <code>select()</code> calls to maintain responsiveness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4

failure modes and recovery strategies that span PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-safety-net\">Mental Model: The Safety Net</h3>\n<p>Think of error handling in a terminal multiplexer like designing safety systems for an aircraft. Just as an airplane has multiple backup systems for navigation, power, and control surfaces, a terminal multiplexer must gracefully handle failures in any of its critical subsystems. When the primary navigation system fails, the pilot doesn&#39;t crash—they switch to backup instruments and continue flying. Similarly, when a child process dies or a PTY fails, the multiplexer must detect the failure, isolate the damage, and maintain operation for other panes while gracefully handling the affected session.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that terminal multiplexers manage multiple independent sessions that should remain isolated from each other&#39;s failures. A crash in one shell session should not bring down the entire multiplexer or affect other running sessions. This requires defensive programming, graceful degradation, and robust cleanup procedures that ensure the terminal is always restored to a usable state, even during catastrophic failures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pty-and-process-failures\">PTY and Process Failures</h3>\n<p>Process and PTY management represents the most critical failure domain in terminal multiplexers because child processes can terminate unexpectedly, PTY allocation can fail under resource pressure, and pipe communication can break due to system limits or process crashes. These failures must be detected quickly and handled gracefully to maintain session isolation and prevent resource leaks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"child-process-termination-detection\">Child Process Termination Detection</h4>\n<p>The most common failure mode occurs when shell processes or their children terminate unexpectedly due to signals, crashes, or normal exit. The multiplexer must detect these terminations promptly and update its internal state accordingly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: SIGCHLD-Based Process Monitoring</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to detect child process termination without blocking main event loop</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Polling with waitpid(WNOHANG), synchronous waitpid() calls, SIGCHLD signal handler</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use SIGCHLD signal handler with self-pipe trick for integration with select()</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Signal handler provides immediate notification without polling overhead, self-pipe makes it compatible with select()-based event loop</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires careful signal handler implementation and proper cleanup of zombie processes</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Process Termination Scenario</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Required Actions</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Normal shell exit</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD signal</td>\n<td>Update session status, close PTY, mark pane as terminated</td>\n<td>Display exit message, allow pane closure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shell crash (SIGSEGV)</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD signal</td>\n<td>Log crash reason, cleanup PTY resources</td>\n<td>Show crash notification, restart shell option</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Killed by user (SIGKILL)</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD signal</td>\n<td>Immediate cleanup, no graceful shutdown</td>\n<td>Close pane, update layout if needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Child process orphan</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD signal</td>\n<td>Reap zombie, maintain session</td>\n<td>Continue normal operation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process group termination</td>\n<td>Multiple SIGCHLD</td>\n<td>Cleanup all related processes</td>\n<td>Close affected panes, rebuild layout</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The process termination handler must safely reap zombie processes while maintaining accurate session state.

The multiplexer must call waitpid() for every SIGCHLD signal received, even if multiple children exit simultaneously.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks</strong>\nFailing to close both master and slave PTY file descriptors when sessions terminate leads to file descriptor exhaustion. Each pty_session_t must track both file descriptors and ensure they are closed in all exit paths, including error conditions.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Race Condition in Process Cleanup</strong>\nAccessing pty_session_t structures from both signal handlers and main event loop creates race conditions. Use the self-pipe trick to defer all PTY session updates to the main event loop context.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Ignoring Process Group Signals</strong>\nWhen users send signals like SIGTERM to the multiplexer, these must be forwarded to all child processes. Failing to properly manage process groups can leave orphaned shell processes running after the multiplexer exits.</p>\n<h3 id=\"terminal-and-display-errors\">Terminal and Display Errors</h3>\n<p>Terminal and display errors encompass failures in escape sequence parsing, screen buffer management, and terminal size handling. These errors can corrupt the display state, cause rendering artifacts, or desynchronize the virtual screen from the physical terminal.</p>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-size-change-handling\">Terminal Size Change Handling</h4>\n<p>Terminal resize events represent one of the most complex error scenarios because they require coordinated updates across multiple components while maintaining visual consistency.

Always clamp cursor positions to valid screen bounds.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: UTF-8 Boundary Errors</strong>\nWhen UTF-8 sequences span multiple read() calls, incomplete sequences can corrupt character display or cause parser state confusion. Buffer incomplete UTF-8 sequences until complete codepoints can be decoded.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Attribute State Leakage</strong>\nFailing to properly reset terminal attributes when switching between panes can cause formatting to leak between sessions. Each pane must maintain independent attribute state in its screen_buffer_t.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resize During Output</strong>\nTerminal resize events that occur while processing escape sequences can cause coordinate calculations to use inconsistent screen dimensions. Cache screen dimensions at the start of escape sequence processing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleanup-and-exit-procedures\">Cleanup and Exit Procedures</h3>\n<p>Proper cleanup and exit procedures ensure that the terminal multiplexer can shutdown gracefully under all conditions, restoring terminal settings and cleaning up system resources even during abnormal termination scenarios. This represents the final safety net that prevents the multiplexer from leaving the user&#39;s terminal in an unusable state.</p>\n<h4 id=\"terminal-state-restoration\">Terminal State Restoration</h4>\n<p>Terminal state restoration is the most critical cleanup operation because failure to restore original terminal attributes can leave the user&#39;s terminal in raw mode, making it unusable for normal shell interaction.

Design all cleanup functions to be safely callable multiple times by checking resource validity before cleanup.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Cleanup Function Complexity</strong>\nComplex cleanup operations in signal handlers can cause deadlocks or crashes because signal handlers have limited safe function availability. Keep signal handler cleanup minimal and defer complex operations to atexit() handlers when possible.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Restoration</strong>\nOnly restoring some terminal attributes (like canonical mode) while forgetting others (like echo settings) can leave the terminal in an inconsistent state. Always restore the complete original_termios structure captured at startup.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Child Process Leakage</strong>\nForgetting to send termination signals to child processes before exiting can leave shell processes running as orphans that consume system resources. Always send SIGTERM to all process groups before final cleanup.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Resource Cleanup Ordering</strong>\nCleaning up resources in the wrong order can cause cascading failures, such as freeing memory before closing file descriptors that reference it.

Strategy</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - this section provides comprehensive testing approaches that verify PTY functionality (M1), terminal emulation accuracy (M2), window management behavior (M3), and input handling (M4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-quality-assurance-laboratory\">Mental Model: The Quality Assurance Laboratory</h3>\n<p>Think of testing a terminal multiplexer like running a quality assurance laboratory for a complex manufacturing process. Just as a manufacturing QA lab has different testing stations - component testing benches that verify individual parts, integration test beds that validate assembled products, and final inspection checkpoints that ensure the complete product meets specifications - our terminal multiplexer testing strategy operates at multiple levels of granularity and scope.</p>\n<p>The component unit tests are like individual testing stations that verify each subsystem in isolation - the escape sequence parser, the layout calculator, the PTY session manager. These tests use controlled inputs and verify precise outputs without external dependencies. The integration tests are like the assembly line test beds that verify how components work together - real shell processes generating terminal output, actual PTY devices handling I/O, complete pane rendering pipelines. The milestone verification checkpoints are like the final inspection stations that validate the complete multiplexer behavior against user requirements.</p>\n<p>This multi-layered testing approach ensures we catch different categories of defects at the appropriate level - logic errors in individual components, interface mismatches between components, and behavior gaps in the complete system. Each layer serves a specific diagnostic purpose and provides different types of confidence in system correctness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-unit-tests\">Component Unit Tests</h3>\n<p>Component unit tests verify the correctness of individual subsystems in isolation from their dependencies and external resources. These tests focus on algorithmic correctness, edge case handling, and interface contract compliance for each major component of the terminal multiplexer architecture.</p>\n<p>The <strong>escape sequence parser</strong> represents one of the most critical components to test thoroughly due to the complexity and variety of ANSI escape sequences that must be handled correctly. The parser must correctly transition between states, accumulate parameters, and generate appropriate actions for hundreds of different escape sequence combinations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Basic CSI Sequences</td>\n<td>Cursor movements (CUU, CUD, CUF, CUB)</td>\n<td>Parser generates correct cursor position changes</td>\n<td>Verify <code>cursor_x</code> and <code>cursor_y</code> values in buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parameter Parsing</td>\n<td>Multi-parameter sequences like <code>\\e[2;5H</code></td>\n<td>Parameters correctly extracted into <code>csi_params</code> array</td>\n<td>Check <code>csi_param_count</code> and individual parameter values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Default Parameters</td>\n<td>Sequences with missing parameters like <code>\\e[H</code></td>\n<td>Parser applies correct default values</td>\n<td>Verify cursor moves to (0,0) for missing parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid Sequences</td>\n<td>Malformed escape sequences</td>\n<td>Parser resets to normal state without corruption</td>\n<td>Check <code>parser_state_t</code> returns to <code>NORMAL</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UTF-8 Handling</td>\n<td>Multi-byte Unicode characters</td>\n<td>Characters correctly decoded and stored</td>\n<td>Verify <code>terminal_cell_t.ch</code> contains complete codepoint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buffer Boundaries</td>\n<td>Sequences longer than <code>ESC_SEQ_BUFFER_SIZE</code></td>\n<td>Parser truncates or rejects overlong sequences</td>\n<td>Check buffer doesn&#39;t overflow and state resets</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The escape sequence parser tests should create controlled input streams and verify state transitions step by step. For example, when testing the sequence <code>\\e[2J</code> (clear screen), the test should verify that the parser transitions from <code>NORMAL</code> to <code>ESCAPE</code> on the escape character, then to <code>CSI_PARAMS</code> on the bracket, accumulates the parameter &quot;2&quot;, and finally generates a clear screen action with the correct mode parameter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Testing Insight</strong>: Escape sequence parsing failures often manifest as display corruption that appears intermittent or input-dependent. Unit tests must exercise boundary conditions like buffer overflows, incomplete sequences, and interleaved UTF-8 characters to catch these subtle bugs before they reach integration testing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>screen buffer management</strong> component requires extensive testing of cursor movement, scrolling behavior, and character storage operations. These tests verify that the virtual screen accurately tracks terminal state without requiring actual terminal I/O.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Cursor Movement</td>\n<td>Absolute and relative positioning</td>\n<td>Cursor stays within buffer boundaries</td>\n<td>Check <code>cursor_x</code> and <code>cursor_y</code> constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scrolling Operations</td>\n<td>Line insertion, deletion, scroll regions</td>\n<td>Content shifts correctly, scrollback preserved</td>\n<td>Verify character positions and scrollback buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Character Storage</td>\n<td>Normal text, wide characters, combining marks</td>\n<td>Characters stored with correct attributes</td>\n<td>Check <code>terminal_cell_t</code> content and formatting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buffer Clearing</td>\n<td>Full screen, line clearing, selective erase</td>\n<td>Specified regions cleared to default state</td>\n<td>Verify cleared cells contain default values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Attribute Handling</td>\n<td>Bold, underline, color changes</td>\n<td>Attributes applied to subsequent characters</td>\n<td>Check <code>current_attributes</code> and cell attributes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scrollback Management</td>\n<td>Lines scrolling off screen</td>\n<td>Old lines preserved up to <code>MAX_SCROLLBACK</code> limit</td>\n<td>Verify scrollback buffer content and bounds</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Screen buffer tests should create known buffer states and verify that operations produce expected results. For example, a scrolling test should fill the buffer with identifiable content, perform scroll operations, and verify that the correct lines moved to the scrollback buffer while new content appeared in the visible area.</p>\n<p>The <strong>layout calculation algorithm</strong> must be tested to ensure correct pane dimension calculations, split operations, and resize handling across various terminal sizes and split configurations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Single Pane Layout</td>\n<td>Full terminal dimensions</td>\n<td>Pane occupies entire available space</td>\n<td>Check pane coordinates match terminal size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Horizontal Splits</td>\n<td>Two-pane horizontal division</td>\n<td>Panes split along horizontal boundary</td>\n<td>Verify y-coordinates and height allocation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vertical Splits</td>\n<td>Two-pane vertical division</td>\n<td>Panes split along vertical boundary</td>\n<td>Verify x-coordinates and width allocation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nested Splits</td>\n<td>Complex multi-level split trees</td>\n<td>Each pane receives correct dimensions</td>\n<td>Walk layout tree and verify all leaf calculations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Size Constraints</td>\n<td>Splits with insufficient space</td>\n<td>Panes respect <code>MIN_PANE_WIDTH</code> and <code>MIN_PANE_HEIGHT</code></td>\n<td>Check no pane dimensions below minimums</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Resize</td>\n<td>Layout recalculation on size change</td>\n<td>All panes resize proportionally</td>\n<td>Compare before/after dimension ratios</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Layout tests should construct various tree configurations and verify that the <code>layout_calculate_dimensions</code> function produces correct absolute coordinates for all panes. These tests can use small, predictable terminal sizes (like 80x24) to make manual verification straightforward.</p>\n<p>The <strong>PTY session management</strong> component requires careful testing of process lifecycle, file descriptor handling, and signal propagation without relying on actual shell processes or terminal devices.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Session Creation</td>\n<td>PTY allocation and process spawning</td>\n<td>Valid file descriptors and running process</td>\n<td>Check <code>master_fd</code>, <code>slave_fd</code>, and <code>child_pid</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Monitoring</td>\n<td>Child process status tracking</td>\n<td><code>process_running</code> accurately reflects process state</td>\n<td>Use test processes with known behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Size Updates</td>\n<td>TIOCSWINSZ ioctl propagation</td>\n<td>Child process receives resize notifications</td>\n<td>Mock ioctl calls and verify parameters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Cleanup</td>\n<td>Resource deallocation on close</td>\n<td>File descriptors closed, processes terminated</td>\n<td>Verify fds invalid and processes reaped</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Handling</td>\n<td>SIGCHLD processing</td>\n<td>Child termination detected and recorded</td>\n<td>Use controlled child processes for testing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I/O Operations</td>\n<td>Read/write through PTY master</td>\n<td>Data flows correctly between processes</td>\n<td>Use pipe-like test programs for verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>PTY session tests can use simple test programs instead of full shells - for example, programs that echo input, print known output patterns, or terminate after specific signals. This provides predictable behavior for test verification while exercising the same PTY infrastructure used with real shells.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Mock vs Real Dependencies</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Use Minimal Real Dependencies with Controlled Behavior</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Component tests need to verify functionality without full system complexity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Pure mocking with stub implementations</li>\n<li>Real dependencies with full shells and terminals</li>\n<li>Minimal real dependencies with controlled test programs</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use minimal real dependencies with controlled test programs</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Pure mocks miss integration issues between components and system interfaces, while full dependencies make tests non-deterministic and environment-dependent. Controlled test programs provide real system behavior with predictable, testable outcomes.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Tests exercise real system interfaces and catch platform-specific issues while remaining fast and deterministic. Test programs must be maintained alongside the main codebase.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"integration-testing\">Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>Integration testing verifies that components work correctly together and that the complete terminal multiplexer handles real-world scenarios with actual shell processes, PTY devices, and terminal output. These tests focus on data flow between components, timing-dependent behavior, and end-to-end functionality.</p>\n<p>The <strong>PTY-to-display pipeline</strong> represents the most critical integration path, where output from shell processes flows through PTY devices, escape sequence parsing, screen buffer updates, and final terminal rendering. Integration tests must verify this pipeline handles realistic shell output correctly.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Scenario</th>\n<th>Test Setup</th>\n<th>Expected Results</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Shell Command Output</td>\n<td>Execute <code>ls -la</code> in pane</td>\n<td>Directory listing displayed correctly</td>\n<td>Compare rendered output to expected text</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interactive Programs</td>\n<td>Run <code>vim</code> or <code>less</code> with known files</td>\n<td>Screen clearing and cursor movement work</td>\n<td>Verify escape sequences parsed and applied</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color and Formatting</td>\n<td>Execute commands with colored output</td>\n<td>Colors and attributes displayed correctly</td>\n<td>Check terminal cells have correct color values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large Output Volumes</td>\n<td>Generate substantial text output</td>\n<td>Scrollback buffer manages content correctly</td>\n<td>Verify old lines preserved and accessible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Real-time Output</td>\n<td>Run streaming commands like <code>tail -f</code></td>\n<td>Output appears as generated</td>\n<td>Check display updates without artificial delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple Pane Output</td>\n<td>Simultaneous activity in multiple panes</td>\n<td>Each pane displays independently</td>\n<td>Verify output doesn&#39;t cross pane boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Integration tests should use realistic shell commands and verify that the complete output appears correctly in the terminal multiplexer display. These tests can capture expected output from known commands and compare against actual multiplexer rendering results.</p>\n<p>The <strong>multi-pane interaction testing</strong> verifies that window management operations work correctly with live PTY sessions and that focus changes, splits, and resizes maintain proper terminal behavior across all panes.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Scenario</th>\n<th>Test Setup</th>\n<th>Expected Results</th>\n<th>Verification Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Pane Creation</td>\n<td>Split existing pane running shell</td>\n<td>New shell starts in new pane</td>\n<td>Verify independent shell processes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Focus Switching</td>\n<td>Switch between panes with different content</td>\n<td>Active pane receives input correctly</td>\n<td>Send keystrokes and verify only active pane responds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pane Resizing</td>\n<td>Resize panes containing running programs</td>\n<td>Programs adjust to new dimensions</td>\n<td>Check program output adapts to new size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pane Closing</td>\n<td>Close pane with running process</td>\n<td>Process terminates cleanly</td>\n<td>Verify process cleanup and layout adjustment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal Resize</td>\n<td>Change terminal size with multiple panes</td>\n<td>All panes resize proportionally</td>\n<td>Verify programs in all panes see size changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Session Persistence</td>\n<td>Long-running processes across operations</td>\n<td>Processes continue running during layout changes</td>\n<td>Check process state maintained through operations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Multi-pane integration tests should use long-running or interactive programs to verify that pane operations don&#39;t disrupt process execution.

The verification procedures bridge the gap between automated testing and user acceptance by providing concrete manual validation steps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Architecture Decision: Automated vs Manual Verification</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Combine Automated Testing with Manual Verification Checkpoints</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Milestone verification needs to validate both technical correctness and user experience</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Fully automated testing with programmatic verification</li>\n<li>Manual testing checklists with human verification</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach combining automated tests with manual validation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Use hybrid approach with automated tests for technical correctness and manual checkpoints for user experience</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Terminal multiplexers have complex user interactions and visual behavior that are difficult to test programmatically, while technical components benefit from automated verification. Manual checkpoints catch usability issues and integration problems that automated tests miss.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Verification process requires both automated test execution and human validation, but provides comprehensive coverage of both technical and user experience requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The testing strategy for a terminal multiplexer requires a combination of isolated component testing, integration verification with real processes, and milestone-driven acceptance testing. This implementation guidance provides complete test infrastructure and specific testing procedures for each component and milestone.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Recommendations for

provides comprehensive debugging approaches that span PTY functionality (M1), terminal emulation accuracy (M2), window management behavior (M3), and input handling correctness (M4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-detective39s-toolkit\">Mental Model: The Detective&#39;s Toolkit</h3>\n<p>Think of debugging a terminal multiplexer like being a detective investigating a complex crime scene. You have multiple suspects (components) that could be causing the problem, various types of evidence (logs, system calls, terminal output), and different investigative techniques (debugging tools, test cases, systematic observation). Just as a detective follows clues systematically from symptoms back to root causes, debugging a terminal multiplexer requires methodical investigation through the layers of PTY management, terminal emulation, window management, and input handling.</p>\n<p>The key insight is that terminal multiplexer bugs often manifest in one component but originate in another. A rendering problem might stem from corrupted escape sequence parsing, which could be caused by incomplete UTF-8 decoding, which might result from improper PTY I/O handling. Like solving a mystery, you need to trace the evidence backwards through the data flow to find the true culprit.</p>\n<p>Building a terminal multiplexer involves orchestrating multiple complex systems (process management, terminal emulation, signal handling, I/O multiplexing) that interact in subtle ways. When things go wrong, the symptoms can be confusing and misleading. This debugging guide provides systematic approaches to diagnose issues across all components and integration points.</p>\n<p>The debugging process for terminal multiplexers differs from typical application debugging because you&#39;re dealing with low-level system interfaces (PTYs, signals, terminal control), real-time I/O processing, and stateful terminal emulation. Problems can be timing-dependent, process-specific, or terminal-dependent, making them challenging to reproduce and isolate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pty-and-process-issues\">PTY and Process Issues</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Nursery Supervisor</strong></p>\n<p>Debugging PTY and process issues is like being a nursery supervisor responsible for multiple children (processes) in separate rooms (PTYs). When a child stops responding, you need to check if they&#39;re sleeping (blocked), sick (crashed), or if their room&#39;s intercom system (PTY) is broken. Sometimes the problem isn&#39;t with the child but with the communication system connecting you to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PTY and process debugging involves understanding the complex interactions between parent and child processes, pseudo-terminal devices, process groups, and signal handling. These issues often manifest as hanging sessions, unresponsive shells, or mysterious process termination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pty-creation-and-management-problems\">Common PTY Creation and Management Problems</h3>\n<p>The most frequent category of PTY issues occurs during the initial creation and setup phase. These problems often result from incorrect file descriptor management, improper session setup, or failure to establish the controlling terminal relationship correctly.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Problem Category</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Root Cause</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PTY Allocation Failure</td>\n<td><code>pty_session_create()</code> returns <code>TMUX_ERROR_PTY_ALLOCATION</code></td>\n<td>System limit reached or permissions issue</td>\n<td>Check errno after <code>posix_openpt()</code> call</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Child Process Hangs</td>\n<td>Shell never appears, no prompt displayed</td>\n<td>Child didn&#39;t become session leader or slave not opened correctly</td>\n<td>Check if <code>setsid()</code> succeeded and slave opened in child</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Not Reaching Shell</td>\n<td>Typing produces no response</td>\n<td>Master/slave file descriptors swapped or not connected</td>\n<td>Verify data flow with write to master, read from slave</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Garbled Output</td>\n<td>Text appears corrupted or missing</td>\n<td>Terminal attributes not set correctly</td>\n<td>Compare termios settings between real terminal and PTY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks Across Fork</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes is failing to properly manage file descriptors across the fork boundary. The parent process should close the slave file descriptor after forking, and the child should close the master. Leaving both ends open in both processes can cause I/O to hang or behave unpredictably.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">c</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// WRONG -

Applications must handle partial I/O operations and buffer management correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"process-state-inspection-techniques\">Process State Inspection Techniques</h3>\n<p>When debugging process issues, systematic inspection of process state provides crucial diagnostic information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Process Tree Analysis</strong>: Use <code>pstree -p</code> to visualize the relationship between the terminal multiplexer, child shells, and any subprocesses they&#39;ve spawned</li>\n<li><strong>File Descriptor Audit</strong>: Examine <code>/proc/PID/fd/</code> for each process to verify PTY file descriptors are open and point to expected devices</li>\n<li><strong>Process Group Verification</strong>: Check process group and session IDs using <code>ps -o pid,ppid,pgid,sid,tty</code> to ensure session leadership is established correctly</li>\n<li><strong>Signal Mask Inspection</strong>: Use <code>/proc/PID/status</code> to check which signals are blocked or ignored in each process</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Map Analysis</strong>: For crashes, examine <code>/proc/PID/maps</code> to identify memory corruption or unexpected library loading</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"terminal-emulation-debugging\">Terminal Emulation Debugging</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mental Model: The Language Translator</strong></p>\n<p>Debugging terminal emulation is like troubleshooting a simultaneous translation system.

could be added after completing the core terminal multiplexer functionality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-growing-ecosystem\">Mental Model: The Growing Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Think of future extensions like expanding a small mountain cabin into a full resort. The original cabin (our basic terminal multiplexer) provides shelter and basic amenities - you can split rooms, manage multiple guests, and coordinate activities. But as needs grow, you might add a lodge office where guests can check in and out even when you&#39;re away (session persistence), a concierge service that remembers guest preferences and provides custom amenities (advanced configuration), and recreational facilities that make the stay more enjoyable (copy mode, search, customizable displays).</p>\n<p>Each extension builds on the solid foundation already established, but adds new capabilities that transform the simple shelter into a sophisticated environment. The key architectural principle remains the same - maintain the core functionality while adding complementary systems that enhance the user experience without disrupting the fundamental operations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"session-persistence\">Session Persistence</h3>\n<p><strong>Session persistence</strong> represents one of the most valuable extensions to a terminal multiplexer, transforming it from a simple window manager into a persistent workspace that survives terminal disconnections, system reboots, and network failures. This capability allows users to detach from their multiplexer sessions and reattach later, finding their shell processes, command history, and screen state exactly as they left them.</p>\n<p>The mental model for session persistence resembles a library reading room system. When you leave the library, the librarian carefully marks your place in each book, notes which books you were reading, remembers your preferred seating arrangement, and stores everything in a secure location. When you return hours or days later, the librarian reconstructs your exact workspace - same books open to the same pages, same arrangement on your desk, same reading lamp position. Session persistence provides this same continuity for terminal sessions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"session-state-serialization\">Session State Serialization</h4>\n<p>Implementing session persistence requires serializing the complete state of a multiplexer session to persistent storage and later reconstructing that state when reattaching. The serialization must capture not just the visible terminal state, but the entire operational context that enables seamless continuation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>State to Serialize</th>\n<th>Format Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>PTY Sessions</td>\n<td>Process IDs, working directories, environment variables, terminal size</td>\n<td>JSON with process metadata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Screen Buffers</td>\n<td>Character cells, attributes, cursor positions, scrollback history</td>\n<td>Binary format with run-length encoding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Layout Tree</td>\n<td>Pane hierarchy, split ratios, focus state, minimum dimensions</td>\n<td>Nested JSON structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terminal State</td>\n<td>Current attributes, saved cursor positions, parser state</td>\n<td>Structured binary format</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Handler</td>\n<td>Key binding overrides, prefix key state, command history</td>\n<td>JSON configuration format</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The serialization process involves capturing a consistent snapshot of all components while they continue operating. This requires careful coordination to avoid capturing inconsistent intermediate states where some components have processed events that others have not yet seen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Session State Storage Format</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to balance serialization speed, storage efficiency, and format evolution compatibility</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Pure JSON for human readability and debugging ease</li>\n<li>Binary format for space efficiency and fast serialization</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach with JSON metadata and binary payload data</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Hybrid approach with JSON for structure and binary for screen buffer content</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: JSON provides format versioning and debugging capability while binary encoding efficiently stores large screen buffers and scrollback history</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables fast serialization of large sessions while maintaining format evolution path and debugging accessibility</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"process-state-management\">Process State Management</h4>\n<p>The most complex aspect of session persistence involves managing the lifecycle of child processes across detach and reattach operations. Unlike simple state serialization, processes represent active system resources that must continue executing even when no terminal is attached to observe their output.</p>\n<p>When a session detaches, the multiplexer must transition all PTY sessions into a <strong>background execution mode</strong> where shell processes continue running but their output gets buffered rather than displayed. The PTY master file descriptors remain open and readable, but no terminal is connected to consume the output or provide input.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Process Management Task</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Error Handling</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Output Buffering</td>\n<td>Expand screen buffer to accommodate continued output during detachment</td>\n<td>Implement buffer size limits with oldest line eviction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Input Queuing</td>\n<td>Store user input in persistent queue until processes can consume it</td>\n<td>Handle queue overflow by dropping oldest input events</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal Forwarding</td>\n<td>Maintain process group relationships for proper signal delivery</td>\n<td>Detect and handle orphaned process groups</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Working Directory</td>\n<td>Track and restore current working directory for each shell session</td>\n<td>Handle cases where directories were deleted during detachment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Variables</td>\n<td>Preserve environment modifications made during session execution</td>\n<td>Detect conflicts with system-wide environment changes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The challenge lies in maintaining the illusion that the terminal never disconnected. When reattaching, processes should behave exactly as if the terminal had been continuously available. This requires buffering all output generated during detachment and presenting it seamlessly when the user reconnects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"session-discovery-and-management\">Session Discovery and Management</h4>\n<p>Session persistence introduces the need for a <strong>session registry</strong> that tracks active detached sessions and enables users to discover and reattach to them. This registry must survive multiplexer restarts and provide meaningful session identification.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code>Session Registry Schema:\n- Session ID: Unique identifier for session instance\n- Session Name: User-friendly name for easy identification  \n- Creation Time: When session was originally created\n- Last Attach Time: When user was last connected to session\n- Process Count: Number of active shell processes in session\n- Working Directory: Base directory where session was created\n- Layout Summary: Brief description of pane configuration\n- State File Path: Location of serialized session state</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The registry enables commands like &quot;list all detached sessions&quot;, &quot;attach to session by name&quot;, &quot;kill abandoned session&quot;, and &quot;rename existing session&quot;. Each registry entry contains enough metadata for users to identify the session they want without loading the full session state.</p>\n<p>Session naming conventions become important for usability. The system should support both automatic naming (based on working directory or primary command) and user-specified names. Name collision resolution and session lifecycle management (automatic cleanup of old sessions) help maintain a manageable session namespace.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reattachment-and-state-reconstruction\">Reattachment and State Reconstruction</h4>\n<p>The reattachment process represents the inverse of session serialization - reconstructing a complete operational multiplexer from persistent storage. This process must restore not just the visible state, but the entire execution context that enables continued operation.</p>\n<p>The reconstruction follows a carefully ordered sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Validate session state integrity</strong> by checking file format versions, verifying process existence, and confirming PTY device availability</li>\n<li><strong>Reconstruct PTY sessions</strong> by reconnecting to existing child processes or detecting terminated processes that require restart</li>\n<li><strong>Restore screen buffers</strong> by deserializing character grids, cursor positions, and scrollback history for each pane</li>\n<li><strong>Rebuild layout tree</strong> by recreating the split hierarchy and calculating current pane dimensions for the new terminal size</li>\n<li><strong>Initialize input handler</strong> by restoring key bindings, command history, and prefix key state</li>\n<li><strong>Synchronize terminal state</strong> by applying any buffered output generated during detachment and updating display</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The most delicate aspect involves handling process state changes that occurred during detachment. Child processes may have terminated, changed working directories, modified environment variables, or generated substantial output. The reattachment logic must detect these changes and adapt appropriately.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Process State Change</th>\n<th>Detection Method</th>\n<th>Recovery Action</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Process Termination</td>\n<td>Check process existence via kill(pid, 0)</td>\n<td>Display termination status and offer restart option</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Working Directory Change</td>\n<td>Compare stored vs current pwd from process</td>\n<td>Update session working directory tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Modification</td>\n<td>Not directly detectable</td>\n<td>Accept changes as part of normal session evolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substantial Output</td>\n<td>Check PTY buffer size and modification time</td>\n<td>Present buffered output with clear delineation markers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Exhaustion</td>\n<td>Monitor PTY buffer and system resource usage</td>\n<td>Implement graceful degradation with user notification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"detachment-signal-handling\">Detachment Signal Handling</h4>\n<p>Clean detachment requires the multiplexer to respond appropriately to various disconnection scenarios - user-initiated detachment, terminal closure, network disconnection, or system shutdown. Each scenario demands different preservation strategies.</p>\n<p>User-initiated detachment (triggered by a key binding like prefix-d) represents the clean case where the multiplexer can perform orderly serialization with advance notice. Terminal closure or network disconnection requires the multiplexer to detect the condition through failed I/O operations and initiate emergency serialization. System shutdown presents the most challenging case, requiring rapid state preservation within the constraints of shutdown timeouts.</p>\n<p>The multiplexer should register signal handlers for <code>SIGHUP</code> (terminal hangup), <code>SIGTERM</code> (termination request), and <code>SIGINT</code> (interrupt) to initiate appropriate detachment procedures. Emergency serialization prioritizes preserving critical state (process IDs, current commands) over complete state (full scrollback history) when time constraints prevent full serialization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"advanced-terminal-features\">Advanced Terminal Features</h3>\n<p>Beyond session persistence, numerous advanced features can enhance the terminal multiplexer&#39;s usability and power-user appeal. These features transform the basic split-screen interface into a sophisticated terminal workspace with integrated text manipulation, search capabilities, and customizable information displays.</p>\n<h4 id=\"copy-mode-and-text-selection\">Copy Mode and Text Selection</h4>\n<p><strong>Copy mode</strong> enables keyboard-driven text selection and clipboard integration within the terminal multiplexer, allowing users to select and copy text from any pane&#39;s screen buffer or scrollback history without requiring mouse interaction. This feature particularly benefits users working in mouse-free environments or over high-latency connections where mouse interaction proves cumbersome.</p>\n<p>The mental model for copy mode resembles switching a text editor into selection mode. The normal terminal interface transitions into a navigation interface where cursor movement keys traverse the screen buffer, selection keys mark text regions, and copy commands transfer selected content to the system clipboard or internal paste buffer.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Copy Mode Action</th>\n<th>Key Binding</th>\n<th>Implementation Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Enter Copy Mode</td>\n<td>prefix + [</td>\n<td>Freeze current pane display and overlay cursor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Navigation</td>\n<td>Arrow keys, hjkl</td>\n<td>Move cursor through screen buffer and scrollback</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Start Selection</td>\n<td>Space or v</td>\n<td>Mark selection start position</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>End Selection</td>\n<td>Enter or y</td>\n<td>Mark selection end and copy to clipboard</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Line Selection</td>\n<td>V</td>\n<td>Select entire lines for rapid bulk copying</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Search in Buffer</td>\n<td>/ or ?</td>\n<td>Find text patterns within current pane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exit Copy Mode</td>\n<td>Escape or q</td>\n<td>Return to normal terminal interaction mode</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The implementation requires maintaining a <strong>copy cursor</strong> that moves independently of the terminal cursor, overlaying the display to show current position. The copy cursor can navigate beyond the visible screen into scrollback history, enabling access to commands and output from earlier in the session.</p>\n<p>Text selection involves tracking start and end positions within the screen buffer coordinate system. The selection must handle line wrapping, character encoding, and mixed content (text with escape sequences). When copying, the system extracts plain text content while preserving line breaks and word boundaries.</p>\n<h4 id=\"search-and-pattern-matching\">Search and Pattern Matching</h4>\n<p>Integrated search functionality enables users to locate specific text patterns within pane contents, scrollback history, and across multiple panes simultaneously. This capability proves essential for reviewing long command outputs, finding specific log entries, or locating previous commands in shell history.</p>\n<p>The search implementation operates on the character grid maintained by each pane&#39;s screen buffer, supporting both literal text matching and regular expression patterns. Search results highlight matching text and provide navigation between multiple matches within the same buffer.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Search Feature</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>User Interface</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Incremental Search</td>\n<td>Real-time pattern matching as user types query</td>\n<td>Highlight matches and show match count</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-Pane Search</td>\n<td>Search all visible panes and present unified results</td>\n<td>Switch between panes showing matches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Historical Search</td>\n<td>Search scrollback buffers for older content</td>\n<td>Navigate through chronological matches</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pattern Highlighting</td>\n<td>Persistent highlighting of search terms</td>\n<td>Toggle highlighting on/off per pane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Search History</td>\n<td>Remember recent search patterns for reuse</td>\n<td>Arrow key navigation through search history</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The search engine must handle <strong>UTF-8 text encoding</strong> correctly, supporting multi-byte character sequences and wide characters that occupy multiple terminal cells. Pattern matching should operate on the logical character sequence rather than the raw byte stream or terminal cell array.</p>\n<p>Regular expression support enables powerful pattern matching for structured text like log files, configuration files, or command output. The implementation should provide a reasonable subset of regex features without requiring a full regex engine - basic character classes, quantifiers, and anchoring operators cover most use cases.</p>\n<h4 id=\"customizable-status-bar\">Customizable Status Bar</h4>\n<p>The <strong>status bar</strong> provides persistent information display across the bottom of the terminal window, showing session status, pane information, system metrics, and user-defined content. A customizable status bar transforms from a simple information display into a powerful dashboard tailored to individual workflows.</p>\n<p>The status bar architecture supports modular <strong>status segments</strong> that can be enabled, disabled, reordered, and configured independently. Each segment responsible for displaying specific information and updating at appropriate intervals.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Status Segment Type</th>\n<th>Information Displayed</th>\n<th>Update Frequency</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Session Info</td>\n<td>Session name, attach time, detached indicator</td>\n<td>On session state changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pane Status</td>\n<td>Current pane index, total pane count, pane title</td>\n<td>On focus changes and pane operations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Process Status</td>\n<td>Shell command, process ID, exit status</td>\n<td>On process state changes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>System Metrics</td>\n<td>CPU usage, memory usage, load average</td>\n<td>Every 5-10 seconds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time Display</td>\n<td>Current time, date, timezone</td>\n<td>Every minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Custom Commands</td>\n<td>Output from user-defined scripts</td>\n<td>User-configurable intervals</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The status bar rendering system must efficiently update only changed segments to minimize terminal output and reduce visual flicker. This requires tracking the previous rendered state of each segment and generating differential updates when content changes.</p>\n<p>Status bar configuration should support both built-in segment types and custom segments that execute user-defined commands or scripts. Custom segments enable integration with external systems - displaying git branch information, monitoring system services, or showing application-specific status.</p>\n<h4 id=\"advanced-key-binding-system\">Advanced Key Binding System</h4>\n<p>While the basic multiplexer provides essential key bindings for pane management, an advanced key binding system enables complete customization of the command interface, support for complex key sequences, and integration with external tools.</p>\n<p>The advanced system supports <strong>multi-key sequences</strong> beyond the simple prefix-key model, enabling Emacs-style or Vim-style key combinations that can express complex commands efficiently. Users can define key sequences like <code>prefix C-w v</code> (prefix, then Ctrl-W, then v) for sophisticated command hierarchies.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key Binding Feature</th>\n<th>Implementation Requirements</th>\n<th>Configuration Format</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Multi-Key Sequences</td>\n<td>State machine tracking partial key sequences</td>\n<td>Hierarchical key mapping tree</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conditional Bindings</td>\n<td>Different bindings based on pane state or content</td>\n<td>Conditional expression evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Command Composition</td>\n<td>Combining multiple commands in single binding</td>\n<td>Command scripting mini-language</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mode-Specific Bindings</td>\n<td>Different key meanings in copy mode vs normal mode</td>\n<td>Mode-aware binding resolution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic Bindings</td>\n<td>Runtime creation of temporary key bindings</td>\n<td>Programmatic binding registration</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The key binding system should provide <strong>binding introspection</strong> capabilities, enabling users to discover available commands, view current bindings, and detect binding conflicts. A built-in help system can display context-sensitive key binding information based on current mode and state.</p>\n<p>Command composition enables sophisticated automation by combining basic operations into complex workflows. For example, a single key binding might create a new pane, start a specific application, resize the pane to preferred dimensions, and switch focus - all executed as an atomic operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"window-and-session-management\">Window and Session Management</h4>\n<p>Advanced window management extends beyond basic pane splitting to provide sophisticated workspace organization capabilities. <strong>Named windows</strong> enable logical grouping of related panes, while <strong>session templates</strong> provide reproducible workspace setups for common development scenarios.</p>\n<p>Named windows function like tabs in a web browser, where each window contains an independent set of panes with their own layout configuration. Users can switch between windows, rename windows, and create new windows with predefined layouts.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Window Management Feature</th>\n<th>User Interface</th>\n<th>Implementation Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Window Creation</td>\n<td>prefix + c (create), prefix + n (next)</td>\n<td>Independent layout trees per window</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Navigation</td>\n<td>prefix + 0-9 (by number), prefix + &#39; (by name)</td>\n<td>Window registry with fast lookup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Renaming</td>\n<td>prefix + , (rename current window)</td>\n<td>Persistent naming across session save/restore</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Status</td>\n<td>Show window list in status bar</td>\n<td>Efficient window state monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Window Templates</td>\n<td>Create windows from predefined configurations</td>\n<td>Template storage and parameterization</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Session templates provide reproducible workspace creation by defining standard pane layouts, startup commands, and working directories for common development scenarios. A web development template might create panes for editor, development server, database console, and system monitoring - all initialized with appropriate commands and working directories.</p>\n<p>Template parameterization enables flexible reuse by accepting variables like project directory, server ports, or database connections. Users can instantiate templates with different parameters to create similar but customized workspaces.</p>\n<h4 id=\"integration-capabilities\">Integration Capabilities</h4>\n<p>Advanced terminal multiplexers benefit from integration with external tools and systems, enabling seamless workflows between terminal-based and graphical applications. Integration capabilities include clipboard synchronization, external editor support, and notification systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Clipboard integration</strong> synchronizes the multiplexer&#39;s internal copy buffer with the system clipboard, enabling seamless text exchange with other applications. This requires platform-specific implementations for different operating systems and clipboard managers.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Integration Type</th>\n<th>Implementation Approach</th>\n<th>Platform Considerations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>System Clipboard</td>\n<td>Use xclip/pbcopy/clip.exe for clipboard operations</td>\n<td>Different utilities per OS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>External Editors</td>\n<td>Launch editor with temporary files for complex editing</td>\n<td>Handle editor configuration and file cleanup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Desktop Notifications</td>\n<td>Send notifications for background pane activity</td>\n<td>Integration with system notification services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>File Manager</td>\n<td>Open file paths from terminal in external file manager</td>\n<td>Parse file paths from terminal output</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Web Browser</td>\n<td>Launch URLs detected in terminal output</td>\n<td>URL pattern recognition and browser selection</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>External editor integration enables users to edit complex text within the terminal multiplexer using their preferred graphical editor. This involves creating temporary files, launching the editor, and monitoring for file changes to update the terminal content.</p>\n<p>Notification integration helps users monitor background activity in detached or non-focused panes. The system can detect interesting events like command completion, error messages, or specific text patterns and generate desktop notifications to alert users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-future-extension-pitfalls\">Common Future Extension Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Session State Explosion</strong>\nMany implementations attempt to serialize every possible piece of state, creating enormous session files and slow serialization. The key insight is that not all state needs persistence - transient UI state, temporary buffers, and cached calculations can be regenerated on reattachment. Focus on preserving only the essential state that cannot be reconstructed: process IDs, user input, and user-generated content.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Process Lifecycle Mismanagement</strong>\nA common mistake involves assuming that child processes remain unchanged during detachment. In reality, processes may terminate, change working directories, create new child processes, or modify environment variables. The reattachment logic must detect and adapt to these changes rather than assuming static process state.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Copy Mode Performance Issues</strong>\nImplementing copy mode by re-rendering the entire screen buffer for each cursor movement creates unacceptable performance for large scrollback buffers. Instead, use differential rendering that updates only the cursor position and selection highlighting. Pre-index the screen buffer content to enable efficient text search and navigation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Status Bar Update Frequency</strong>\nUpdating the status bar on every terminal refresh or input event creates significant overhead and visual distraction. Implement intelligent update scheduling that refreshes segments only when their underlying data changes, and batch multiple changes to reduce rendering frequency.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Key Binding Conflicts</strong>\nAdding advanced key binding features without considering conflicts with existing terminal applications creates user frustration. Maintain a registry of reserved key sequences, provide conflict detection when users define custom bindings, and offer escape mechanisms for sending literal key sequences to applications.</p>\n<h3

id=\"glossary\">Glossary</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> All milestones (1-4) - this section provides comprehensive definitions for technical terminology used throughout the terminal multiplexer design and implementation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-the-technical-dictionary\">Mental Model: The Technical Dictionary</h3>\n<p>Think of this glossary as a technical translator that bridges multiple domains of knowledge. Building a terminal multiplexer requires understanding concepts from operating systems (processes, signals, file descriptors), terminal emulation (escape sequences, character encoding), user interface design (layout algorithms, input handling), and systems programming (I/O multiplexing, state machines). Each term in this glossary represents a building block that connects these domains, helping you understand not just what each concept means, but how it fits into the larger system architecture.</p>\n<p>Just as a good dictionary provides not only definitions but also etymology and usage examples, this glossary explains both the technical meaning of each term and its role in the terminal multiplexer ecosystem.

multiple shell sessions through a single terminal interface, handling pseudo-terminal allocation, terminal emulation, and window management. The key architectural challenge is coordinating PTY I/O, escape sequence parsing, and multi-pane rendering while maintaining session isolation and terminal compatibility.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - this section establishes the foundational understanding needed across the entire project\n\n### Mental Model: The Terminal Switchboard\n\nImagine a busy telephone switchboard operator in the 1950s. Dozens of callers want to make phone calls simultaneously, but there's only one operator sitting at the central console. The operator's job is to connect each caller to their desired destination, manage multiple conversations at once, and switch between them seamlessly. When Caller A wants to talk, the operator plugs their line into the main console. When Caller B needs attention, the operator switches the connection. From each caller's perspective, they have the operator's full attention, even though the operator is actually juggling many conversations.\n\nA **terminal multiplexer** works exactly like this switchboard operator, but instead of routing phone calls, it routes terminal input and output between multiple shell sessions. You have one physical terminal (your keyboard and screen), but you want to run multiple shell sessions - perhaps editing code in one, running tests in another, monitoring logs in a third, and debugging in a fourth. The multiplexer sits between your physical terminal and these multiple shell processes, creating the illusion that each shell has its own dedicated terminal.\n\nWhen you type commands, the multiplexer routes your keystrokes to whichever shell session currently has \"focus\" - just like the operator connecting your voice to the right phone line. When shells produce output (listing files, showing error messages, displaying program results), the multiplexer captures that output and displays it on your screen, switching between different sessions as you request. Each shell process believes it has a real terminal attached, complete with the ability to move the cursor, change colors, and clear the screen, but it's actually communicating with a \"fake\" terminal that the multiplexer creates and manages.\n\nThe technical term for these fake terminals is **pseudo-terminals** or **PTYs**. Think of a PTY as a telephone extension - it looks and behaves exactly like a real phone from the caller's perspective, but it's actually connected to the central switchboard system. The multiplexer creates one PTY for each shell session, managing the illusion that each has its own dedicated terminal hardware.\n\nJust as the switchboard operator needs to understand telephone protocols (how to establish connections, handle busy signals, manage conference calls), the multiplexer needs to understand terminal protocols - the special codes that programs send to control cursor position, change text colors, clear the screen, and handle window resizing. This is where **terminal emulation** comes in: the multiplexer must speak the same language as both the physical terminal and the shell processes.\n\nThe switchboard analogy extends to window management as well. Imagine the operator has a large control panel that can be divided into sections, with each section showing the status of different phone conversations simultaneously. Similarly, a terminal multiplexer can split your screen into multiple **panes**, each showing a different shell session. You can see multiple conversations at once, resize the sections to give more space to important ones, and switch focus between them with keyboard shortcuts.\n\nThis mental model helps explain why building a terminal multiplexer is technically challenging: you're essentially building a sophisticated communications system that must maintain the illusion of multiple dedicated terminals while actually sharing a single physical terminal. Every keystroke, escape sequence, and terminal capability must be correctly routed and translated between the different abstraction layers.\n\n### Existing Approaches Comparison\n\nThe terminal multiplexing space has several mature solutions, each representing different architectural approaches and feature sets. Understanding their design decisions helps illuminate the core challenges and trade-offs in this problem domain.\n\n**GNU Screen** represents the original approach to terminal multiplexing, developed in 1987 when terminal hardware was expensive and remote connections were unreliable. Screen's primary innovation was **session persistence** - the ability to detach from a terminal session and reattach later, potentially from a different machine. This was revolutionary for users connecting over slow dial-up or unreliable network connections.\n\n| Aspect | GNU Screen Approach | Strengths | Limitations |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Architecture | Single-process session manager | Simple, stable, well-tested | Limited window management |\n| Window Model | Linear window list (Ctrl-a n/p) | Easy to understand and navigate | No panes or splits within windows |\n| Terminal Emulation | Basic ANSI/VT100 support | Compatible with most applications | Limited color and Unicode support |\n| Configuration | Simple RC file format | Easy to configure | Limited customization options |\n| Session Management | Strong detach/reattach support | Survives network disconnections | Sessions tied to single user |\n| Resource Usage | Low memory footprint | Runs on minimal hardware | Single-threaded performance limits |\n\nScreen's architecture is fundamentally a **session container** - it creates a persistent environment that outlives individual terminal connections. When you run Screen, it forks into a daemon process that manages all the PTYs and shell processes. Your terminal connects to this daemon as a client. If the connection breaks, the daemon continues running, keeping all your shells alive. This design priority explains why Screen has limited window management features - it was built for persistence first, convenience second.\n\n**tmux** (Terminal Multiplexer) emerged in 2007 as a modern reimplementation of Screen's concepts with a focus on **advanced window management** and a cleaner architecture. tmux's key innovation was treating terminal multiplexing as primarily a layout and presentation problem rather than just a session persistence problem.\n\n| Aspect | tmux Approach | Strengths | Limitations |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Architecture | Client-server with multiple sessions | Clean separation, multiple clients | More complex setup |\n| Window Model | Sessions → Windows → Panes hierarchy | Very flexible layouts | Steeper learning curve |\n| Terminal Emulation | Modern terminal support (256 colors, UTF-8) | Excellent compatibility | Higher resource usage |\n| Configuration | Rich scripting and customization | Extremely configurable | Configuration complexity |\n| Session Management | Multiple named sessions | Better organization | Overkill for simple use cases |\n| Layout Engine | Dynamic pane splitting and resizing | Professional workspace feel | Can be overwhelming |\n\ntmux's architecture centers around a **three-level hierarchy**: sessions contain windows, windows contain panes. This allows for much more sophisticated organization - you might have a \"development\" session with windows for \"editing\", \"testing\", and \"debugging\", where each window has multiple panes showing different tools. The tmux server can host multiple sessions simultaneously, and multiple clients can connect to different sessions or even the same session from different terminals.\n\nThe layout engine in tmux is particularly sophisticated. Instead of Screen's simple linear window switching, tmux implements a **tree-based layout algorithm** where panes can be split recursively in both horizontal and vertical directions. Each pane maintains its own PTY and screen buffer, but they share screen real estate dynamically. When you resize the terminal, tmux recalculates the entire layout tree and adjusts all panes proportionally.\n\n**Terminal Multiplexer in IDE Context** represents a third approach seen in modern development environments. Tools like VS Code's integrated terminal, iTerm2's tmux integration, and terminal emulators with built-in multiplexing take a **native integration** approach rather than running as separate processes.\n\n| Aspect | IDE Integration Approach | Strengths | Limitations |\n|--------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Architecture | Embedded in larger application | Seamless user experience | Tied to specific environment |\n| Window Model | Tabs and splits native to UI | Familiar interface patterns | Less keyboard-driven |\n| Terminal Emulation | Full terminal emulator built-in | Perfect rendering compatibility | High development complexity |\n| Configuration | GUI preferences integration | User-friendly setup | Less scriptable |\n| Session Management | Application lifecycle tied | Simple mental model | No detach/reattach capability |\n| Performance | Native code integration | Fast rendering and input | Memory usage of full application |\n\nThis approach treats terminal multiplexing as a **user interface problem** rather than a systems programming problem. Instead of creating PTYs and managing processes directly, these solutions embed full terminal emulators within larger graphical applications. The benefit is seamless integration with other development tools, but the cost is loss of the lightweight, universal nature of traditional multiplexers.\n\n**Modern Alternatives** like Zellij, Wezterm, and other recent multiplexers represent a fourth wave focused on **user experience modernization** while maintaining the core architectural patterns established by tmux.\n\n| Feature Category | Screen (1987) | tmux (2007) | Modern Tools (2020+) |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Session Persistence | ✓ Strong | ✓ Strong | ✓ Strong |\n| Pane Management | ✗ Windows only | ✓ Hierarchical | ✓ Advanced layouts |\n| Visual Polish | ✗ Basic | ~ Good | ✓ Excellent |\n| Configuration | ~ Simple | ~ Powerful but complex | ✓ User-friendly |\n| Plugin Ecosystem | ✗ Limited | ✓ Rich | ✓ Growing |\n| Learning Curve | ✓ Gentle | ✗ Steep | ~ Moderate |\n| Resource Usage | ✓ Minimal | ~ Moderate | ~ Higher |\n| Maturity | ✓ Battle-tested | ✓ Mature | ✗ Newer, less proven |\n\n> **Key Architectural Insight**: The evolution from Screen to tmux to modern multiplexers reflects a fundamental tension between **simplicity and capability**. Screen prioritized reliability and minimal resource usage. tmux prioritized flexibility and power. Modern tools prioritize user experience and discoverability. Each represents valid engineering trade-offs for different use cases and user populations.\n\n**Core Technical Challenges Across All Approaches**\n\nRegardless of architectural approach, all terminal multiplexers must solve the same fundamental technical challenges:\n\n**PTY Management Complexity**: Every multiplexer must create and manage pseudo-terminal pairs, which involves intricate systems programming. The PTY subsystem has many subtle requirements around process groups, session leadership, controlling terminals, and signal handling. A single mistake in PTY setup can cause shells to behave incorrectly or not start at all.\n\n**Terminal Protocol Compatibility**: Modern terminal applications use hundreds of different escape sequences for cursor control, color management, window manipulation, and feature negotiation. The multiplexer must parse these sequences accurately and either handle them directly (for screen management commands) or pass them through to the underlying terminal (for display commands). Incorrect parsing leads to garbled output or broken application behavior.\n\n**Input/Output Performance**: A multiplexer sits in the critical path between user input and program output. Any latency introduced by the multiplexer directly impacts the user experience. High-performance applications like text editors, games, or real-time monitoring tools are particularly sensitive to input lag or output buffering delays.\n\n**Layout and Rendering Coordination**: When managing multiple panes, the multiplexer must solve complex geometric problems: how to divide available screen space, handle terminal resizing, manage scrolling and scrollback buffers, and composite multiple data streams into a single output stream without visual artifacts.\n\n**Process Lifecycle Management**: Each shell session represents a separate process tree that must be properly managed. This includes handling process creation, signal forwarding, exit status collection, and cleanup of resources when processes terminate. The multiplexer must also handle edge cases like orphaned processes, zombie processes, and cascading failures.\n\n> **Design Principle**: The fundamental challenge of terminal multiplexing is **maintaining multiple illusions simultaneously**. Each shell process must believe it has a dedicated terminal, each user must feel they're interacting directly with their programs, and the underlying terminal must receive a coherent stream of properly formatted output. The multiplexer succeeds when these illusions are invisible to all parties.\n\nThis context establishes why building a terminal multiplexer is an advanced systems programming project: it requires deep understanding of Unix process management, terminal protocols, event-driven programming, and user interface design, all while maintaining high performance and rock-solid reliability. The implementation must get low-level details exactly right while presenting a clean, intuitive interface to users.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis implementation guidance focuses on establishing the foundational understanding and development environment needed to tackle the terminal multiplexer project.\n\n**A. Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| PTY Management | `posix_openpt()` + manual setup | `forkpty()` library function | Manual approach teaches fundamentals |\n| Event Loop | `select()` system call | `epoll()` or `kqueue()` | select() is portable and sufficient |\n| Terminal Control | Raw termios manipulation | ncurses library | Raw control teaches terminal protocols |\n| Configuration | Hard-coded key bindings | Config file parsing | Focus on core functionality first |\n| Logging | `fprintf(stderr, ...)` | syslog integration | Simple debugging adequate initially |\n\nFor this learning-focused implementation, we recommend the simpler options that expose the underlying mechanisms rather than hiding them behind convenience libraries.\n\n**B.

Language-Specific Hints for C Implementation**\n\n- **PTY Functions**: Use `posix_openpt()`, `grantpt()`, `unlockpt()`, and `ptsname()` for portable PTY allocation\n- **Non-blocking I/O**: Set `O_NONBLOCK` using `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` after opening PTY master\n- **Process Management**: Always check return values from `fork()`, `waitpid()`, and `exec*()` family functions\n- **Signal Handling**: Install `SIGCHLD` handler to detect when child processes exit\n- **Memory Safety**: Initialize all structure fields to safe values before use\n- **Error Handling**: Use `errno` to get specific error information after system call failures\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint for Context Understanding**\n\nAfter understanding this context section, you should be able to:\n\n1. **Explain the switchboard analogy**: Describe how a terminal multiplexer routes I/O between multiple sessions and one physical terminal\n2. **Compare multiplexer architectures**: List key differences between Screen's session-first approach and tmux's layout-first approach  \n3. **Identify core technical challenges**: Name the four main problem areas (PTY management, terminal emulation, layout management, input handling)\n4. **Set up development environment**: Compile and run the provided infrastructure code\n5. **Understand project scope**: Distinguish between features you'll implement vs. advanced features that are out of scope\n\n**Test your understanding**:\n```bash\n# Compile the infrastructure code\ngcc -o test_infrastructure common.c terminal_control.c -DTEST_INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n# This should compile without errors and show terminal dimensions\n./test_infrastructure\n```\n\nExpected output: Current terminal size and confirmation that raw mode can be entered/exited.\n\n**Signs you need to review**:\n- Can't explain why PTYs are necessary (review the switchboard analogy)\n- Unclear on the difference between tmux sessions/windows/panes (review the comparison table)\n- Infrastructure code doesn't compile (check that you have POSIX headers available)\n- Confused about which features you'll build vs. which are out of scope (review the milestone descriptions)\n\nThis context establishes the mental framework and technical foundation needed to successfully implement each milestone of the terminal multiplexer project.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - this section establishes the scope and boundaries that guide implementation across the entire project\n\n### Mental Model: The Feature Boundaries\n\nThink of defining goals and non-goals like planning a camping trip. You need to decide what essential gear to pack (goals), what luxury items would be nice but aren't necessary (non-goals), and what equipment is completely out of scope for this particular adventure (explicit exclusions). Just as a successful camping trip requires clear boundaries on what you're trying to accomplish - whether it's a lightweight backpacking expedition or a comfortable car camping experience - building a terminal multiplexer requires explicit decisions about what functionality to include and what to leave for future versions.\n\nThe key insight is that every feature you choose NOT to implement is as important as every feature you choose to implement. Non-goals aren't failures or limitations - they're conscious architectural decisions that keep the project focused, manageable, and aligned with its learning objectives. A terminal multiplexer could theoretically include dozens of advanced features, but for a learning project, we must ruthlessly prioritize the core concepts that provide the most educational value.\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nThe terminal multiplexer will implement a focused set of core features that demonstrate the essential concepts of PTY management, terminal emulation, and window management. These requirements are carefully chosen to build understanding progressively, with each feature depending on and reinforcing the concepts learned in previous milestones.\n\n#### PTY Management and Session Handling\n\nThe multiplexer must create and manage pseudo-terminal pairs that allow multiple shell sessions to run independently within a single terminal interface. This represents the fundamental capability that distinguishes a multiplexer from a simple shell - the ability to virtualize terminal access across multiple processes.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Success Criteria |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| PTY Creation | Allocate master/slave PTY pairs using `posix_openpt` or equivalent system calls | Returns valid file descriptors for both master and slave devices |\n| Process Spawning | Fork child processes and execute shell commands with PTY as controlling terminal | Child process runs shell with correct terminal environment variables |\n| Terminal Size Handling | Forward terminal size changes to child processes using `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl | Pane resizing updates child PTY dimensions and shell applications respond correctly |\n| Process Lifecycle | Monitor child process status and handle termination gracefully | Detect process exit via `SIGCHLD` and clean up PTY resources |\n| I/O Multiplexing | Read output from multiple PTY masters and write input to active PTY | Select-based event loop handles multiple file descriptors without blocking |\n\nThe PTY management system forms the foundation for all higher-level multiplexer functionality. Without reliable PTY creation and process management, features like window splitting and terminal emulation become meaningless. Each `pty_session_t` structure represents one virtualized terminal that believes it has exclusive access to a real terminal device.\n\n#### Terminal Emulation and Display\n\nThe multiplexer must parse and interpret terminal escape sequences to maintain accurate virtual screen buffers for each pane. This functionality transforms the raw character stream from shell processes into structured display information that can be rendered and manipulated.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Success Criteria |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| ANSI Escape Parsing | Parse CSI sequences, control characters, and OSC commands from PTY output | Correctly interpret cursor movement, text attributes, and screen manipulation commands |\n| Cursor Management | Track cursor position and handle movement commands (up, down, left, right) | Cursor position accurately reflects terminal state after escape sequence processing |\n| Screen Buffer Maintenance | Maintain virtual screen buffer with character cells and attributes for each pane | Screen buffer accurately represents what should be displayed in pane |\n| Text Attributes | Support bold, underline, reverse video, and 256-color text rendering | Text attributes applied correctly to character cells in screen buffer |\n| Scrollback Buffer | Retain lines that scroll off the top of the visible screen area | Users can review previous output up to `MAX_SCROLLBACK` lines |\n| UTF-8 Support | Handle multi-byte UTF-8 character sequences correctly | Non-ASCII characters display properly without corruption |\n\nThe terminal emulation component bridges the gap between the raw byte streams from PTY devices and the structured display information needed for rendering. Each `screen_buffer_t` represents the current visual state of one pane, including both visible content and scrollback history.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: Terminal emulation is not just about parsing escape sequences - it's about maintaining a stateful model of what the terminal display should look like. The escape sequences are commands that modify this state, and the screen buffer is the authoritative representation of the current display.\n\n#### Window Management and Layout\n\nThe multiplexer must support splitting the terminal into multiple panes, each containing an independent shell session. This requires sophisticated layout algorithms and rendering logic to present multiple virtual terminals within a single physical terminal.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Success Criteria |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Pane Splitting | Create vertical and horizontal splits that subdivide existing panes | New panes allocated with independent PTY sessions and screen buffers |\n| Focus Management | Track which pane is currently active and route input appropriately | Keyboard input directed to correct PTY master based on focus state |\n| Pane Resizing | Adjust pane dimensions while maintaining minimum viable sizes | Layout algorithm redistributes space proportionally while respecting constraints |\n| Border Rendering | Draw borders between panes using box-drawing characters | Clear visual separation between panes without corrupting pane content |\n| Layout Persistence | Maintain pane layout and proportions across terminal resize events | Pane relationships preserved when terminal window size changes |\n\nThe window management system must handle the complex geometry calculations required to fit multiple rectangular panes within the available terminal space. The layout algorithm uses a tree structure where each node represents either a pane (leaf) or a split container (internal node).\n\n#### User Interface and Key Bindings\n\nThe multiplexer must provide an intuitive command interface that allows users to control pane management, navigation, and multiplexer functions without interfering with the shell sessions running in individual panes.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Success Criteria |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Prefix Key System | Intercept configurable prefix key (default Ctrl-b) to enter command mode | Prefix key captured in raw terminal mode before being sent to active pane |\n| Pane Navigation | Keyboard shortcuts for switching focus between panes directionally | Arrow keys or vim-style navigation moves focus to adjacent panes |\n| Split Commands | Key bindings for creating vertical and horizontal splits | Single keystrokes trigger pane splitting with new shell sessions |\n| Pane Management | Commands for closing panes and adjusting pane sizes | Pane closure cleans up PTY resources and redistributes layout space |\n| Status Bar | Display current pane information, session name, and system time | Status bar updates reflect focus changes and system state |\n| Raw Terminal Mode | Capture all keyboard input while preserving ability to restore normal mode | Terminal attributes saved and restored correctly on multiplexer exit |\n\nThe user interface system must carefully balance between intercepting control commands and passing normal input through to shell processes. The prefix key mechanism provides a clean separation between multiplexer commands and application input.\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Prefix Key vs. Modal Interface**\n> - **Context**: Users need a way to send commands to the multiplexer without interfering with applications running in panes\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Prefix key system (like tmux Ctrl-b)\n>   - Modal interface (like screen's command mode)\n>   - Menu system with mouse support\n> - **Decision**: Prefix key system with configurable prefix\n> - **Rationale**: Prefix keys provide immediate access to multiplexer functions without mode confusion, familiar to users of existing multiplexers, and work reliably over SSH connections where mouse support may be limited\n> - **Consequences**: Users must remember key combinations, potential conflicts with application key bindings, but provides consistent and fast access to all multiplexer functions\n\n#### Error Handling and Robustness\n\nThe multiplexer must handle various failure conditions gracefully, including PTY allocation failures, child process termination, terminal size changes, and malformed escape sequences.\n\n| Requirement | Description | Success Criteria |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|\n| PTY Allocation Failure | Handle cases where PTY creation fails due to system limits | Graceful degradation with error messages, no resource leaks |\n| Child Process Death | Detect and handle premature child process termination | Pane marked as dead, resources cleaned up, user notified of exit status |\n| Terminal Corruption Recovery | Recover from malformed escape sequences or terminal state corruption | Parser resets to known state, screen buffer remains consistent |\n| Resource Cleanup | Properly clean up PTY file descriptors, child processes, and memory on exit | No zombie processes, file descriptors closed, terminal attributes restored |\n| Signal Handling | Handle SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGWINCH signals appropriately | Graceful shutdown on termination signals, terminal resize propagated to panes |\n\n### Non-Goals\n\nThe following features are explicitly excluded from this implementation to maintain focus on the core learning objectives and keep the project scope manageable. These exclusions represent conscious architectural decisions, not limitations or oversights.\n\n#### Session Persistence and Detachment\n\nThis multiplexer will NOT support session persistence, detaching from sessions, or reattaching to sessions across terminal disconnections. These features, while valuable in production multiplexers like tmux and screen, introduce significant complexity in session management, process daemonization, and inter-process communication that would distract from the core learning objectives.\n\n| Excluded Feature | Rationale | Alternative |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Session Detachment | Requires complex daemon architecture, socket communication, session serialization | Run multiplexer in persistent terminal or use existing tools |\n| Session Reattachment | Needs session discovery, state restoration, terminal synchronization | Start new multiplexer instance with fresh sessions |\n| Background Operation | Process daemonization, signal handling, log management complexity | Keep multiplexer as foreground process |\n| Session Naming/Listing | Persistent session registry, inter-process communication protocols | Single session per multiplexer instance |\n\nSession persistence would require implementing a client-server architecture where the multiplexer runs as a background daemon and terminal instances connect as clients. This architectural complexity would overshadow the PTY management and terminal emulation concepts that are the primary learning goals.\n\n#### Networking and Remote Access\n\nThe multiplexer will NOT include networking capabilities, remote session access, or SSH integration. While these features enable powerful distributed terminal management scenarios, they introduce network programming, authentication, and security concerns that are beyond the scope of a terminal multiplexer learning project.\n\n| Excluded Feature | Rationale | Alternative |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Network Protocol | Socket programming, protocol design, security considerations distract from terminal concepts | Use SSH port forwarding or VNC for remote access |\n| Authentication/Authorization | User management, credential verification, access control complexity | Rely on system-level authentication |\n| Multi-User Sessions | Shared session access, concurrent user management, conflict resolution | Single-user local multiplexer only |\n| Encryption/Security | TLS implementation, key management, secure communication protocols | Use SSH tunneling for secure remote access |\n\nRemote access functionality would require designing network protocols, handling connection management, and implementing security measures that are entirely separate from the terminal multiplexing concepts we aim to teach.\n\n#### Advanced Terminal Features\n\nThe multiplexer will NOT implement advanced terminal capabilities that require extensive terminal database knowledge, complex escape sequence handling, or specialized hardware emulation beyond basic ANSI compatibility.\n\n| Excluded Feature | Rationale | Alternative |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Full Terminal Database | Terminfo/termcap integration requires extensive terminal knowledge database | Focus on common ANSI sequences, rely on TERM environment |\n| Mouse Support | Complex coordinate tracking, event parsing, application coordination | Keyboard-only interface |\n| Terminal Profiles | Color schemes, font settings, appearance customization | Use terminal emulator's native configuration |\n| Advanced Graphics | Sixel graphics, image display, custom character sets | Focus on text-based interface |\n| Complex Scrolling | Alternate screen buffer, application-controlled scrolling modes | Simple scrollback buffer only |\n\nThese features would require implementing large portions of a full terminal emulator, which would shift focus away from the multiplexing and PTY management concepts.\n\n#### Scripting and Automation\n\nThe multiplexer will NOT include a scripting interface, configuration language, or extensive automation capabilities. These features require language design, parser implementation, and API development that would significantly expand the project scope.\n\n| Excluded Feature | Rationale | Alternative |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Configuration Files | File parsing, validation, option management complexity | Compile-time constants and simple runtime options |\n| Command Scripts | Scripting language design, interpreter implementation | Manual command execution or external shell scripts |\n| API/Plugin System | Dynamic loading, plugin architecture, API versioning | Monolithic implementation with fixed feature set |\n| Macro Recording | Command recording, playback, macro management | Manual command repetition or external automation tools |\n| Event Hooks | Event system, callback management, user-defined actions | Fixed behavior with no customization |\n\nAutomation features would require building a complete scripting environment, which is a substantial project in itself and would overshadow the terminal multiplexing learning objectives.\n\n> **Design Philosophy: Learning Focus vs. Feature Completeness**\n> \n> The conscious decision to exclude these advanced features reflects a fundamental principle: this project prioritizes deep understanding of core concepts over broad feature coverage. By limiting scope to PTY management, terminal emulation, window management, and basic user interface, learners can focus on mastering the essential techniques that make terminal multiplexing possible.\n> \n> Each excluded feature represents a potential future learning project. Session persistence could be added as an advanced exercise in daemon programming and IPC. Networking support could become a distributed systems learning project. Advanced terminal features could form the basis for a complete terminal emulator implementation.\n\n#### Performance Optimization\n\nThe multiplexer will NOT include performance optimizations, advanced rendering techniques, or scalability features designed for handling large numbers of panes or high-throughput scenarios.\n\n| Excluded Feature | Rationale | Alternative |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Efficient Rendering | Screen damage tracking, differential updates, rendering optimization | Simple full-screen refresh for clarity |\n| Memory Optimization | Custom allocators, memory pooling, buffer recycling | Standard malloc/free with focus on correctness |\n| High Pane Counts | Tree balancing, layout optimization, resource scaling | Limit to `MAX_PANES` reasonable for learning |\n| Asynchronous I/O | epoll/kqueue, async event handling, high-concurrency support | Simple select-based synchronous I/O |\n| Buffer Compression | Scrollback compression, memory-efficient storage | Fixed-size buffers with reasonable limits |\n\nPerformance optimization would introduce algorithmic complexity and system-specific code that would obscure the fundamental concepts being taught. The focus remains on correctness and clarity over efficiency.\n\n### Requirements Validation\n\nThe functional requirements and non-goals work together to create a coherent learning experience that builds understanding progressively while maintaining reasonable project scope. Each included feature directly supports one or more of the core learning objectives: PTY handling, terminal escape sequences, and process management.\n\nThe milestone structure maps directly to these requirements:\n\n- **Milestone 1 (PTY Creation)** addresses PTY management and session handling requirements\n- **Milestone 2 (Terminal Emulation)** addresses terminal emulation and display requirements  \n- **Milestone 3 (Window Management)** addresses window management and layout requirements\n- **Milestone 4 (Key Bindings and UI)** addresses user interface and key binding requirements\n\nError handling and robustness requirements span all milestones, ensuring that each component includes appropriate failure detection and recovery mechanisms.\n\n> **Validation Principle**: Every functional requirement must satisfy two criteria: (1) it teaches a fundamental concept in terminal multiplexing, and (2) it can be implemented and tested within the milestone structure. Every non-goal must satisfy two criteria: (1) excluding it doesn't prevent learning the core concepts, and (2) including it would add complexity that outweighs its educational value.\n\nThe resulting feature set provides a complete, working terminal multiplexer that demonstrates all essential concepts while remaining implementable as a learning project. Users will be able to split panes, run multiple shell sessions, navigate between panes, and perform basic terminal operations - sufficient functionality to understand how production multiplexers work internally.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis section provides concrete direction for translating the goals and requirements into working code, focusing on the architectural decisions and technology choices that support the defined scope.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| PTY Management | `posix_openpt()` with manual setup | `forkpty()` from libutil |\n| Terminal I/O | `select()` with blocking I/O | `epoll`/`kqueue` async I/O |\n| Escape Parsing | Hand-written state machine | libvterm or similar library |\n| Screen Buffers | 2D character arrays | Optimized line-based storage |\n| Layout Management | Recursive tree with fixed splits | Dynamic layout with weights |\n| Configuration | Compile-time constants | Runtime config file parsing |\n\nFor this learning project, consistently choose the simple options. The goal is understanding the underlying mechanisms, not building the most efficient implementation. Using `posix_openpt()` teaches PTY allocation explicitly, while `forkpty()` hides the educational details. Hand-writing the escape sequence parser reveals how terminal emulation works, while using libvterm treats it as a black box.\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe implementation should organize code to reflect the component architecture and support incremental development through the milestone structure.\n\n```\nterminal-multiplexer/\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.c                    ← Entry point and main event loop\n│   ├── pty_manager.c            ← PTY creation and process management (Milestone 1)\n│   ├── pty_manager.h\n│   ├── terminal_emulator.c      ← Escape sequence parsing and screen buffers (Milestone 2)\n│   ├── terminal_emulator.h\n│   ├── window_manager.c         ← Pane layout and rendering (Milestone 3)\n│   ├── window_manager.h\n│   ├── input_handler.c          ← Key bindings and command processing (Milestone 4)\n│   ├── input_handler.h\n│   ├── types.h                  ← Core data structures and constants\n│   └── utils.c                  ← Utility functions and error handling\n│   └── utils.h\n├── tests/\n│   ├── test_pty_manager.c       ← Unit tests for PTY functionality\n│   ├── test_terminal_emulator.c ← Parser and buffer tests\n│   ├── test_window_manager.c    ← Layout and rendering tests\n│   └── integration_test.c       ← End-to-end multiplexer tests\n├── Makefile                     ← Build configuration\n└── README.md                    ← Usage instructions and examples\n```\n\nThis structure allows implementing and testing each component independently while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

These structures form the foundation for all multiplexer functionality:\n\n```c\n// types.h - Complete type definitions for terminal multiplexer\n\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <termios.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\n// Terminal character cell with attributes and colors\ntypedef struct {\n    char ch;                    // Character to display (UTF-8 support limited to ASCII for simplicity)\n    unsigned char attributes;   // Bit flags for bold, underline, reverse\n    unsigned char fg_color;     // Foreground color (0-255)\n    unsigned char bg_color;     // Background color (0-255)\n} terminal_cell_t;\n\n// Virtual screen buffer for one pane\ntypedef struct {\n    terminal_cell_t *cells;     // 2D array stored as 1D: cells[row * width + col]\n    int width;                  // Current screen width in characters\n    int height;                 // Current screen height in characters\n    int cursor_x;               // Current cursor column position\n    int cursor_y;               // Current cursor row position\n    int scroll_offset;          // Number of lines scrolled up from bottom\n    terminal_cell_t **scrollback; // Array of scrollback lines\n    int scrollback_lines;       // Number of lines currently in scrollback\n    unsigned char current_attributes; // Current text attributes for new characters\n    unsigned char current_fg_color;   // Current foreground color\n    unsigned char current_bg_color;   // Current background color\n} screen_buffer_t;\n\n// PTY session managing one shell process\ntypedef struct {\n    int master_fd;              // File descriptor for PTY master\n    int slave_fd;               // File descriptor for PTY slave (used during setup)\n    pid_t child_pid;            // Process ID of shell running in this PTY\n    bool process_running;       // True if child process is still alive\n    int exit_status;            // Exit status if process has terminated\n} pty_session_t;\n\n// Terminal state management for raw mode\ntypedef struct {\n    struct termios original_termios; // Original terminal attributes for restoration\n    bool raw_mode_active;           // True if terminal is currently in raw mode\n} terminal_state_t;\n\n// Error codes for multiplexer operations\ntypedef enum {\n    TMUX_OK = 0,\n    TMUX_ERROR_PTY_ALLOCATION,\n    TMUX_ERROR_PROCESS_SPAWN,\n    TMUX_ERROR_TERMINAL_SETUP,\n    TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION\n} tmux_error_t;\n```\n\nThese structures provide the complete data model needed for all four milestones. Each structure includes all fields that will be needed, even if early milestones don't use them immediately.\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\nProvide complete utility functions that handle the non-educational but necessary infrastructure:\n\n```c\n// utils.c - Complete utility functions\n\n#include \"utils.h\"\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\n// Get current terminal window size\ntmux_error_t terminal_get_size(int *width, int *height) {\n    struct winsize ws;\n    if (ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &ws) == -1) {\n        return TMUX_ERROR_TERMINAL_SETUP;\n    }\n    *width = ws.ws_col;\n    *height = ws.ws_row;\n    return TMUX_OK;\n}\n\n// Initialize screen buffer with given dimensions\ntmux_error_t screen_buffer_init(screen_buffer_t *buffer, int width, int height) {\n    buffer->width = width;\n    buffer->height = height;\n    buffer->cursor_x = 0;\n    buffer->cursor_y = 0;\n    buffer->scroll_offset = 0;\n    buffer->current_attributes = 0;\n    buffer->current_fg_color = COLOR_WHITE;\n    buffer->current_bg_color = COLOR_BLACK;\n    \n    // Allocate main screen buffer\n    buffer->cells = calloc(width * height, sizeof(terminal_cell_t));\n    if (!buffer->cells) {\n        return TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION;\n    }\n    \n    // Allocate scrollback buffer\n    buffer->scrollback = calloc(MAX_SCROLLBACK, sizeof(terminal_cell_t *));\n    if (!buffer->scrollback) {\n        free(buffer->cells);\n        return TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION;\n    }\n    buffer->scrollback_lines = 0;\n    \n    // Initialize all cells to default state\n    for (int i = 0; i < width * height; i++) {\n        buffer->cells[i].ch = ' ';\n        buffer->cells[i].attributes = 0;\n        buffer->cells[i].fg_color = COLOR_WHITE;\n        buffer->cells[i].bg_color = COLOR_BLACK;\n    }\n    \n    return TMUX_OK;\n}\n\n// Enter raw terminal mode, saving original state\ntmux_error_t terminal_enter_raw_mode(terminal_state_t *state) {\n    // TODO: Implement raw mode setup\n    // Hint: Use tcgetattr to save original, tcsetattr to set raw mode\n    // Disable canonical mode, echo, signals, special character processing\n}\n\n// Restore original terminal attributes\ntmux_error_t terminal_restore_mode(terminal_state_t *state) {\n    // TODO: Implement terminal restoration\n    // Hint: Use tcsetattr with saved original_termios\n    // This is CRITICAL - must be called on exit or terminal will be unusable\n}\n```\n\nThis infrastructure code handles memory management, terminal sizing, and basic buffer operations that are necessary but not the core learning focus.\n\n#### Core Component Skeletons\n\nFor each major component, provide function signatures with detailed TODO comments that map to the architectural concepts:\n\n```c\n// pty_manager.h - PTY management interface\n\n// Create new PTY session with shell process\ntmux_error_t pty_session_create(pty_session_t *session, const char *shell_command) {\n    // TODO 1: Open PTY master using posix_openpt(O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY)\n    // TODO 2: Grant access to slave with grantpt(master_fd)\n    // TODO 3: Unlock slave PTY with unlockpt(master_fd)\n    // TODO 4: Get slave device name with ptsname(master_fd)\n    // TODO 5: Fork child process\n    // TODO 6: In child: call setsid() to create new session\n    // TODO 7: In child: open slave PTY and set as controlling terminal\n    // TODO 8: In child: dup2 slave to stdin/stdout/stderr\n    // TODO 9: In child: exec shell command\n    // TODO 10: In parent: store child PID and master FD\n    // Pitfall: Must call setsid() before opening slave, or controlling terminal setup fails\n    // Pitfall: Close slave FD in parent process to avoid blocking on child exit\n}\n\n// Read data from PTY master (shell output)\nssize_t pty_session_read(pty_session_t *session, char *buffer, size_t size) {\n    // TODO 1: Check if process is still running using kill(pid, 0)\n    // TODO 2: Use read() on master_fd with non-blocking I/O\n    // TODO 3: Handle EAGAIN for non-blocking reads\n    // TODO 4: Handle EOF when child process exits\n    // TODO 5: Update process_running status on errors\n    // Hint: Use fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) for non-blocking I/O\n}\n\n// Write data to PTY master (user input to shell)\nssize_t pty_session_write(pty_session_t *session, const char *data, size_t length) {\n    // TODO 1: Verify process is still running\n    // TODO 2: Use write() on master_fd\n    // TODO 3: Handle partial writes by tracking bytes written\n    // TODO 4: Handle EPIPE if child process has exited\n    // Pitfall: write() may not write all bytes at once - must loop for partial writes\n}\n```\n\nEach TODO comment corresponds to a specific step in the algorithms described in the design sections, providing clear implementation guidance while leaving the actual coding as a learning exercise.\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nDefine specific verification criteria for each milestone:\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - PTY Creation:**\n- Compile with: `make && ./terminal-multiplexer`\n- Expected behavior: Single pane shows shell prompt, can execute commands\n- Test command: `ls -la` should show directory listing in pane\n- Verification: `ps aux | grep bash` shows child shell process\n- Signs of trouble: \"No PTY\" errors indicate allocation failure, zombie processes indicate cleanup issues\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint - Terminal Emulation:**\n- Test command: `echo -e \"\\033[31mRed Text\\033[0m\"` should show colored text\n- Test cursor movement: `echo -e \"\\033[10;5HPositioned\"` should place text at specific location\n- Test clear screen: `clear` command should blank the pane\n- Verification: Screen buffer contents match expected terminal state\n- Signs of trouble: Garbled text indicates parser issues, missing colors indicate attribute handling problems\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint - Window Management:**\n- Key sequence: Prefix key + `%` should create vertical split\n- Key sequence: Prefix key + `\"` should create horizontal split\n- Key sequence: Prefix key + arrow keys should switch between panes\n- Verification: Each pane runs independent shell, borders drawn correctly\n- Signs of trouble: Overlapping content indicates rendering issues, shared input indicates focus problems\n\n**Milestone 4 Checkpoint - Complete Interface:**\n- Status bar shows current pane number and time\n- All key bindings respond correctly\n- Terminal restoration works on exit (Ctrl-C or normal quit)\n- Verification: Full multiplexer functionality matches specification\n- Signs of trouble: Unusable terminal after exit indicates restoration failure\n\n#### Language-Specific Implementation Notes\n\nFor C implementation, key technical considerations:\n\n- **PTY Allocation**: Use `posix_openpt()` rather than opening `/dev/ptmx` directly for portability\n- **Signal Handling**: Install `SIGCHLD` handler to detect child process termination: `signal(SIGCHLD, child_handler)`\n- **Non-blocking I/O**: Use `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` on PTY master to prevent blocking reads\n- **Terminal Control**: Save terminal state with `tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &original)` before entering raw mode\n- **Memory Management**: Use `calloc()` for screen buffers to ensure clean initialization\n- **Error Handling**: Check all system call return values - PTY operations can fail in various ways\n\n#### Common Implementation Pitfalls\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|------------------|-----|\n| \"Permission denied\" on PTY | Missing `grantpt()` call | Check PTY creation sequence | Call `grantpt()` after `posix_openpt()` |\n| Child processes become zombies | No `SIGCHLD` handler | Check `ps aux` for zombie processes | Install signal handler to `waitpid()` |\n| Terminal corrupted on exit | Raw mode not restored | Terminal requires reset after program exit | Always call `terminal_restore_mode()` in cleanup |\n| Input not reaching shell | Slave PTY not set as controlling terminal | Shell doesn't respond to input | Call `setsid()` in child before opening slave |\n| Partial screen updates | Inefficient rendering | Text appears gradually or incorrectly | Implement double-buffering or complete screen refresh |\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - this section establishes the architectural foundation that guides implementation across the entire project\n\n### Component Overview: The Four Main Components\n\n#### Mental Model: The Orchestra Conductor\n\nThink of a terminal multiplexer as an orchestra conductor coordinating four specialized musicians. Each musician has a distinct role but must work in perfect harmony to create a seamless performance. The **PTY Manager** is like the string section - creating the fundamental sound (shell sessions) that everything else builds upon. The **Terminal Emulator** acts as the woodwinds - interpreting and translating the musical score (escape sequences) into meaningful display changes. The **Window Manager** serves as the brass section - providing structure and visual organization that makes the performance coherent to the audience. Finally, the **Input Handler** functions as the percussion - keeping time and routing control signals that coordinate the entire ensemble.\n\nJust as a conductor must understand each section's capabilities and limitations while maintaining perfect timing between them, our multiplexer architecture must carefully orchestrate data flow between these four components while preserving the illusion that each shell session has a dedicated terminal.\n\n#### The PTY Manager Component\n\nThe **PTY Manager** serves as the foundation of our terminal multiplexer, responsible for creating and maintaining the pseudo-terminal pairs that enable shell sessions to run independently. This component encapsulates all the complex details of PTY allocation, process spawning, and session lifecycle management that form the core of Milestone 1.\n\nThe PTY Manager maintains a collection of active sessions, each represented by a `pty_session_t` structure that tracks the master and slave file descriptors, child process ID, and session state. When a new pane is created, the PTY Manager allocates a fresh pseudo-terminal pair using `posix_openpt()`, configures the terminal attributes to match the current terminal settings, and forks a child process that will run the shell session.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Key Data Structures |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| PTY Allocation | Create master/slave PTY pairs with proper permissions | `pty_session_t` with `master_fd`, `slave_fd` fields |\n| Process Spawning | Fork child processes and exec shells with PTY as controlling terminal | `child_pid`, `process_running` fields |\n| Session Lifecycle | Track process state, handle SIGCHLD, manage session termination | `exit_status` field, signal handlers |\n| I/O Management | Provide read/write interface for PTY master file descriptors | Buffer management, non-blocking I/O |\n| Terminal Sizing | Forward TIOCSWINSZ ioctl calls to adjust PTY dimensions | Window size change propagation |\n\nThe PTY Manager abstracts away the complexity of pseudo-terminal management from other components. When the Window Manager needs to create a new pane, it simply calls `pty_session_create()` and receives a ready-to-use session structure. When the Terminal Emulator needs to send input to a shell, it uses `pty_session_write()` without concerning itself with file descriptor management or process state.\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: The PTY Manager acts as a protective barrier between the multiplexer and the underlying Unix process model. By encapsulating all PTY and process management logic in this component, we can change process handling strategies (like adding process group management or session persistence) without affecting the rest of the system.\n\n#### The Terminal Emulator Component  \n\nThe **Terminal Emulator** transforms the raw output streams from shell processes into structured screen representations that can be displayed and manipulated. This component implements the complex logic of Milestone 2, parsing ANSI escape sequences and maintaining virtual screen buffers for each active pane.\n\nAt its heart, the Terminal Emulator contains a finite state machine that processes character streams byte by byte, distinguishing between printable characters that should appear on screen and control sequences that modify cursor position, text attributes, or screen content. The parser maintains state across multiple input chunks, handling cases where escape sequences span buffer boundaries or arrive incomplete.\n\n| Parser State | Purpose | Transitions | Actions Taken |\n|-------------|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| NORMAL_TEXT | Processing regular printable characters | ESC → ESCAPE_START | Add characters to screen buffer at cursor position |\n| ESCAPE_START | Detected ESC byte, waiting for sequence type | '[' → CSI_PARAMS, 'O' → SS3_SEQUENCE | Set up sequence parsing context |\n| CSI_PARAMS | Collecting numeric parameters for CSI sequences | '0'-'9', ';' → CSI_PARAMS, 'A'-'Z' → NORMAL_TEXT | Build parameter list, execute cursor/display commands |\n| OSC_SEQUENCE | Processing Operating System Command sequences | '\\x07' or '\\x1b\\\\' → NORMAL_TEXT | Handle title changes, color settings |\n\nEach pane maintains its own `screen_buffer_t` structure that represents the current display state. The screen buffer contains a two-dimensional array of `terminal_cell_t` structures, each storing a character along with its display attributes (bold, underline, colors). The Terminal Emulator updates this buffer in response to parsed escape sequences, handling cursor movement, text insertion, line scrolling, and screen clearing operations.\n\nThe Terminal Emulator also manages a scrollback buffer that preserves lines that scroll off the top of the visible area. This buffer enables users to review previous command output and supports copy mode functionality where users can select and copy text from the scrollback history.\n\n> **Critical Architecture Decision**: We maintain separate screen buffers per pane rather than trying to multiplex output at the character level. This design allows each pane to have independent scrollback history, cursor state, and display attributes while simplifying the rendering logic that composes multiple panes into terminal output.\n\n#### The Window Manager Component\n\nThe **Window Manager** orchestrates the visual layout of multiple panes within the terminal window, implementing the sophisticated space allocation and rendering logic required for Milestone 3. This component treats the terminal screen as a canvas that must be dynamically partitioned among competing panes while providing visual feedback about pane boundaries and focus state.\n\nThe Window Manager employs a tree-based layout algorithm where each node represents either a leaf pane containing a shell session or an internal split node that divides available space between its children. Split nodes can be either horizontal (dividing space top-to-bottom) or vertical (dividing space left-to-right), creating a recursive partitioning system that can represent arbitrarily complex layouts.\n\n| Layout Node Type | Data Fields | Responsibilities |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Leaf Pane | `session_ptr`, `screen_buffer`, `is_focused` | Render single pane content with borders |\n| Horizontal Split | `top_child`, `bottom_child`, `split_ratio` | Divide height between children, handle resize |\n| Vertical Split | `left_child`, `right_child`, `split_ratio` | Divide width between children, handle resize |\n\nWhen the terminal window is resized, the Window Manager recalculates the entire layout tree, propagating new dimensions down to leaf panes and updating the corresponding PTY sizes through `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl calls. This ensures that shell programs receive accurate terminal dimensions and can adjust their output accordingly.\n\nThe Window Manager's rendering pipeline processes the layout tree in depth-first order, compositing each pane's screen buffer into the final terminal output. It draws border characters between adjacent panes, highlights the currently focused pane with visual indicators, and reserves space for a status bar that displays pane information and system status.\n\n> **Space Management Philosophy**: The Window Manager treats screen real estate as a precious resource that must be allocated fairly while respecting minimum usability constraints. Each pane must be large enough to display at least one line of shell output, but beyond that minimum, space is distributed proportionally based on user-initiated resize operations.\n\n#### The Input Handler Component\n\nThe **Input Handler** manages the critical task of routing keyboard input between the multiplexer's control functions and the active shell sessions, implementing the sophisticated input processing required for Milestone 4. This component must operate in raw terminal mode to capture all keystrokes while providing a clean abstraction that separates multiplexer commands from normal terminal input.\n\nThe Input Handler implements a two-mode system: **pass-through mode** where keystrokes are forwarded directly to the focused pane's shell, and **command mode** triggered by a configurable prefix key (typically Ctrl-b). In command mode, the Input Handler interprets subsequent keystrokes as multiplexer commands for pane management, window navigation, and system control.\n\n| Input Mode | Trigger | Key Bindings | Destination |\n|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| Pass-through | Default state | All keys except prefix | Active pane's PTY session |\n| Command Mode | Prefix key pressed | 'c' → new pane, 'h/j/k/l' → navigate, '%' → vsplit | Window Manager operations |\n| Copy Mode | Command + '[' | Arrow keys → cursor, Space → select, Enter → copy | Screen buffer navigation |\n\nThe Input Handler maintains a registry of key bindings that maps keystroke sequences to multiplexer functions. This registry supports both single-character commands and multi-character sequences, allowing for sophisticated key binding schemes that don't conflict with normal shell usage. The component also handles special keys like arrow keys and function keys that generate multi-byte escape sequences.\n\nRaw terminal mode management represents one of the Input Handler's most critical responsibilities. When the multiplexer starts, it must save the current terminal attributes using `tcgetattr()`, switch to raw mode to disable line buffering and special character processing, and ensure that original terminal settings are restored even if the program exits unexpectedly due to signals or errors.\n\n> **Input Routing Complexity**: The challenge isn't just capturing keystrokes - it's maintaining the illusion that each shell session has a dedicated terminal while intercepting just enough input to provide multiplexer functionality. This requires careful coordination between raw terminal mode, signal handling, and prefix key detection.\n\n### Component Interaction Patterns\n\nThe four components interact through well-defined interfaces that maintain clear separation of concerns while enabling efficient data flow. The PTY Manager produces character streams from shell processes, the Terminal Emulator consumes these streams and produces structured screen buffers, the Window Manager consumes screen buffers and produces terminal output, and the Input Handler coordinates the entire process by routing commands and managing system state.\n\n| Data Flow Path | Source Component | Destination Component | Data Format | Frequency |\n|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Shell Output | PTY Manager | Terminal Emulator | Raw byte streams with escape sequences | Continuous during shell activity |\n| Screen Updates | Terminal Emulator | Window Manager | Structured screen buffers with cursor state | After each escape sequence batch |\n| Terminal Rendering | Window Manager | Terminal (stdout) | Composed display with borders and status | On screen buffer changes |\n| User Input | Input Handler | PTY Manager | Filtered keystroke streams | Real-time during user interaction |\n| Control Commands | Input Handler | Window Manager | Split, resize, focus commands | On prefix key sequences |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Event-Driven Coordination**\n> - **Context**: Components need to coordinate without tight coupling while maintaining responsive performance\n> - **Options Considered**: Direct method calls, message passing, shared memory, event-driven with select()\n> - **Decision**: Event-driven architecture using select() for I/O multiplexing with direct method calls for control operations\n> - **Rationale**: Select-based I/O handles multiple PTY file descriptors efficiently while direct calls provide synchronous control operations without message passing overhead\n> - **Consequences**: Enables responsive input handling and efficient resource utilization but requires careful state management across components\n\n### Recommended Module Structure\n\nThe terminal multiplexer implementation should be organized into focused modules that correspond directly to the architectural components while providing clean separation between interface definitions and implementation details.

Lower-level modules provide services to higher-level modules without requiring knowledge of their clients' implementation details.\n\n| Module Layer | Components | Dependencies | Exports |\n|-------------|------------|--------------|---------|\n| Foundation | `tmux_types.h`, `tmux_constants.h`, `utils/` | Standard C library only | Core data structures, error codes, utilities |\n| Session Layer | `pty_manager/` | Foundation layer | PTY allocation, session management, I/O operations |\n| Processing Layer | `terminal_emulator/` | Foundation + Session layers | Escape sequence parsing, screen buffer management |\n| Presentation Layer | `window_manager/` | Foundation + Processing layers | Layout algorithms, rendering pipeline |\n| Control Layer | `input_handler/` | All lower layers | Input routing, command processing, terminal control |\n| Application Layer | `main.c` | All layers | Event loop coordination, program lifecycle |\n\n#### Interface Design Principles\n\nEach module exposes its functionality through header files that define clean interfaces without exposing implementation details. The interfaces use consistent naming conventions and error handling patterns that make the system easy to understand and extend.\n\n**PTY Manager Interface** (`pty_manager/pty_manager.h`):\nThe PTY Manager interface provides session lifecycle management without exposing file descriptor details or process management complexity to client code.\n\n| Function Signature | Purpose | Error Conditions |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------|\n| `tmux_error_t pty_session_create(pty_session_t* session, const char* shell_command)` | Allocate PTY pair and spawn shell process | `TMUX_ERROR_PTY_ALLOCATION`, `TMUX_ERROR_PROCESS_SPAWN` |\n| `tmux_error_t pty_session_read(pty_session_t* session, char* buffer, size_t size, ssize_t* bytes_read)` | Non-blocking read from PTY master | `TMUX_ERROR_IO`, end-of-file conditions |\n| `tmux_error_t pty_session_write(pty_session_t* session, const char* data, size_t length)` | Write data to PTY master | `TMUX_ERROR_IO`, broken pipe conditions |\n| `bool pty_session_is_alive(const pty_session_t* session)` | Check if child process is still running | Never fails, returns false for terminated processes |\n| `tmux_error_t pty_session_destroy(pty_session_t* session)` | Clean up session resources and terminate child | `TMUX_ERROR_CLEANUP` if cleanup partially fails |\n\n**Terminal Emulator Interface** (`terminal_emulator/terminal_emulator.h`):\nThe Terminal Emulator interface focuses on transforming character streams into screen buffer updates while hiding the complexity of escape sequence parsing.\n\n| Function Signature | Purpose | Error Conditions |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------|\n| `tmux_error_t screen_buffer_init(screen_buffer_t* buffer, int width, int height)` | Initialize screen buffer with dimensions | `TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` |\n| `tmux_error_t screen_buffer_process_input(screen_buffer_t* buffer, const char* data, size_t length)` | Parse input and update screen buffer | `TMUX_ERROR_INVALID_SEQUENCE` for malformed escape codes |\n| `tmux_error_t screen_buffer_resize(screen_buffer_t* buffer, int new_width, int new_height)` | Resize buffer and adjust cursor bounds | `TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` |\n| `tmux_error_t screen_buffer_get_line(const screen_buffer_t* buffer, int line_num, terminal_cell_t** cells, int* length)` | Get rendered line for display | `TMUX_ERROR_INVALID_LINE` for out-of-bounds access |\n\n> **Design Philosophy: Minimal Surface Area**: Each module interface exposes only the functions necessary for other components to use its services. Internal helper functions, data structure manipulation, and implementation details remain private to the module. This approach reduces coupling and makes the system easier to test and modify.\n\n#### Compilation and Linking Strategy\n\nThe modular structure supports efficient development workflows where individual components can be compiled and tested independently. The build system uses static libraries for each major component, enabling parallel compilation and selective rebuilding when source files change.\n\n| Build Target | Components | Link Dependencies | Purpose |\n|-------------|------------|------------------|---------|\n| `libpty.a` | `pty_manager/` modules | `libc` | PTY session management library |\n| `libemulator.a` | `terminal_emulator/` modules | `libc` | Terminal emulation and screen buffer library |\n| `libwindow.a` | `window_manager/` modules | `libc`, `libemulator.a` | Window layout and rendering library |\n| `libinput.a` | `input_handler/` modules | `libc`, `libtermios` | Input processing and terminal control library |\n| `tmux` | `main.c` | All static libraries | Final executable with event loop |\n\n#### Error Propagation Architecture\n\nThe module structure implements consistent error handling that enables graceful failure recovery while providing detailed diagnostic information for debugging. Each module defines its own error codes within the global `tmux_error_t` enumeration, and errors propagate up the call stack with context preservation.\n\n| Error Category | Error Codes | Handling Strategy | Recovery Actions |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|\n| System Resource | `TMUX_ERROR_PTY_ALLOCATION`, `TMUX_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` | Immediate failure with cleanup | Attempt graceful shutdown, restore terminal state |\n| Process Management | `TMUX_ERROR_PROCESS_SPAWN`, `TMUX_ERROR_SIGNAL_SETUP` | Session-level failure | Close affected pane, continue with other sessions |\n| I/O Operations | `TMUX_ERROR_IO`, `TMUX_ERROR_TERMINAL_SETUP` | Retry with backoff | Buffer data temporarily, retry operation |\n| Data Validation | `TMUX_ERROR_INVALID_SEQUENCE`, `TMUX_ERROR_INVALID_LINE` | Skip invalid data | Continue processing, log diagnostic information |\n\n> **Error Handling Insight**: Terminal multiplexers must be extremely robust because users rely on them for critical shell sessions that shouldn't be lost due to minor errors. The modular error handling allows the system to isolate failures to individual panes or functions while maintaining overall system stability.\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in Module Organization\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Circular Dependencies Between Components**\nA common mistake is allowing the Terminal Emulator to call Window Manager functions or the PTY Manager to depend on Input Handler state. This creates circular dependencies that make the code difficult to compile and test. Always design dependencies to flow in one direction: Control Layer → Presentation Layer → Processing Layer → Session Layer → Foundation Layer.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Exposing Implementation Details Through Headers**\nAnother frequent error is putting internal data structures or helper functions in public header files. This creates unnecessary coupling where changes to internal implementation require recompiling all dependent modules. Keep implementation details in `.c` files and only expose the minimal interface needed by other components.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Handling Across Modules**\nDifferent modules using different error reporting mechanisms (return codes vs. global variables vs. callbacks) makes the system difficult to debug and maintain. Establish consistent error handling patterns early and enforce them across all modules through code review and testing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Monolithic Data Structures**\nCreating giant structures that contain fields for multiple components violates encapsulation and makes the code harder to understand. Each module should own its data structures and provide accessor functions for other components that need to interact with that data.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations Table\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| PTY Management | POSIX `posix_openpt()` with manual setup | BSD `forkpty()` with automatic configuration |\n| Terminal Control | Raw `tcgetattr()`/`tcsetattr()` calls | ncurses `termios` wrapper functions |\n| Screen Buffers | Simple 2D character arrays | Memory pools with copy-on-write optimization |\n| Layout Algorithm | Fixed-ratio binary tree splits | Flexible constraint-based layout engine |\n| Event Loop | Basic `select()` with manual FD management | `epoll()` or `kqueue()` for high-performance scaling |\n| Error Handling | Simple return codes with `errno` | Structured error objects with stack traces |\n\nFor learning purposes, start with the simple options and upgrade individual components as needed. The simple approaches expose the underlying Unix APIs more directly, which helps build understanding of the core concepts.\n\n#### Recommended File Structure Implementation\n\n```c\n// src/tmux_types.h -

these set proper permissions\n- Use `ptsname()` to get the slave PTY device name for the child process\n- Set master FD to non-blocking with `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)`\n- Handle `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` errors when reading from non-blocking PTY master\n\n**Terminal Control in C:**\n- Save original terminal state with `tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &original_termios)`\n- Enter raw mode by copying original state and modifying flags: `cfmakeraw(&raw_termios)`\n- Use `atexit()` to register cleanup function that calls `tcsetattr()` to restore terminal\n- Handle `SIGWINCH` signal to detect terminal resize events\n- Use `ioctl(fd, TIOCGWINSZ, &winsize)` to get current terminal dimensions\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Use memory pools for screen buffers to avoid fragmentation from frequent resize operations\n- Implement reference counting for scrollback lines that may be shared between panes\n- Use `mmap()` for large scrollback buffers that can be swapped to disk if memory is limited\n- Always pair `malloc()`/`free()` calls and check for allocation failures\n\n**Signal Handling:**\n- Install handlers for `SIGCHLD` to detect when child shell processes exit\n- Handle `SIGWINCH` for terminal resize events that need to propagate to PTY slaves\n- Use `signalfd()` or `self-pipe trick` to integrate signals into select() event loop\n- Block signals during critical sections like PTY allocation to prevent race conditions\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint (PTY Creation):**\nAfter implementing the PTY Manager, verify functionality with this test:\n```bash\n# Compile just the PTY manager components\nmake libpty.a\n\n# Run unit tests\n./tests/unit/test_pty_manager\n\n# Expected behavior:\n# - Creates PTY session successfully  \n# - Forks shell process that responds to input\n# - Can write \"echo hello\\n\" and read back \"hello\" from PTY\n# - Properly cleans up child process on session destroy\n```\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint (Terminal Emulation):**\nTest escape sequence parsing with known sequences:\n```bash\n# Send test escape sequences to screen buffer\necho -e \"\\033[2J\\033[H\\033[1mBold Text\\033[0m\" | ./test_emulator\n\n# Expected behavior:\n# - Screen buffer clears (all cells become spaces)\n# - Cursor moves to home position (0,0)\n# - Text \"Bold Text\" appears with ATTR_BOLD flag set\n# - Subsequent text has normal attributes after reset sequence\n```\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint (Window Management):**\nVerify pane splitting and layout algorithms:\n```bash\n# Test pane splitting functionality\n./tmux_test -split-vertical -split-horizontal\n\n# Expected behavior:\n# - Creates 3 panes in tree layout\n# - Each pane has independent shell session\n# - Border characters drawn between panes\n# - Focus switching changes active pane highlighting\n```\n\n**Milestone 4 Checkpoint (Key Bindings):**\nTest complete multiplexer functionality:\n```bash\n# Start multiplexer and test key bindings\n./tmux\n\n# In the multiplexer, test:\n# Ctrl-b c → creates new pane\n# Ctrl-b % → splits current pane vertically  \n# Ctrl-b h/j/k/l → switches focus between panes\n# All other keys → forwarded to active shell\n```\n\n#### Debugging Tips\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----|\n| PTY allocation fails | Insufficient permissions or system limits | Check `ulimit -n`, run with strace | Increase file descriptor limits, check /dev/pts mount |\n| Child process becomes zombie | Not calling waitpid() for terminated children | Check process table with `ps aux` | Install SIGCHLD handler, call waitpid() with WNOHANG |\n| Terminal corrupted on exit | Raw mode not restored properly | Terminal shows strange characters | Use atexit() handler, always call tcsetattr() in cleanup |\n| Escape sequences not parsed | State machine stuck in wrong state | Log parser state transitions | Reset parser state on timeout, handle incomplete sequences |\n| Pane borders misaligned | Layout calculation error | Print pane dimensions to debug log | Verify width/height arithmetic, check for integer overflow |\n| Input not reaching shell | Raw mode capturing all keystrokes | Shell doesn't respond to commands | Check prefix key detection, verify PTY write operations |\n\n\n## Data Model\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - this section defines the core data structures that underpin PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)\n\n### Mental Model: The Information Warehouse\n\nThink of the terminal multiplexer's data model as a well-organized warehouse that stores different types of information in specialized containers. Just as a warehouse has sections for raw materials, work-in-progress items, and finished products, our multiplexer organizes data into distinct categories: session information (tracking active shell processes), visual state (what appears on screen), layout information (how panes are arranged), and system state (terminal configuration).\n\nEach \"container\" in our warehouse serves a specific purpose and has a defined structure. The **session containers** hold everything needed to communicate with shell processes - file descriptors, process IDs, and status information. The **visual containers** store the current appearance of each terminal screen - every character, color, and cursor position. The **layout containers** define how multiple sessions share screen real estate. Finally, the **system containers** preserve the original terminal configuration so we can restore it when exiting.\n\nThe key insight is that these containers must work together seamlessly. When a shell process writes output, it flows from session containers through parsing logic into visual containers, which then get composited by layout containers for display. This separation of concerns allows each component to focus on its specific responsibility while maintaining clear interfaces between them.\n\n![Core Data Structures](./diagrams/data-model.svg)\n\n### Session and Pane Structures\n\nThe session and pane structures form the foundation for managing multiple shell processes and organizing them visually. These structures bridge the gap between the low-level pseudo-terminal interfaces and the higher-level windowing abstractions that users interact with.\n\n#### PTY Session Structure\n\nThe `pty_session_t` structure encapsulates everything needed to manage a single shell session running in a pseudo-terminal. This structure serves as the primary interface between the multiplexer and individual shell processes.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `master_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for PTY master device, used for reading shell output and writing user input |\n| `slave_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for PTY slave device, connected to child process stdin/stdout/stderr |\n| `child_pid` | `pid_t` | Process ID of the shell process running in this session |\n| `process_running` | `bool` | Flag indicating whether child process is still alive and responsive |\n| `exit_status` | `int` | Exit code from child process after termination (valid only when process_running is false) |\n\nThe master file descriptor serves as the multiplexer's primary interface to the shell process. All data written to the master appears on the slave's stdout, and all data written to the slave's stdin appears when reading from the master. This bidirectional pipe abstraction allows the multiplexer to intercept and process all terminal I/O.\n\nThe slave file descriptor is typically only used during session creation to configure terminal attributes and establish the controlling terminal relationship. Once the child process starts, the multiplexer closes its copy of the slave descriptor, leaving only the child process with access.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The `process_running` flag provides a fast path for checking process liveness without making system calls. It's updated asynchronously when SIGCHLD signals arrive, avoiding the need to call `waitpid()` on every I/O operation.\n\n#### Pane Structure\n\nPanes represent the visual organization of sessions within the terminal window. Each pane contains a session, screen buffer, and layout information that determines how it appears to the user.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `int` | Unique identifier for this pane within the current window |\n| `session` | `pty_session_t` | PTY session running in this pane |\n| `buffer` | `screen_buffer_t` | Virtual screen buffer storing current display state |\n| `x` | `int` | Left column position of pane within terminal (0-based) |\n| `y` | `int` | Top row position of pane within terminal (0-based) |\n| `width` | `int` | Width of pane content area in characters (excluding borders) |\n| `height` | `int` | Height of pane content area in characters (excluding borders) |\n| `has_focus` | `bool` | Whether this pane currently receives keyboard input |\n| `needs_redraw` | `bool` | Flag indicating pane content has changed and requires re-rendering |\n| `border_style` | `int` | Border appearance (none, simple, double-line) |\n\nThe coordinate system uses zero-based indexing with the origin at the top-left corner of the terminal. The `width` and `height` fields represent the usable content area, excluding any border characters. This separation simplifies the rendering logic by providing consistent dimensions regardless of border style.\n\nThe `needs_redraw` flag implements a simple optimization to avoid unnecessary rendering. Components set this flag when modifying pane content, and the renderer clears it after updating the display. This prevents wasted CPU cycles re-rendering unchanged panes.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Embedding the session directly in the pane structure (rather than using a pointer or ID reference) simplifies memory management and ensures session lifetime matches pane lifetime. This prevents dangling pointer bugs that could occur if sessions were managed separately.\n\n#### Window Structure\n\nWindows provide the top-level container for organizing multiple panes. Each window maintains its own pane layout and can be switched independently.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `id` | `int` | Unique identifier for this window |\n| `name` | `char[64]` | Human-readable name displayed in status bar |\n| `panes` | `pane_t[MAX_PANES]` | Array of panes within this window |\n| `pane_count` | `int` | Number of active panes in the panes array |\n| `active_pane` | `int` | Index of currently focused pane in panes array |\n| `layout_tree` | `layout_node_t*` | Root of binary tree describing pane split structure |\n| `last_activity` | `time_t` | Timestamp of most recent activity in any pane |\n\nThe panes array uses a fixed-size allocation to simplify memory management and prevent fragmentation. The `MAX_PANES` constant (16) provides reasonable flexibility while avoiding the complexity of dynamic allocation.\n\nThe layout tree represents the hierarchical structure of pane splits. Each internal node represents a split (horizontal or vertical), while leaf nodes represent individual panes. This tree structure enables efficient resize calculations and maintains split proportions when the terminal size changes.\n\n#### Layout Node Structure\n\nLayout nodes form a binary tree that describes how panes are arranged within a window. This tree-based approach provides flexible layout capabilities while maintaining efficient resize and rendering operations.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `type` | `layout_type_t` | Node type: LAYOUT_LEAF (pane), LAYOUT_HSPLIT (horizontal), or LAYOUT_VSPLIT (vertical) |\n| `pane_id` | `int` | Pane identifier (valid only for leaf nodes) |\n| `split_ratio` | `float` | Proportion of space allocated to left/top child (0.0 to 1.0) |\n| `left` | `layout_node_t*` | Left or top child node (NULL for leaf nodes) |\n| `right` | `layout_node_t*` | Right or bottom child node (NULL for leaf nodes) |\n| `parent` | `layout_node_t*` | Parent node (NULL for root) |\n\nThe split ratio determines how available space is divided between child nodes. A ratio of 0.3 allocates 30% of space to the left/top child and 70% to the right/bottom child. This proportional system maintains layout balance when the terminal is resized.\n\nParent pointers enable efficient upward traversal during resize operations. When a pane requests a size change, the algorithm walks up the tree to find the appropriate split node and adjusts ratios accordingly.\n\n### Terminal State Structures\n\nTerminal state structures maintain the visual representation of shell output and the system-level terminal configuration. These structures bridge the gap between raw character streams from shell processes and the formatted display that users see.\n\n#### Screen Buffer Structure\n\nThe `screen_buffer_t` structure represents the complete visual state of a single terminal session. It maintains both the currently visible screen and the scrollback history that users can navigate.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `cells` | `terminal_cell_t**` | 2D array of screen cells, indexed as cells[row][column] |\n| `width` | `int` | Screen buffer width in characters (matches pane width) |\n| `height` | `int` | Screen buffer height in characters (matches pane height) |\n| `cursor_x` | `int` | Current cursor column position (0-based) |\n| `cursor_y` | `int` | Current cursor row position (0-based) |\n| `scroll_offset` | `int` | Number of lines scrolled up from bottom of scrollback |\n| `scrollback` | `terminal_cell_t**` | Scrollback buffer storing lines that scrolled off screen |\n| `scrollback_lines` | `int` | Current number of lines stored in scrollback buffer |\n| `current_attributes` | `byte` | Active text attributes (bold, underline, reverse) |\n| `current_fg_color` | `byte` | Active foreground color (0-15 for standard colors) |\n| `current_bg_color` | `byte` | Active background color (0-15 for standard colors) |\n\nThe cells array provides random access to any screen position for efficient cursor movement and text rendering. The two-dimensional indexing simplifies coordinate calculations and bounds checking during escape sequence processing.\n\nThe scrollback buffer operates as a circular buffer that preserves lines as they scroll off the top of the visible screen. The `scroll_offset` field allows users to navigate this history without losing the current screen state. When `scroll_offset` is zero, the user sees the live terminal output. Positive values show historical lines.\n\nCurrent attribute fields maintain the terminal's text formatting state. These values apply to all subsequently written characters until modified by escape sequences. Separating these from individual cell attributes enables efficient processing of long runs of similarly formatted text.\n\n> **Design Insight**: Using a 2D array rather than a single linear buffer simplifies indexing calculations and reduces the likelihood of buffer overflow bugs. The memory overhead is minimal compared to the safety benefits.\n\n#### Terminal Cell Structure\n\nThe `terminal_cell_t` structure represents a single character position on the terminal screen, including the character itself and all associated display attributes.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `ch` | `char` | Unicode character at this cell position (UTF-8 encoded) |\n| `attributes` | `byte` | Bitmask of text attributes (bold, underline, reverse video) |\n| `fg_color` | `byte` | Foreground color index (0-255 for extended color support) |\n| `bg_color` | `byte` | Background color index (0-255 for extended color support) |\n\nThe character field stores a single UTF-8 code unit. For multi-byte Unicode characters, the first cell contains the complete UTF-8 sequence while subsequent cells in the character are marked with a special continuation value. This approach maintains simple indexing while supporting international characters.\n\nThe attributes field uses individual bits to represent different text formatting options:\n\n| Attribute | Bit Position | Description |\n|-----------|--------------|-------------|\n| `ATTR_BOLD` | 0 | Bold or bright text rendering |\n| `ATTR_UNDERLINE` | 1 | Underlined text decoration |\n| `ATTR_REVERSE` | 2 | Swap foreground and background colors |\n\nColor fields support both the standard 16-color palette and extended 256-color mode. Standard colors use values 0-15, while extended colors utilize the full 0-255 range. The special value `COLOR_DEFAULT` (9) indicates the terminal's default color scheme should be used.\n\n#### Terminal State Structure\n\nThe `terminal_state_t` structure preserves the original terminal configuration to enable proper restoration when the multiplexer exits. Raw terminal mode significantly alters the terminal's behavior, making restoration critical for system stability.\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `original_termios` | `struct termios` | Terminal attributes before entering raw mode |\n| `raw_mode_active` | `bool` | Flag indicating whether raw mode is currently enabled |\n\nThe `termios` structure contains all terminal configuration parameters, including input processing flags, output processing flags, control character definitions, and line discipline settings. Preserving this complete state ensures perfect restoration regardless of the user's custom terminal configuration.\n\nThe `raw_mode_active` flag prevents double-initialization and ensures proper cleanup. Attempting to enter raw mode when already active, or restore mode when not active, can cause undefined behavior or system instability.\n\n### Data Structure Relationships\n\nUnderstanding how these structures interconnect is crucial for implementing the multiplexer correctly. The relationships follow a clear hierarchy that mirrors the user's conceptual model of the system.\n\n#### Ownership and Lifetime Management\n\nWindows own panes, panes own sessions and screen buffers, and sessions own PTY file descriptors. This ownership hierarchy ensures proper resource cleanup and prevents memory leaks:\n\n1. **Window Lifetime**: Created when user creates new window, destroyed when user closes window or multiplexer exits\n2. **Pane Lifetime**: Created when splitting existing pane or creating first pane in window, destroyed when user closes pane\n3. **Session Lifetime**: Created with pane, destroyed when shell process exits or pane is closed\n4. **Buffer Lifetime**: Matches pane lifetime, allocated during pane creation, freed during pane cleanup\n\n#### Data Flow Patterns\n\nData flows through these structures in predictable patterns that correspond to the main multiplexer operations:\n\n**Shell Output Processing**:\n1. Data arrives on PTY master file descriptor in `pty_session_t`\n2. Escape sequence parser processes raw bytes and updates `screen_buffer_t`\n3. Window manager composites multiple buffers for display\n4. Terminal output renderer converts screen buffers to terminal escape sequences\n\n**User Input Processing**:\n1. Raw keyboard input arrives from terminal\n2. Input handler checks for prefix key combinations and command mode\n3. Regular input routes to active pane's `pty_session_t`\n4. Data writes to PTY master file descriptor reach shell process\n\n**Window Management Operations**:\n1. Split commands create new `pane_t` and `pty_session_t` structures\n2. Layout tree updates with new `layout_node_t` reflecting split\n3. Existing panes resize to accommodate new pane\n4. Screen buffers resize to match new pane dimensions\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Embedded vs Referenced Structures**\n> - **Context**: Structures can either embed related structures directly or reference them through pointers/IDs\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Direct embedding (session embedded in pane)\n>   - Pointer references (pane points to session)\n>   - ID-based lookup (pane stores session ID)\n> - **Decision**: Use direct embedding for session-in-pane, pointer references for layout tree\n> - **Rationale**: Embedding simplifies lifetime management and prevents null pointer dereferences. Pointers used only where tree structure requires it.\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher memory usage, but significantly reduced complexity and improved safety\n\n#### Memory Layout Considerations\n\nThe structures are designed to minimize memory fragmentation and cache misses during common operations. Related data is co-located, and frequently accessed fields are positioned early in structures to improve cache performance.\n\nFixed-size arrays (like the panes array in windows) prevent heap fragmentation that could occur with dynamic allocation. The `MAX_PANES` limit is generous enough for typical usage while keeping memory usage predictable.\n\nCircular buffer management for scrollback uses efficient modular arithmetic rather than shifting array contents. This provides O(1) insertion performance regardless of scrollback buffer size.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\n> **Decision: Fixed vs Dynamic Array Sizes**\n> - **Context**: Collections like panes within windows could use fixed arrays or dynamic allocation\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Fixed arrays with compile-time maximums\n>   - Dynamic arrays with reallocation\n>   - Linked lists with individual node allocation\n> - **Decision**: Fixed arrays with reasonable limits (`MAX_PANES` = 16)\n> - **Rationale**: Eliminates allocation failures, prevents fragmentation, simplifies memory management, provides predictable performance\n> - **Consequences**: Memory usage slightly higher, but eliminates entire classes of runtime errors and complexity\n\n> **Decision: Screen Buffer Organization**\n> - **Context**: Screen buffers could be organized as 2D arrays, linear arrays, or sparse data structures\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - 2D array indexed as `buffer[row][column]`\n>   - Linear array with calculated offsets\n>   - Sparse representation storing only non-blank cells\n> - **Decision**: 2D array with direct indexing\n> - **Rationale**: Simplifies coordinate calculations, eliminates offset bugs, provides O(1) random access, matches natural mental model\n> - **Consequences**: Uses more memory for sparse screens, but provides simpler and more reliable implementation\n\n> **Decision: UTF-8 Character Handling**\n> - **Context**: Unicode characters can span multiple bytes, requiring special handling in terminal cells\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Store complete UTF-8 sequences in each cell\n>   - Use wide characters (wchar_t) for internal representation\n>   - Mark continuation cells with special values\n> - **Decision**: Store UTF-8 in first cell, mark continuations with special marker\n> - **Rationale**: Maintains byte-oriented processing, supports full Unicode range, preserves simple indexing model\n> - **Consequences**: Requires special handling during cursor movement and editing operations\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting to Initialize Screen Buffer Cells**\nWhen allocating a new screen buffer, uninitialized cells may contain random memory values that appear as garbage characters on screen. Always initialize cells with space characters, default colors, and no attributes. Use `memset()` or explicit loops to ensure clean initialization.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Buffer Overflow During Screen Resize**\nWhen terminal dimensions change, existing screen buffers may be smaller than the new size. Accessing cells beyond the old dimensions causes buffer overflows. Always reallocate and initialize screen buffers before updating width/height fields.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Cursor Position Tracking**\nThe cursor position in the screen buffer must stay synchronized with the PTY's actual cursor position. Escape sequences that move the cursor must update both the internal tracking variables and send appropriate sequences to the PTY. Mismatches cause visual artifacts and incorrect text placement.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Layout Tree Management**\nLayout nodes are dynamically allocated and form a tree structure with complex ownership relationships. Failing to properly traverse and free the entire tree during cleanup causes memory leaks. Implement recursive cleanup functions that handle both leaf and internal nodes correctly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Process Status Updates**\nThe `process_running` flag is updated asynchronously by signal handlers when child processes exit. Reading this flag without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions where the multiplexer thinks a process is still running after it has exited. Use atomic operations or proper locking when accessing process status.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Scrollback Buffer Circular Index Errors**\nCircular buffers require careful index management to wrap correctly at buffer boundaries. Off-by-one errors in modular arithmetic cause buffer overruns or incorrect data retrieval. Always use consistent wrap-around logic and validate indices before array access.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

Hints\n\n**C Implementation Tips:**\n- Use `posix_openpt()` instead of opening `/dev/ptmx` directly for better portability\n- Always call `grantpt()` and `unlockpt()` after `posix_openpt()` before accessing slave\n- Use `setsid()` in child process before opening slave device to establish controlling terminal\n- Set up signal handlers with `sigaction()`, not `signal()`, for reliable behavior\n- Use `tcgetattr()`/`tcsetattr()` to save/restore terminal attributes\n- Consider using `select()` or `poll()` to multiplex between multiple PTY master file descriptors\n\n**Memory Management:**\n- Use `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for structure initialization to zero\n- Always check allocation return values before using pointers\n- Implement cleanup functions that can handle partially initialized structures\n- Use consistent naming for cleanup functions: `*_destroy()` or `*_cleanup()`\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**After implementing basic data structures:**\n- Compile with `gcc -Wall -Wextra src/data_model/*.c tests/test_data_model.c -o test_data_model`\n- Run `./test_data_model` - should show successful structure allocation/deallocation\n- Check with `valgrind

Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (PTY Creation) - this section establishes the foundational PTY management capabilities that enable all subsequent terminal multiplexer functionality\n\n### Mental Model: The Process Nursery\n\nUnderstanding PTYs requires thinking of the PTY Manager as a **process nursery** that creates isolated environments where child processes believe they have dedicated terminals. Just as a hospital nursery provides controlled environments for newborns, the PTY Manager creates controlled terminal environments for shell processes.\n\nIn the physical world, a terminal was historically a physical device with a keyboard and screen connected to a mainframe computer. Modern operating systems simulate this hardware relationship using **pseudo-terminals** (PTYs), which consist of a master-slave pair. The master side acts like the \"computer end\" of the terminal connection, while the slave side acts like the \"terminal hardware\" that the shell process sees.\n\nThink of the PTY Manager as operating a nursery where each \"crib\" (PTY pair) contains a sleeping child process (shell). The nursery attendant (PTY Manager) can communicate with each child through a window (master file descriptor) while the child believes it has its own private room (slave terminal). When a child writes to what it thinks is its terminal screen, those writes actually go to the master side where our multiplexer can intercept, process, and route them. Similarly, when we want to send keyboard input to a specific child, we write to the master and the operating system delivers it to the slave as if it came from a real keyboard.\n\nThis isolation is crucial because each shell process needs to believe it has complete control over its terminal. It needs to set terminal attributes, handle terminal signals, and manage cursor positioning without interference from other shells. The PTY Manager maintains this illusion while secretly coordinating multiple such environments through a single real terminal interface.\n\n### PTY Manager Interface\n\nThe PTY Manager provides a clean interface for creating, managing, and destroying pseudo-terminal sessions. Each session encapsulates a shell process running in its own controlled terminal environment. The interface abstracts away the complex details of PTY allocation, process forking, and file descriptor management.\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| `pty_session_create` | `session: pty_session_t*`, `shell_command: char*` | `tmux_error_t` | Creates new PTY pair, forks child process, and starts shell with proper session setup |\n| `pty_session_read` | `session: pty_session_t*`, `buffer: char*`, `size: size_t` | `ssize_t` | Reads output from shell process via PTY master, returns bytes read or -1 on error |\n| `pty_session_write` | `session: pty_session_t*`, `data: char*`, `length: size_t` | `ssize_t` | Sends input to shell process via PTY master, returns bytes written or -1 on error |\n| `pty_session_resize` | `session: pty_session_t*`, `width: int`, `height: int` | `tmux_error_t` | Updates PTY terminal size and notifies child process via SIGWINCH signal |\n| `pty_session_is_alive` | `session: pty_session_t*` | `bool` | Checks if child process is still running using non-blocking waitpid |\n| `pty_session_get_exit_status` | `session: pty_session_t*` | `int` | Returns exit status of terminated child process, or -1 if still running |\n| `pty_session_terminate` | `session: pty_session_t*`, `signal: int` | `tmux_error_t` | Sends signal to child process (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, etc.) |\n| `pty_session_destroy` | `session: pty_session_t*` | `tmux_error_t` | Cleans up PTY file descriptors, reaps child process, and frees resources |\n\nThe `pty_session_t` structure maintains all state necessary for managing a single shell session:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `master_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for PTY master device, used for reading shell output and writing input |\n| `slave_fd` | `int` | File descriptor for PTY slave device, typically closed after fork in parent process |\n| `child_pid` | `pid_t` | Process ID of forked shell child, used for signal delivery and status monitoring |\n| `process_running` | `bool` | Flag indicating whether child process is still alive, updated by SIGCHLD handler |\n| `exit_status` | `int` | Exit code returned by child process after termination, obtained via waitpid |\n\nThe interface design prioritizes simplicity and safety. Each function returns explicit error codes rather than relying on global errno values. The session structure encapsulates all necessary state, avoiding global variables that could complicate multi-session management. File descriptor ownership is clear: the PTY Manager owns the master descriptor while the child process owns the slave.\n\n### PTY Creation and Management\n\nThe PTY creation process involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of system calls that must be executed in the correct order to establish proper session leadership and terminal ownership. The algorithm handles the complex interaction between PTY allocation, process forking, and session management.\n\n![PTY Creation and Process Spawning Flow](./diagrams/pty-creation-flow.svg)\n\nThe PTY creation algorithm follows these essential steps:\n\n1. **PTY Master Allocation**: The system allocates a PTY master device using `posix_openpt(O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY)`. The `O_NOCTTY` flag prevents the PTY from becoming the controlling terminal of the current process. This returns a file descriptor for the master side of the PTY pair.\n\n2. **PTY Master Configuration**: The master device requires permission and ownership setup through `grantpt()` and `unlockpt()` system calls. These functions configure the slave device permissions and make it available for opening by child processes.\n\n3. **Slave Device Path Resolution**: The `ptsname()` function returns the filesystem path to the corresponding slave device (typically `/dev/pts/N` where N is a number). This path will be used by the child process to open its terminal device.\n\n4. **Process Fork**: The parent process forks using `fork()`, creating an identical child process. At this point, both processes have access to the master file descriptor, but only the child will open and use the slave.\n\n5. **Child Process Session Setup**: The child process must establish itself as a session leader before opening the slave terminal. It calls `setsid()` to create a new session and process group, making itself the session leader with no controlling terminal.\n\n6. **Slave Terminal Acquisition**: The child opens the slave device using the path obtained from `ptsname()`. This open operation establishes the slave PTY as the child's controlling terminal because the child is a session leader without an existing controlling terminal.\n\n7. **Standard File Descriptor Redirection**: The child duplicates the slave file descriptor to stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr (2) using `dup2()`. This ensures all shell I/O operations use the PTY slave device.\n\n8. **Shell Process Execution**: The child executes the shell program using `execve()` or similar, replacing its process image with the shell while preserving the PTY file descriptors and session relationship.\n\n9. **Parent Cleanup**: The parent process closes its copy of the slave file descriptor (since it will never use it) and stores the master descriptor and child PID in the session structure for ongoing management.\n\nThe terminal attribute configuration requires special attention. The PTY slave initially inherits default terminal settings that may not be appropriate for shell interaction. The child process typically configures terminal attributes using `tcsetattr()` to enable features like canonical input processing, signal generation, and proper character echo behavior.\n\nWindow size initialization is critical for proper shell operation. Many shell programs and applications query terminal dimensions to format their output appropriately. The PTY Manager must set initial window size using the `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl on the master file descriptor, typically matching the current terminal's dimensions.\n\nSignal handling configuration affects both parent and child processes. The parent must install a `SIGCHLD` handler to detect child process termination asynchronously. The child inherits the parent's signal disposition but may modify signal handling after becoming a session leader, particularly for terminal-related signals like `SIGINT`, `SIGTSTP`, and `SIGWINCH`.\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe PTY Manager design involves several critical architectural decisions that affect system reliability, performance, and complexity. Each decision represents a trade-off between different technical approaches with distinct advantages and limitations.\n\n> **Decision: PTY Allocation Method**\n> - **Context**: Multiple system interfaces exist for PTY allocation, including BSD-style `openpty()`, System V-style `getpt()`, and POSIX `posix_openpt()`. Each has different portability characteristics and feature sets.\n> - **Options Considered**: Direct `/dev/ptmx` access, `openpty()` library function, `posix_openpt()` system call\n> - **Decision**: Use `posix_openpt()` for PTY master allocation\n> - **Rationale**: POSIX `posix_openpt()` provides standardized behavior across Unix systems while giving explicit control over flags like `O_NOCTTY`. Unlike `openpty()`, it doesn't hide important setup steps, making the code more educational and debuggable.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires explicit calls to `grantpt()` and `unlockpt()`, but provides better error handling granularity and clearer understanding of the PTY setup process.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| `openpty()` | Handles setup automatically, very simple API | Hides important setup steps, less portable | No |\n| `posix_openpt()` | POSIX standard, explicit control, good error handling | Requires manual grantpt/unlockpt calls | **Yes** |\n| Direct `/dev/ptmx` | Maximum control, no library dependencies | Non-portable, complex permission handling | No |\n\n> **Decision: Child Process Monitoring Strategy**\n> - **Context**: The parent process must track child process lifecycle to detect termination, collect exit status, and prevent zombie processes. Options include synchronous monitoring, asynchronous signal handling, or hybrid approaches.\n> - **Options Considered**: Blocking `waitpid()` calls, `SIGCHLD` signal handler with `waitpid()`, polling with `WNOHANG`\n> - **Decision**: Asynchronous `SIGCHLD` signal handler combined with non-blocking status checks\n> - **Rationale**: Signal-driven monitoring provides immediate notification of child state changes without blocking the main event loop. Non-blocking `waitpid(WNOHANG)` allows status collection without race conditions.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful signal handler implementation to avoid race conditions, but provides responsive child process management without blocking I/O operations.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Blocking `waitpid()` | Simple, reliable | Blocks event loop, poor responsiveness | No |\n| `SIGCHLD` handler | Immediate notification, non-blocking | Complex signal handling, race conditions | **Yes** |\n| Polling approach | Simple, no signals | Delayed detection, CPU overhead | No |\n\n> **Decision: File Descriptor Management Strategy**\n> - **Context**: PTY file descriptors must be managed carefully across fork operations, with clear ownership boundaries between parent and child processes. Poor management leads to descriptor leaks or broken communication.\n> - **Options Considered**: Shared descriptors, exclusive ownership, descriptor passing protocols\n> - **Decision**: Exclusive ownership with immediate cleanup after fork\n> - **Rationale**: Parent owns master descriptor exclusively, child owns slave exclusively. Each process closes descriptors it doesn't need immediately after fork, preventing leaks and eliminating ambiguity about responsibility.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires disciplined descriptor management but eliminates most file descriptor related bugs and simplifies debugging.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Shared descriptors | Flexible access patterns | Complex ownership, race conditions | No |\n| Exclusive ownership | Clear responsibility, no races | Requires careful handoff protocol | **Yes** |\n| Descriptor passing | Dynamic ownership transfer | Complex implementation, error-prone | No |\n\n> **Decision: Terminal Size Handling Approach**\n> - **Context**: Terminal applications need accurate window size information to format output correctly. Size changes must be propagated from the real terminal through the multiplexer to child processes.\n> - **Options Considered**: Static size initialization, periodic size polling, signal-driven size updates\n> - **Decision**: Signal-driven size updates with `SIGWINCH` propagation\n> - **Rationale**: The multiplexer catches `SIGWINCH` signals indicating terminal resize, updates PTY sizes using `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl, and relies on the kernel to deliver `SIGWINCH` to child processes automatically.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides responsive resize handling without polling overhead, but requires proper signal handling setup and careful coordination between global and per-PTY size management.\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons | Chosen? |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Static size | Simple, no coordination needed | Poor user experience, broken applications | No |\n| Periodic polling | Eventually consistent | Delayed response, CPU overhead | No |\n| Signal-driven | Immediate response, efficient | Complex signal handling coordination | **Yes** |\n\n### Common PTY Pitfalls\n\nPTY management involves numerous subtle requirements that frequently trip up developers implementing terminal multiplexers. These pitfalls often manifest as mysterious hangs, broken terminal behavior, or resource leaks that are difficult to debug without understanding the underlying PTY semantics.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting setsid() in Child Process**\n\nMany developers attempt to open the PTY slave device in the child process without first calling `setsid()` to establish session leadership. This causes the `open()` call to fail because a process can only acquire a controlling terminal if it's a session leader without an existing controlling terminal.\n\nThe symptom is that child processes fail to start properly, often with \"Operation not permitted\" errors when attempting to open the slave device. The root cause is that the child process inherited the parent's session and process group, making it ineligible to acquire a new controlling terminal.\n\nThe fix requires calling `setsid()` in the child process before opening the slave device. This system call creates a new session with the child as session leader, creates a new process group, and detaches from any existing controlling terminal. After `setsid()`, the child can successfully open the PTY slave and establish it as the controlling terminal.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks Across Fork**\n\nA common mistake is failing to close unused file descriptors after forking, leading to resource leaks and communication problems. The parent process should never hold the slave file descriptor, and the child should close the master descriptor immediately after fork.\n\nWhen file descriptors leak across the fork boundary, several problems occur. The parent holding a slave descriptor prevents proper EOF detection when the child terminates. The child holding a master descriptor can interfere with the parent's I/O operations and prevents proper cleanup.\n\nThe solution is disciplined descriptor management: immediately after fork, the parent closes the slave descriptor and keeps only the master. The child closes the master descriptor and uses only the slave for its stdin/stdout/stderr redirection. This creates clean ownership boundaries and prevents interference.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Terminal Attribute Configuration**\n\nPTY slave devices inherit default terminal attributes that are often inappropriate for interactive shell use. Failing to configure attributes like canonical mode, echo settings, and signal generation leads to shells that behave strangely or don't respond to user input properly.\n\nThe child process should configure terminal attributes using `tcgetattr()` and `tcsetattr()` after opening the slave device but before executing the shell. Common settings include enabling canonical input processing (so users can edit command lines), configuring appropriate echo behavior, and ensuring signal generation for Ctrl-C and similar key combinations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Improper SIGCHLD Handling**\n\nInadequate child process monitoring leads to zombie processes that consume system resources and prevent accurate session status tracking. The `SIGCHLD` signal handler must properly reap terminated children using `waitpid()` while avoiding race conditions.\n\nThe signal handler should use `waitpid(-1, &status, WNOHANG)` in a loop to collect all available child exit statuses without blocking. The `WNOHANG` flag prevents blocking if no children have terminated, while the loop ensures multiple simultaneous child terminations are handled correctly.\n\nRace conditions occur when the main program checks child status while the signal handler is also accessing the same data structures. Use atomic operations or careful locking to coordinate between the signal handler and main program when updating session status.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect Window Size Propagation**\n\nTerminal applications rely on accurate window size information obtained through the `TIOCGWINSZ` ioctl. When the real terminal is resized, this information must be propagated to all PTY sessions, and child processes must be notified via `SIGWINCH` signals.\n\nThe multiplexer should install a `SIGWINCH` handler that updates the window size for all active PTY sessions using the `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl on each master file descriptor. The kernel automatically delivers `SIGWINCH` to child processes when their controlling terminal size changes, so no explicit signal sending is required.\n\nFailure to propagate size changes results in applications that format output for incorrect dimensions, leading to broken display layouts and poor user experience. Terminal-based editors and pagers are particularly sensitive to accurate size information.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking I/O in Event Loop**\n\nUsing blocking I/O operations when reading from PTY master file descriptors can cause the entire multiplexer to hang when one shell produces no output. This destroys the multiplexer's responsiveness and makes it unusable for managing multiple sessions.\n\nAll PTY I/O must be non-blocking, typically achieved by setting the `O_NONBLOCK` flag on master file descriptors and using `select()`, `poll()`, or similar mechanisms to determine when I/O operations can proceed without blocking.\n\nWhen `read()` returns `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`, this indicates no data is currently available, not an error condition. The event loop should simply move on to check other file descriptors rather than retrying the read operation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Error Recovery**\n\nPTY operations can fail in various ways that require graceful handling rather than program termination. Common failure modes include PTY allocation failures (when the system runs out of PTY devices), child process exec failures, and I/O errors on master file descriptors.\n\nWhen PTY allocation fails, the session creation should return an appropriate error code rather than crashing. When child process execution fails, the parent should detect this condition (usually through immediate child termination) and clean up resources appropriately.\n\nI/O errors on master file descriptors often indicate that the child process has terminated and closed the slave device. This is a normal condition that should result in session cleanup rather than error propagation to the user.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe PTY Manager implementation requires careful attention to system call ordering, error handling, and resource management. The following guidance provides concrete starting points for building robust PTY management functionality.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option

specific error information\n- Use `strerror(errno)` to convert error numbers to human-readable messages for debugging\n- The `O_NOCTTY` flag prevents PTY from becoming the controlling terminal of the parent process\n- Set `O_NONBLOCK` on master file descriptors to prevent blocking in the main event loop\n- Use `tcgetattr()` and `tcsetattr()` in child processes to configure terminal attributes appropriately\n- Install a `SIGCHLD` handler in the main program to handle asynchronous child termination\n- Use `sigemptyset()` and `sigaddset()` to create proper signal masks for

session with `/bin/echo \"Hello World\"`:\n\n```bash\ngcc -o test_pty src/pty/*.c src/common/*.c tests/test_pty_manager.c\n./test_pty\n```\n\n**Expected Output**: The test should successfully create a PTY session, read \"Hello World\\n\" from the shell output, detect process termination, and clean up resources without any file descriptor leaks.\n\n**Manual Verification Steps**:\n1. Run `ps aux | grep [your-process]` during execution - should see parent and child processes\n2. Check `/proc/[pid]/fd/` for both processes - parent should have master fd, child should have slave as 0,1,2\n3. After child terminates, `ps aux` should show no zombie processes\n4. Use `lsof` to verify no leaked file descriptors after session cleanup\n\n**Signs of Problems**:\n- Child process appears as `<defunct>` (zombie) - check `SIGCHLD` handling and `waitpid()` calls\n- \"Operation not permitted\" errors - child process needs `setsid()` before opening slave\n- Hanging during read operations - ensure master fd has `O_NONBLOCK` flag set\n- File descriptor leaks - verify both parent and child close unused descriptors after fork\n\n\n## Terminal Emulator Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Terminal Emulation) - this section implements the core terminal emulation capabilities that parse escape sequences and maintain virtual screen buffers for each pane\n\n### Mental Model: The Display Interpreter\n\nUnderstanding terminal emulation requires thinking of it as a specialized interpreter that translates a mixed stream of text and control codes into a two-dimensional display representation. Imagine you're a projectionist at an old movie theater who receives a continuous stream of film frames mixed with handwritten notes about projector settings. The film frames represent regular text characters that should appear on screen, while the handwritten notes are escape sequences that tell you to adjust the projector focus (cursor movement), change the lighting (text attributes), or switch reels (clear screen operations).\n\nJust as the projectionist must separate the film frames from the control notes and apply the settings appropriately, the terminal emulator must parse the incoming byte stream to distinguish between printable characters and escape sequences. The projectionist maintains a mental model of the current screen state - what's currently being displayed, where the focus is, what lighting settings are active - and updates this state based on both the film frames and control notes. Similarly, the terminal emulator maintains a virtual screen buffer that tracks every character position, cursor location, and text attributes, updating this representation as it processes the input stream.\n\nThe key insight is that terminal emulation is fundamentally a **stateful translation process**. Unlike a simple text display that just shows characters as they arrive, a terminal emulator must maintain persistent state about cursor position, text attributes, scrolling regions, and screen contents. Each incoming byte might be part of a multi-byte escape sequence, requiring the emulator to buffer partial sequences until complete commands can be parsed and executed. This stateful nature means the terminal emulator serves as the authoritative source of truth about what each pane's display should look like at any given moment.\n\n### Escape Sequence Parser\n\nThe escape sequence parser forms the core intelligence of the terminal emulator, responsible for distinguishing between regular text and control commands in the incoming byte stream. Modern terminal applications use ANSI escape sequences, which begin with the escape character (ASCII 27) followed by specific character patterns that encode commands for cursor movement, text formatting, and screen manipulation.\n\n![Escape Sequence Parser State Machine](./diagrams/escape-sequence-parser.svg)\n\nThe parser operates as a finite state machine that processes input bytes one at a time, transitioning between different parsing states based on the characters encountered. This approach handles the complexity of escape sequences that can span multiple bytes and include optional numeric parameters.\n\n**Parser State Machine**\n\n| Current State | Input Character | Next State | Action Taken |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|\n| NORMAL | Regular ASCII (32-126) | NORMAL | Add character to screen buffer at cursor position |\n| NORMAL | Escape (27) | ESCAPE | Begin escape sequence, prepare parameter buffer |\n| ESCAPE | '[' (CSI introducer) | CSI_PARAMS | Enter Control Sequence Introducer parsing mode |\n| ESCAPE | ']' (OSC introducer) | OSC_PARAMS | Enter Operating System Command parsing mode |\n| ESCAPE | Any other char | NORMAL | Execute single-character escape, return to normal |\n| CSI_PARAMS | Digits (0-9) | CSI_PARAMS | Accumulate numeric parameter value |\n| CSI_PARAMS | ';' (parameter separator) | CSI_PARAMS | Store current parameter, prepare for next |\n| CSI_PARAMS | Letter (A-Z, a-z) | NORMAL | Execute CSI command with parameters |\n| OSC_PARAMS | Any char except BEL/ESC | OSC_PARAMS | Accumulate OSC string parameter |\n| OSC_PARAMS | BEL (7) or ESC+'\\' | NORMAL | Execute OSC command with string parameter |\n\nThe parser maintains several pieces of state to handle the complexity of escape sequence processing. The parameter buffer stores numeric values extracted from sequences like `\\033[2;5H` (move cursor to row 2, column 5), while the command buffer accumulates the complete escape sequence for logging and debugging purposes. The parser also tracks whether it's in the middle of parsing a multi-byte UTF-8 character, since Unicode characters can span 2-4 bytes and must be handled atomically.\n\n**Core Escape Sequence Types**\n\n| Sequence Pattern | Command Type | Parameters | Description |\n|------------------|--------------|------------|-------------|\n| `\\033[nA` | Cursor Up | n = lines | Move cursor up n lines (default 1) |\n| `\\033[nB` | Cursor Down | n = lines | Move cursor down n lines (default 1) |\n| `\\033[nC` | Cursor Right | n = columns | Move cursor right n columns (default 1) |\n| `\\033[nD` | Cursor Left | n = columns | Move cursor left n columns (default 1) |\n| `\\033[r;cH` | Cursor Position | r = row, c = col | Move cursor to absolute position |\n| `\\033[nJ` | Clear Display | n = mode | Clear screen (0=below, 1=above, 2=all) |\n| `\\033[nK` | Clear Line | n = mode | Clear line (0=right, 1=left, 2=all) |\n| `\\033[nm` | Set Attributes | n = attr code | Set text attributes (bold, color, etc.) |\n| `\\033[s` | Save Cursor | none | Save current cursor position |\n| `\\033[u` | Restore Cursor | none | Restore previously saved cursor position |\n\n> **Decision: State Machine vs. Regular Expression Parser**\n> - **Context**: Need to parse complex, nested escape sequences with optional parameters and variable length\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Finite state machine with explicit state tracking\n>   2. Regular expression matching against buffered input\n>   3. Recursive descent parser with lookahead\n> - **Decision**: Finite state machine with byte-by-byte processing\n> - **Rationale**: State machine handles incomplete sequences gracefully, processes input in real-time without buffering requirements, and provides clear error recovery paths. Regular expressions require complete sequences in buffer and don't handle streaming input well. Recursive descent adds unnecessary complexity for this domain.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables real-time processing of PTY output without latency, handles network delays and partial reads correctly, but requires careful state management and explicit bounds checking\n\nThe escape sequence parser must handle several categories of malformed or incomplete input. Network delays or PTY buffering can cause escape sequences to arrive in fragments, requiring the parser to suspend processing mid-sequence and resume when additional bytes arrive. Invalid parameter values (negative numbers, excessively large coordinates) must be validated and either clamped to valid ranges or ignored entirely. Unknown escape sequences should be silently discarded rather than displayed as literal text, maintaining compatibility with terminal applications that use non-standard extensions.\n\n**UTF-8 Character Handling**\n\nModern terminal applications must support Unicode text, which introduces additional complexity to the parsing process. UTF-8 encodes characters using 1-4 bytes, with the first byte indicating the total character length. The parser must accumulate multi-byte characters completely before adding them to the screen buffer, since partial UTF-8 sequences are invalid and would corrupt the display.\n\n| UTF-8 First Byte | Character Length | Remaining Bytes | Validation Required |\n|------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| 0x00-0x7F | 1 byte | none | ASCII compatibility check |\n| 0xC0-0xDF | 2 bytes | 1 continuation | Valid range 0x80-0x7FF |\n| 0xE0-0xEF | 3 bytes | 2 continuation | Valid range 0x800-0xFFFF |\n| 0xF0-0xF7 | 4 bytes | 3 continuation | Valid range 0x10000-0x10FFFF |\n\nThe UTF-8 decoder maintains a separate state machine that validates character encoding and accumulates bytes until complete characters are formed. Invalid UTF-8 sequences are typically replaced with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) to maintain display integrity while indicating encoding problems.\n\n### Screen Buffer Management\n\nThe screen buffer serves as the virtual representation of each pane's terminal display, maintaining both the current visible content and a scrollback history of previous output. This component translates the parsed escape sequences into concrete changes to the 2D character grid, handles cursor movement and bounds checking, and manages the transition of content between the visible screen and scrollback storage.\n\nThe `screen_buffer_t` structure encapsulates all state necessary to represent a terminal display. The primary `cells` array stores the current visible content as a two-dimensional grid of `terminal_cell_t` structures, each containing a character, its display attributes, and foreground/background colors. The cursor position tracks where the next character will be placed, while the current attribute state determines how new characters will be formatted.\n\n**Screen Buffer Data Structure**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `cells` | `terminal_cell_t**` | Two-dimensional array of character cells (height × width) |\n| `width` | `int` | Current screen width in character columns |\n| `height` | `int` | Current screen height in character rows |\n| `cursor_x` | `int` | Current cursor column position (0-based) |\n| `cursor_y` | `int` | Current cursor row position (0-based) |\n| `scroll_offset` | `int` | Number of lines scrolled up from bottom of scrollback |\n| `scrollback` | `terminal_cell_t**` | Array of scrollback lines (oldest to newest) |\n| `scrollback_lines` | `int` | Current number of lines stored in scrollback buffer |\n| `current_attributes` | `byte` | Active text attributes (bold, underline, etc.) |\n| `current_fg_color` | `byte` | Active foreground color code |\n| `current_bg_color` | `byte` | Active background color code |\n\n**Terminal Cell Structure**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `ch` | `char` | UTF-8 character data (may be first byte of multi-byte sequence) |\n| `attributes` | `byte` | Text formatting attributes (bold, underline, reverse) |\n| `fg_color` | `byte` | Foreground color code (0-255 for 256-color mode) |\n| `bg_color` | `byte` | Background color code (0-255 for 256-color mode) |\n\nThe screen buffer implements several key operations that correspond to the escape sequences parsed from the input stream. Character insertion places new content at the cursor position and advances the cursor, handling line wrapping when the cursor moves past the right edge of the screen. Cursor movement operations update the position while enforcing bounds checking to prevent invalid coordinates. Screen clearing operations reset portions of the character grid to default values (space character with default attributes).\n\n**Screen Buffer Operations**\n\n| Operation | Parameters | Effect | Bounds Handling |\n|-----------|------------|--------|-----------------|\n| Insert Character | `ch`, `attrs`, `fg`, `bg` | Place character at cursor, advance cursor | Wrap to next line at right edge |\n| Move Cursor | `new_x`, `new_y` | Update cursor position | Clamp to valid screen coordinates |\n| Clear Screen | `mode` | Reset cells to default (space + default attrs) | Clear visible area or scrollback |\n| Clear Line | `mode`, `line_num` | Reset line cells to default | Handle partial line clears |\n| Scroll Up | `lines` | Move content up, add new lines at bottom | Transfer top lines to scrollback |\n| Scroll Down | `lines` | Move content down, lose bottom lines | Generally not supported in scrollback |\n| Set Attributes | `attrs`, `fg`, `bg` | Update current formatting state | Apply to subsequent character insertions |\n\n> **Decision: Separate Scrollback vs. Unified Buffer**\n> - **Context**: Need to maintain history of terminal output that exceeds screen height while providing efficient access to visible content\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Separate arrays for visible screen and scrollback history\n>   2. Single large circular buffer containing both visible and historical content\n>   3. Linked list of line structures with separate visible window tracking\n> - **Decision**: Separate arrays with explicit scrollback management\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable memory usage with configurable scrollback limits, enables efficient screen updates without copying historical data, and simplifies cursor movement logic within visible area. Unified buffer would complicate coordinate calculations and waste memory for large scrollback. Linked list adds pointer overhead and cache locality issues.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables fast screen redraws and cursor operations, provides configurable memory usage, but requires explicit management of content transfer between visible screen and scrollback storage\n\nThe scrollback buffer maintains a separate storage area for lines that have scrolled off the top of the visible screen. When the screen scrolls up (either due to newline characters when the cursor is on the bottom row, or explicit scroll escape sequences), the top line of the visible screen transfers to the bottom of the scrollback buffer. This design preserves terminal history while maintaining fast access to the current display content.\n\n**Scrollback Management Algorithm**\n\n1. **Scroll Event Detection**: When cursor moves below bottom row or explicit scroll command received\n2. **Line Transfer**: Copy top visible line to new scrollback entry at end of scrollback array  \n3. **Visible Screen Shift**: Move all visible lines up one position, clear bottom line\n4. **Scrollback Limit Enforcement**: If scrollback exceeds `MAX_SCROLLBACK`, remove oldest line\n5. **Cursor Position Adjustment**: Update cursor coordinates to account for scroll operation\n6. **Redraw Notification**: Mark screen buffer as requiring complete redraw for display\n\nThe screen buffer must handle several edge cases and error conditions during normal operation. Cursor movement commands that specify coordinates outside the valid screen area are clamped to the nearest valid position rather than being rejected entirely. Character insertion at the bottom-right corner of the screen triggers automatic scrolling to make room for additional content. Terminal resize operations require rebuilding the cell arrays with new dimensions while preserving as much existing content as possible.\n\n**Attribute and Color Management**\n\nTerminal text attributes provide formatting capabilities including bold, underline, and color display. The terminal emulator maintains current attribute state that applies to all subsequently inserted characters until changed by escape sequences. This stateful approach means that setting bold text affects all following characters until bold is explicitly disabled.\n\n| Attribute Bit | Constant Name | Visual Effect | Escape Sequence |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| 0 | `ATTR_BOLD` | Bright/thick character display | `\\033[1m` (set), `\\033[22m` (clear) |\n| 1 | `ATTR_UNDERLINE` | Underlined character display | `\\033[4m` (set), `\\033[24m` (clear) |\n| 2 | `ATTR_REVERSE` | Swap foreground/background colors | `\\033[7m` (set), `\\033[27m` (clear) |\n\nColor support in modern terminals typically includes both the basic 8-color ANSI set and extended 256-color mode. The basic colors use specific escape sequence parameters (30-37 for foreground, 40-47 for background), while 256-color mode uses a more complex parameter format with additional color index values.\n\n| Color Code | Color Name | Foreground Escape | Background Escape |\n|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 0 | `COLOR_BLACK` | `\\033[30m` | `\\033[40m` |\n| 1 | `COLOR_RED` | `\\033[31m` | `\\033[41m` |\n| 2 | `COLOR_GREEN` | `\\033[32m` | `\\033[42m` |\n| 3 | `COLOR_YELLOW` | `\\033[33m` | `\\033[43m` |\n| 4 | `COLOR_BLUE` | `\\033[34m` | `\\033[44m` |\n| 5 | `COLOR_MAGENTA` | `\\033[35m` | `\\033[45m` |\n| 6 | `COLOR_CYAN` | `\\033[36m` | `\\033[46m` |\n| 7 | `COLOR_WHITE` | `\\033[37m` | `\\033[47m` |\n| 9 | `COLOR_DEFAULT` | `\\033[39m` | `\\033[49m` |\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe terminal emulator component involves several critical design decisions that significantly impact performance, memory usage, and compatibility with existing terminal applications. These decisions establish the foundation for how escape sequences are processed, how screen content is stored and managed, and how the emulator handles edge cases and error conditions.\n\n> **Decision: Immediate vs. Deferred Screen Updates**\n> - **Context**: Terminal applications generate output at varying rates, from interactive commands to bulk text processing that produces thousands of lines per second\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Update screen buffer immediately as each character/escape sequence is processed\n>   2. Batch updates and apply them periodically during event loop cycles  \n>   3. Queue updates and apply them only when rendering is required\n> - **Decision**: Immediate screen buffer updates with deferred rendering\n> - **Rationale**: Immediate updates maintain accurate terminal state for cursor queries and screen content inspection, while deferred rendering prevents excessive redraw operations during bulk output. This approach separates logical terminal state from display optimization.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables accurate terminal emulation and proper escape sequence handling, provides responsive cursor movement for interactive applications, but requires careful buffer management during high-throughput scenarios\n\n> **Decision: Fixed vs. Dynamic Buffer Allocation** \n> - **Context**: Screen buffers must accommodate terminal resize operations while managing memory efficiently across multiple panes\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Pre-allocate fixed-size buffers based on maximum expected terminal size\n>   2. Dynamically allocate and resize buffers based on current terminal dimensions\n>   3. Use sparse allocation with on-demand page allocation for large buffers\n> - **Decision**: Dynamic allocation with size limits and reallocation on resize\n> - **Rationale**: Dynamic allocation minimizes memory usage for small terminals while supporting resize operations. Size limits prevent excessive memory consumption from malicious or buggy applications. Pre-allocation wastes memory for typical use cases, while sparse allocation adds complexity without significant benefits.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides memory-efficient operation across varying terminal sizes, supports resize operations without data loss, but requires careful error handling for allocation failures and adds complexity to buffer management code\n\n> **Decision: Character-Based vs. Grapheme-Based Text Handling**\n> - **Context**: Modern terminals must support Unicode text including combining characters, emoji, and complex scripts that don't map directly to single character cells\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Store individual Unicode codepoints in each terminal cell\n>   2. Store complete grapheme clusters (user-perceived characters) spanning multiple cells\n>   3. Use UTF-8 byte sequences with variable-width character representation  \n> - **Decision**: Single codepoint per cell with combining character support\n> - **Rationale**: Maintains compatibility with existing terminal applications that assume fixed-width character cells, while providing hooks for combining character attachment. Grapheme clusters would break cursor positioning logic, while UTF-8 bytes complicate character-based operations.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides good compatibility with existing terminal software and predictable cursor behavior, supports basic Unicode display, but may not handle complex scripts perfectly and requires additional logic for wide characters (CJK)\n\n**Buffer Management Architecture**\n\n| Decision Aspect | Option A | Option B | Chosen Option | Rationale |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|\n| Scrollback Storage | Circular buffer | Linear array with compaction | Linear array | Simpler implementation, predictable memory usage |\n| Line Representation | Array of character pointers | Array of complete line structures | Character grid | Direct indexing, cache-friendly access patterns |\n| Memory Allocation | Single large allocation | Per-line allocation | Single allocation per buffer | Reduces fragmentation, faster access |\n| Resize Handling | Preserve all content | Preserve visible content only | Preserve visible + recent scrollback | Balances functionality with implementation complexity |\n\nThe buffer management architecture significantly impacts both performance and memory usage characteristics of the terminal multiplexer. A linear array approach for scrollback provides predictable memory access patterns and simplifies the implementation of scrollback search and content export functionality. The character grid representation enables direct coordinate-based access for cursor operations while maintaining compatibility with terminal applications that assume grid-based positioning.\n\n> **Decision: Escape Sequence Buffer Size and Handling**\n> - **Context**: Escape sequences can vary from single characters to complex sequences with multiple parameters, and applications may send malformed or excessively long sequences\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fixed-size escape sequence buffer with truncation of oversized sequences\n>   2. Dynamic buffer allocation that grows as needed for long sequences\n>   3. Streaming parser that processes parameters without buffering complete sequences\n> - **Decision**: Fixed-size buffer (`ESC_SEQ_BUFFER_SIZE` = 64 bytes) with overflow detection\n> - **Rationale**: Fixed buffer prevents memory exhaustion from malformed input while accommodating all standard ANSI sequences. Dynamic allocation adds complexity and potential attack vectors. Streaming parser works for simple sequences but complicates parameter handling for complex commands.\n> - **Consequences**: Provides robust defense against malformed input and predictable memory usage, handles all standard terminal sequences correctly, but may truncate non-standard extended sequences and requires explicit overflow handling\n\n### Common Emulation Pitfalls\n\nTerminal emulation involves numerous subtle details that can cause compatibility issues with real-world terminal applications. Understanding these common pitfalls helps avoid bugs that may not surface during basic testing but cause problems with specific shell environments or terminal-based applications.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete UTF-8 Character Handling**\n\nA common mistake is treating each incoming byte as a complete character without considering UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. When UTF-8 characters arrive fragmented across multiple read operations from the PTY, the terminal emulator may attempt to display partial characters, resulting in corrupted text display or invalid character encoding.\n\nThe error manifests when processing output from applications that generate Unicode text, particularly when the PTY buffer boundaries split multi-byte characters. For example, a 3-byte UTF-8 character might arrive as two bytes in one read() call and the final byte in the next call. Treating the first two bytes as separate characters corrupts both the incomplete character and subsequent display.\n\n**Correct approach**: Implement a UTF-8 decoder state machine that buffers partial characters until complete sequences are received. Validate UTF-8 sequences and replace invalid encodings with the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) rather than displaying garbage.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cursor Bounds Checking Inconsistencies** \n\nMany implementations inconsistently handle cursor movement that would place the cursor outside the valid screen area. Some escape sequences should clamp cursor coordinates to valid ranges, while others should be ignored entirely, and the behavior often depends on terminal mode settings.\n\nThe most common error is applying uniform bounds checking to all cursor operations. For example, absolute cursor positioning (`\\033[H`) should clamp coordinates to valid ranges, while relative movement (`\\033[A`) should stop at screen edges without wrapping. Additionally, some applications rely on cursor coordinates being preserved even when temporarily invalid, expecting the cursor to become visible again after screen resize or scroll operations.\n\n**Correct approach**: Implement escape sequence specific bounds handling that matches the expected behavior of target terminal types (typically VT100/ANSI). Maintain separate \"logical\" and \"physical\" cursor positions when necessary, and carefully test with applications that use cursor positioning heavily (vim, emacs, htop).\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Escape Sequence Parameter Default Values**\n\nANSI escape sequences often have optional parameters with specific default values when omitted. A frequent mistake is using zero as the default for all parameters, when many sequences use 1 as the default value (e.g., cursor movement distances).\n\nThis error causes applications to behave incorrectly when they omit parameters and expect standard default behavior. For example, `\\033[A` (cursor up with no parameter) should move up one line, not zero lines. Similarly, `\\033[J` (clear screen) should clear from cursor to end when the parameter is omitted.\n\n**Correct approach**: Implement parameter parsing that distinguishes between explicit zero values and missing parameters, applying the correct default value for each escape sequence type. Reference terminal documentation or existing implementations to verify default values for each supported sequence.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Screen Buffer Memory Management During Resize**\n\nTerminal resize operations require careful handling of existing screen content and scrollback history. Common errors include losing scrollback content, corrupting character data during buffer reallocation, or failing to update cursor positions relative to the new screen dimensions.\n\nWhen the terminal width changes, existing line content may need to be rewrapped to fit the new dimensions. Lines that were previously wrapped due to width constraints may need to be joined, while long lines may need new wrap points. Height changes affect how much scrollback content remains accessible and whether the cursor position remains valid.\n\n**Correct approach**: Implement resize operations as atomic transactions that preserve content integrity. Save cursor position relative to content rather than absolute coordinates, handle line rewrapping carefully, and ensure scrollback content transfers correctly to new buffer structures.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Access**\n\nIf the terminal emulator processes PTY input on a different thread from display rendering, race conditions can occur when the screen buffer is modified while being rendered. This leads to corrupted display output or crashes when render code accesses invalid memory.\n\nThe issue is particularly problematic during high-throughput scenarios where PTY output arrives faster than the display can be updated. Without proper synchronization, render operations may see partially updated screen state or encounter buffer reallocations mid-render.\n\n**Correct approach**: Use proper synchronization primitives (mutexes, read-write locks) to protect screen buffer access, or use a single-threaded event loop design that serializes all buffer modifications. If using separate threads, consider double-buffering techniques where updates occur on a background buffer that's atomically swapped during render operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Attribute State Persistence Across Operations**\n\nTerminal text attributes (bold, color, etc.) should persist across cursor movements and other non-printing operations, but many implementations incorrectly reset attributes during certain escape sequence processing. This causes applications that set formatting and then move the cursor to lose their formatting state.\n\nThe error typically occurs in parsers that treat attribute-setting sequences as separate from cursor operations, rather than understanding that attribute state is global terminal state that persists until explicitly changed.\n\n**Correct approach**: Maintain attribute state separately from cursor operations and screen content. Only modify attribute state when processing specific attribute-setting escape sequences (`\\033[m` and variations), and ensure that cursor movement, scrolling, and other operations preserve the current attribute state for subsequent character insertion.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe terminal emulator component bridges parsed escape sequences and visual display, requiring careful attention to state management, performance, and compatibility. This implementation focuses on correctness and clarity while providing the necessary performance for real-time terminal applications.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option |

storage across platforms\n- Employ `memmove()` rather than `memcpy()` when copying overlapping screen buffer regions during scroll operations\n- Implement proper UTF-8 validation to prevent buffer overruns from malformed multi-byte sequences\n- Use `calloc()` for screen buffer allocation to ensure cells are zero-initialized with default attributes\n- Consider using `likely()`/`unlikely()` compiler hints for the normal character path vs. escape sequence processing if performance becomes critical\n\n**Milestone Checkpoint: Terminal Emulation Verification**\n\nAfter implementing the terminal emulator component, verify correct operation with these tests:\n\n**Basic Character Display**: Run `echo \"Hello World\"` and confirm characters appear at correct cursor positions with proper advancement. Test UTF-8 characters with `echo \"Ñoël 中文\"` to verify multi-byte character handling.\n\n**Cursor Movement**: Test cursor positioning with `printf \"\\033[5;10HTest\"` (should place \"Test\" at row 5, column 10). Verify bounds checking with coordinates outside screen area.\n\n**Screen Clearing**: Test `clear` command or `printf \"\\033[2J\"` to verify screen clearing operation. Test line clearing with `printf \"\\033[K\"` at various cursor positions.\n\n**Text Attributes**: Test color and formatting with `printf \"\\033[1;31mBold Red\\033[0m Normal\"`. Verify attribute persistence across cursor movements.\n\n**High-throughput Output**: Test with `cat /dev/urandom | hexdump -C` or similar to verify parser handles rapid escape sequence streams without corruption.\n\n**Signs of Problems**: Characters appearing in wrong positions indicate cursor logic errors. Corrupted display during rapid output suggests parser state machine issues. Missing colors/attributes indicate attribute handling problems. Crashes during UTF-8 text suggest character decoder issues.\n\n\n## Window Manager Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 3 (Window Management) - this section implements the pane splitting, layout calculation, and multi-pane rendering capabilities that allow multiple shell sessions to share screen real estate\n\n### Mental Model: The Space Organizer\n\nUnderstanding the window manager component requires thinking about it as a sophisticated space organizer, similar to how a building architect divides floor space among different rooms and tenants. Just as an architect must efficiently partition a fixed building footprint among competing space requirements while maintaining proper circulation and structural integrity, the window manager must dynamically partition the finite terminal screen real estate among multiple competing shell sessions while maintaining usable dimensions and clear visual separation.\n\nConsider the analogy of a newspaper layout editor working on a fixed page size. The editor receives requests for different article spaces—some need wide columns for text, others need square regions for photos, and advertisements demand specific aspect ratios. The editor must split the available page space using horizontal and vertical dividers, ensuring each allocated region meets minimum size requirements while maximizing space utilization. When new content arrives, existing allocations must be resized to make room, but no region can shrink below its minimum viable dimensions.\n\nThe window manager operates under similar constraints with additional complexity. Unlike a static newspaper layout, the terminal window manager must handle dynamic changes—new panes appear when users split existing ones, panes disappear when shells exit, users actively resize regions, and the entire terminal window itself may change size when the user resizes their terminal emulator. Each pane contains a living shell session that expects a consistent rectangular screen area and becomes confused if its dimensions change unexpectedly.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: The window manager's primary responsibility is maintaining the illusion that each shell session has its own dedicated terminal, while actually coordinating shared access to a single physical terminal display. This requires careful synchronization between logical pane boundaries and the actual character grid positions where each pane's content appears.\n\nThe space organization challenge becomes particularly complex because terminal displays operate on discrete character cell boundaries rather than pixel coordinates. A pane cannot be positioned at arbitrary screen coordinates—it must align to character boundaries and have dimensions measured in complete character cells. This discretization constraint means resize operations often involve distributing leftover space or adjusting multiple panes simultaneously to accommodate the character grid limitations.\n\n### Pane Layout Algorithm\n\nThe window manager implements a hierarchical space partitioning system based on a binary tree data structure called the layout tree. Each node in the layout tree represents either a concrete pane containing a shell session or an abstract split that divides space between two child regions. This tree structure naturally models the recursive splitting behavior users expect—split a window horizontally, then split one of the resulting halves vertically, then split one of those quarters horizontally again.\n\nThe fundamental layout data structure is the `layout_node_t`, which serves dual purposes depending on its type. Leaf nodes represent actual panes and contain a `pane_id` that references the corresponding `pane_t` structure containing the PTY session and screen buffer. Internal nodes represent splits and contain a `split_ratio` value between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines how the available space is divided between the left/right (or top/bottom) children.\n\n**Layout Node Structure:**\n\n| Field Name | Type | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `type` | `layout_type_t` | Either `LAYOUT_LEAF` for panes or `LAYOUT_HORIZONTAL`/`LAYOUT_VERTICAL` for splits |\n| `pane_id` | `int` | Valid only for leaf nodes, references the pane containing PTY session |\n| `split_ratio` | `float` | Valid only for split nodes, ratio 0.0-1.0 determining space allocation |\n| `left` | `layout_node_t*` | First child (top child for horizontal splits, left child for vertical splits) |\n| `right` | `layout_node_t*` | Second child (bottom child for horizontal splits, right child for vertical splits) |\n| `parent` | `layout_node_t*` | Parent node in tree, NULL for root node |\n\nThe layout algorithm operates through a recursive tree traversal that calculates absolute screen coordinates and dimensions for each pane based on the split ratios and available space. The algorithm begins at the root node with the full terminal dimensions and recursively subdivides the space according to the split hierarchy.\n\n**Dimension Calculation Algorithm:**\n\n1. The algorithm receives the current node and available rectangular region defined by x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, and height parameters\n2. If the current node is a leaf, it updates the corresponding pane's position and dimensions directly and marks the pane for redrawing\n3. If the current node is a horizontal split, it calculates the split position by multiplying the available height by the split ratio\n4. The algorithm ensures the split position respects minimum pane height requirements by adjusting the split ratio if necessary\n5. It recursively calls itself on the left child with the top portion of the available space (original height multiplied by adjusted split ratio)\n6. It recursively calls itself on the right child with the bottom portion of the available space (remaining height after top allocation)\n7. If the current node is a vertical split, it follows the same pattern but divides the available width instead of height\n8. The algorithm propagates any minimum size constraint violations back up the tree, potentially adjusting parent split ratios to accommodate\n\nThe split ratio adjustment mechanism ensures that no pane shrinks below its minimum viable dimensions. When a resize operation would violate minimum size constraints, the algorithm performs a constraint satisfaction process that adjusts multiple split ratios simultaneously to find a valid layout configuration.\n\n**Pane Splitting Implementation:**\n\nWhen a user requests splitting an existing pane, the window manager must transform a leaf node in the layout tree into an internal split node with two children. This operation requires careful handling to maintain tree consistency and update all affected data structures.\n\n1. The system identifies the target pane and locates its corresponding leaf node in the layout tree\n2. It allocates a new pane structure with a fresh PTY session for the new shell instance  \n3. It creates a new layout node for the new pane and configures it as a leaf node\n4. It transforms the existing leaf node into a split node by changing its type and adding the new pane as one child\n5. It creates another new layout node for the original pane and attaches it as the other child of the split\n6. It sets the initial split ratio to 0.5 to divide the space equally between the original and new panes\n7. It triggers a full layout recalculation to update all pane positions and dimensions\n8. It sends resize notifications to the affected PTY sessions so their shells understand their new terminal dimensions\n\n> **Decision: Binary Tree Layout Structure**\n> - **Context**: Multiple layout approaches exist for managing pane arrangements, including grid-based systems, constraint-based layouts, and tree-based hierarchical splitting\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Grid system with fixed rows/columns\n>   - Constraint-based layout with flexible positioning\n>   - Binary tree with recursive splitting\n> - **Decision**: Binary tree with recursive splitting\n> - **Rationale**: Tree structure naturally models user mental model of splitting operations, enables efficient recursive algorithms for layout calculation, and provides straightforward implementation for resize operations. Grid systems become complex with irregular splits, while constraint-based systems require sophisticated solvers.\n> - **Consequences**: Splitting behavior matches user expectations from other terminal multiplexers, resize operations can be implemented with simple tree traversals, but complex layouts may require deep nesting levels\n\n**Layout Tree Options Comparison:**\n\n| Layout Approach | Pros | Cons | Memory Usage |\n|----------------|------|------|-------------|\n| Binary Tree | Natural split modeling, Simple algorithms, Predictable behavior | Deep nesting, Limited layout flexibility | O(n) nodes for n panes |\n| Grid System | Uniform appearance, Simple coordinate math | Complex irregular splits, Wasted space | O(rows × cols) regardless of pane count |\n| Constraint-Based | Maximum flexibility, Optimal space usage | Complex implementation, Unpredictable behavior | O(n²) constraints for n panes |\n\n### Multi-Pane Rendering\n\nThe multi-pane rendering system composites multiple independent screen buffers into a single terminal output stream while adding visual separators and status information. This rendering pipeline must coordinate updates from multiple asynchronous PTY sessions, handle partial screen updates efficiently, and maintain visual consistency across pane boundaries.\n\nThe rendering process operates on a frame-based model where the window manager periodically generates a complete terminal screen image by combining content from all visible panes. Each pane maintains its own `screen_buffer_t` containing the virtual terminal state for its associated shell session. The window manager must merge these independent buffers into a unified display while adding border characters and status information.\n\n![Pane Layout and Splitting Algorithm](./diagrams/layout-algorithm.svg)\n\n**Border and Status Rendering:**\n\nThe window manager reserves specific character positions for visual elements that help users distinguish between different panes and understand the current system state. Border characters are drawn along the edges of each pane using box-drawing Unicode characters that create clean visual separation between adjacent screen regions.\n\n| Border Element | Unicode Character | Usage |\n|---------------|------------------|-------|\n| Horizontal Line | `─` (U+2500) | Top and bottom pane borders |\n| Vertical Line | `│` (U+2502) | Left and right pane borders |\n| Top-Left Corner | `┌` (U+250C) | Upper-left pane corner |\n| Top-Right Corner | `┐` (U+2510) | Upper-right pane corner |\n| Bottom-Left Corner | `└` (U+2514) | Lower-left pane corner |\n| Bottom-Right Corner | `┘` (U+2518) | Lower-right pane corner |\n| Cross Intersection | `┼` (U+253C) | Where horizontal and vertical borders meet |\n| Focused Pane Highlight | Different color/bold | Visual indication of active pane |\n\nThe rendering pipeline must account for the space consumed by borders when calculating usable pane dimensions. A pane with screen coordinates spanning from (x, y) to (x+width, y+height) actually has usable content area from (x+1, y+1) to (x+width-1, y+height-1) due to the border character overhead.\n\n**Frame Compositing Algorithm:**\n\n1. The renderer allocates a complete terminal-sized buffer initialized to blank characters with default attributes\n2. It traverses the layout tree to identify all visible panes and their absolute screen coordinates\n3. For each pane, it copies the relevant portion of the pane's screen buffer into the corresponding region of the composite buffer\n4. It applies clipping to ensure pane content does not overflow its allocated boundaries\n5. It draws border characters around each pane's perimeter, using intersection characters where borders from adjacent panes meet\n6. It applies focus highlighting by modifying the border attributes for the currently active pane\n7. It renders the status bar information at the bottom of the screen, showing pane numbers, window names, and system status\n8. It converts the composite buffer into a sequence of terminal escape codes that positions the cursor and outputs each character with appropriate attributes\n9. It optimizes the output by detecting unchanged screen regions and generating movement commands instead of redrawing static content\n\n![Multi-Pane Rendering Pipeline](./diagrams/render-pipeline.svg)\n\nThe output optimization step significantly improves rendering performance by avoiding unnecessary character output. The renderer maintains a shadow buffer representing the terminal's current state and compares it against the new frame content to generate minimal update sequences.\n\n**Screen Update Optimization:**\n\n| Update Type | Detection Method | Optimization Strategy |\n|-------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Character Changes | Compare cell content and attributes | Output only changed characters with cursor positioning |\n| Line Insertions | Detect shifted content patterns | Use scroll region escape sequences |\n| Line Deletions | Detect compacted content patterns | Use delete line escape sequences |\n| Cursor Movements | Track cursor position changes | Generate optimal cursor positioning sequence |\n| Attribute Changes | Compare text formatting | Group consecutive attribute changes |\n\nThe optimization process must balance update efficiency against complexity. Simple character-by-character comparison provides good results without requiring sophisticated diff algorithms that might consume more CPU time than they save in terminal output.\n\n> **Decision: Frame-Based Rendering with Optimization**\n> - **Context**: Multiple rendering approaches exist, including immediate mode rendering, retained mode with full redraws, and optimized frame-based rendering\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Immediate mode (output directly to terminal as changes occur)\n>   - Full frame redraw (regenerate entire screen each update)\n>   - Optimized frame-based (compare with previous frame and output minimal changes)\n> - **Decision**: Optimized frame-based rendering\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable visual consistency by ensuring all panes update atomically, enables efficient border and status rendering, and optimization reduces terminal output overhead significantly for typical usage patterns\n> - **Consequences**: Requires additional memory for shadow buffer and comparison logic, introduces frame latency between PTY output and display, but provides smooth visual experience and good performance\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe window manager component involves several critical design decisions that significantly impact both implementation complexity and user experience. These decisions must balance performance requirements, memory usage constraints, and compatibility with existing terminal multiplexer user expectations.\n\n> **Decision: Minimum Pane Dimensions**\n> - **Context**: Panes must remain usable when users resize layouts aggressively, but different shells and applications have varying minimum size requirements\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Fixed minimum (e.g., 10x3 characters) for all panes\n>   - Dynamic minimum based on shell capabilities detection\n>   - No minimum enforcement, allowing unusably small panes\n> - **Decision**: Fixed minimum of 10 characters width by 3 characters height\n> - **Rationale**: Most shell prompts require at least 8-10 characters for basic functionality, three lines provide space for prompt, command input, and one line of output. Fixed minimum simplifies layout calculations and prevents user confusion from dynamic constraints.\n> - **Consequences**: Some aggressive resize operations may be rejected when they would violate minimum size constraints, but ensures all panes remain functional for basic shell interaction\n\n**Minimum Pane Size Options:**\n\n| Approach | Width | Height | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|-------|---------|------|------|\n| Conservative | 15 chars | 5 lines | Always usable | Limits splitting density |\n| Minimal | 10 chars | 3 lines | Good splitting flexibility | Some applications may be cramped |\n| Dynamic | Variable | Variable | Optimal for each shell | Complex detection logic |\n| None | 1 char | 1 line | Maximum flexibility | Unusable panes possible |\n\n> **Decision: Layout Tree Balance Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Repeated splitting operations can create highly unbalanced trees that degrade layout calculation performance and produce awkward visual arrangements\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - No rebalancing, allow arbitrary tree shapes\n>   - Automatic rebalancing after each split operation\n>   - Manual rebalancing command for user-initiated optimization\n> - **Decision**: No automatic rebalancing, but provide manual layout reset functionality\n> - **Rationale**: Automatic rebalancing would disrupt user's mental model of the layout structure and change split ratios unexpectedly. Manual reset allows users to clean up complex layouts when desired while preserving their intentional arrangements.\n> - **Consequences**: Complex layouts with many splits may have slightly slower layout calculations, but user control over layout structure is preserved\n\n> **Decision: Border Style Configuration**\n> - **Context**: Different users prefer different visual styles for pane borders, and some terminals have varying support for Unicode box-drawing characters\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Fixed Unicode box-drawing borders\n>   - ASCII fallback borders using |, -, and + characters  \n>   - Configurable border styles with multiple options\n> - **Decision**: Unicode box-drawing with ASCII fallback detection\n> - **Rationale**: Unicode borders provide professional appearance on modern terminals, but ASCII fallback ensures compatibility with older terminals or systems with limited Unicode support. Automatic detection based on terminal capabilities avoids requiring user configuration.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires terminal capability detection logic and dual rendering paths, but provides optimal appearance across diverse terminal environments\n\n**Border Style Comparison:**\n\n| Style | Characters Used | Compatibility | Visual Quality | Implementation Complexity |\n|-------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Unicode | `─│┌┐└┘┼` | Modern terminals | Excellent | Medium (capability detection) |\n| ASCII | `\\|-+` | Universal | Basic | Simple |\n| Configurable | User choice | Varies | User dependent | High (multiple render paths) |\n\n> **Decision: Pane Focus Indication**\n> - **Context**: Users need clear visual indication of which pane currently receives keyboard input, especially in complex layouts with many panes\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Different border color for focused pane\n>   - Border thickness/style change for focused pane\n>   - Background color change for focused pane content area\n> - **Decision**: Border color change with bold attribute for focused pane\n> - **Rationale**: Color change provides clear visual distinction without affecting pane content area, bold attribute ensures visibility even on terminals with limited color support, and border modification preserves content readability\n> - **Consequences**: Requires color capability detection and fallback to bold-only on monochrome terminals, but provides clear focus indication across terminal types\n\n### Common Window Management Pitfalls\n\nWindow management implementation involves several subtle issues that frequently cause problems for developers building terminal multiplexers. Understanding these pitfalls helps avoid frustrating debugging sessions and ensures robust operation across diverse terminal environments.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect PTY Size Propagation**\n\nMany developers forget that splitting a pane requires updating the PTY dimensions for the affected shell sessions. When a pane's screen dimensions change due to splitting or resizing, the associated PTY must be notified via the `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl call, otherwise the shell process continues to believe it has the old terminal dimensions.\n\nThis manifests as applications within the pane formatting their output for incorrect line widths, causing text to wrap unexpectedly or leaving blank space. Text editors become particularly confused and may display content incorrectly or crash when their assumed terminal size doesn't match the actual available space.\n\nThe fix requires calling `pty_session_resize()` immediately after any layout calculation that changes pane dimensions. The resize notification must occur before any new output appears in the pane to ensure the shell process updates its internal state correctly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Border Character Coordinate Confusion**\n\nA common mistake involves failing to account for border character space when calculating usable pane content areas. Developers often calculate pane positions correctly but forget that border characters consume screen real estate, leading to content overflow into adjacent panes or border characters.\n\nFor example, a pane positioned at (5, 10) with dimensions 20x8 actually has usable content space from (6, 11) to (23, 16) due to the border characters around the perimeter. Applications that ignore this adjustment will overwrite border characters or have their content clipped unexpectedly.\n\nThe solution involves maintaining separate calculations for pane layout coordinates (including borders) and content coordinates (excluding borders). Always subtract 2 from both width and height when configuring PTY dimensions, and offset content positioning by +1 in both x and y directions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Floating Point Split Ratio Precision**\n\nUsing floating point arithmetic for split ratios can introduce subtle rounding errors that accumulate during resize operations. When a user resizes the terminal window multiple times, small precision errors can cause pane dimensions to drift from their intended proportions.\n\nThis problem becomes particularly evident when users expect symmetric layouts (50/50 splits) but observe that repeated resize operations gradually make one pane larger than the other. The accumulated error eventually becomes visible and violates user expectations about layout behavior.\n\nThe fix involves implementing split ratio normalization that periodically adjusts ratios to eliminate accumulated errors. Additionally, using fixed-point arithmetic or rational number representation for split ratios can eliminate floating point precision issues entirely.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Multi-Pane Updates**\n\nWhen multiple PTY sessions generate output simultaneously, race conditions can occur during screen buffer updates and rendering. Without proper synchronization, the window manager might read partially updated screen buffers or composite inconsistent pane states into the final output.\n\nThis manifests as visual glitches where panes display mixed content from different time points, or rendering artifacts where border characters disappear temporarily. The problem becomes more severe under heavy output load when multiple shell sessions are active simultaneously.\n\nThe solution requires implementing proper locking around screen buffer updates and ensuring that the rendering pipeline operates on consistent snapshots of all pane states. Consider using a double-buffering approach where PTY output updates a background buffer while rendering operates on a stable foreground buffer.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Memory Leaks in Layout Tree Operations**\n\nLayout tree manipulation, particularly node insertion and deletion during pane creation and destruction, often introduces memory leaks if not handled carefully. When a pane closes, its layout node must be removed from the tree, but developers frequently forget to properly deallocate the node structure or update parent pointers.\n\nAdditionally, when the last remaining pane in a split closes, the split node becomes redundant and should be removed to prevent tree degeneration. Failing to clean up these unnecessary nodes causes memory usage to grow over time and can lead to degraded layout calculation performance.\n\nThe fix requires implementing careful tree cleanup logic that recursively removes unnecessary split nodes and properly deallocates all associated memory. Consider using reference counting or garbage collection techniques to ensure proper cleanup of complex tree structures.\n\n**Common Pitfalls Summary:**\n\n| Pitfall | Symptom | Root Cause | Prevention |\n|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|\n| PTY Size Mismatch | Text wrapping incorrectly | Missing TIOCSWINSZ calls | Update PTY size after every layout change |\n| Border Overlap | Content overwrites borders | Wrong coordinate calculations | Separate layout coordinates from content coordinates |\n| Split Ratio Drift | Layouts become asymmetric | Floating point precision errors | Implement ratio normalization |\n| Rendering Artifacts | Visual glitches | Race conditions in updates | Synchronize buffer access properly |\n| Memory Leaks | Growing memory usage | Incomplete tree cleanup | Implement proper node deallocation |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Layout Calculation | Basic recursive tree traversal | Cached layout with incremental updates |\n| Border Rendering | ASCII characters with simple drawing | Unicode box-drawing with capability detection |\n| Screen Composition | Character-by-character copying | Optimized diff-based rendering |\n| Tree Management | Manual memory allocation | Reference-counted smart pointers |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nterminal-multiplexer/\n  src/\n    window/\n      layout.h              ← layout tree data structures and algorithms\n      layout.c              ← implementation of layout calculation and tree manipulation\n      render.h              ← rendering pipeline interfaces\n      render.c              ← screen composition and border drawing\n      window_manager.h      ← main window manager interface\n      window_manager.c      ← window manager implementation\n    test/\n      test_layout.c         ← unit tests for layout algorithms\n      test_render.c         ← rendering pipeline tests\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\nHere's a complete layout tree management foundation that handles the complex tree manipulation operations:\n\n```c\n// layout.h - Layout tree management interface\n#ifndef LAYOUT_H\n#define LAYOUT_H\n\n#include <stdbool.h>\n\ntypedef enum {\n    LAYOUT_LEAF,\n    LAYOUT_HORIZONTAL,\n    LAYOUT_VERTICAL\n} layout_type_t;\n\ntypedef struct layout_node_s {\n    layout_type_t type;\n    int pane_id;

Press prefix key + 'v' to split vertically\n# 2. Press prefix key + 'h' to split horizontally  \n# 3. Navigate between panes with prefix + arrow keys\n# 4. Resize terminal window and observe layout updates\n```\n\n**Expected Behaviors:**\n- Each pane should display an independent shell prompt and accept commands\n- Border characters should cleanly separate panes without overlapping content\n- Focused pane should have visually distinct border highlighting\n- Terminal resize should proportionally adjust all pane dimensions\n- PTY sessions should receive correct dimensions and format output appropriately\n\n**Common Issues and Diagnostics:**\n- **Panes overlap or have gaps**: Check border calculation in `layout_calculate_dimensions()` \n- **Shell output wraps incorrectly**: Verify `pty_session_resize()` calls after layout changes\n- **Borders use wrong characters**: Check terminal UTF-8 capability and fallback logic\n- **Focus highlighting doesn't appear**: Verify color/attribute application in render pipeline\n- **Layout becomes corrupted after splits**: Debug layout tree structure with print statements\n\n\n## Input Handler Component\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 4 (Key Bindings and UI) - this section implements the user interaction layer that enables command mode, key bindings, and input routing to control the terminal multiplexer\n\n![Input Routing](./diagrams/input-routing.svg)\n\n### Mental Model: The Traffic Controller\n\nThink of the Input Handler as a **traffic controller at a busy intersection**. Just like a traffic controller must decide whether to direct each car to continue straight through the intersection or pull them aside for inspection, the Input Handler must decide what to do with each keystroke that arrives from the user's keyboard.\n\nMost keystrokes are like regular traffic - they should flow straight through to the active pane's shell process without any interference. When you type `ls -la` in your shell, those characters need to reach the shell process as quickly and transparently as possible, just like most cars need to flow through the intersection without stopping.\n\nHowever, some keystrokes are special - they're like emergency vehicles that need different treatment. When the user presses the prefix key (typically Ctrl-b, similar to tmux), it's like an ambulance arriving at the intersection. The traffic controller must immediately recognize this special vehicle and route it to the appropriate emergency facility rather than letting it continue with normal traffic.\n\nThe Input Handler operates in two distinct modes, much like a traffic intersection can switch between normal flow and emergency response mode. In **normal mode**, keystrokes flow directly to the active pane's PTY master file descriptor, where they're forwarded to the shell process. The Input Handler acts as a transparent conduit, adding minimal latency to the user's typing experience.\n\nIn **command mode**, triggered by the prefix key, the Input Handler temporarily stops forwarding input to the shell and instead interprets keystrokes as multiplexer commands. This is like the traffic controller holding all normal traffic while they coordinate the emergency response. During this time, keys like 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' become navigation commands to switch between panes, '\"' becomes a horizontal split command, and '%' becomes a vertical split command.\n\nThe critical insight here is that the Input Handler must maintain **context awareness** - it needs to know not just what key was pressed, but also what state the multiplexer is currently in. Just like a traffic controller must track whether they're in normal mode or emergency mode, the Input Handler tracks whether it's in normal input mode or command mode. This state determines the entire interpretation and routing of subsequent input.\n\n> The Input Handler's dual-mode operation creates a clean separation between user interaction with the multiplexer itself versus user interaction with the shell processes running inside panes. This separation is essential for maintaining the illusion that each pane contains an independent terminal session.\n\n### Key Binding System\n\nThe **key binding system** forms the core of user interaction with the terminal multiplexer, translating raw keyboard input into multiplexer commands and routing decisions. This system must handle the complexity of distinguishing between input intended for the multiplexer versus input intended for the shell processes running in individual panes.\n\nThe system operates around a **prefix key mechanism**, borrowed from established multiplexers like tmux and screen. The prefix key acts as an escape sequence that signals the transition from normal input mode to command mode. When the user presses the prefix key (typically Ctrl-b), the Input Handler captures this keystroke and enters a temporary command interpretation state where the next keystroke will be interpreted as a multiplexer command rather than shell input.\n\n#### Prefix Key State Management\n\nThe prefix key implementation requires careful state tracking to handle timing and multi-keystroke sequences correctly. The Input Handler maintains a prefix state that transitions through several phases during command processing.\n\n| State | Description | Next Keystroke Handling | Timeout Behavior |\n|-------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| `PREFIX_INACTIVE` | Normal input mode, keys route to active pane | Standard shell input forwarding | No timeout active |\n| `PREFIX_DETECTED` | Prefix key pressed, awaiting command key | Interpret as multiplexer command | Reset to inactive after 500ms |\n| `PREFIX_CONSUMING` | Processing multi-key command sequence | Continue command sequence parsing | Extend timeout for sequence completion |\n| `PREFIX_INVALID` | Invalid command sequence detected | Return to normal mode, may echo error | Reset immediately to inactive |\n\nThe prefix key detection logic must handle several edge cases that commonly trip up implementations. First, the prefix key combination (such as Ctrl-b) generates a specific byte sequence that must be distinguished from other control sequences. The implementation cannot simply check for the ASCII value 2 (Ctrl-b) because this same byte might appear as part of a legitimate escape sequence being sent to a shell program.\n\n> **Decision: Prefix Key Timeout Mechanism**\n> - **Context**: After detecting a prefix key, the system must decide how long to wait for the subsequent command key before reverting to normal mode\n> - **Options Considered**: No timeout (wait indefinitely), short timeout (100-200ms), medium timeout (500ms), long timeout (1-2 seconds)\n> - **Decision**: 500ms timeout with configurable override\n> - **Rationale**: 500ms provides enough time for deliberate command entry without leaving the system in command mode if user accidentally hits prefix key. Configurable override allows users with different typing speeds to adjust\n> - **Consequences**: Reduces frustration from accidental prefix key presses while maintaining responsive command entry for intentional use\n\n#### Command Key Mapping\n\nOnce the prefix key activates command mode, the subsequent keystroke is interpreted according to a **command key mapping table**. This table defines the relationship between individual key presses and multiplexer actions, providing the vocabulary for user interaction with the system.\n\n| Command Key | Action | Parameters | Description |\n|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| `h` | `switch_pane` | direction: LEFT | Switch focus to pane on the left |\n| `j` | `switch_pane` | direction: DOWN | Switch focus to pane below |\n| `k` | `switch_pane` | direction: UP | Switch focus to pane above |\n| `l` | `switch_pane` | direction: RIGHT | Switch focus to pane on the right |\n| `\"` | `split_pane` | type: HORIZONTAL | Create horizontal split of current pane |\n| `%` | `split_pane` | type: VERTICAL | Create vertical split of current pane |\n| `x` | `close_pane` | confirm: true | Close current pane with confirmation |\n| `c` | `create_window` | shell: default | Create new window with fresh shell |\n| `n` | `next_window` | wrap: true | Switch to next window, wrapping to first |\n| `p` | `prev_window` | wrap: true | Switch to previous window, wrapping to last |\n| `:` | `command_prompt` | mode: EXTENDED | Enter extended command prompt mode |\n\nThe command mapping system supports both **immediate commands** and **extended commands**. Immediate commands execute directly upon pressing the command key, providing fast access to common operations like pane switching and splitting. Extended commands, triggered by keys like ':', enter a sub-mode where the user can type longer command sequences with arguments.\n\n#### Multi-Key Command Sequences\n\nSome multiplexer operations require more complex input than a single command key can provide. **Multi-key command sequences** handle operations that need additional parameters or confirmation, such as pane resizing with specific dimensions or window renaming with custom text.\n\nThe multi-key system extends the prefix state machine to handle **command continuation states**. When a command key indicates that additional input is required, the Input Handler transitions to a specialized parsing mode that interprets subsequent keystrokes according to the specific command's requirements.\n\n| Command Sequence | State Progression | Input Interpretation | Completion Trigger |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Resize pane | PREFIX_DETECTED → RESIZE_MODE | Arrow keys adjust dimensions | Enter key or timeout |\n| Rename window | PREFIX_DETECTED → TEXT_INPUT | Alphanumeric characters build name | Enter key or Escape |\n| Goto window | PREFIX_DETECTED → NUMBER_INPUT | Digits build window index | Enter key or invalid digit |\n| Copy mode | PREFIX_DETECTED → COPY_MODE | Vi-style navigation commands | 'q' key or Escape |\n\nMulti-key sequences require **input validation** at each step to provide immediate feedback when users enter invalid commands or parameters. The validation logic must distinguish between incomplete input (where more keystrokes are expected) and invalid input (where the current sequence cannot be completed).\n\n> **Decision: Command Key Modifier Support**\n> - **Context**: Users may want to use modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) in combination with command keys to expand the available command vocabulary\n> - **Options Considered**: No modifiers (single keys only), Ctrl combinations, Alt combinations, all modifier combinations\n> - **Decision**: Support Ctrl combinations for extended commands, avoid Alt due to terminal compatibility issues\n> - **Rationale**: Ctrl combinations are reliably detected across terminal types and provide sufficient expansion of command space. Alt combinations often conflict with terminal emulator menu shortcuts\n> - **Consequences**: Provides extended command vocabulary while maintaining broad terminal compatibility, but limits total available commands compared to supporting all modifiers\n\n### Raw Terminal Mode Management\n\n**Raw terminal mode** represents one of the most critical and error-prone aspects of terminal multiplexer implementation. In normal terminal operation, the terminal driver performs significant input and output processing, including line buffering, echo handling, and signal generation for control characters like Ctrl-C. A terminal multiplexer must bypass this processing to gain direct access to all keyboard input, including control sequences and special keys.\n\n#### Terminal Mode Transitions\n\nThe transition between normal and raw terminal modes involves manipulating the **terminal attributes** through the `termios` interface. These attributes control how the terminal driver processes input and output, determining whether characters are buffered, echoed, or interpreted as signals.\n\nThe `terminal_state_t` structure maintains the information necessary to safely transition between modes and restore the original terminal configuration when the multiplexer exits.\n\n| Terminal Attribute | Normal Mode Setting | Raw Mode Setting | Purpose |\n|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|\n| `ECHO` | Enabled | Disabled | Prevents input characters from appearing twice |\n| `ICANON` | Enabled | Disabled | Disables line buffering for immediate character access |\n| `ISIG` | Enabled | Disabled | Prevents Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z from generating signals |\n| `INPCK` | Varies | Disabled | Disables input parity checking |\n| `ISTRIP` | Varies | Disabled | Preserves 8th bit of input characters |\n| `INLCR` | Varies | Disabled | Prevents newline translation |\n| `IGNCR` | Varies | Disabled | Preserves carriage return characters |\n| `ICRNL` | Enabled | Disabled | Prevents CR to NL translation |\n| `IXON` | Enabled | Disabled | Disables software flow control |\n| `OPOST` | Enabled | Disabled | Disables output processing |\n\nThe mode transition process follows a specific sequence to ensure atomicity and proper error handling:\n\n1. **Save original terminal attributes** using `tcgetattr()` to capture the current terminal configuration before any modifications\n2. **Validate terminal file descriptor** to ensure the multiplexer is running on an actual terminal rather than a pipe or regular file\n3. **Prepare raw mode attributes** by copying the original attributes and modifying specific flags for raw mode operation\n4. **Apply raw mode atomically** using `tcsetattr()` with `TCSAFLUSH` to ensure all pending output is transmitted before the change\n5. **Verify raw mode activation** by reading back the terminal attributes and confirming the changes took effect\n6. **Register cleanup handlers** to ensure terminal restoration occurs even if the multiplexer exits unexpectedly\n\n#### Signal Handling in Raw Mode\n\nRaw terminal mode disables the automatic signal generation normally triggered by control characters, making the multiplexer responsible for **explicit signal handling**. This responsibility includes both managing signals directed at the multiplexer itself and properly forwarding signals to the child shell processes running in individual panes.\n\n| Signal | Source | Normal Terminal Action | Raw Mode Requirement |\n|--------|--------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| `SIGINT` | Ctrl-C | Interrupt foreground process group | Forward to active pane's process group |\n| `SIGTSTP` | Ctrl-Z | Suspend foreground process group | Forward to active pane's process group |\n| `SIGQUIT` | Ctrl-\\ | Quit foreground process group | Forward to active pane's process group |\n| `SIGWINCH` | Terminal resize | Update terminal size | Update all pane PTY sizes |\n| `SIGTERM` | External termination | Exit process | Restore terminal and exit cleanly |\n| `SIGCHLD` | Child process exit | Default handling | Clean up terminated pane sessions |\n\nThe signal forwarding mechanism requires careful **process group management** to ensure signals reach the appropriate shell processes. Each PTY session establishes its own process group, with the shell process as the group leader. When forwarding signals, the multiplexer must send them to the process group rather than individual processes to ensure proper signal propagation to any child processes spawned by the shell.\n\n> **Decision: Terminal Restoration Strategy**\n> - **Context**: The multiplexer must restore normal terminal mode when exiting, but exit can occur through multiple paths (normal shutdown, signals, crashes)\n> - **Options Considered**: Atexit handlers only, signal handlers only, both atexit and signal handlers, cleanup in main function only\n> - **Decision**: Both atexit handlers and signal handlers with cleanup state tracking\n> - **Rationale**: Multiple exit paths require multiple restoration mechanisms. Atexit handles normal exits, signal handlers manage interruption, state tracking prevents double-restoration\n> - **Consequences**: Robust terminal restoration across all exit scenarios, but requires careful state management to avoid conflicts between restoration mechanisms\n\n#### Input Processing Pipeline\n\nIn raw terminal mode, the Input Handler receives **unprocessed byte streams** directly from the terminal device. These byte streams may contain single-byte characters, multi-byte UTF-8 sequences, or complex escape sequences representing special keys like arrow keys or function keys.\n\nThe input processing pipeline transforms these raw bytes into **structured input events** that the rest of the multiplexer can process uniformly:\n\n1. **Byte stream collection** accumulates incoming bytes from the terminal file descriptor using non-blocking reads to avoid stalling the event loop\n2. **UTF-8 sequence assembly** identifies multi-byte Unicode characters and buffers incomplete sequences until all bytes arrive\n3. **Escape sequence detection** recognizes special key combinations that generate multi-byte sequences like `\\e[A` for the up arrow key\n4. **Input event generation** converts completed character or key sequences into structured events with metadata about modifier keys and special key types\n5. **Context-sensitive routing** directs events to either the command processor (in command mode) or the active pane's PTY (in normal mode)\n\nThe pipeline must handle **partial sequences** gracefully, as network delays or system load can cause multi-byte sequences to arrive across multiple read operations. The implementation maintains intermediate buffers for UTF-8 assembly and escape sequence parsing to reconstruct complete sequences from fragmented input.\n\n| Input Type | Byte Sequence Example | Processing Required | Output Event |\n|------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| ASCII character | `0x41` ('A') | Direct conversion | Character event with 'A' |\n| UTF-8 character | `0xC3 0xA9` ('é') | Multi-byte assembly | Character event with Unicode codepoint |\n| Arrow key | `0x1B 0x5B 0x41` (up arrow) | Escape sequence parsing | Special key event UP_ARROW |\n| Function key | `0x1B 0x4F 0x50` (F1) | Escape sequence parsing | Special key event F1 |\n| Modified key | `0x1B 0x5B 0x31 0x3B 0x32 0x41` (Shift+up) | Complex escape parsing | Special key event UP_ARROW with SHIFT modifier |\n\n### Architecture Decision Records\n\nThe Input Handler design involves several critical decisions that significantly impact the user experience and system robustness. Each decision represents a trade-off between competing concerns such as performance, compatibility, ease of implementation, and feature richness.\n\n> **Decision: Event Loop Integration Strategy**\n> - **Context**: The Input Handler must integrate with the main event loop that also handles PTY I/O and terminal rendering, requiring coordination between multiple input sources\n> - **Options Considered**: Separate input thread with queues, polling-based integration with select(), signal-driven I/O, dedicated input process\n> - **Decision**: Polling-based integration using select() with the main event loop\n> - **Rationale**: Select()-based polling provides deterministic behavior and integrates cleanly with existing PTY file descriptor monitoring. Threading introduces complexity with shared state, while signal-driven I/O has portability issues\n> - **Consequences**: Simplifies concurrency management and ensures consistent event processing order, but requires careful timeout management to maintain input responsiveness\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Separate thread | Responsive input handling, parallel processing | Complex synchronization, shared state issues |\n| Select() polling | Simple integration, deterministic ordering | Potential input latency with heavy PTY I/O |\n| Signal-driven I/O | Low latency, event-driven architecture | Platform-specific behavior, signal handling complexity |\n| Dedicated process | Complete isolation, crash resilience | IPC overhead, increased memory usage |\n\n> **Decision: Prefix Key Collision Handling**\n> - **Context**: The chosen prefix key (Ctrl-b) might be used by shell programs or text editors running within panes, requiring a mechanism to send the literal prefix key to applications\n> - **Options Considered**: Double prefix key (Ctrl-b Ctrl-b), escape sequence (Ctrl-b \\\\), alternative prefix key only, user-configurable prefix\n> - **Decision**: Double prefix key sends literal, with user-configurable prefix support\n> - **Rationale**: Double prefix matches tmux convention and provides intuitive escape mechanism. User configuration allows adaptation to different workflows without breaking muscle memory\n> - **Consequences**: Familiar behavior for tmux users and flexibility for customization, but requires additional state tracking for double-key detection\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Double prefix | Intuitive, matches tmux convention | Requires sequence detection logic |\n| Escape sequence | Clear visual indicator | Non-standard, harder to remember |\n| Alternative prefix only | Simple implementation | Limited flexibility for complex cases |\n| User-configurable | Maximum flexibility | Configuration complexity |\n\n> **Decision: Command Mode Timeout Mechanism**\n> - **Context**: After entering command mode with the prefix key, the system must determine how long to wait for command input before reverting to normal mode\n> - **Options Considered**: No timeout (wait forever), fixed short timeout (200ms), fixed medium timeout (500ms), adaptive timeout based on typing speed\n> - **Decision**: Fixed 500ms timeout with configuration override\n> - **Rationale**: 500ms balances responsiveness with usability - long enough for deliberate command entry but short enough to recover quickly from accidental prefix key presses. Configuration override accommodates different user preferences\n> - **Consequences**: Predictable behavior that works well for most users, with customization available for edge cases, but requires timeout management in the event loop\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| No timeout | Never leaves user stranded | Accidental prefix key locks input mode |\n| 200ms timeout | Very responsive recovery | Too fast for deliberate command entry |\n| 500ms timeout | Good balance of speed and usability | May feel slow for fast typists |\n| Adaptive timeout | Optimizes for individual users | Complex implementation, unpredictable behavior |\n\n> **Decision: Terminal Restoration Error Handling**\n> - **Context**: If terminal restoration fails during multiplexer exit (due to file descriptor closure or system errors), the terminal may be left in an unusable state\n> - **Options Considered**: Ignore restoration failures, retry with exponential backoff, external cleanup script, store restoration commands for external execution\n> - **Decision**: Retry with limited attempts plus external script fallback\n> - **Rationale**: Multiple restoration attempts handle temporary system issues, while external script provides recovery mechanism for persistent failures. User can manually run script if needed\n> - **Consequences**: Robust recovery from most failure scenarios with fallback mechanism, but adds complexity to cleanup logic and requires external script management\n\n| Option | Pros | Cons |\n|--------|------|------|\n| Ignore failures | Simple implementation | May leave terminal unusable |\n| Retry with backoff | Handles temporary failures | May delay exit unnecessarily |\n| External script | Always provides recovery option | Requires separate file management |\n| Store commands | Flexible external execution | Complex implementation |\n\n### Common Input Handling Pitfalls\n\nInput handling represents one of the most error-prone areas of terminal multiplexer development due to the low-level nature of terminal interaction and the variety of edge cases that must be handled correctly. Understanding these common pitfalls and their solutions is essential for building a robust multiplexer.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Restoration**\n\nMany implementations fail to properly restore terminal attributes when the multiplexer exits, leaving the terminal in raw mode. This makes the terminal unusable because input characters are no longer echoed and line editing features don't work.\n\nThe root cause typically involves missing restoration in signal handlers or failing to handle unexpected exit paths. When a user presses Ctrl-C or the system sends SIGTERM, the multiplexer may exit without executing normal cleanup code. The terminal remains in raw mode because no code ran to restore the original `termios` attributes.\n\n**Detection**: After multiplexer exit, typing characters in the terminal produces no visible output, and pressing Enter doesn't execute commands.\n\n**Solution**: Implement restoration in multiple places: normal exit paths, signal handlers, and `atexit()` registered functions. Use a global flag to track whether restoration has already occurred to prevent double-restoration issues.\n\n```c\n// Implementation Guidance will show the complete restoration pattern\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Signal Forwarding to Wrong Process Group**\n\nA common error involves sending signals directly to individual shell processes rather than their process groups. This causes problems when shells spawn child processes (like running `vim` or `make`), because the signals only reach the shell itself, not the currently running foreground job.\n\nThis happens because developers often store only the shell's process ID from the `fork()` call and use it directly with `kill()`. However, terminals normally send signals to process groups using negative PIDs, ensuring all related processes receive the signal.\n\n**Detection**: Pressing Ctrl-C in a pane only interrupts the shell but not programs running within the shell. For example, a long-running `grep` command continues running even after Ctrl-C.\n\n**Solution**: Use negative PIDs with `kill()` to send signals to process groups, and ensure each PTY session establishes its own process group using `setsid()` in the child process.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: UTF-8 Sequence Fragmentation**\n\nRaw terminal input can fragment multi-byte UTF-8 characters across multiple read operations, especially under system load or with network-based terminals. Implementations that process bytes individually without buffering incomplete sequences will misinterpret UTF-8 characters as multiple invalid single-byte characters.\n\nThis creates visual corruption when users type non-ASCII characters, and can desynchronize the input parser when UTF-8 fragments are misinterpreted as escape sequence components.\n\n**Detection**: Non-ASCII characters appear as question marks or random symbols, especially when typing quickly or during system load.\n\n**Solution**: Implement UTF-8 sequence buffering that accumulates bytes until a complete Unicode codepoint is assembled. The parser should track the expected length of multi-byte sequences and defer processing until all bytes arrive.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Escape Sequence State Confusion**\n\nInput parsers often fail to handle escape sequences that arrive fragmented or interleaved with other input. For example, the up arrow key generates the sequence `\\e[A`, but this might arrive as separate reads of `\\e`, `[`, and `A`. If other input arrives between these bytes, the parser can lose synchronization.\n\nAdditionally, some applications send escape sequences that the multiplexer doesn't recognize, leading to parser state corruption where subsequent input is misinterpreted.\n\n**Detection**: Special keys like arrows occasionally don't work, or typing immediately after pressing special keys produces incorrect characters in the shell.\n\n**Solution**: Implement a robust state machine with timeout-based recovery. If an escape sequence doesn't complete within a reasonable time (typically 50-100ms), treat accumulated bytes as separate characters and reset parser state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Command Mode State Leakage**\n\nImplementations sometimes fail to properly exit command mode when errors occur or when users press unexpected keys. This leaves the multiplexer stuck in command mode, where all subsequent input is interpreted as multiplexer commands rather than shell input.\n\nThis typically happens when the command key handler encounters an invalid command but doesn't reset the prefix state, or when multi-key sequences are interrupted by unexpected input.\n\n**Detection**: After pressing the prefix key and making a mistake, all subsequent typing is ignored by the shell, and characters like 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l' switch between panes instead of appearing as shell input.\n\n**Solution**: Implement explicit state reset logic in all command processing paths, including error paths and timeout handlers. Any unrecognized command should immediately return to normal mode with appropriate error feedback.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Terminal Size Propagation Failures**\n\nWhen terminal window resizing occurs, the multiplexer must update the PTY sizes for all sessions to reflect the new dimensions. Implementations often miss this step or update only the currently active pane, causing programs in other panes to have incorrect assumptions about terminal size.\n\nThis creates display corruption in programs that use full-screen interfaces like `vim`, `less`, or `htop`, which rely on accurate terminal dimensions for screen layout.\n\n**Detection**: After resizing the terminal window, full-screen programs in inactive panes have incorrect display layout with text wrapping at wrong positions or status bars in wrong locations.\n\n**Solution**: Handle `SIGWINCH` signals by updating PTY dimensions for all sessions using the `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl, not just the active pane. Also send `SIGWINCH` to all child process groups to notify programs of the size change.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe Input Handler bridges the gap between raw terminal input and structured multiplexer commands, requiring careful integration of several low-level Unix interfaces. This implementation guidance provides complete starter code for terminal mode management and skeleton code for the core input processing logic.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|------------------|\n| Terminal Control | `termios.h` with basic flags | `termios.h` with full attribute management |\n| Signal Handling | Basic `signal()` registration | Advanced `sigaction()` with masks |\n| Input Parsing | Character-by-character state machine | Buffered parsing with lookahead |\n| UTF-8 Support | Basic ASCII-only implementation | Full Unicode with `wchar.h` support |\n| Key Bindings | Static array of command mappings | Dynamic hash table with user configuration |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```c\nsrc/\n  input/\n    input_handler.h          ← public interface and types\n    input_handler.c          ← main input processing logic  \n    terminal_mode.c          ← raw mode management\n    key_bindings.c           ← command key mapping and prefix handling\n    utf8_decoder.c           ← UTF-8 sequence processing\n    escape_parser.c          ← escape sequence state machine\n  multiplexer.c              ← main event loop integration\n  tests/\n    test_input_handler.c     ← unit tests for input processing\n    test_terminal_mode.c     ← terminal mode transition tests\n```\n\n#### Complete Terminal Mode Management Code\n\nThis infrastructure handles the critical terminal mode transitions and restoration logic.

Test:**\n```bash\n# Compile and run your multiplexer\n./multiplexer\n\n# Type normal characters - they should appear in shell\necho \"hello world\"\n\n# Characters should appear normally and command should execute\n```\n\n**Prefix Key Test:**\n```bash\n# In your multiplexer, press Ctrl-b then 'h'\n# Should switch pane focus (if multiple panes exist)\n# Or show \"no pane to left\" message\n\n# Press Ctrl-b then Ctrl-b  \n# Should send literal Ctrl-b to shell (may show ^B)\n```\n\n**Terminal Restoration Test:**\n```bash\n# While multiplexer is running, press Ctrl-C\n# Terminal should return to normal mode\n# Typing should work normally with echo\n\n# Test signal handling:\nkill -TERM <multiplexer_pid>\n# Terminal should still work normally after process exits\n```\n\n**Expected Behaviors:**\n- Normal typing appears in active pane's shell\n- Prefix key followed by commands controls multiplexer\n- Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z work correctly in shell programs\n- Terminal always restores to normal mode on exit\n- UTF-8 characters display correctly (test with: echo \"héllo wørld\")\n\n#### Language-Specific Implementation Hints\n\n**Terminal Control:**\n- Use `tcgetattr()` and `tcsetattr()` for terminal mode management\n- Always use `TCSAFLUSH` flag to ensure clean state transitions\n- Check `isatty()` before attempting terminal operations\n\n**Signal Handling:**\n- Use `sigaction()` instead of `signal()` for reliable behavior\n- Block signals during critical sections with `sigprocmask()`\n- Remember that `SIGCHLD` needs special handling for PTY cleanup\n\n**UTF-8

shifting to assemble multi-byte codepoints\n\n**Timing and Timeouts:**\n- Use `gettimeofday()` or `clock_gettime()` for high-resolution timestamps\n- Convert timeout milliseconds to microseconds for comparison\n- Handle timer wraparound in long-running processes\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Debugging Input Handler Issues\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | Diagnosis | Fix

create a functioning terminal multiplexer, building on PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)\n\n### Mental Model: The Orchestra Conductor\n\nThink of the terminal multiplexer's main event loop as an orchestra conductor coordinating multiple musicians. Just as a conductor listens for cues from different sections and coordinates their timing to create harmonious music, the event loop listens for input from multiple sources (PTY sessions, user keyboard, terminal resize signals) and orchestrates their processing to create a seamless user experience. The conductor doesn't play every instrument—instead, it routes information between specialists (PTY manager for process communication, terminal emulator for display rendering, window manager for layout) while maintaining perfect timing and synchronization.\n\nThe key insight is that a terminal multiplexer is fundamentally an **event-driven system** where multiple asynchronous data sources must be coordinated without blocking. Unlike a simple shell that processes one command at a time, our multiplexer must simultaneously handle output from multiple shell sessions, user input, terminal resize events, and child process termination—all while maintaining responsive user interaction and consistent display state.\n\n### Main Event Loop\n\nThe **main event loop** forms the beating heart of the terminal multiplexer, using `select()`-based I/O multiplexing to handle multiple file descriptors simultaneously without blocking. This approach allows the multiplexer to remain responsive to user input while processing output from multiple PTY sessions and handling system events.\n\nThe event loop operates on a **unified file descriptor set** that includes the standard input for user keyboard input, all active PTY master file descriptors for shell session output, and a signal file descriptor for handling terminal resize and child process termination events. The `select()` system call blocks until at least one file descriptor becomes ready for reading, at which point the loop processes all ready descriptors before returning to wait for the next events.\n\n#### Event Loop Architecture\n\nThe event loop maintains several critical data structures to track active file descriptors and their associated processing handlers. The main loop uses a `fd_set` structure for the `select()` call, with parallel arrays mapping file descriptor numbers to their corresponding pane identifiers and processing functions. This design enables efficient dispatch of I/O events to the appropriate component handlers without linear searches or complex lookup structures.\n\n| Component | File Descriptors | Event Types | Processing Handler |\n|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| User Input | STDIN_FILENO (0) | Keyboard input, special keys | `input_handler_process_input()` |\n| PTY Sessions | master_fd for each pane | Shell output, process termination | `pty_session_read()` → `escape_parser_process_byte()` |\n| Signal Handler | signalfd or pipe | SIGCHLD, SIGWINCH | Signal dispatch to appropriate component |\n| Timer Events | timerfd (optional) | Prefix key timeout, rendering throttle | Timeout-based state transitions |\n\n#### Event Processing Pipeline\n\nThe event loop follows a structured processing pipeline that ensures consistent ordering and prevents race conditions between different event types. The pipeline prioritizes signal events (like child process termination) over I/O events to ensure system state remains consistent before processing new data.\n\n1. **Signal Event Processing**: Handle `SIGCHLD` for child process termination and `SIGWINCH` for terminal resize events before processing any I/O, ensuring system state consistency.\n\n2. **User Input Processing**: Process keyboard input from stdin, routing through the input handler's prefix key detection and command mode logic to determine routing destination.\n\n3. **PTY Output Processing**: Read data from all ready PTY master file descriptors, feeding the raw bytes through the terminal emulator's escape sequence parser to update screen buffers.\n\n4. **Screen Composition**: After processing all input events, determine if any panes need redrawing based on their `needs_redraw` flags and compose the final terminal output.\n\n5. **Terminal Output**: Write the composed frame to stdout using a single write operation to minimize terminal flickering and ensure atomic display updates.\n\n> **Design Insight**: The event loop processes ALL ready file descriptors in each iteration before composing output, rather than rendering after each individual PTY read. This batching approach prevents excessive screen updates when multiple panes have simultaneous output, significantly improving performance and reducing visual artifacts.\n\n#### File Descriptor Management\n\nThe event loop must dynamically manage its file descriptor set as panes are created and destroyed during the multiplexer session. When a new pane is created, its PTY master file descriptor is added to the `select()` set and the corresponding mapping tables are updated. When a pane is closed, the file descriptor is removed from the set and its entry in the mapping tables is cleared.\n\nThe event loop maintains a **maximum file descriptor tracker** to optimize the `select()` call, since `select()` requires specifying the highest-numbered file descriptor plus one. This value is recalculated whenever file descriptors are added or removed, ensuring efficient operation even with sparse file descriptor numbers.\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n    fd_set read_fds;\n    int max_fd;\n    int pane_fd_map[MAX_PANES];     // Maps fd to pane_id\n    int fd_pane_map[FD_SETSIZE];    // Maps pane_id to fd\n    window_manager_t* window_manager;\n    input_handler_t* input_handler;\n    bool shutdown_requested;\n} event_loop_t;\n```\n\n#### Error Handling and Recovery\n\nThe event loop implements robust error handling for file descriptor failures, including `EAGAIN` for temporary unavailability, `EBADF` for invalid file descriptors (indicating closed PTY sessions), and `EINTR` for interrupted system calls. When a PTY file descriptor becomes invalid, the event loop automatically closes the corresponding pane and updates the layout tree.\n\n**Error Recovery Pipeline**:\n\n| Error Condition | Detection Method | Recovery Action | State Updates |\n|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| PTY Session Death | `read()` returns 0 or `EBADF` | Remove fd from select set, close pane | Update layout tree, switch focus if needed |\n| Signal Interruption | `select()` returns -1 with `EINTR` | Continue loop without processing I/O | None - retry select() |\n| Memory Allocation | Buffer allocation failure | Log error, attempt graceful shutdown | Close all PTY sessions, restore terminal |\n| Terminal Write Error | `write()` to stdout fails | Attempt recovery, fallback to basic output | Switch to simplified rendering mode |\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Single-Threaded Event Loop**\n> - **Context**: Need to coordinate multiple asynchronous I/O sources while maintaining consistent state\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Single-threaded select()-based loop\n>   2. Multi-threaded with per-pane threads\n>   3. Asynchronous I/O with callbacks\n> - **Decision**: Single-threaded select()-based event loop\n> - **Rationale**: Eliminates complex synchronization, ensures deterministic event ordering, simplifies debugging, and matches the architecture of proven multiplexers like tmux\n> - **Consequences**: All processing must be non-blocking, but provides predictable behavior and easier state management\n\n### Inter-Component Communication\n\nThe flow of data between components follows a structured pipeline that transforms raw PTY output into composed terminal display while routing user input to the appropriate destinations. Understanding this data flow is crucial for implementing consistent behavior and debugging issues that span multiple components.\n\n#### PTY Output Data Flow\n\nWhen a shell process writes output to its PTY slave, the data becomes available for reading on the PTY master file descriptor. The event loop detects this availability and initiates a processing chain that transforms the raw bytes into display updates.\n\n**Output Processing Pipeline**:\n\n1. **PTY Data Reception**: The `pty_session_read()` function reads raw bytes from the PTY master file descriptor, handling partial reads and buffering incomplete data for the next iteration.\n\n2. **Escape Sequence Parsing**: Raw bytes are fed character-by-character into the terminal emulator's `escape_parser_process_byte()` function, which maintains a state machine to identify ANSI escape sequences and plain text characters.\n\n3. **Screen Buffer Updates**: Parsed characters and escape sequence commands are applied to the pane's `screen_buffer_t` structure, updating the virtual display state including cursor position, text attributes, and scrollback history.\n\n4. **Redraw Flag Setting**: When the screen buffer is modified, the pane's `needs_redraw` flag is set to indicate that this pane requires re-rendering in the next display composition cycle.\n\n5. **Frame Composition**: During the rendering phase, all panes marked for redraw are composited into the window manager's output buffer, including borders and status information.\n\n6. **Terminal Output**: The complete frame is written to the terminal using a single `write()` system call to ensure atomic display updates and minimize flickering.\n\n#### Component Interface Contracts\n\nEach component exposes well-defined interfaces that enforce separation of concerns and enable testing of individual components. The interfaces use **data transformation contracts** where each component receives structured input, performs its specific processing, and produces structured output for the next component.\n\n| Source Component | Output Data | Target Component | Processing Function | Result Data |\n|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| PTY Manager | Raw byte stream | Terminal Emulator | `escape_parser_process_byte()` | Parsed characters + commands |\n| Terminal Emulator | Screen buffer updates | Window Manager | `screen_buffer_put_char()` | Updated virtual display state |\n| Window Manager | Layout calculations | Rendering System | `window_manager_render_frame()` | Composed terminal output |\n| Input Handler | Input events | PTY Manager/Window Manager | `input_handler_route_event()` | Routed commands or character data |\n\n#### Memory Management and Buffer Ownership\n\nThe inter-component communication design uses **clear ownership semantics** to prevent memory leaks and use-after-free errors. Each component owns its internal data structures and provides controlled access through defined interfaces, with callers responsible for providing appropriately-sized buffers for data transfer.\n\n**Buffer Ownership Rules**:\n- PTY Manager owns PTY session structures and provides read-only access to session metadata\n- Terminal Emulator owns screen buffers and scrollback data, accepting character input through functional interfaces\n- Window Manager owns layout trees and rendering buffers, accepting pane updates through defined callbacks\n- Input Handler owns terminal state and input buffers, providing parsed events through callback interfaces\n\nThe design avoids shared mutable state between components, instead using **message-passing semantics** where components communicate through function calls with well-defined input and output parameters. This approach simplifies reasoning about data flow and makes the system more testable and debuggable.\n\n#### Event Flow Coordination\n\nThe multiplexer implements **event flow coordination** to ensure that related events are processed in the correct order and that component state remains consistent. For example, when a pane is closed, the event must propagate through multiple components in the correct sequence.\n\n**Pane Closure Event Flow**:\n\n1. **Input Handler**: Detects close-pane command from user input and validates that the target pane exists and can be closed\n2. **PTY Manager**: Terminates the child process using `pty_session_terminate()` and closes the PTY file descriptors\n3. **Window Manager**: Updates the layout tree using `layout_destroy_tree()` and redistributes space to remaining panes\n4. **Event Loop**: Removes the PTY file descriptor from the `select()` set and updates the file descriptor mapping tables\n5. **Rendering System**: Triggers a full redraw to reflect the new layout and remove the closed pane from the display\n\n> **Design Insight**: Event flow coordination prevents race conditions by ensuring that component updates happen in dependency order. The PTY is closed before layout updates to prevent the event loop from attempting to read from a closed file descriptor, and layout updates complete before rendering to ensure consistent display state.\n\n### State Synchronization\n\nMaintaining consistent state across components presents one of the most challenging aspects of terminal multiplexer implementation. The system must coordinate **distributed state** including pane focus, terminal attributes, layout dimensions, and process lifecycle while handling asynchronous events that can affect multiple components simultaneously.\n\n#### Focus Management\n\n**Focus state** determines which pane receives user input and affects visual rendering through focus highlighting. The focus management system must coordinate between the input handler (which routes keystrokes), window manager (which renders focus indicators), and event loop (which handles focus change commands).\n\nThe window manager maintains the **canonical focus state** through its `active_pane_id` field, with other components querying this authoritative source rather than maintaining duplicate state. Focus changes trigger a coordinated update sequence that ensures all components reflect the new focus state consistently.\n\n**Focus Change Protocol**:\n\n| Step | Component | Action | State Update |\n|------|-----------|--------|--------------|\n| 1 | Input Handler | Detects focus change command (arrow keys after prefix) | None - validation only |\n| 2 | Window Manager | Validates target pane exists and is reachable | Updates `active_pane_id` |\n| 3 | Window Manager | Marks old and new focus panes for redraw | Sets `needs_redraw` flags |\n| 4 | Event Loop | Triggers rendering cycle | Coordinates screen composition |\n| 5 | Rendering System | Updates focus highlighting in terminal output | Visual focus indicators |\n\n#### Terminal Size Synchronization\n\nTerminal size changes affect multiple components and require careful coordination to maintain consistent state. When the user resizes their terminal window, the multiplexer must update its internal layout calculations, propagate size changes to all PTY sessions, and trigger a complete redraw with the new dimensions.\n\nThe **terminal size synchronization protocol** handles `SIGWINCH` signals by coordinating updates across all components in the correct dependency order. The window manager serves as the coordination point, ensuring that layout calculations complete before PTY size updates and that all components use consistent dimension values.\n\n**Size Change Coordination**:\n\n1. **Signal Detection**: Event loop receives `SIGWINCH` and calls `terminal_get_size()` to obtain new terminal dimensions\n2. **Layout Recalculation**: Window manager updates its internal dimensions using `window_manager_resize_terminal()` and recalculates all pane positions\n3. **PTY Size Propagation**: Each pane's PTY session is updated with its new dimensions using `pty_session_resize()` and the `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl\n4. **Buffer Reallocation**: Screen buffers are resized to match new pane dimensions, preserving existing content where possible\n5. **Full Redraw**: All panes are marked for redraw and a complete screen refresh is triggered\n\n> **Critical Synchronization Point**: PTY size updates must complete before processing any new output from shell sessions, since shells may immediately output content formatted for the new terminal size. Processing old output with new size parameters can cause display corruption.\n\n#### Process Lifecycle Coordination\n\nChild process lifecycle events require coordination between the PTY manager (which detects process termination), window manager (which may need to close panes), and event loop (which must update file descriptor sets). The system uses **lifecycle state machines** to ensure consistent handling of process creation, execution, and termination.\n\n**Process State Transitions**:\n\n| Current State | Event | Next State | Coordinated Actions |\n|---------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| CREATING | PTY allocation success | SPAWNING | Update file descriptor maps |\n| SPAWNING | Child process started | RUNNING | Add PTY fd to select set |\n| RUNNING | Process output available | RUNNING | Route to terminal emulator |\n| RUNNING | SIGCHLD received | TERMINATING | Begin cleanup sequence |\n| TERMINATING | Cleanup complete | CLOSED | Remove from all component state |\n\n#### Data Consistency Guarantees\n\nThe multiplexer provides **eventual consistency guarantees** for state synchronization, ensuring that all components eventually reflect the same logical state even when updates are processed asynchronously. The system uses **state version numbers** to detect and resolve inconsistencies when they occur.\n\nEach major state change (focus switch, pane creation/destruction, terminal resize) increments a global version counter that components can use to validate that their local state is current. When a component detects that its state is stale, it requests a refresh from the authoritative component rather than attempting to reconstruct state independently.\n\n**State Validation Protocol**:\n- Window manager maintains master state version for layout and focus changes\n- Components cache state version with their local copies of shared state\n- Before using cached state, components compare versions and refresh if stale\n- Periodic validation cycles detect and correct any remaining inconsistencies\n\n> **Architecture Decision: Centralized State Authority**\n> - **Context**: Multiple components need consistent view of shared state (focus, layout, process status)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Distributed state with peer synchronization\n>   2. Centralized state authority with component queries\n>   3. Event sourcing with state reconstruction\n> - **Decision**: Centralized state authority in window manager\n> - **Rationale**: Simplifies consistency guarantees, reduces synchronization complexity, matches natural ownership (window manager already coordinates layout)\n> - **Consequences**: Window manager becomes critical component but provides single source of truth for shared state\n\n![Main Event Loop Processing](./diagrams/event-loop-flow.svg)\n\n![System Component Architecture](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\n![Multi-Pane Rendering Pipeline](./diagrams/render-pipeline.svg)\n\n#### Common Pitfalls in State Synchronization\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Focus Updates**\nWhen handling focus changes, developers often update the input routing before updating the visual focus indicators, creating a window where keystrokes route to the new pane but the display still shows the old pane as focused. This confuses users and makes debugging difficult. Always update the canonical focus state first, then propagate updates to all dependent components in dependency order.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Size Propagation**\nFailing to propagate terminal size changes to all PTY sessions causes shell programs to render output for the old terminal size, leading to display corruption and line wrapping issues. Ensure that every active PTY receives a `TIOCSWINSZ` ioctl with the new dimensions before processing any new output from shell sessions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Stale File Descriptor Mappings**\nWhen panes are destroyed, developers often forget to update the file descriptor mapping tables used by the event loop, causing the `select()` call to continue monitoring closed file descriptors. This leads to busy loops and resource leaks. Always update both the `fd_set` for `select()` and the mapping arrays when adding or removing PTY file descriptors.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Blocking Operations in Event Loop**\nIncluding blocking system calls (like `sleep()` or blocking I/O) in the event loop prevents the multiplexer from responding to other events, causing apparent hangs and poor responsiveness. Use non-blocking alternatives and timeout-based `select()` calls to maintain responsiveness.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| I/O Multiplexing | `select()` system call | `epoll()` (Linux) or `kqueue()` (BSD) | select() is portable and sufficient for moderate PTY counts |\n| Signal Handling | Traditional signal handlers with flags | `signalfd()` or self-pipe trick | Traditional signals work but require careful async-signal-safe handling |\n| Timer Management | `select()` timeout parameter | `timerfd_create()` (Linux) | select() timeout sufficient for basic prefix key timeout |\n| Memory Management | Fixed-size buffers with bounds checking | Dynamic allocation with memory pools | Fixed buffers prevent fragmentation and simplify debugging |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe event loop coordination spans multiple files but centralizes in a main event processing module:\n\n```\nsrc/\n  main.c                    ← entry point, initialization\n  event_loop.c             ← main event loop implementation  \n  event_loop.h             ← event loop interface and structures\n  components/\n    pty_manager.c          ← PTY session management\n    terminal_emulator.c    ← escape sequence parsing  \n    window_manager.c       ← layout and rendering\n    input_handler.c        ← keyboard input processing\n  utils/\n    signal_utils.c         ← signal handling helpers\n    fd_utils.c             ← file descriptor management utilities\n  tests/\n    test_event_loop.c      ← event loop unit tests\n    integration_test.c     ← end-to-end flow testing\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n**Signal Handling Utilities** (`utils/signal_utils.c`):\n```c\n#include <signal.h>\n#include <sys/signalfd.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include \"signal_utils.h\"\n\nstatic volatile sig_atomic_t sigwinch_received = 0;\nstatic volatile sig_atomic_t sigchld_received = 0;\n\n// Signal-safe flag setters for traditional signal handling\nvoid sigwinch_handler(int sig) {\n    sigwinch_received = 1;\n}\n\nvoid sigchld_handler(int sig) {\n    sigchld_received = 1;\n}\n\nint signal_utils_setup_handlers(void) {\n    struct sigaction sa;\n    \n    // Install SIGWINCH handler for terminal resize\n    sa.sa_handler = sigwinch_handler;\n    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);\n    sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;\n    if (sigaction(SIGWINCH, &sa, NULL) == -1) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n    \n    // Install SIGCHLD handler for child process termination\n    sa.sa_handler = sigchld_handler;\n    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);\n    sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART | SA_NOCLDSTOP;\n    if (sigaction(SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL) == -1) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\nbool signal_utils_check_winch(void) {\n    if (sigwinch_received) {\n        sigwinch_received = 0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\nbool signal_utils_check_chld(void) {\n    if (sigchld_received) {\n        sigchld_received = 0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n**File Descriptor Management Utilities** (`utils/fd_utils.c`):\n```c\n#include <sys/select.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include \"fd_utils.h\"\n\nvoid fd_utils_init_set(fd_set* fds, int* max_fd) {\n    FD_ZERO(fds);\n    *max_fd = -1;\n}\n\nvoid fd_utils_add_fd(fd_set* fds, int fd, int* max_fd) {\n    FD_SET(fd, fds);\n    if (fd > *max_fd) {\n        *max_fd = fd;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid fd_utils_remove_fd(fd_set* fds, int fd, int* max_fd) {\n    FD_CLR(fd, fds);\n    // Note: max_fd recalculation needed if fd == *max_fd\n    // For simplicity, we accept slight inefficiency\n}\n\nbool fd_utils_is_ready(fd_set* fds, int fd) {\n    return FD_ISSET(fd, fds);\n}\n\nint fd_utils_make_nonblocking(int fd) {\n    int flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0);\n    if (flags == -1) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n    return fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);\n}\n```\n\n#### Core Logic Skeleton Code\n\n**Main Event Loop Implementation** (`event_loop.c`):\n```c\n#include \"event_loop.h\"\n#include \"utils/signal_utils.h\"\n#include \"utils/fd_utils.h\"\n\n// Initialize event loop with all components\nint event_loop_init(event_loop_t* loop, window_manager_t* wm, input_handler_t* input) {\n    // TODO 1: Initialize fd_set and max_fd for select()\n    // TODO 2: Set up signal handlers using signal_utils_setup_handlers()\n    // TODO 3: Initialize file descriptor mapping arrays\n    // TODO 4: Store component pointers for event routing\n    // TODO 5: Add stdin (fd 0) to select set for user input\n    // Hint: Use fd_utils_init_set() and fd_utils_add_fd()\n}\n\n// Main event processing loop -

should show single pane with shell\n- Type commands - output should appear without blocking  \n- Press Ctrl+C - should send signal to shell, not exit multiplexer\n- Resize terminal window - pane should resize automatically  \n- Multiple rapid keystrokes should all be processed without drops\n\n**After implementing inter-component coordination**:\n- Create multiple panes - each should have independent input/output\n- Switch focus between panes - input routing should change immediately\n- Close a pane - layout should rebalance and focus should move appropriately\n- Resize with multiple panes - all panes should resize proportionally\n\n**After implementing state synchronization**:\n- All panes should maintain consistent state across operations\n- Focus indicators should always match actual input routing\n- Terminal size changes should propagate to all PTY sessions immediately\n- Process termination should be detected and handled gracefully\n\n\n## Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n> **Milestone(s):** All milestones (1-4) - this section describes failure modes and recovery strategies that span PTY management (M1), terminal emulation (M2), window management (M3), and input handling (M4)\n\n### Mental Model: The Safety Net\n\nThink of error handling in a terminal multiplexer like designing safety systems for an aircraft. Just as an airplane has multiple backup systems for navigation, power, and control surfaces, a terminal multiplexer must gracefully handle failures in any of its critical subsystems. When the primary navigation system fails, the pilot doesn't crash—they switch to backup instruments and continue flying. Similarly, when a child process dies or a PTY fails, the multiplexer must detect the failure, isolate the damage, and maintain operation for other panes while gracefully handling the affected session.\n\nThe key insight is that terminal multiplexers manage multiple independent sessions that should remain isolated from each other's failures. A crash in one shell session should not bring down the entire multiplexer or affect other running sessions. This requires defensive programming, graceful degradation, and robust cleanup procedures that ensure the terminal is always restored to a usable state, even during catastrophic failures.\n\n### PTY and Process Failures\n\nProcess and PTY management represents the most critical failure domain in terminal multiplexers because child processes can terminate unexpectedly, PTY allocation can fail under resource pressure, and pipe communication can break due to system limits or process crashes. These failures must be detected quickly and handled gracefully to maintain session isolation and prevent resource leaks.\n\n#### Child Process Termination Detection\n\nThe most common failure mode occurs when shell processes or their children terminate unexpectedly due to signals, crashes, or normal exit. The multiplexer must detect these terminations promptly and update its internal state accordingly.\n\n> **Decision: SIGCHLD-Based Process Monitoring**\n> - **Context**: Need to detect child process termination without blocking main event loop\n> - **Options Considered**: Polling with waitpid(WNOHANG), synchronous waitpid() calls, SIGCHLD signal handler\n> - **Decision**: Use SIGCHLD signal handler with self-pipe trick for integration with select()\n> - **Rationale**: Signal handler provides immediate notification without polling overhead, self-pipe makes it compatible with select()-based event loop\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful signal handler implementation and proper cleanup of zombie processes\n\n| Process Termination Scenario | Detection Method | Required Actions | Recovery Strategy |\n|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Normal shell exit | SIGCHLD signal | Update session status, close PTY, mark pane as terminated | Display exit message, allow pane closure |\n| Shell crash (SIGSEGV) | SIGCHLD signal | Log crash reason, cleanup PTY resources | Show crash notification, restart shell option |\n| Killed by user (SIGKILL) | SIGCHLD signal | Immediate cleanup, no graceful shutdown | Close pane, update layout if needed |\n| Child process orphan | SIGCHLD signal | Reap zombie, maintain session | Continue normal operation |\n| Process group termination | Multiple SIGCHLD | Cleanup all related processes | Close affected panes, rebuild layout |\n\nThe process termination handler must safely reap zombie processes while maintaining accurate session state. This requires careful coordination between the signal handler and the main event loop to avoid race conditions.\n\n```c\n// Process termination handling flow:\n// 1. SIGCHLD signal received\n// 2. Signal handler writes notification to self-pipe\n// 3. Main event loop detects self-pipe readable\n// 4. Event loop calls waitpid() to reap children\n// 5. Update pty_session_t structures with exit status\n// 6. Mark affected panes for cleanup or restart\n```\n\n#### PTY Allocation Failures\n\nPTY allocation can fail due to system limits on pseudo-terminal devices, insufficient privileges, or resource exhaustion. These failures must be handled gracefully without crashing the multiplexer or leaving orphaned processes.\n\n| PTY Failure Mode | Detection Point | Error Recovery | User Feedback |\n|------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|\n| posix_openpt() fails | pty_session_create() | Return error code, no session created | Show error message in status bar |\n| grantpt() fails | PTY setup | Close master fd, cleanup | Display permission error |\n| unlockpt() fails | PTY setup | Close master and slave fds | Show system error message |\n| Slave open fails | Child process | Exit child with error code | Parent detects child exit |\n| System PTY limit | posix_openpt() | Retry with backoff, suggest closing panes | Show resource limit warning |\n\n> The critical insight here is that PTY allocation failures should never crash the multiplexer—they should be treated as temporary resource constraints that may resolve when other sessions close.\n\n#### Broken Pipe and I/O Failures\n\nCommunication between the multiplexer and child processes can fail due to broken pipes, full buffers, or I/O errors. These conditions require careful detection and recovery to maintain system stability.\n\n| I/O Failure Type | Detection Method | Immediate Response | Long-term Recovery |\n|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Broken pipe (SIGPIPE) | Signal or EPIPE error | Stop writing to PTY | Mark session as terminated |\n| Read failure on master | read() returns -1 | Check errno, handle EAGAIN | Close session if permanent failure |\n| Write buffer full | write() returns partial | Buffer remaining data | Implement flow control |\n| PTY master closed | EOF on read | Immediate session cleanup | Remove pane from layout |\n| Slave side closed | SIGHUP signal | Graceful session shutdown | Allow process termination |\n\nThe I/O error handling must distinguish between temporary conditions (like EAGAIN) that require retry logic and permanent failures (like EPIPE) that indicate session termination.\n\n#### Common PTY Management Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Zombie Process Accumulation**\nMany implementations forget to reap child processes after SIGCHLD signals, leading to zombie accumulation that eventually exhausts the process table. The multiplexer must call waitpid() for every SIGCHLD signal received, even if multiple children exit simultaneously.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks**\nFailing to close both master and slave PTY file descriptors when sessions terminate leads to file descriptor exhaustion. Each pty_session_t must track both file descriptors and ensure they are closed in all exit paths, including error conditions.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Condition in Process Cleanup**\nAccessing pty_session_t structures from both signal handlers and main event loop creates race conditions. Use the self-pipe trick to defer all PTY session updates to the main event loop context.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Ignoring Process Group Signals**\nWhen users send signals like SIGTERM to the multiplexer, these must be forwarded to all child processes. Failing to properly manage process groups can leave orphaned shell processes running after the multiplexer exits.\n\n### Terminal and Display Errors\n\nTerminal and display errors encompass failures in escape sequence parsing, screen buffer management, and terminal size handling. These errors can corrupt the display state, cause rendering artifacts, or desynchronize the virtual screen from the physical terminal.\n\n#### Terminal Size Change Handling\n\nTerminal resize events represent one of the most complex error scenarios because they require coordinated updates across multiple components while maintaining visual consistency. Size changes can occur at any time and must be propagated through the entire system.\n\n> **Decision: Synchronous Resize Propagation**\n> - **Context**: Terminal resize affects layout, PTY sizes, and screen buffers simultaneously\n> - **Options Considered**: Asynchronous resize with eventual consistency, synchronous resize with temporary inconsistency, queued resize events\n> - **Decision**: Synchronous resize that updates all components atomically\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents visual artifacts and ensures PTY sizes match layout dimensions immediately\n> - **Consequences**: Resize operations may briefly block event loop but guarantee consistency\n\n| Resize Failure Point | Error Condition | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Layout recalculation | Panes below minimum size | Dimension validation | Adjust split ratios, merge small panes |\n| PTY size update | ioctl(TIOCSWINSZ) fails | System call return code | Log error, continue with current size |\n| Screen buffer resize | Memory allocation failure | malloc() returns NULL | Revert to previous size, show warning |\n| Render buffer realloc | Insufficient memory | realloc() returns NULL | Use smaller buffer, degrade rendering quality |\n| Multiple rapid resizes | Event queue overflow | Event count tracking | Coalesce resize events, process latest only |\n\nThe resize handling must be atomic to prevent temporary states where layout dimensions don't match PTY sizes, which can cause child processes to receive incorrect terminal geometry information.\n\n#### Malformed Escape Sequence Recovery\n\nTerminal emulation must handle malformed or incomplete escape sequences gracefully without corrupting the parser state or losing subsequent valid sequences. Real-world terminal output often contains truncated or invalid escape sequences due to program crashes or binary data.\n\n| Parser Error Type | Error Condition | Detection Method | Recovery Strategy |\n|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Truncated CSI sequence | Buffer overflow in escape_parser_t | Buffer length check | Reset parser state, treat as literal text |\n| Invalid parameters | Non-numeric CSI parameters | Character validation | Use default values, continue parsing |\n| Unknown sequence | Unrecognized escape code | Sequence lookup failure | Ignore sequence, return to normal mode |\n| UTF-8 decode error | Invalid byte sequence | UTF-8 validation | Insert replacement character (U+FFFD) |\n| Buffer overflow | Sequence exceeds ESC_SEQ_BUFFER_SIZE | Length tracking | Truncate sequence, force state reset |\n| State machine stuck | Parser never returns to NORMAL | Timeout or sequence count | Emergency reset to NORMAL state |\n\n> The fundamental principle in escape sequence error recovery is to never let malformed input corrupt the parser state permanently—always provide a path back to the NORMAL parsing state.\n\n#### Screen Buffer Corruption Detection\n\nScreen buffer corruption can occur due to memory errors, invalid cursor movements, or arithmetic overflow in coordinate calculations. The multiplexer must detect these conditions and recover gracefully.\n\n| Corruption Type | Detection Method | Error Indicators | Recovery Action |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Invalid cursor position | Bounds checking | cursor_x >= width or cursor_y >= height | Clamp to screen bounds |\n| Buffer overrun | Array bounds validation | Write beyond cells array | Reallocate buffer, clear corruption |\n| Attribute corruption | Value range checking | Invalid attribute bits set | Reset to default attributes |\n| UTF-8 sequence split | Character boundary validation | Partial codepoint at line end | Complete sequence on next line |\n| Color index overflow | Color range validation | Color value > COLOR_WHITE | Use COLOR_DEFAULT |\n| Scrollback overflow | Buffer size monitoring | scrollback_lines > MAX_SCROLLBACK | Discard oldest lines |\n\nThe screen buffer must implement defensive programming practices that validate all coordinate and attribute values before using them to index into memory structures.\n\n#### Common Terminal Emulation Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cursor Position Overflow**\nMany implementations fail to validate cursor coordinates before using them as array indices, leading to buffer overruns when malformed escape sequences specify coordinates outside the screen buffer. Always clamp cursor positions to valid screen bounds.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: UTF-8 Boundary Errors**\nWhen UTF-8 sequences span multiple read() calls, incomplete sequences can corrupt character display or cause parser state confusion. Buffer incomplete UTF-8 sequences until complete codepoints can be decoded.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Attribute State Leakage**\nFailing to properly reset terminal attributes when switching between panes can cause formatting to leak between sessions. Each pane must maintain independent attribute state in its screen_buffer_t.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resize During Output**\nTerminal resize events that occur while processing escape sequences can cause coordinate calculations to use inconsistent screen dimensions. Cache screen dimensions at the start of escape sequence processing.\n\n### Cleanup and Exit Procedures\n\nProper cleanup and exit procedures ensure that the terminal multiplexer can shutdown gracefully under all conditions, restoring terminal settings and cleaning up system resources even during abnormal termination scenarios. This represents the final safety net that prevents the multiplexer from leaving the user's terminal in an unusable state.\n\n#### Terminal State Restoration\n\nTerminal state restoration is the most critical cleanup operation because failure to restore original terminal attributes can leave the user's terminal in raw mode, making it unusable for normal shell interaction. This restoration must occur even during crash scenarios or signal-induced termination.\n\n> **Decision: Multi-Level Cleanup Registration**\n> - **Context**: Terminal restoration must occur regardless of how the process terminates\n> - **Options Considered**: atexit() handlers only, signal handlers only, both atexit() and signal handlers\n> - **Decision**: Use both atexit() handlers and signal handlers with shared cleanup code\n> - **Rationale**: Covers both normal exit and signal termination, provides redundant safety\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful design to prevent double-cleanup and ensure idempotent operations\n\n| Exit Scenario | Cleanup Trigger | Terminal Restoration | Resource Cleanup |\n|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Normal exit | atexit() handler | Restore original_termios | Close all PTYs, free memory |\n| SIGINT (Ctrl-C) | Signal handler | Immediate restoration | Emergency PTY cleanup |\n| SIGTERM | Signal handler | Graceful restoration | Send SIGTERM to children |\n| SIGSEGV crash | Signal handler | Emergency restoration only | Best-effort cleanup |\n| Process kill | None possible | Automatic by kernel | Automatic by kernel |\n| exit() call | atexit() handler | Full restoration | Complete cleanup |\n\nThe terminal restoration procedure must be idempotent and signal-safe, allowing it to be called multiple times or from signal handler context without causing additional problems.\n\n```c\n// Terminal cleanup procedure:\n// 1. Check if raw_mode_active flag is set\n// 2. Call tcsetattr() with original_termios\n// 3. Clear raw_mode_active flag\n// 4. Restore cursor visibility if hidden\n// 5. Reset terminal to cooked mode\n// 6. Flush any pending output\n```\n\n#### Process Group Management\n\nThe multiplexer must properly manage process groups to ensure that signals are delivered correctly to child processes and that all related processes are cleaned up during shutdown. This prevents orphaned shell processes from continuing to run after the multiplexer exits.\n\n| Process Management Task | Implementation Approach | Error Handling | Signal Coordination |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| Child process creation | setsid() in child before exec | Check return codes | Setup SIGCHLD handler |\n| Process group tracking | Store pgid in pty_session_t | Handle invalid pgids | Forward termination signals |\n| Signal forwarding | killpg() to process groups | Ignore ESRCH errors | Respect signal ordering |\n| Graceful termination | SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL | Timeout mechanism | Wait for child cleanup |\n| Orphan prevention | Proper session leadership | Monitor parent-child relationships | Clean exit procedures |\n\n> The key insight is that the multiplexer acts as a session leader that must properly manage the lifecycle of all descendant processes, ensuring they don't become orphans when the multiplexer terminates.\n\n#### Resource Deallocation\n\nMemory and file descriptor cleanup must be thorough and systematic to prevent resource leaks that could affect system stability or subsequent multiplexer runs. This includes both explicit allocations and resources managed by the operating system.\n\n| Resource Type | Cleanup Procedure | Error Recovery | Verification Method |\n|---------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|\n| PTY file descriptors | close() master and slave fds | Log but continue cleanup | Check with lsof or /proc/fd |\n| Memory allocations | free() all malloc'd buffers | NULL pointer safety | Valgrind or AddressSanitizer |\n| Screen buffers | Free cells and scrollback arrays | Check for double-free | Memory debugging tools |\n| Process children | waitpid() for all spawned processes | Handle already-reaped children | Check process table |\n| Signal handlers | Restore default signal handling | Best-effort restoration | Signal behavior testing |\n| Layout tree | Recursive free of layout_node_t | NULL pointer checking | Tree traversal verification |\n\nThe cleanup procedure must handle partial initialization scenarios where some components may not be fully initialized when cleanup is triggered due to early errors.\n\n#### Emergency Recovery Procedures\n\nEmergency recovery handles situations where normal cleanup procedures cannot complete successfully, such as when the system is under extreme resource pressure or when cleanup operations themselves fail. These procedures prioritize terminal restoration above all other cleanup tasks.\n\n| Emergency Condition | Detection Method | Emergency Response | Fallback Action |\n|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Cleanup failure | System call errors during cleanup | Skip failed operations, continue | Terminal restoration only |\n| Memory corruption | Segfault during cleanup | Signal-safe restoration | exec() fresh shell |\n| Resource exhaustion | ENOMEM during cleanup | Free essential resources only | Emergency terminal reset |\n| Infinite loop | Timeout during cleanup | Force termination | Kill process group |\n| Signal storm | Repeated signal delivery | Block signals, emergency cleanup | System reset procedures |\n| Corrupted state | Inconsistent internal state | Abandon complex cleanup | Basic terminal restoration |\n\n> Emergency procedures prioritize leaving the user with a functional terminal over completing perfect cleanup—it's better to leak some memory than to leave the terminal unusable.\n\n#### Common Cleanup and Exit Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Non-Idempotent Cleanup**\nCalling cleanup functions multiple times can cause crashes if they attempt to free already-freed memory or close already-closed file descriptors. Design all cleanup functions to be safely callable multiple times by checking resource validity before cleanup.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Cleanup Function Complexity**\nComplex cleanup operations in signal handlers can cause deadlocks or crashes because signal handlers have limited safe function availability. Keep signal handler cleanup minimal and defer complex operations to atexit() handlers when possible.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incomplete Terminal Restoration**\nOnly restoring some terminal attributes (like canonical mode) while forgetting others (like echo settings) can leave the terminal in an inconsistent state. Always restore the complete original_termios structure captured at startup.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Child Process Leakage**\nForgetting to send termination signals to child processes before exiting can leave shell processes running as orphans that consume system resources. Always send SIGTERM to all process groups before final cleanup.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Resource Cleanup Ordering**\nCleaning up resources in the wrong order can cause cascading failures, such as freeing memory before closing file descriptors that reference it.

this section provides comprehensive testing approaches that verify PTY functionality (M1), terminal emulation accuracy (M2), window management behavior (M3), and input handling (M4)\n\n### Mental Model: The Quality Assurance Laboratory\n\nThink of testing a terminal multiplexer like running a quality assurance laboratory for a complex manufacturing process. Just as a manufacturing QA lab has different testing stations - component testing benches that verify individual parts, integration test beds that validate assembled products, and final inspection checkpoints that ensure the complete product meets specifications - our terminal multiplexer testing strategy operates at multiple levels of granularity and scope.\n\nThe component unit tests are like individual testing stations that verify each subsystem in isolation - the escape sequence parser, the layout calculator, the PTY session manager. These tests use controlled inputs and verify precise outputs without external dependencies. The integration tests are like the assembly line test beds that verify how components work together - real shell processes generating terminal output, actual PTY devices handling I/O, complete pane rendering pipelines. The milestone verification checkpoints are like the final inspection stations that validate the complete multiplexer behavior against user requirements.\n\nThis multi-layered testing approach ensures we catch different categories of defects at the appropriate level - logic errors in individual components, interface mismatches between components, and behavior gaps in the complete system. Each layer serves a specific diagnostic purpose and provides different types of confidence in system correctness.\n\n### Component Unit Tests\n\nComponent unit tests verify the correctness of individual subsystems in isolation from their dependencies and external resources. These tests focus on algorithmic correctness, edge case handling, and interface contract compliance for each major component of the terminal multiplexer architecture.\n\nThe **escape sequence parser** represents one of the most critical components to test thoroughly due to the complexity and variety of ANSI escape sequences that must be handled correctly. The parser must correctly transition between states, accumulate parameters, and generate appropriate actions for hundreds of different escape sequence combinations.\n\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Expected Behavior | Verification Method |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Basic CSI Sequences | Cursor movements (CUU, CUD, CUF, CUB) | Parser generates correct cursor position changes | Verify `cursor_x` and `cursor_y` values in buffer |\n| Parameter Parsing | Multi-parameter sequences like `\\e[2;5H` | Parameters correctly extracted into `csi_params` array | Check `csi_param_count` and individual parameter values |\n| Default Parameters | Sequences with missing parameters like `\\e[H` | Parser applies correct default values | Verify cursor moves to (0,0) for missing parameters |\n| Invalid Sequences | Malformed escape sequences | Parser resets to normal state without corruption | Check `parser_state_t` returns to `NORMAL` |\n| UTF-8 Handling | Multi-byte Unicode characters | Characters correctly decoded and stored | Verify `terminal_cell_t.ch` contains complete codepoint |\n| Buffer Boundaries | Sequences longer than `ESC_SEQ_BUFFER_SIZE` | Parser truncates or rejects overlong sequences | Check buffer doesn't overflow and state resets |\n\nThe escape sequence parser tests should create controlled input streams and verify state transitions step by step. For example, when testing the sequence `\\e[2J` (clear screen), the test should verify that the parser transitions from `NORMAL` to `ESCAPE` on the escape character, then to `CSI_PARAMS` on the bracket, accumulates the parameter \"2\", and finally generates a clear screen action with the correct mode parameter.\n\n> **Critical Testing Insight**: Escape sequence parsing failures often manifest as display corruption that appears intermittent or input-dependent. Unit tests must exercise boundary conditions like buffer overflows, incomplete sequences, and interleaved UTF-8 characters to catch these subtle bugs before they reach integration testing.\n\nThe **screen buffer management** component requires extensive testing of cursor movement, scrolling behavior, and character storage operations. These tests verify that the virtual screen accurately tracks terminal state without requiring actual terminal I/O.\n\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Expected Behavior | Verification Method |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Cursor Movement | Absolute and relative positioning | Cursor stays within buffer boundaries | Check `cursor_x` and `cursor_y` constraints |\n| Scrolling Operations | Line insertion, deletion, scroll regions | Content shifts correctly, scrollback preserved | Verify character positions and scrollback buffer |\n| Character Storage | Normal text, wide characters, combining marks | Characters stored with correct attributes | Check `terminal_cell_t` content and formatting |\n| Buffer Clearing | Full screen, line clearing, selective erase | Specified regions cleared to default state | Verify cleared cells contain default values |\n| Attribute Handling | Bold, underline, color changes | Attributes applied to subsequent characters | Check `current_attributes` and cell attributes |\n| Scrollback Management | Lines scrolling off screen | Old lines preserved up to `MAX_SCROLLBACK` limit | Verify scrollback buffer content and bounds |\n\nScreen buffer tests should create known buffer states and verify that operations produce expected results. For example, a scrolling test should fill the buffer with identifiable content, perform scroll operations, and verify that the correct lines moved to the scrollback buffer while new content appeared in the visible area.\n\nThe **layout calculation algorithm** must be tested to ensure correct pane dimension calculations, split operations, and resize handling across various terminal sizes and split configurations.\n\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Expected Behavior | Verification Method |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Single Pane Layout | Full terminal dimensions | Pane occupies entire available space | Check pane coordinates match terminal size |\n| Horizontal Splits | Two-pane horizontal division | Panes split along horizontal boundary | Verify y-coordinates and height allocation |\n| Vertical Splits | Two-pane vertical division | Panes split along vertical boundary | Verify x-coordinates and width allocation |\n| Nested Splits | Complex multi-level split trees | Each pane receives correct dimensions | Walk layout tree and verify all leaf calculations |\n| Minimum Size Constraints | Splits with insufficient space | Panes respect `MIN_PANE_WIDTH` and `MIN_PANE_HEIGHT` | Check no pane dimensions below minimums |\n| Terminal Resize | Layout recalculation on size change | All panes resize proportionally | Compare before/after dimension ratios |\n\nLayout tests should construct various tree configurations and verify that the `layout_calculate_dimensions` function produces correct absolute coordinates for all panes. These tests can use small, predictable terminal sizes (like 80x24) to make manual verification straightforward.\n\nThe **PTY session management** component requires careful testing of process lifecycle, file descriptor handling, and signal propagation without relying on actual shell processes or terminal devices.\n\n| Test Category | Test Cases | Expected Behavior | Verification Method |\n|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Session Creation | PTY allocation and process spawning | Valid file descriptors and running process | Check `master_fd`, `slave_fd`, and `child_pid` |\n| Process Monitoring | Child process status tracking | `process_running` accurately reflects process state | Use test processes with known behavior |\n| Window Size Updates | TIOCSWINSZ ioctl propagation | Child process receives resize notifications | Mock ioctl calls and verify parameters |\n| Session Cleanup | Resource deallocation on close | File descriptors closed, processes terminated | Verify fds invalid and processes reaped |\n| Signal Handling | SIGCHLD processing | Child termination detected and recorded | Use controlled child processes for testing |\n| I/O Operations | Read/write through PTY master | Data flows correctly between processes | Use pipe-like test programs for verification |\n\nPTY session tests can use simple test programs instead of full shells - for example, programs that echo input, print known output patterns, or terminate after specific signals. This provides predictable behavior for test verification while exercising the same PTY infrastructure used with real shells.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Mock vs Real Dependencies**\n\n> **Decision: Use Minimal Real Dependencies with Controlled Behavior**\n> - **Context**: Component tests need to verify functionality without full system complexity\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Pure mocking with stub implementations\n>   2. Real dependencies with full shells and terminals\n>   3. Minimal real dependencies with controlled test programs\n> - **Decision**: Use minimal real dependencies with controlled test programs\n> - **Rationale**: Pure mocks miss integration issues between components and system interfaces, while full dependencies make tests non-deterministic and environment-dependent. Controlled test programs provide real system behavior with predictable, testable outcomes.\n> - **Consequences**: Tests exercise real system interfaces and catch platform-specific issues while remaining fast and deterministic. Test programs must be maintained alongside the main codebase.\n\n### Integration Testing\n\nIntegration testing verifies that components work correctly together and that the complete terminal multiplexer handles real-world scenarios with actual shell processes, PTY devices, and terminal output. These tests focus on data flow between components, timing-dependent behavior, and end-to-end functionality.\n\nThe **PTY-to-display pipeline** represents the most critical integration path, where output from shell processes flows through PTY devices, escape sequence parsing, screen buffer updates, and final terminal rendering. Integration tests must verify this pipeline handles realistic shell output correctly.\n\n| Integration Scenario | Test Setup | Expected Results | Verification Method |\n|---------------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Shell Command Output | Execute `ls -la` in pane | Directory listing displayed correctly | Compare rendered output to expected text |\n| Interactive Programs | Run `vim` or `less` with known files | Screen clearing and cursor movement work | Verify escape sequences parsed and applied |\n| Color and Formatting | Execute commands with colored output | Colors and attributes displayed correctly | Check terminal cells have correct color values |\n| Large Output Volumes | Generate substantial text output | Scrollback buffer manages content correctly | Verify old lines preserved and accessible |\n| Real-time Output | Run streaming commands like `tail -f` | Output appears as generated | Check display updates without artificial delays |\n| Multiple Pane Output | Simultaneous activity in multiple panes | Each pane displays independently | Verify output doesn't cross pane boundaries |\n\nIntegration tests should use realistic shell commands and verify that the complete output appears correctly in the terminal multiplexer display. These tests can capture expected output from known commands and compare against actual multiplexer rendering results.\n\nThe **multi-pane interaction testing** verifies that window management operations work correctly with live PTY sessions and that focus changes, splits, and resizes maintain proper terminal behavior across all panes.\n\n| Integration Scenario | Test Setup | Expected Results | Verification Method |\n|---------------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Pane Creation | Split existing pane running shell | New shell starts in new pane | Verify independent shell processes |\n| Focus Switching | Switch between panes with different content | Active pane receives input correctly | Send keystrokes and verify only active pane responds |\n| Pane Resizing | Resize panes containing running programs | Programs adjust to new dimensions | Check program output adapts to new size |\n| Pane Closing | Close pane with running process | Process terminates cleanly | Verify process cleanup and layout adjustment |\n| Terminal Resize | Change terminal size with multiple panes | All panes resize proportionally | Verify programs in all panes see size changes |\n| Session Persistence | Long-running processes across operations | Processes continue running during layout changes | Check process state maintained through operations |\n\nMulti-pane integration tests should use long-running or interactive programs to verify that pane operations don't disrupt process execution. Programs like text editors, system monitors, or simple loops provide observable behavior for verification.\n\nThe **input routing verification** ensures that keyboard input reaches the correct destinations based on multiplexer state, prefix key detection works reliably, and command mode operations execute correctly.\n\n| Integration Scenario | Test Setup | Expected Results | Verification Method |\n|---------------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Normal Input Routing | Type in active pane | Characters appear in shell | Verify shell receives keystrokes |\n| Prefix Key Detection | Press configured prefix key | Multiplexer enters command mode | Check mode transition and visual feedback |\n| Command Execution | Execute split, resize, switch commands | Operations complete correctly | Verify layout changes and focus updates |\n| Complex Key Sequences | Multi-byte characters, function keys | Special keys handled correctly | Check UTF-8 decoding and escape sequence handling |\n| Input Mode Transitions | Switch between command and normal modes | Mode changes work reliably | Verify prefix timeout and mode indicators |\n| Signal Forwarding | Send Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z to active pane | Signals reach child processes | Check process signal handling |\n\nInput routing tests should simulate realistic typing patterns and keyboard combinations while monitoring both multiplexer state changes and shell process responses. These tests can use automated input generation with verification of expected outcomes.\n\n**Error Recovery Integration Testing** verifies that the multiplexer handles failure conditions gracefully and maintains system stability when components encounter errors or unexpected conditions.\n\n| Error Scenario | Trigger Condition | Expected Recovery | Verification Method |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Child Process Death | Kill shell process in pane | Pane marked as terminated, layout preserved | Check pane status and continued multiplexer operation |\n| PTY Allocation Failure | Exhaust PTY devices | Graceful error reporting | Verify error messages and continued operation |\n| Terminal Size Errors | Invalid window size updates | Fallback to previous valid size | Check dimension validation and error handling |\n| Escape Sequence Corruption | Malformed terminal output | Parser recovery without display corruption | Verify display remains consistent |\n| Memory Allocation Failures | Large scrollback buffers | Graceful degradation or cleanup | Check memory management and error reporting |\n| Signal Handling Errors | Rapid signal delivery | Consistent internal state | Verify signal handling robustness |\n\nError recovery tests should deliberately trigger failure conditions and verify that the multiplexer responds appropriately without crashing or corrupting its internal state. These tests help ensure reliable operation in production environments.\n\n> **Integration Testing Insight**: Many terminal multiplexer bugs only manifest under specific timing conditions or with particular combinations of shell programs and user input. Integration tests must exercise realistic usage patterns with sufficient duration to catch these intermittent issues.\n\n### Milestone Verification Checkpoints\n\nMilestone verification checkpoints provide concrete acceptance criteria and testing procedures to validate that each development milestone delivers the expected functionality. These checkpoints serve as quality gates to ensure solid foundations before progressing to more advanced features.\n\n**Milestone 1: PTY Creation Verification**\n\nThe PTY creation milestone establishes the foundational capability to spawn and manage shell sessions through pseudo-terminal devices. Verification focuses on correct PTY handling, process management, and basic terminal I/O functionality.\n\n| Verification Test | Procedure | Expected Outcome | Success Criteria |\n|------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n| PTY Allocation | Call `pty_session_create` with `/bin/bash` | Valid session with open file descriptors | `master_fd` and `slave_fd` both positive |\n| Process Spawning | Check child process creation | Shell process running with correct PID | `child_pid` valid and `process_running` true |\n| Basic I/O | Write command to PTY, read response | Shell executes command and returns output | Command output appears in read buffer |\n| Terminal Attributes | Create session and check terminal settings | PTY configured with proper terminal attributes | Terminal settings enable interactive use |\n| Window Size Setting | Call `pty_session_resize` with dimensions | Child process receives size update | Process sees correct window size via ioctl |\n| Session Cleanup | Call `pty_session_destroy` on active session | All resources cleaned up properly | File descriptors closed, process terminated |\n\n**Manual Verification Steps for Milestone 1:**\n\n1. **Compile the PTY test program**: Build a simple test program that creates a PTY session and enters an interactive loop\n2. **Run the test program**: Execute and verify it creates a shell session successfully\n3. **Type shell commands**: Enter commands like `echo hello`, `pwd`, `ls` and verify responses appear\n4. **Test window resizing**: Change terminal size and verify the shell receives size updates\n5. **Exit cleanly**: Terminate the test program and verify no processes remain and no file descriptors leak\n\nThe milestone 1 verification should demonstrate that PTY sessions behave identically to direct shell interaction, with commands executing normally and output appearing as expected.\n\n**Milestone 2: Terminal Emulation Verification**\n\nThe terminal emulation milestone implements escape sequence parsing and virtual screen buffer management.

Verification focuses on correct space allocation, independent pane operation, and visual layout rendering.\n\n| Verification Test | Procedure | Expected Outcome | Success Criteria |\n|------------------|-----------|------------------|------------------|\n| Horizontal Split | Split single pane horizontally | Two panes with independent shells | Each pane has separate PTY session |\n| Vertical Split | Split pane vertically | Panes divided along vertical boundary | Width allocation correct for both panes |\n| Nested Splits | Create complex split hierarchy | All panes receive correct dimensions | Layout tree calculates positions accurately |\n| Pane Focus | Switch focus between multiple panes | Input directed to active pane only | Only focused pane receives keystrokes |\n| Pane Resizing | Adjust pane boundaries | Panes resize maintaining minimums | Dimension changes propagated to PTY sessions |\n| Multi-Pane Rendering | Display all panes simultaneously | Complete terminal output with borders | All pane content visible with clear separation |\n\n**Manual Verification Steps for Milestone 3:**\n\n1. **Create initial pane**: Start multiplexer and verify single pane occupies full terminal\n2. **Split panes**: Create horizontal and vertical splits and verify independent shell sessions\n3. **Test focus switching**: Move between panes and verify input goes to correct shell\n4. **Verify independent operation**: Run different commands in each pane simultaneously\n5. **Test visual rendering**: Verify pane borders and status information display correctly\n6. **Resize terminal**: Change terminal size and verify all panes resize appropriately\n\nThe milestone 3 verification should demonstrate that multiple shell sessions operate independently in separate screen regions with proper visual separation and focus management.\n\n**Milestone 4: Key Bindings and UI Verification**\n\nThe key bindings and UI milestone implements command mode, configurable key bindings, status display, and complete user interface functionality.

The verification procedures bridge the gap between automated testing and user acceptance by providing concrete manual validation steps.\n\n**Architecture Decision: Automated vs Manual Verification**\n\n> **Decision: Combine Automated Testing with Manual Verification Checkpoints**\n> - **Context**: Milestone verification needs to validate both technical correctness and user experience\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Fully automated testing with programmatic verification\n>   2. Manual testing checklists with human verification\n>   3. Hybrid approach combining automated tests with manual validation\n> - **Decision**: Use hybrid approach with automated tests for technical correctness and manual checkpoints for user experience\n> - **Rationale**: Terminal multiplexers have complex user interactions and visual behavior that are difficult to test programmatically, while technical components benefit from automated verification. Manual checkpoints catch usability issues and integration problems that automated tests miss.\n> - **Consequences**: Verification process requires both automated test execution and human validation, but provides comprehensive coverage of both technical and user experience requirements.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe testing strategy for a terminal multiplexer requires a combination of isolated component testing, integration verification with real processes, and milestone-driven acceptance testing.

this section provides comprehensive debugging approaches that span PTY functionality (M1), terminal emulation accuracy (M2), window management behavior (M3), and input handling correctness (M4)\n\n### Mental Model: The Detective's Toolkit\n\nThink of debugging a terminal multiplexer like being a detective investigating a complex crime scene. You have multiple suspects (components) that could be causing the problem, various types of evidence (logs, system calls, terminal output), and different investigative techniques (debugging tools, test cases, systematic observation). Just as a detective follows clues systematically from symptoms back to root causes, debugging a terminal multiplexer requires methodical investigation through the layers of PTY management, terminal emulation, window management, and input handling.\n\nThe key insight is that terminal multiplexer bugs often manifest in one component but originate in another. A rendering problem might stem from corrupted escape sequence parsing, which could be caused by incomplete UTF-8 decoding, which might result from improper PTY I/O handling. Like solving a mystery, you need to trace the evidence backwards through the data flow to find the true culprit.\n\nBuilding a terminal multiplexer involves orchestrating multiple complex systems (process management, terminal emulation, signal handling, I/O multiplexing) that interact in subtle ways. When things go wrong, the symptoms can be confusing and misleading. This debugging guide provides systematic approaches to diagnose issues across all components and integration points.\n\nThe debugging process for terminal multiplexers differs from typical application debugging because you're dealing with low-level system interfaces (PTYs, signals, terminal control), real-time I/O processing, and stateful terminal emulation. Problems can be timing-dependent, process-specific, or terminal-dependent, making them challenging to reproduce and isolate.\n\n## PTY and Process Issues\n\n> **Mental Model: The Nursery Supervisor**\n> \n> Debugging PTY and process issues is like being a nursery supervisor responsible for multiple children (processes) in separate rooms (PTYs). When a child stops responding, you need to check if they're sleeping (blocked), sick (crashed), or if their room's intercom system (PTY) is broken. Sometimes the problem isn't with the child but with the communication system connecting you to them.\n\nPTY and process debugging involves understanding the complex interactions between parent and child processes, pseudo-terminal devices, process groups, and signal handling. These issues often manifest as hanging sessions, unresponsive shells, or mysterious process termination.\n\n### Common PTY Creation and Management Problems\n\nThe most frequent category of PTY issues occurs during the initial creation and setup phase. These problems often result from incorrect file descriptor management, improper session setup, or failure to establish the controlling terminal relationship correctly.\n\n| Problem Category | Symptom | Root Cause | Detection Method |\n|-----------------|---------|------------|------------------|\n| PTY Allocation Failure | `pty_session_create()` returns `TMUX_ERROR_PTY_ALLOCATION` | System limit reached or permissions issue | Check errno after `posix_openpt()` call |\n| Child Process Hangs | Shell never appears, no prompt displayed | Child didn't become session leader or slave not opened correctly | Check if `setsid()` succeeded and slave opened in child |\n| Input Not Reaching Shell | Typing produces no response | Master/slave file descriptors swapped or not connected | Verify data flow with write to master, read from slave |\n| Garbled Output | Text appears corrupted or missing | Terminal attributes not set correctly | Compare termios settings between real terminal and PTY |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: File Descriptor Leaks Across Fork**\n\nOne of the most common mistakes is failing to properly manage file descriptors across the fork boundary. The parent process should close the slave file descriptor after forking, and the child should close the master. Leaving both ends open in both processes can cause I/O to hang or behave unpredictably.\n\n```c\n// WRONG - both processes keep both file descriptors\nif (fork() == 0) {\n    // Child still has master_fd open - this is wrong\n    dup2(slave_fd, STDIN_FILENO);\n    // ...\n}\n// Parent still has slave_fd open - this is also wrong\n\n// CORRECT - each process closes the file descriptor it doesn't need\npid_t pid = fork();\nif (pid == 0) {\n    close(master_fd);  // Child closes master\n    setsid();          // Become session leader\n    dup2(slave_fd, STDIN_FILENO);\n    // ...\n} else {\n    close(slave_fd);   // Parent closes slave\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe debugging approach for file descriptor issues involves checking `/proc/PID/fd/` for both parent and child processes to verify which file descriptors are open and ensuring they point to the expected devices.\n\n### Process Lifecycle and Signal Handling Issues\n\nProcess management problems often involve incorrect signal handling, failure to detect child termination, or improper cleanup when processes exit unexpectedly.\n\n| Signal Issue | Symptom | Debugging Approach | Solution |\n|-------------|---------|-------------------|----------|\n| SIGCHLD Not Handled | Zombie processes accumulate | Check `ps aux` for `<defunct>` processes | Install SIGCHLD handler with `SA_NOCLDWAIT` |\n| Child Termination Undetected | Pane remains active after shell exits | Monitor `pty_session_is_alive()` return value | Use `waitpid()` with `WNOHANG` to check status |\n| Signal Delivery to Wrong Process | Ctrl-C doesn't work in shell | Check process group IDs with `ps -o pid,ppid,pgid,sid` | Ensure child calls `setsid()` before exec |\n| Race Condition on Cleanup | Segmentation fault during session destruction | Use debugging tools to check cleanup order | Implement reference counting for session objects |\n\n> **Decision: Signal Handler Safety**\n> - **Context**: Signal handlers can interrupt any code, creating race conditions with normal program flow\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Self-pipe trick to convert signals to file descriptor events\n>   - Signal masking with signalfd() on Linux\n>   - Traditional signal handlers with atomic flags\n> - **Decision**: Use self-pipe trick for signal-safe event loop integration\n> - **Rationale**: Portable across Unix systems and integrates cleanly with select()-based event loop\n> - **Consequences**: Requires additional file descriptor and pipe management but eliminates race conditions\n\nThe self-pipe trick involves writing a byte to a pipe from the signal handler and monitoring the pipe's read end in the main event loop. This converts asynchronous signals into synchronous file descriptor events.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Race Conditions in Process Group Management**\n\nSetting up process groups correctly requires careful attention to timing. The child process must call `setsid()` before opening the slave PTY, and the parent must handle the case where the child terminates before the PTY setup completes.\n\n### PTY I/O and Communication Debugging\n\nPTY I/O issues manifest as data corruption, partial reads, or communication timeouts. These problems often stem from incorrect assumptions about PTY behavior or failure to handle partial I/O operations.\n\n| I/O Issue | Detection Method | Common Cause | Debugging Technique |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Partial Reads | `pty_session_read()` returns fewer bytes than expected | PTY operates in packet mode | Log all read sizes and buffer contents |\n| Write Blocking | Process hangs during `pty_session_write()` | Child process not reading, buffer full | Check PTY buffer size with `ioctl(FIONREAD)` |\n| Data Corruption | Characters appear wrong or missing | UTF-8 sequences split across reads | Hexdump raw PTY data before processing |\n| EOF Handling | Read returns 0 but child still running | Child closed stdout but not stderr | Monitor both stdout and stderr file descriptors |\n\nThe key insight for PTY I/O debugging is that PTYs don't guarantee atomic reads or writes for arbitrary data sizes. Applications must handle partial I/O operations and buffer management correctly.\n\n### Process State Inspection Techniques\n\nWhen debugging process issues, systematic inspection of process state provides crucial diagnostic information:\n\n1. **Process Tree Analysis**: Use `pstree -p` to visualize the relationship between the terminal multiplexer, child shells, and any subprocesses they've spawned\n2. **File Descriptor Audit**: Examine `/proc/PID/fd/` for each process to verify PTY file descriptors are open and point to expected devices\n3. **Process Group Verification**: Check process group and session IDs using `ps -o pid,ppid,pgid,sid,tty` to ensure session leadership is established correctly\n4. **Signal Mask Inspection**: Use `/proc/PID/status` to check which signals are blocked or ignored in each process\n5. **Memory Map Analysis**: For crashes, examine `/proc/PID/maps` to identify memory corruption or unexpected library loading\n\n## Terminal Emulation Debugging\n\n> **Mental Model: The Language Translator**\n> \n> Debugging terminal emulation is like troubleshooting a simultaneous translation system. The terminal emulator receives a stream of mixed languages (regular text + control codes) and must parse them correctly to produce the right display output. When translation fails, you might see garbled text (parsing errors), missing words (incomplete sequences), or text in the wrong place (cursor tracking bugs).\n\nTerminal emulation debugging focuses on the accuracy of escape sequence parsing, screen buffer management, and the complex state transitions involved in maintaining a virtual terminal display.\n\n### Escape Sequence Parsing Issues\n\nEscape sequence parsing problems are among the most common terminal emulation bugs. They manifest as incorrect cursor positioning, missing text formatting, or garbled display output.\n\n| Parsing Issue | Visual Symptom | Root Cause | Diagnostic Approach |\n|---------------|----------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Incomplete Sequence Handling | Text appears with escape characters visible | Parser doesn't buffer partial sequences across reads | Log raw input stream and parser state transitions |\n| Parameter Parsing Errors | Cursor moves wrong distance or colors incorrect | CSI parameter parsing fails for edge cases | Test with sequences having missing/multiple parameters |\n| UTF-8 Boundary Issues | Foreign characters appear corrupted | Multibyte characters split across I/O boundaries | Verify UTF-8 decoder handles partial sequences |\n| State Machine Corruption | Parser stuck, no longer processes sequences | Invalid state transition or missing reset logic | Add state validation and recovery mechanisms |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming Complete Escape Sequences**\n\nA critical mistake is assuming that each call to `pty_session_read()` contains complete escape sequences. PTY reads can split escape sequences at arbitrary boundaries, requiring the parser to buffer incomplete sequences and resume parsing when more data arrives.\n\n```c\n// WRONG - assumes complete sequences\nchar buffer[1024];\nint bytes = pty_session_read(session, buffer, sizeof(buffer));\nescape_parser_process_byte(parser, screen_buffer, buffer[0]); // Only processes first byte\n\n// CORRECT - processes all bytes and handles partial sequences\nfor (int i = 0; i < bytes; i++) {\n    escape_parser_process_byte(parser, screen_buffer, buffer[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThe escape sequence parser must maintain state across multiple read operations, buffering incomplete sequences until they can be completed.\n\n### Screen Buffer State Debugging\n\nScreen buffer corruption manifests as incorrect text placement, missing characters, or cursor tracking errors. These issues often result from bounds checking failures or incorrect scrolling logic.\n\n| Buffer Issue | Symptom | Debugging Method | Prevention |\n|-------------|---------|------------------|------------|\n| Cursor Out of Bounds | Crash or corruption when writing | Add assertions for cursor position validity | Clamp cursor to screen boundaries |\n| Scroll Buffer Overflow | Old lines disappear unexpectedly | Monitor scrollback buffer size | Implement circular buffer with size limits |\n| Attribute Inconsistency | Text formatting appears wrong | Compare stored attributes with expected values | Log attribute changes with screen position |\n| Line Wrapping Errors | Text appears on wrong lines | Trace cursor movement during long line input | Implement proper line wrapping state tracking |\n\n> **Decision: Screen Buffer Representation**\n> - **Context**: Need to store terminal content with per-character attributes and handle scrolling efficiently\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Array of lines, each line is array of characters\n>   - Flat array with row/column indexing\n>   - Circular buffer for scrollback with separate visible area\n> - **Decision**: Array of lines with separate circular scrollback buffer\n> - **Rationale**: Matches terminal semantics, simplifies line-oriented operations like scrolling and clearing\n> - **Consequences**: Enables efficient scrolling but requires careful index management for scrollback\n\nThe screen buffer debugging process involves validating buffer state consistency at key points: after cursor movement, after character insertion, and after scrolling operations.\n\n### Terminal Attribute and Color Handling\n\nColor and text attribute bugs often manifest as incorrect visual formatting or attributes that persist when they shouldn't. These issues typically involve state management problems in the attribute tracking system.\n\n| Attribute Issue | Visual Effect | Root Cause Analysis | Fix Strategy |\n|----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Color Bleeding | Colors appear in wrong places | Attribute reset not handled correctly | Verify SGR 0 (reset) sequence processing |\n| Bold/Underline Stuck | Formatting persists after reset | Current attribute state not updated | Track attribute changes in parser state |\n| 256-Color Mode Issues | Colors appear wrong or default | Color palette not initialized or indexed incorrectly | Validate color index bounds and palette setup |\n| Saved Cursor Attributes | Formatting wrong after cursor restore | Saved cursor doesn't include text attributes | Store complete cursor state including attributes |\n\nThe terminal attribute system requires careful state management because attributes are modal - they persist until explicitly changed or reset. Debugging attribute issues involves tracking the complete attribute state through all sequences that modify it.\n\n### UTF-8 and Character Width Debugging\n\nUTF-8 and wide character handling presents unique challenges because character encoding and display width don't always align simply. These issues often manifest as text misalignment or corrupted display of international characters.\n\n| Character Issue | Display Problem | Debugging Technique | Solution |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Incomplete UTF-8 Sequences | Question marks or corrupted characters | Hexdump raw bytes vs decoded codepoints | Buffer incomplete sequences across reads |\n| Wide Character Positioning | Asian text overlaps or has gaps | Check terminal cell occupation for wide chars | Use `utf8_is_wide_character()` for width calculation |\n| Combining Character Handling | Diacritical marks appear separately | Test with composed vs decomposed Unicode forms | Implement grapheme cluster detection |\n| Emoji and Unicode Blocks | Modern emoji render incorrectly | Verify Unicode database version and width data | Update to current Unicode width specifications |\n\n> **Decision: UTF-8 Decoding Strategy**\n> - **Context**: PTY data can contain incomplete UTF-8 sequences split across read boundaries\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Decode each read buffer independently, discard incomplete sequences\n>   - Buffer incomplete sequences and resume decoding on next read\n>   - Convert to wide characters immediately for processing\n> - **Decision**: Buffer incomplete sequences with resume capability\n> - **Rationale**: Preserves character integrity and handles real-world PTY I/O patterns correctly\n> - **Consequences**: Requires stateful UTF-8 decoder but ensures no data loss\n\n## Debugging Tools and Techniques\n\n> **Mental Model: The Forensic Laboratory**\n> \n> Think of debugging tools as a forensic laboratory equipped with specialized instruments for analyzing different types of evidence. Just as forensic scientists use microscopes for physical evidence, chemical tests for substances, and DNA analysis for biological samples, terminal multiplexer debugging requires different tools for different types of problems: system call tracers for I/O issues, terminal capture tools for emulation problems, and memory analyzers for crash investigation.\n\n### System Call Tracing and Analysis\n\nSystem call tracing provides the most detailed view of how the terminal multiplexer interacts with the kernel, revealing PTY operations, signal delivery, and process management activities that are invisible at the application level.\n\n| Tool | Use Case | Key Options | Example Command |\n|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|\n| strace | Trace system calls and signals | `-f` follow forks, `-e` filter calls, `-o` output file | `strace -f -e trace=openat,read,write,ioctl,clone,wait4 ./tmux` |\n| ltrace | Trace library function calls | `-f` follow forks, `-e` filter functions | `ltrace -f -e 'posix_openpt+ioctl+tcsetattr' ./tmux` |\n| perf | Performance profiling and tracing | `record` capture events, `report` analyze | `perf record -g ./tmux; perf report` |\n| ftrace | Kernel-level tracing (Linux) | Event tracing, function graphs | `echo 'pty*' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter` |\n\nThe system call tracing approach for PTY debugging follows this systematic process:\n\n1. **Initial Trace Capture**: Run the terminal multiplexer under strace with comprehensive tracing to capture all system interactions\n2. **Call Sequence Analysis**: Examine the sequence of `openat()`, `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` calls related to PTY file descriptors\n3. **Signal Correlation**: Match SIGCHLD delivery with child process state changes and PTY I/O patterns\n4. **Error Code Investigation**: Focus on system calls that return errors (return value -1) and examine the errno values\n5. **Timing Analysis**: Look for patterns in call timing that might indicate race conditions or blocking I/O issues\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Strace Output Interpretation**\n\nStrace output can be overwhelming and misleading if not interpreted carefully. Focus on the system calls that matter for your specific issue rather than trying to understand every call. Filter the trace to relevant call types and look for patterns rather than individual calls.\n\n### Terminal Capture and Replay Tools\n\nTerminal capture tools allow you to record and analyze the exact sequence of data flowing between the terminal multiplexer and the terminal, enabling precise diagnosis of terminal emulation issues.\n\n| Tool Category | Tool Name | Purpose | Usage Pattern |\n|---------------|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| Terminal Recording | `script` | Record terminal session with timing | `script -t terminal.log 2>timing.log` |\n| Data Stream Capture | `tee` with named pipes | Split data streams for analysis | `mkfifo debug.pipe; tee debug.pipe | hexdump -C` |\n| Escape Sequence Analysis | `cat -v` | Show control characters visually | `cat -v logfile` to see escape sequences |\n| Binary Data Analysis | `hexdump` / `xxd` | Examine raw byte sequences | `hexdump -C ptydump.raw` |\n\nThe terminal capture debugging workflow involves several stages:\n\n1. **Data Stream Isolation**: Capture the raw data flowing from PTY to terminal emulator using file descriptor redirection or pipe tapping\n2. **Sequence Identification**: Use hexdump or specialized tools to identify escape sequences and their boundaries in the captured data\n3. **Parser State Reconstruction**: Manually trace through the escape sequence parser state machine using the captured data to identify where parsing fails\n4. **Expected vs Actual Comparison**: Generate known good escape sequences and compare with the captured problematic sequences\n5. **Reproduction with Synthetic Data**: Create minimal test cases that reproduce the parsing issue with controlled input sequences\n\n### Memory and Resource Analysis\n\nMemory analysis tools help diagnose crashes, memory leaks, and resource management issues that are common in terminal multiplexers due to their complex process and buffer management.\n\n| Analysis Type | Tool | Key Features | Usage Example |\n|---------------|------|-------------|---------------|\n| Memory Error Detection | Valgrind | Leak detection, use-after-free, bounds checking | `valgrind --leak-check=full --track-fds=yes ./tmux` |\n| Address Sanitization | GCC/Clang ASan | Compile-time instrumentation for memory errors | `gcc -fsanitize=address -g -o tmux tmux.c` |\n| Core Dump Analysis | GDB | Stack trace, variable inspection, memory examination | `gdb ./tmux core.dump; bt; info registers` |\n| Resource Monitoring | `lsof` / `ss` | File descriptor and network connection tracking | `lsof -p $(pgrep tmux)` |\n\n> **Decision: Memory Management Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Terminal multiplexers manage complex object lifetimes with PTY sessions, screen buffers, and layout trees\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Manual memory management with explicit cleanup functions\n>   - Reference counting for shared objects\n>   - Arena allocation for short-lived objects\n> - **Decision**: Manual memory management with explicit cleanup and cleanup handlers\n> - **Rationale**: Provides predictable performance and clear resource ownership semantics\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful cleanup ordering but avoids reference cycle complexities\n\n### Logging and Diagnostic Infrastructure\n\nBuilding comprehensive logging into the terminal multiplexer enables systematic debugging of complex interaction issues that are difficult to reproduce or trace with external tools.\n\n| Log Category | Information Captured | Log Level | Example Entry |\n|-------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| PTY Operations | Session creation, I/O operations, termination | DEBUG | `[DEBUG] pty_session_read: fd=5, bytes=42, data=\"ls -la\\r\\n\"` |\n| Parser State | Escape sequence parsing, state transitions | TRACE | `[TRACE] escape_parser: state=CSI_PARAMS, byte=0x6D, params=[1,32]` |\n| Layout Changes | Pane splits, resizes, focus changes | INFO | `[INFO] layout_split_pane: pane_id=2, type=VERTICAL, new_pane=3` |\n| Error Conditions | System call failures, validation errors | ERROR | `[ERROR] pty_session_create: posix_openpt() failed: errno=24 (EMFILE)` |\n\nThe logging infrastructure should support runtime log level adjustment and structured output that can be easily parsed by analysis tools. Key design considerations include:\n\n1. **Performance Impact Minimization**: Use conditional compilation or runtime checks to eliminate debug logging overhead in production builds\n2. **Thread Safety**: Ensure log operations are atomic when called from signal handlers or multiple execution contexts\n3. **Buffer Management**: Implement circular log buffers to prevent unbounded memory usage during long debugging sessions\n4. **Contextual Information**: Include relevant context like pane IDs, session IDs, and timestamps in all log entries\n5. **Binary Data Handling**: Provide hexdump formatting for raw PTY data and escape sequences\n\n### Systematic Debugging Methodology\n\nEffective terminal multiplexer debugging requires a systematic approach that moves from symptom observation through hypothesis formation to root cause identification:\n\n**Phase 1: Symptom Documentation**\n1. Record the exact steps to reproduce the issue, including terminal size, shell type, and input sequences\n2. Capture screenshots or terminal recordings showing the incorrect behavior\n3. Note any error messages, crash information, or unusual process states\n4. Identify which milestone's functionality is affected by the problem\n\n**Phase 2: Component Isolation**\n1. Determine whether the issue occurs in PTY management, terminal emulation, window management, or input handling\n2. Create minimal test cases that isolate the problem to specific component interactions\n3. Use component-level unit tests to verify individual component behavior\n4. Check if the issue reproduces with different shells, terminal sizes, or input patterns\n\n**Phase 3: Data Flow Analysis**\n1. Trace data flow from the problematic input through all processing stages to the final output\n2. Insert logging or debugging output at each stage to identify where the problem first appears\n3. Compare actual data flow with expected behavior based on the design specifications\n4. Identify any data transformation or state update that produces incorrect results\n\n**Phase 4: Root Cause Investigation**\n1. Use appropriate debugging tools based on the problem category (strace for PTY issues, memory tools for crashes, etc.)\n2. Form specific hypotheses about the root cause and design tests to validate or refute them\n3. Examine related code paths and error handling to understand the failure mechanism\n4. Consider timing issues, race conditions, and state management problems\n\n**Phase 5: Fix Validation**\n1. Implement targeted fixes that address the identified root cause\n2. Verify the fix resolves the original issue without introducing regressions\n3. Add automated tests that prevent the issue from recurring\n4. Update documentation and debugging guides with lessons learned\n\n### Integration Testing and End-to-End Validation\n\nIntegration testing for terminal multiplexers requires careful orchestration of real processes, terminals, and user input to validate correct behavior across all components working together.\n\n| Test Category | Validation Approach | Key Checkpoints | Automated Verification |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| PTY Integration | Spawn real shells, verify I/O | Shell prompt appears, commands execute | Compare expected vs actual output patterns |\n| Terminal Compatibility | Test with various terminal types | Escape sequences render correctly | Automated screenshot comparison |\n| Multi-Pane Behavior | Create splits, verify isolation | Independent scrolling, separate processes | Process tree validation, buffer content checks |\n| Signal Handling | Send signals, verify propagation | Ctrl-C reaches correct process | Monitor signal delivery with strace |\n\nThe integration testing framework should include:\n\n1. **Test Environment Standardization**: Use consistent terminal settings, shell configurations, and system resources across test runs\n2. **Output Verification**: Implement reliable methods for comparing terminal output that account for timing variations and terminal-specific rendering differences\n3. **Process State Monitoring**: Continuously monitor process states, file descriptors, and resource usage during tests\n4. **Failure Artifact Collection**: Automatically capture logs, core dumps, and system state when tests fail\n5. **Performance Baseline Tracking**: Monitor resource usage and response times to detect performance regressions\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe debugging infrastructure for a terminal multiplexer requires careful design to provide comprehensive diagnostic capabilities without impacting normal operation performance.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Logging Framework | Printf with log levels | Structured logging with JSON output |\n| Memory Debugging | Valgrind for development | AddressSanitizer for continuous integration |\n| System Call Tracing | Basic strace usage | Custom ptrace-based tracer for detailed analysis |\n| Performance Profiling | Simple timing measurements | Integrated perf counters and flame graphs |\n\n#### Recommended Debugging Infrastructure\n\n```\nsrc/\n  debug/\n    debug.h              ← Debug macros and log level definitions\n    debug.c              ← Logging implementation with level filtering\n    memory_tracker.h     ← Memory allocation tracking for leak detection\n    memory_tracker.c     ← Implementation of allocation tracking\n  test/\n    integration/\n      terminal_tests.c   ← End-to-end tests with real terminal interaction\n      pty_tests.c        ← PTY-specific integration tests\n      capture_utils.c    ← Terminal capture and replay utilities\n    unit/\n      parser_tests.c     ← Escape sequence parser unit tests\n      layout_tests.c     ← Window layout algorithm tests\n  tools/\n    log_analyzer.py      ← Script for parsing and analyzing debug logs\n    memory_report.sh     ← Valgrind wrapper for standardized memory analysis\n    terminal_replay.c    ← Tool for replaying captured terminal sessions\n```\n\n#### Core Debugging Infrastructure Code\n\n```c\n// debug.h -

this section describes potential enhancements that could be added after completing the core terminal multiplexer functionality\n\n### Mental Model: The Growing Ecosystem\n\nThink of future extensions like expanding a small mountain cabin into a full resort. The original cabin (our basic terminal multiplexer) provides shelter and basic amenities - you can split rooms, manage multiple guests, and coordinate activities. But as needs grow, you might add a lodge office where guests can check in and out even when you're away (session persistence), a concierge service that remembers guest preferences and provides custom amenities (advanced configuration), and recreational facilities that make the stay more enjoyable (copy mode, search, customizable displays).\n\nEach extension builds on the solid foundation already established, but adds new capabilities that transform the simple shelter into a sophisticated environment. The key architectural principle remains the same - maintain the core functionality while adding complementary systems that enhance the user experience without disrupting the fundamental operations.\n\n### Session Persistence\n\n**Session persistence** represents one of the most valuable extensions to a terminal multiplexer, transforming it from a simple window manager into a persistent workspace that survives terminal disconnections, system reboots, and network failures. This capability allows users to detach from their multiplexer sessions and reattach later, finding their shell processes, command history, and screen state exactly as they left them.\n\nThe mental model for session persistence resembles a library reading room system. When you leave the library, the librarian carefully marks your place in each book, notes which books you were reading, remembers your preferred seating arrangement, and stores everything in a secure location. When you return hours or days later, the librarian reconstructs your exact workspace - same books open to the same pages, same arrangement on your desk, same reading lamp position. Session persistence provides this same continuity for terminal sessions.\n\n#### Session State Serialization\n\nImplementing session persistence requires serializing the complete state of a multiplexer session to persistent storage and later reconstructing that state when reattaching. The serialization must capture not just the visible terminal state, but the entire operational context that enables seamless continuation.\n\n| Component | State to Serialize | Format Considerations |\n|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| PTY Sessions | Process IDs, working directories, environment variables, terminal size | JSON with process metadata |\n| Screen Buffers | Character cells, attributes, cursor positions, scrollback history | Binary format with run-length encoding |\n| Layout Tree | Pane hierarchy, split ratios, focus state, minimum dimensions | Nested JSON structure |\n| Terminal State | Current attributes, saved cursor positions, parser state | Structured binary format |\n| Input Handler | Key binding overrides, prefix key state, command history | JSON configuration format |\n\nThe serialization process involves capturing a consistent snapshot of all components while they continue operating. This requires careful coordination to avoid capturing inconsistent intermediate states where some components have processed events that others have not yet seen.\n\n> **Decision: Session State Storage Format**\n> - **Context**: Need to balance serialization speed, storage efficiency, and format evolution compatibility\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Pure JSON for human readability and debugging ease\n>   2. Binary format for space efficiency and fast serialization\n>   3. Hybrid approach with JSON metadata and binary payload data\n> - **Decision**: Hybrid approach with JSON for structure and binary for screen buffer content\n> - **Rationale**: JSON provides format versioning and debugging capability while binary encoding efficiently stores large screen buffers and scrollback history\n> - **Consequences**: Enables fast serialization of large sessions while maintaining format evolution path and debugging accessibility\n\n#### Process State Management\n\nThe most complex aspect of session persistence involves managing the lifecycle of child processes across detach and reattach operations. Unlike simple state serialization, processes represent active system resources that must continue executing even when no terminal is attached to observe their output.\n\nWhen a session detaches, the multiplexer must transition all PTY sessions into a **background execution mode** where shell processes continue running but their output gets buffered rather than displayed. The PTY master file descriptors remain open and readable, but no terminal is connected to consume the output or provide input.\n\n| Process Management Task | Implementation Approach | Error Handling |\n|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| Output Buffering | Expand screen buffer to accommodate continued output during detachment | Implement buffer size limits with oldest line eviction |\n| Input Queuing | Store user input in persistent queue until processes can consume it | Handle queue overflow by dropping oldest input events |\n| Signal Forwarding | Maintain process group relationships for proper signal delivery | Detect and handle orphaned process groups |\n| Working Directory | Track and restore current working directory for each shell session | Handle cases where directories were deleted during detachment |\n| Environment Variables | Preserve environment modifications made during session execution | Detect conflicts with system-wide environment changes |\n\nThe challenge lies in maintaining the illusion that the terminal never disconnected. When reattaching, processes should behave exactly as if the terminal had been continuously available. This requires buffering all output generated during detachment and presenting it seamlessly when the user reconnects.\n\n#### Session Discovery and Management\n\nSession persistence introduces the need for a **session registry** that tracks active detached sessions and enables users to discover and reattach to them. This registry must survive multiplexer restarts and provide meaningful session identification.\n\n```\nSession Registry Schema:\n- Session ID: Unique identifier for session instance\n- Session Name: User-friendly name for easy identification  \n- Creation Time: When session was originally created\n- Last Attach Time: When user was last connected to session\n- Process Count: Number of active shell processes in session\n- Working Directory: Base directory where session was created\n- Layout Summary: Brief description of pane configuration\n- State File Path: Location of serialized session state\n```\n\nThe registry enables commands like \"list all detached sessions\", \"attach to session by name\", \"kill abandoned session\", and \"rename existing session\". Each registry entry contains enough metadata for users to identify the session they want without loading the full session state.\n\nSession naming conventions become important for usability. The system should support both automatic naming (based on working directory or primary command) and user-specified names. Name collision resolution and session lifecycle management (automatic cleanup of old sessions) help maintain a manageable session namespace.\n\n#### Reattachment and State Reconstruction\n\nThe reattachment process represents the inverse of session serialization - reconstructing a complete operational multiplexer from persistent storage. This process must restore not just the visible state, but the entire execution context that enables continued operation.\n\nThe reconstruction follows a carefully ordered sequence:\n\n1. **Validate session state integrity** by checking file format versions, verifying process existence, and confirming PTY device availability\n2. **Reconstruct PTY sessions** by reconnecting to existing child processes or detecting terminated processes that require restart\n3. **Restore screen buffers** by deserializing character grids, cursor positions, and scrollback history for each pane\n4. **Rebuild layout tree** by recreating the split hierarchy and calculating current pane dimensions for the new terminal size\n5. **Initialize input handler** by restoring key bindings, command history, and prefix key state\n6. **Synchronize terminal state** by applying any buffered output generated during detachment and updating display\n\nThe most delicate aspect involves handling process state changes that occurred during detachment. Child processes may have terminated, changed working directories, modified environment variables, or generated substantial output. The reattachment logic must detect these changes and adapt appropriately.\n\n| Process State Change | Detection Method | Recovery Action |\n|---------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Process Termination | Check process existence via kill(pid, 0) | Display termination status and offer restart option |\n| Working Directory Change | Compare stored vs current pwd from process | Update session working directory tracking |\n| Environment Modification | Not directly detectable | Accept changes as part of normal session evolution |\n| Substantial Output | Check PTY buffer size and modification time | Present buffered output with clear delineation markers |\n| Resource Exhaustion | Monitor PTY buffer and system resource usage | Implement graceful degradation with user notification |\n\n#### Detachment Signal Handling\n\nClean detachment requires the multiplexer to respond appropriately to various disconnection scenarios - user-initiated detachment, terminal closure, network disconnection, or system shutdown. Each scenario demands different preservation strategies.\n\nUser-initiated detachment (triggered by a key binding like prefix-d) represents the clean case where the multiplexer can perform orderly serialization with advance notice. Terminal closure or network disconnection requires the multiplexer to detect the condition through failed I/O operations and initiate emergency serialization. System shutdown presents the most challenging case, requiring rapid state preservation within the constraints of shutdown timeouts.\n\nThe multiplexer should register signal handlers for `SIGHUP` (terminal hangup), `SIGTERM` (termination request), and `SIGINT` (interrupt) to initiate appropriate detachment procedures. Emergency serialization prioritizes preserving critical state (process IDs, current commands) over complete state (full scrollback history) when time constraints prevent full serialization.\n\n### Advanced Terminal Features\n\nBeyond session persistence, numerous advanced features can enhance the terminal multiplexer's usability and power-user appeal. These features transform the basic split-screen interface into a sophisticated terminal workspace with integrated text manipulation, search capabilities, and customizable information displays.\n\n#### Copy Mode and Text Selection\n\n**Copy mode** enables keyboard-driven text selection and clipboard integration within the terminal multiplexer, allowing users to select and copy text from any pane's screen buffer or scrollback history without requiring mouse interaction. This feature particularly benefits users working in mouse-free environments or over high-latency connections where mouse interaction proves cumbersome.\n\nThe mental model for copy mode resembles switching a text editor into selection mode. The normal terminal interface transitions into a navigation interface where cursor movement keys traverse the screen buffer, selection keys mark text regions, and copy commands transfer selected content to the system clipboard or internal paste buffer.\n\n| Copy Mode Action | Key Binding | Implementation Requirements |\n|------------------|-------------|----------------------------|\n| Enter Copy Mode | prefix + [ | Freeze current pane display and overlay cursor |\n| Navigation | Arrow keys, hjkl | Move cursor through screen buffer and scrollback |\n| Start Selection | Space or v | Mark selection start position |\n| End Selection | Enter or y | Mark selection end and copy to clipboard |\n| Line Selection | V | Select entire lines for rapid bulk copying |\n| Search in Buffer | / or ? | Find text patterns within current pane |\n| Exit Copy Mode | Escape or q | Return to normal terminal interaction mode |\n\nThe implementation requires maintaining a **copy cursor** that moves independently of the terminal cursor, overlaying the display to show current position. The copy cursor can navigate beyond the visible screen into scrollback history, enabling access to commands and output from earlier in the session.\n\nText selection involves tracking start and end positions within the screen buffer coordinate system. The selection must handle line wrapping, character encoding, and mixed content (text with escape sequences). When copying, the system extracts plain text content while preserving line breaks and word boundaries.\n\n#### Search and Pattern Matching\n\nIntegrated search functionality enables users to locate specific text patterns within pane contents, scrollback history, and across multiple panes simultaneously. This capability proves essential for reviewing long command outputs, finding specific log entries, or locating previous commands in shell history.\n\nThe search implementation operates on the character grid maintained by each pane's screen buffer, supporting both literal text matching and regular expression patterns. Search results highlight matching text and provide navigation between multiple matches within the same buffer.\n\n| Search Feature | Implementation Approach | User Interface |\n|----------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Incremental Search | Real-time pattern matching as user types query | Highlight matches and show match count |\n| Cross-Pane Search | Search all visible panes and present unified results | Switch between panes showing matches |\n| Historical Search | Search scrollback buffers for older content | Navigate through chronological matches |\n| Pattern Highlighting | Persistent highlighting of search terms | Toggle highlighting on/off per pane |\n| Search History | Remember recent search patterns for reuse | Arrow key navigation through search history |\n\nThe search engine must handle **UTF-8 text encoding** correctly, supporting multi-byte character sequences and wide characters that occupy multiple terminal cells. Pattern matching should operate on the logical character sequence rather than the raw byte stream or terminal cell array.\n\nRegular expression support enables powerful pattern matching for structured text like log files, configuration files, or command output. The implementation should provide a reasonable subset of regex features without requiring a full regex engine - basic character classes, quantifiers, and anchoring operators cover most use cases.\n\n#### Customizable Status Bar\n\nThe **status bar** provides persistent information display across the bottom of the terminal window, showing session status, pane information, system metrics, and user-defined content. A customizable status bar transforms from a simple information display into a powerful dashboard tailored to individual workflows.\n\nThe status bar architecture supports modular **status segments** that can be enabled, disabled, reordered, and configured independently. Each segment responsible for displaying specific information and updating at appropriate intervals.\n\n| Status Segment Type | Information Displayed | Update Frequency |\n|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Session Info | Session name, attach time, detached indicator | On session state changes |\n| Pane Status | Current pane index, total pane count, pane title | On focus changes and pane operations |\n| Process Status | Shell command, process ID, exit status | On process state changes |\n| System Metrics | CPU usage, memory usage, load average | Every 5-10 seconds |\n| Time Display | Current time, date, timezone | Every minute |\n| Custom Commands | Output from user-defined scripts | User-configurable intervals |\n\nThe status bar rendering system must efficiently update only changed segments to minimize terminal output and reduce visual flicker. This requires tracking the previous rendered state of each segment and generating differential updates when content changes.\n\nStatus bar configuration should support both built-in segment types and custom segments that execute user-defined commands or scripts. Custom segments enable integration with external systems - displaying git branch information, monitoring system services, or showing application-specific status.\n\n#### Advanced Key Binding System\n\nWhile the basic multiplexer provides essential key bindings for pane management, an advanced key binding system enables complete customization of the command interface, support for complex key sequences, and integration with external tools.\n\nThe advanced system supports **multi-key sequences** beyond the simple prefix-key model, enabling Emacs-style or Vim-style key combinations that can express complex commands efficiently. Users can define key sequences like `prefix C-w v` (prefix, then Ctrl-W, then v) for sophisticated command hierarchies.\n\n| Key Binding Feature | Implementation Requirements | Configuration Format |\n|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Multi-Key Sequences | State machine tracking partial key sequences | Hierarchical key mapping tree |\n| Conditional Bindings | Different bindings based on pane state or content | Conditional expression evaluation |\n| Command Composition | Combining multiple commands in single binding | Command scripting mini-language |\n| Mode-Specific Bindings | Different key meanings in copy mode vs normal mode | Mode-aware binding resolution |\n| Dynamic Bindings | Runtime creation of temporary key bindings | Programmatic binding registration |\n\nThe key binding system should provide **binding introspection** capabilities, enabling users to discover available commands, view current bindings, and detect binding conflicts. A built-in help system can display context-sensitive key binding information based on current mode and state.\n\nCommand composition enables sophisticated automation by combining basic operations into complex workflows. For example, a single key binding might create a new pane, start a specific application, resize the pane to preferred dimensions, and switch focus - all executed as an atomic operation.\n\n#### Window and Session Management\n\nAdvanced window management extends beyond basic pane splitting to provide sophisticated workspace organization capabilities. **Named windows** enable logical grouping of related panes, while **session templates** provide reproducible workspace setups for common development scenarios.\n\nNamed windows function like tabs in a web browser, where each window contains an independent set of panes with their own layout configuration. Users can switch between windows, rename windows, and create new windows with predefined layouts.\n\n| Window Management Feature | User Interface | Implementation Considerations |\n|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Window Creation | prefix + c (create), prefix + n (next) | Independent layout trees per window |\n| Window Navigation | prefix + 0-9 (by number), prefix + ' (by name) | Window registry with fast lookup |\n| Window Renaming | prefix + , (rename current window) | Persistent naming across session save/restore |\n| Window Status | Show window list in status bar | Efficient window state monitoring |\n| Window Templates | Create windows from predefined configurations | Template storage and parameterization |\n\nSession templates provide reproducible workspace creation by defining standard pane layouts, startup commands, and working directories for common development scenarios. A web development template might create panes for editor, development server, database console, and system monitoring - all initialized with appropriate commands and working directories.\n\nTemplate parameterization enables flexible reuse by accepting variables like project directory, server ports, or database connections. Users can instantiate templates with different parameters to create similar but customized workspaces.\n\n#### Integration Capabilities\n\nAdvanced terminal multiplexers benefit from integration with external tools and systems, enabling seamless workflows between terminal-based and graphical applications. Integration capabilities include clipboard synchronization, external editor support, and notification systems.\n\n**Clipboard integration** synchronizes the multiplexer's internal copy buffer with the system clipboard, enabling seamless text exchange with other applications. This requires platform-specific implementations for different operating systems and clipboard managers.\n\n| Integration Type | Implementation Approach | Platform Considerations |\n|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| System Clipboard | Use xclip/pbcopy/clip.exe for clipboard operations | Different utilities per OS |\n| External Editors | Launch editor with temporary files for complex editing | Handle editor configuration and file cleanup |\n| Desktop Notifications | Send notifications for background pane activity | Integration with system notification services |\n| File Manager | Open file paths from terminal in external file manager | Parse file paths from terminal output |\n| Web Browser | Launch URLs detected in terminal output | URL pattern recognition and browser selection |\n\nExternal editor integration enables users to edit complex text within the terminal multiplexer using their preferred graphical editor. This involves creating temporary files, launching the editor, and monitoring for file changes to update the terminal content.\n\nNotification integration helps users monitor background activity in detached or non-focused panes. The system can detect interesting events like command completion, error messages, or specific text patterns and generate desktop notifications to alert users.\n\n### Common Future Extension Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Session State Explosion**\nMany implementations attempt to serialize every possible piece of state, creating enormous session files and slow serialization. The key insight is that not all state needs persistence - transient UI state, temporary buffers, and cached calculations can be regenerated on reattachment. Focus on preserving only the essential state that cannot be reconstructed: process IDs, user input, and user-generated content.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Process Lifecycle Mismanagement**\nA common mistake involves assuming that child processes remain unchanged during detachment. In reality, processes may terminate, change working directories, create new child processes, or modify environment variables. The reattachment logic must detect and adapt to these changes rather than assuming static process state.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Copy Mode Performance Issues**\nImplementing copy mode by re-rendering the entire screen buffer for each cursor movement creates unacceptable performance for large scrollback buffers. Instead, use differential rendering that updates only the cursor position and selection highlighting. Pre-index the screen buffer content to enable efficient text search and navigation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Status Bar Update Frequency**\nUpdating the status bar on every terminal refresh or input event creates significant overhead and visual distraction. Implement intelligent update scheduling that refreshes segments only when their underlying data changes, and batch multiple changes to reduce rendering frequency.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Key Binding Conflicts**\nAdding advanced key binding features without considering conflicts with existing terminal applications creates user frustration. Maintain a registry of reserved key sequences, provide conflict detection when users define custom bindings, and offer escape mechanisms for sending literal key sequences to applications.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Session Storage | JSON files in ~/.tmux/sessions/ | SQLite database with indexed metadata |\n| Process Management | Simple PID tracking with kill() checks | Process control groups with resource monitoring |\n| Search Engine | Linear buffer scanning with basic patterns | Regex engine with incremental matching |\n| Configuration | Static compile-time configuration | Dynamic configuration with hot reloading |\n| Clipboard Integration | Shell commands (xclip/pbcopy) | Native OS APIs with format detection |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── cmd/tmux/\n│   ├── main.c                    ← main entry point\n│   └── commands/\n│       ├── detach.c              ← session detachment\n│       ├── attach.c              ← session reattachment  \n│       └── list_sessions.c       ← session discovery\n├── internal/\n│   ├── session/\n│   │   ├── persistence.c         ← session serialization\n│   │   ├── persistence.h\n│   │   ├── registry.c            ← session management\n│   │   └── registry.h\n│   ├── features/\n│   │   ├── copy_mode.c           ← text selection\n│   │   ├── copy_mode.h\n│   │   ├── search.c              ← buffer search\n│   │   ├── search.h\n│   │   ├── status_bar.c          ← customizable status\n│   │   └── status_bar.h\n│   └── integration/\n│       ├── clipboard.c           ← system clipboard\n│       ├── clipboard.h\n│       ├── notifications.c       ← desktop notifications\n│       └── notifications.h\n├── config/\n│   ├── templates/                ← session templates\n│   │   ├── dev_workspace.json\n│   │   └── monitoring.json\n│   └── bindings/                 ← key binding configs\n│       └── default.conf\n└── tests/\n    ├── session_persistence_test.c\n    ├── copy_mode_test.c\n    └── integration_test.c\n```\n\n#### Session Persistence Infrastructure\n\n```c\n// Session registry management - complete implementation\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <time.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    char session_id[64];\n    char session_name[128];\n    time_t creation_time;\n    time_t last_attach_time;\n    int process_count;\n    char working_directory[256];\n    char state_file_path[512];\n    bool is_attached;\n} session_registry_entry_t;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    session_registry_entry_t* entries;\n    int entry_count;\n    int capacity;\n    char registry_path[512];\n} session_registry_t;\n\n// Initialize session registry with persistent storage\nint session_registry_init(session_registry_t* registry, const char* config_dir) {\n    snprintf(registry->registry_path, sizeof(registry->registry_path), \n             \"%s/session_registry.json\", config_dir);\n    \n    registry->entries = malloc(sizeof(session_registry_entry_t) * 16);\n    registry->capacity = 16;\n    registry->entry_count = 0;\n    \n    // Create config directory if it doesn't exist\n    struct stat st = {0};\n    if (stat(config_dir, &st) == -1) {\n        mkdir(config_dir, 0700);\n    }\n    \n    // Load existing registry\n    return session_registry_load(registry);\n}\n\n// Save registry to persistent storage\nint session_registry_save(session_registry_t* registry) {\n    FILE* file = fopen(registry->registry_path, \"w\");\n    if (!file) return -1;\n    \n    fprintf(file, \"{\\n  \\\"sessions\\\": [\\n\");\n    for (int i = 0;

Building a terminal multiplexer requires understanding concepts from operating systems (processes, signals, file descriptors), terminal emulation (escape sequences, character encoding), user interface design (layout algorithms, input handling), and systems programming (I/O multiplexing, state machines). Each term in this glossary represents a building block that connects these domains, helping you understand not just what each concept means, but how it fits into the larger system architecture.\n\nJust as a good dictionary provides not only definitions but also etymology and usage examples, this glossary explains both the technical meaning of each term and its role in the terminal multiplexer ecosystem. The terms are organized to build conceptually from fundamental system concepts through specific implementation details.\n\n### Core System Concepts\n\nThe foundation of terminal multiplexing rests on several key operating system and terminal concepts that may be unfamiliar to developers who haven't worked extensively with Unix systems programming.\n\n| Term | Definition | Context in Terminal Multiplexer |\n|------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **terminal multiplexer** | A system that manages multiple shell sessions through a single terminal interface, allowing users to split screens, switch between sessions, and maintain persistent connections | The overarching system being built - coordinates PTY management, terminal emulation, and user interface |\n| **pseudo-terminal (PTY)** | A software device that emulates real terminal hardware, consisting of a master/slave pair where the master connects to an application and the slave connects to a shell process | Core abstraction enabling multiple shell sessions - each pane gets its own PTY pair |\n| **controlling terminal** | The terminal device associated with a process session that receives keyboard signals (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z) and can send signals to the session leader and process group | Critical for proper signal handling - child shells must have their PTY slave as controlling terminal |\n| **session leader** | The process that created a new session using `setsid()` and controls terminal access for all processes in that session | Each shell process becomes session leader for its PTY to ensure proper signal delivery |\n| **process group management** | System for organizing related processes so that signals can be delivered to entire groups rather than individual processes | Ensures that signals like SIGTERM reach not just the shell but all child processes it spawns |\n| **session persistence** | The ability to detach from a running terminal multiplexer session and reattach later, with all shell sessions continuing to run in the background | Future extension that would require serializing window manager state and PTY session information |\n| **raw terminal mode** | Terminal configuration that bypasses line-buffering and signal processing, passing all input directly to the application for processing | Essential for capturing prefix keys and special key combinations for multiplexer commands |\n| **canonical terminal mode** | Default terminal configuration where the kernel handles line editing, signal generation, and input buffering before passing complete lines to applications | Must be disabled for multiplexer operation but restored on exit for normal terminal behavior |\n\n### PTY Management and Process Control\n\nThe PTY management layer deals with the low-level details of creating and managing pseudo-terminal pairs and the shell processes that connect to them.\n\n| Term | Definition | Context in Terminal Multiplexer |\n|------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **PTY allocation** | Process of requesting a new pseudo-terminal pair from the kernel using `posix_openpt()` or similar system calls | First step in creating new pane - must handle allocation failures gracefully |\n| **master file descriptor** | The file descriptor connected to the master side of a PTY pair, used by the terminal multiplexer to read shell output and write user input | Core I/O channel - added to select() monitoring for reading shell output to display |\n| **slave file descriptor** | The file descriptor connected to the slave side of a PTY pair, used by shell processes as their stdin, stdout, and stderr | Connected to child shell process - must be properly configured as controlling terminal |\n| **child process termination** | Event when a shell process exits, detected through SIGCHLD signals and handled by updating pane state and potentially closing the pane | Must be detected promptly to update UI and clean up resources -
