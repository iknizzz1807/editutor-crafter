The key architectural challenge is building a constraint-based type inference engine that can unify type constraints while supporting polymorphism through let-generalization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"context-and-problem-statement\">Context and Problem Statement</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Type checking serves as the foundational safety mechanism in statically typed programming languages, catching errors at compile time before they manifest as runtime failures. Building a type checker requires sophisticated algorithms that can not only validate explicit type annotations but also infer types where they are omitted, unify conflicting constraints, and support advanced features like polymorphism. Understanding why these algorithms are necessary—and how they work together—is crucial for implementing a robust type system that provides both safety and expressiveness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-checking-as-contract-verification\">Type Checking as Contract Verification</h3>\n<p>Think of type checking as a legal contract verification system in a complex business transaction. Just as lawyers review contracts to ensure all parties&#39; obligations are clearly defined, mutually compatible, and legally enforceable, a type checker examines program code to verify that all data flows, function calls, and variable assignments respect the &quot;contracts&quot; defined by type annotations.</p>\n<p>In this analogy, <strong>types are contracts</strong> that specify what operations are permissible on a piece of data. When you declare a variable as <code>int</code>, you&#39;re establishing a contract that this storage location will only hold integer values and support integer operations like arithmetic. When you define a function with signature <code>string -&gt; int</code>, you&#39;re creating a contract promising to accept any string input and produce an integer output.</p>\n<p>The <strong>type checker acts as the contract lawyer</strong>, examining every interaction between program components to ensure contract compliance. When it encounters a function call, it verifies that the arguments provided match the parameter contracts, just as a lawyer would verify that each party in a business deal can fulfill their stated obligations. When it sees an assignment, it checks that the value being stored satisfies the variable&#39;s contract requirements.</p>\n<p>But unlike simple contract verification, type checking must handle <strong>implicit contracts</strong>—situations where the programmer hasn&#39;t explicitly stated the types involved. This is where type inference becomes essential. Imagine a business lawyer who must not only verify explicit contract terms but also infer unstated obligations from context and industry standards. If a contract mentions &quot;delivery within 30 days&quot; but doesn&#39;t specify the delivery method, the lawyer might infer reasonable constraints based on the product type and industry norms.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when a type checker encounters code like <code>let x = 42 + y</code>, it must infer that <code>x</code> has integer type based on the integer literal <code>42</code> and the addition operation, while also constraining <code>y</code> to be integer-compatible. This inference process generates <strong>type constraints</strong>—requirements that must be satisfied for the program to be well-typed.</p>\n<p>The most sophisticated part of this analogy involves <strong>contract templates</strong>—polymorphic types that can be instantiated with specific terms for different situations. Just as a business might use template contracts where blanks are filled in based on the specific deal (vendor name, delivery date, payment amount), polymorphic functions use type variables that get instantiated with concrete types at each call site. The type checker must ensure that each instantiation of the template produces valid, consistent contracts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: Type checking is fundamentally about proving that a program&#39;s implicit promises can be consistently fulfilled. Every expression makes promises about what type of value it produces, and every context makes demands about what types it can accept. The type checker&#39;s job is to verify that all promises match all demands throughout the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"existing-type-system-approaches\">Existing Type System Approaches</h3>\n<p>Different programming languages have evolved distinct approaches to type checking, each representing different trade-offs between safety, expressiveness, implementation complexity, and programmer burden. Understanding these approaches helps clarify why our constraint-based inference system requires sophisticated algorithms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"simple-type-checking-approach\">Simple Type Checking Approach</h4>\n<p>The simplest approach requires <strong>explicit type annotations everywhere</strong> and performs <strong>direct syntactic verification</strong> without inference. Languages like early versions of Pascal or C follow this model, where every variable declaration must include a type annotation, and the type checker simply verifies that each operation&#39;s operand types exactly match the expected types.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Simple Type Checking</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Annotation Requirement</td>\n<td>Explicit types required on all variables, parameters, return values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inference Capability</td>\n<td>None—types are only propagated, never inferred</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Complexity</td>\n<td>Linear pass through AST checking local compatibility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Detection</td>\n<td>Immediate—mismatch detected at each operation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphism Support</td>\n<td>None, or limited to ad-hoc overloading</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation Effort</td>\n<td>Low—straightforward recursive AST traversal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>In this system, checking a function call involves three simple steps: look up the function&#39;s declared signature, check that each argument&#39;s type exactly matches the corresponding parameter type, and propagate the declared return type to the call site. There&#39;s no constraint solving, no unification, and no type variable instantiation.</p>\n<p>The major limitation is <strong>annotation burden</strong>—programmers must write type annotations for every binding, even when the types are obvious from context. Code like <code>let length: int = 0</code> feels redundant when the integer literal makes the type clear. More importantly, this approach cannot support <strong>parametric polymorphism</strong>—generic functions that work with multiple types—because there&#39;s no mechanism for type variables or constraint solving.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hindley-milner-inference-approach\">Hindley-Milner Inference Approach</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Hindley-Milner type system</strong> represents the opposite extreme: maximal type inference with minimal annotations. Languages like ML, Haskell, and our target implementation use this approach, where most type annotations are optional and the system infers the most general types possible through constraint-based unification.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Hindley-Milner Inference</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Annotation Requirement</td>\n<td>Optional except at module boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inference Capability</td>\n<td>Complete—can infer most general types without annotations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Complexity</td>\n<td>Constraint generation + unification (roughly linear in practice)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Detection</td>\n<td>Deferred—errors surface when constraints become unsatisfiable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphism Support</td>\n<td>Full parametric polymorphism with let-generalization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation Effort</td>\n<td>High—requires constraint solving and unification algorithms</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The Hindley-Milner approach works through <strong>constraint generation</strong> and <strong>unification</strong>. When the type checker encounters an expression like <code>f(x)</code>, it doesn&#39;t immediately verify compatibility. Instead, it generates constraints: &quot;the type of <code>f</code> must be a function type from the type of <code>x</code> to some result type.&quot; These constraints accumulate throughout the program, forming a system of type equations.</p>\n<p>The <strong>unification algorithm</strong> then solves this constraint system by finding type substitutions that make all constraints simultaneously satisfiable. If unification succeeds, the program is well-typed and the algorithm has discovered the most general type for every expression. If unification fails, the constraints are inconsistent and the program contains a type error.</p>\n<p>The key insight enabling this approach is <strong>let-polymorphism</strong>: when a value is bound in a let-expression, its inferred type is generalized by quantifying over any type variables that don&#39;t escape the binding&#39;s scope. This allows the same function to be used at multiple types within the same program.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Constraint-Based Inference with Hindley-Milner</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We want to support both type safety and programmer convenience, with optional annotations and generic functions</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Simple explicit typing (like early Pascal)</li>\n<li>Constraint-based inference (Hindley-Milner)</li>\n<li>Gradual typing (mixed static/dynamic)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Implement constraint-based inference following the Hindley-Milner approach</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides maximum expressiveness with minimal annotation burden, supports full parametric polymorphism, and has well-understood theoretical foundations with proven decidability</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires implementing constraint generation, unification algorithm, and let-generalization, but provides excellent user experience and catches errors statically</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"gradual-typing-approach\">Gradual Typing Approach</h4>\n<p><strong>Gradual typing</strong> attempts to bridge static and dynamic typing by allowing programmers to add type annotations incrementally. Languages like TypeScript, Python with type hints, and Dart use this approach, where unannotated code is assigned a special &quot;dynamic&quot; type that bypasses static checking.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Aspect</th>\n<th>Gradual Typing</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Annotation Requirement</td>\n<td>Optional, with dynamic fallback for unannotated code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inference Capability</td>\n<td>Limited—inference within typed regions, dynamic elsewhere</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithm Complexity</td>\n<td>Multi-phase: static analysis where possible, runtime checks at boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Detection</td>\n<td>Mixed—static errors in typed code, runtime errors at dynamic boundaries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphism Support</td>\n<td>Varies—full polymorphism in static regions, duck typing in dynamic regions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation Effort</td>\n<td>Very high—requires both static analysis and runtime type checking infrastructure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Gradual typing introduces <strong>consistency checking</strong> instead of strict type equality. A dynamically-typed value is considered &quot;consistent&quot; with any static type, allowing gradual migration from dynamic to static typing. However, this consistency must be verified at runtime through <strong>type casts</strong> and <strong>proxy wrappers</strong> that check contracts at the boundaries between typed and untyped code.</p>\n<p>The complexity comes from maintaining <strong>type soundness</strong> in the presence of dynamic code. The static portions of the program must be protected from type violations that might originate in dynamic code, requiring sophisticated runtime monitoring and error reporting.</p>\n<h4 id=\"approach-comparison-and-selection\">Approach Comparison and Selection</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Approach</th>\n<th>Safety Guarantees</th>\n<th>Programmer Burden</th>\n<th>Implementation Complexity</th>\n<th>Expressiveness</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simple Explicit</td>\n<td>Full static safety</td>\n<td>High annotation burden</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Limited polymorphism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hindley-Milner</td>\n<td>Full static safety</td>\n<td>Minimal annotations</td>\n<td>Medium-High</td>\n<td>Full polymorphism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gradual</td>\n<td>Partial safety</td>\n<td>Optional annotations</td>\n<td>Very High</td>\n<td>Mixed paradigms</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For our educational type checker implementation, the Hindley-Milner approach provides the best balance of learning value and practical utility. It requires understanding sophisticated algorithms (constraint generation, unification, generalization) while producing a system that feels modern and expressive to use.</p>\n<p>The constraint-based inference approach also demonstrates important computer science concepts: the unification algorithm is a fundamental technique in automated reasoning, constraint solving appears throughout AI and optimization, and the type system&#39;s mathematical foundations connect to logic and formal methods.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Understanding</strong>: The need for sophisticated algorithms in type checking stems from the tension between expressiveness and verification. Simple type checking is easy to implement but forces programmers to state the obvious repeatedly. Powerful inference systems allow natural expression of polymorphic, generic code but require complex algorithms to ensure that the inferred types are sound and consistent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3

It should successfully infer types for the first two bindings and produce a clear error for the third, showing that your type representation, environment management, and basic checking components work together correctly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-non-goals\">Goals and Non-Goals</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building a type checker is like constructing a sophisticated quality assurance system for a manufacturing line. Just as a quality inspector must understand the specifications for each product, know how components fit together, and catch defects before they reach customers, our type checker must understand type specifications, verify that program components interact correctly, and catch type errors before runtime. However, unlike a simple inspection checklist, our type checker must also be a detective—inferring missing specifications and solving constraints to determine what types should be where no explicit annotations exist.</p>\n<p>The scope of this type checker project strikes a careful balance between educational value and implementation complexity. We aim to build a system sophisticated enough to demonstrate the core principles of modern type systems while remaining focused enough that a single developer can implement it thoroughly. This means including the essential features that make type checking both challenging and useful, while deliberately excluding advanced features that would multiply implementation complexity without proportional learning benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"primary-goals\">Primary Goals</h3>\n<p>Our type checker will accomplish four major objectives that progressively build upon each other to create a complete type inference system.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundational Type System Implementation</strong> forms the bedrock of our checker. We will implement a complete algebraic data type system for representing primitive types (<code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code>), function types (<code>TFun</code>), type variables (<code>TVar</code>), and polymorphic types (<code>TForall</code>). The system will include structural type equality checking through <code>type_equal</code>, proper scoping through a hierarchical <code>TypeEnv.t</code> structure, and fundamental type compatibility rules. This foundation must be rock-solid because every other component depends on these type representations and environment operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Constraint-Based Type Inference Engine</strong> represents the intellectual heart of the project. We will implement a complete Hindley-Milner style inference system that can deduce types for expressions without explicit annotations. The system will generate type constraints from expressions, solve them through a Robinson unification algorithm with <code>occurs_check</code> protection against infinite types, and apply the resulting substitutions to produce fully concrete types. This goes far beyond simple type checking—it&#39;s a constraint solver that can work backwards from usage patterns to determine what types variables and expressions must have.</p>\n<p><strong>Let-Polymorphism Support</strong> enables our type checker to handle generic programming patterns that are essential in real programming languages. We will implement type scheme representation with quantified variables, automatic generalization at let-bindings that abstracts over free type variables, and instantiation at use sites that creates fresh type variables for each polymorphic usage. This allows a single function definition to work at multiple types—a critical feature for writing reusable code.</p>\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Error Reporting System</strong> ensures that our type checker is actually usable by developers. We will implement detailed error messages that include source locations, clear descriptions of what went wrong, and helpful suggestions for fixes. The system will continue checking after encountering errors to find multiple problems in a single pass, and it will provide meaningful diagnostics when constraint solving fails or unification encounters impossible requirements.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes our core deliverables and their acceptance criteria:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Deliverable</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Representation</td>\n<td>Complete algebraic data type system</td>\n<td>All primitive, function, and generic types representable; structural equality works correctly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Environment</td>\n<td>Scoped symbol table with lookup/extension</td>\n<td>Proper lexical scoping; variable shadowing handled correctly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Checking</td>\n<td>Expression and statement type validation</td>\n<td>All language constructs type-checked; operator compatibility enforced</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Inference</td>\n<td>Constraint generation and unification</td>\n<td>Types inferred where not annotated; unification finds most general types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphism</td>\n<td>Let-polymorphism with generalization</td>\n<td>Single definitions usable at multiple types; proper quantification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Reporting</td>\n<td>Clear messages with source locations</td>\n<td>Multiple errors found per pass; helpful diagnostic information</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"explicit-non-goals\">Explicit Non-Goals</h3>\n<p>To maintain focus and achievable scope, we explicitly exclude several advanced type system features that would significantly complicate implementation without proportional educational benefit for understanding core type checking principles.</p>\n<p><strong>Dependent Types and Advanced Type Theory Features</strong> are deliberately excluded. We will not implement dependent types where types can depend on runtime values, type-level computation, or sophisticated type families. While these features appear in languages like Agda, Idris, and recent Haskell extensions, they require substantially more complex type checking algorithms and would shift the focus from understanding basic inference to navigating advanced type theory. Our goal is to understand how types flow through programs, not to explore the cutting edge of type system research.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect Systems and Advanced Control Flow Analysis</strong> remain outside our scope. We will not track side effects, exceptions, or other computational effects in our type system. Similarly, we exclude advanced control flow features like continuations, coroutines, or sophisticated exception handling mechanisms. While effect systems are increasingly important in modern functional languages, they represent a separate layer of complexity that would double the implementation burden without reinforcing the core type inference concepts we want to master.</p>\n<p><strong>Object-Oriented Type Features and Inheritance</strong> are not included in this implementation. We will not build support for classes, inheritance hierarchies, method dispatch, or subtyping beyond simple function type compatibility. While these features are central to languages like Java or C++, they introduce architectural complexity around vtables, method resolution, and inheritance diamond problems that distract from the core algorithms of constraint-based type inference.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Polymorphism Beyond Let-Polymorphism</strong> is excluded to keep the scope manageable. We will not implement higher-ranked types, existential quantification, type classes, or GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types). While these features enable powerful programming patterns, they require significantly more sophisticated constraint solving algorithms and would multiply the complexity of our unification engine beyond what&#39;s needed to understand the fundamental principles.</p>\n<p><strong>Production Language Features and Optimizations</strong> are consciously omitted. We will not implement module systems, separate compilation, incremental type checking, or performance optimizations like constraint caching or parallel inference. Similarly, we exclude features like type annotations for optimization hints, calling convention specifications, or memory layout controls. Our focus is on correctness and understanding, not on building a production-ready compiler infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Gradual Typing and Dynamic Interaction</strong> features are excluded. We will not implement any form of gradual typing that allows mixing typed and untyped code, runtime type reflection, or dynamic type checking mechanisms. While these features are increasingly important for language interoperability, they introduce runtime components and dynamic analysis that are orthogonal to the static analysis principles we want to understand.</p>\n<p>The following table clarifies what we explicitly will not implement:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Excluded Features</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Advanced Types</td>\n<td>Dependent types, type families, GADTs</td>\n<td>Requires advanced type theory beyond core inference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Effects</td>\n<td>Effect systems, exception tracking, continuations</td>\n<td>Separate complexity domain from basic type checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OOP Features</td>\n<td>Classes, inheritance, method dispatch</td>\n<td>Different architectural complexity than functional type inference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Advanced Polymorphism</td>\n<td>Higher-ranked types, type classes, existentials</td>\n<td>Would require sophisticated constraint solving extensions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Production Features</td>\n<td>Modules, separate compilation, optimizations</td>\n<td>Focus on correctness over performance and scale</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic Interaction</td>\n<td>Gradual typing, reflection, runtime types</td>\n<td>Introduces runtime components beyond static analysis</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"target-complexity-and-learning-outcomes\">Target Complexity and Learning Outcomes</h3>\n<p>Our type checker targets the complexity level of a sophisticated undergraduate compiler course final project or a graduate-level programming languages assignment. The implementation should require approximately 2000-3000 lines of well-structured code, with roughly equal complexity distributed across type representation, constraint generation, unification algorithm implementation, and polymorphism support.</p>\n<p><strong>Algorithm Implementation Depth</strong> will focus on understanding and implementing the core algorithms from first principles. Students will implement the Robinson unification algorithm with occurs check, understand why the occurs check prevents infinite types, and see how substitution composition works in practice. They will implement constraint generation that walks expression trees and collects type equality requirements, then solve those constraints to determine concrete types. This hands-on implementation of fundamental algorithms provides deep understanding that cannot be gained from just reading about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Type Theory Understanding</strong> will emerge naturally from implementing the system rather than being taught abstractly. Students will understand why let-polymorphism generalizes at let-bindings but not at lambda expressions, what the value restriction prevents, and how type schemes with quantified variables enable generic programming. They will see how type environments implement lexical scoping and why proper environment threading is crucial for correct type checking in nested expressions.</p>\n<p><strong>Software Architecture Skills</strong> will be developed through building a multi-component system where type representation, environment management, constraint solving, and error reporting must work together cleanly. Students will learn how to design algebraic data types that naturally represent the problem domain, how to structure recursive algorithms that traverse and transform complex data structures, and how to build error handling that provides useful feedback without crashing the entire system.</p>\n<p>The learning progression follows a carefully designed sequence where each milestone builds essential concepts needed for the next stage, ensuring that students understand not just what to implement, but why each component is necessary and how the pieces fit together to enable type inference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The power of this project lies not in implementing any single algorithm perfectly, but in understanding how type representation, constraint generation, unification, and polymorphism work together as a complete system. Each component constrains and enables the others, creating a whole that demonstrates the elegant interplay between theory and practice in programming language implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"success-metrics-and-validation\">Success Metrics and Validation</h3>\n<p>Success in this project will be measured through both functional correctness and conceptual understanding, with specific checkpoints at each milestone to ensure steady progress toward a complete system.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional Correctness Metrics</strong> provide objective measures of implementation quality. The type checker must correctly infer types for polymorphic expressions like <code>let id = fun x -&gt; x in (id 42, id true)</code>, producing types <code>(int * bool)</code> without any explicit annotations. It must detect type errors like <code>1 + true</code> and provide clear error messages explaining why integer addition cannot be applied to boolean operands. The unification algorithm must handle complex constraint sets and properly implement the occurs check to reject infinite types like <code>&#39;a = &#39;a -&gt; int</code>. Error recovery must continue checking after encountering problems to find multiple type errors in a single pass.</p>\n<p><strong>Conceptual Understanding Assessment</strong> focuses on whether students grasp the underlying principles rather than just copying implementation patterns. Students should be able to explain why let-polymorphism generalizes <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x</code> to type <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> but does not generalize the same expression when it appears as a function argument. They should understand why the occurs check prevents infinite types and be able to trace through the unification algorithm on specific examples. Most importantly, they should see how constraint-based inference enables type checking without explicit annotations while maintaining the safety guarantees of static typing.</p>\n<p><strong>Code Quality and Architecture Standards</strong> ensure that the implementation demonstrates good software engineering practices alongside algorithmic correctness. The code should exhibit clear separation between type representation, environment management, constraint generation, and unification solving. Error handling should be comprehensive without being defensive to the point of obscuring the main logic. The type representations should naturally reflect the mathematical structure of the type system, making the code serve as executable documentation of the algorithms.</p>\n<p>The following table defines specific validation criteria for each milestone:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Milestone</th>\n<th>Functional Test</th>\n<th>Conceptual Check</th>\n<th>Code Quality Standard</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Representation</td>\n<td>All primitive and composite types representable</td>\n<td>Explain structural vs nominal typing choice</td>\n<td>Clean algebraic data type definitions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Basic Type Checking</td>\n<td>Expressions and statements type-checked correctly</td>\n<td>Trace type rule applications by hand</td>\n<td>Clear separation of checking vs inference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Inference</td>\n<td>Types inferred for unannotated expressions</td>\n<td>Explain constraint generation process</td>\n<td>Unification algorithm cleanly separated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphism</td>\n<td>Polymorphic functions work at multiple types</td>\n<td>Explain generalization vs instantiation</td>\n<td>Type scheme handling properly abstracted</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The implementation approach balances theoretical understanding with practical software construction, providing complete infrastructure components while ensuring students implement the core algorithms themselves.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-technology-recommendations\">A.

Just as a legal department has specialized teams for contract review (lawyers), document management (paralegals), dispute resolution (mediators), and reporting (clerks), our type checker divides the complex task of type verification into specialized components. Each component has a clear responsibility, well-defined interfaces, and specific expertise, but they must work together seamlessly to transform raw source code into a verified, type-safe program.</p>\n<p>The type checker architecture follows a <strong>pipeline model</strong> where each stage adds more semantic understanding to the program representation. We start with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that captures the structural syntax of the program, then progressively annotate it with type information, resolve type constraints, and finally produce either a fully type-checked AST or comprehensive error reports. This pipeline approach allows us to separate concerns cleanly while maintaining the ability to recover from errors and continue checking to find multiple issues in a single pass.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Type Checker System Architecture\"></p>\n<p>The architecture is built around four core principles that guide component design and interaction patterns. <strong>Separation of concerns</strong> ensures that type representation logic is independent of inference algorithms, which are independent of error reporting mechanisms. <strong>Composability</strong> allows us to combine basic type checking with sophisticated inference without modifying existing components. <strong>Error resilience</strong> enables the system to continue checking after encountering type errors, maximizing the feedback provided to developers. <strong>Extensibility</strong> supports adding new type constructs (like algebraic data types) without requiring fundamental architectural changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Insight</strong>: The type checker&#39;s architecture mirrors the conceptual structure of type theory itself. Type representations correspond to the syntax of types, the type environment models variable binding and scoping rules, the inference engine implements type rules and constraint solving, and the error reporter translates formal type theory violations into human-readable feedback.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"component-responsibilities\">Component Responsibilities</h3>\n<p>The type checker system consists of four primary components, each with distinct responsibilities and clear boundaries. Understanding these boundaries is crucial because violations lead to tightly coupled code that becomes difficult to extend and debug.</p>\n<h4 id=\"type-representation-system\">Type Representation System</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Type Representation</strong> component serves as the foundation layer, defining the abstract syntax and semantics of types themselves. Think of this component as the &quot;type theory textbook&quot; of our system—it contains all the formal definitions of what constitutes a valid type, how types relate to each other, and the fundamental operations we can perform on types.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Key Operations</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Definition</td>\n<td>Algebraic data type defining the universe of possible types</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code>, <code>TVar</code>, <code>TFun</code>, <code>TForall</code> constructors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Equality</td>\n<td>Structural comparison of types for compatibility checking</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(t1, t2)</code> determines if two types are identical</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Manipulation</td>\n<td>Operations for constructing, deconstructing, and transforming types</td>\n<td><code>fresh_type_var()</code>, <code>string_of_type()</code>, substitution application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subtyping Rules</td>\n<td>Formal rules defining when one type can be used in place of another</td>\n<td>Coercion rules for function types and polymorphic instantiation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>This component deliberately avoids any knowledge of source code syntax, variable environments, or inference algorithms. It operates purely on type values and provides the primitive operations that higher-level components use to reason about type relationships. The type representation must be <strong>immutable</strong> to prevent subtle bugs during constraint solving, where the same type might be referenced from multiple constraints.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algebraic Data Types for Type Representation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to represent the variety of types (primitives, functions, variables, polymorphic types) in a way that supports pattern matching and ensures exhaustive case handling</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Object-oriented hierarchy with virtual methods</li>\n<li>Union types with tagged discriminants  </li>\n<li>Algebraic data types with pattern matching</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Algebraic data types (<code>ty</code> type with constructors)</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Pattern matching ensures exhaustive handling of type cases, prevents null pointer errors, and makes the type structure explicit. OCaml&#39;s type system guarantees we handle all type constructor cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables reliable constraint generation and unification algorithms, but requires functional programming comfort from implementers.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"type-environment-manager\">Type Environment Manager</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Type Environment</strong> component functions as the &quot;symbol table with scoping awareness&quot; for our type checker. Just as a compiler&#39;s symbol table tracks variable declarations across nested scopes, the type environment maintains the mapping from variable names to their types, handling lexical scoping rules correctly.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Responsibility</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Implementation Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Variable Binding</td>\n<td>Associates variable names with their declared or inferred types</td>\n<td>Stack of scope frames, each containing name-to-type mappings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope Management</td>\n<td>Tracks entry/exit from lexical scopes (functions, blocks, let bindings)</td>\n<td>Push/pop operations on scope stack during AST traversal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Name Resolution</td>\n<td>Looks up variable types following lexical scoping rules</td>\n<td>Search scopes from innermost to outermost until name found</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shadowing Handling</td>\n<td>Correctly handles variable shadowing in nested scopes</td>\n<td>Inner scope bindings hide outer scope bindings with same name</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The environment uses a <strong>stack of frames</strong> approach where each frame represents a single lexical scope. When entering a new scope (function body, let binding, block), we push a new frame. When exiting, we pop the frame, automatically restoring the previous scope&#39;s bindings. This approach naturally handles variable shadowing—inner scope variables with the same name as outer scope variables correctly hide the outer bindings.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Environment Operation</th>\n<th>Input Parameters</th>\n<th>Return Value</th>\n<th>Side Effects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.extend</code></td>\n<td><code>name: string</code>, <code>ty: ty</code>, <code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Updated environment</td>\n<td>Adds binding to innermost scope frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.lookup</code></td>\n<td><code>name: string</code>, <code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>ty option</code></td>\n<td>None (pure function)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.push_scope</code></td>\n<td><code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Updated environment</td>\n<td>Creates new empty scope frame</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.pop_scope</code></td>\n<td><code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Updated environment</td>\n<td>Removes innermost scope frame</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Immutable Environment with Scope Stack</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to track variable types across nested scopes while supporting backtracking during constraint generation</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Mutable hashtable with manual scope tracking</li>\n<li>Immutable environment with scope stack</li>\n<li>Persistent data structure with path copying</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Immutable environment with scope stack (<code>(string * ty) list list</code>)</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Immutability prevents bugs during backtracking and parallel constraint generation.

Think of it as a theorem prover that takes type constraints (equations like &quot;the type of <code>x + 1</code> must equal the type of <code>x</code> unified with <code>TInt</code>&quot;) and finds consistent solutions. This component implements the heart of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Inference Phase</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Constraint Generation</td>\n<td>Expression AST + Type Environment</td>\n<td>Type variable + Constraint list</td>\n<td>Recursive traversal generating equality constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constraint Solving</td>\n<td>Constraint list</td>\n<td>Substitution or Error</td>\n<td>Robinson unification algorithm with occurs check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substitution Application</td>\n<td>Substitution + Type</td>\n<td>Concrete Type</td>\n<td>Replace type variables with solved types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Generalization</td>\n<td>Inferred type + Environment</td>\n<td>Type scheme</td>\n<td>Abstract over free type variables (let-polymorphism)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The inference engine operates in two distinct phases that must remain separate for correctness. <strong>Constraint generation</strong> walks the expression AST and collects type equality requirements without attempting to solve them. This separation is crucial because constraint generation may encounter expressions whose types depend on solving constraints from other expressions. <strong>Constraint solving</strong> then takes the complete set of constraints and finds a substitution (mapping from type variables to concrete types) that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Core Algorithm</th>\n<th>Input Types</th>\n<th>Return Type</th>\n<th>Failure Conditions</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>generate_constraints</code></td>\n<td><code>expr</code>, <code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>ty * constraint_t list</code></td>\n<td>Undefined variable reference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>unify</code></td>\n<td><code>ty</code>, <code>ty</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code></td>\n<td>Occurs check failure, incompatible types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>apply_subst_to_type</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code>, <code>ty</code></td>\n<td><code>ty</code></td>\n<td>Never fails (total function)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>compose_subst</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code>, <code>substitution</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code></td>\n<td>Never fails (total function)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <strong>unification algorithm</strong> lies at the heart of constraint solving. When asked to unify two types <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code>, it returns a substitution <code>s</code> such that applying <code>s</code> to both <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> produces identical types. The algorithm handles several cases: identical types unify with the empty substitution, type variables unify by binding the variable to the other type (after occurs check), and structured types (like functions) unify by recursively unifying their components.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Insight</strong>: The inference engine must be <strong>deterministic</strong> and <strong>complete</strong>. Deterministic means that given the same constraints, it always produces the same substitution (modulo variable renaming). Complete means that if a solution exists, the algorithm finds it. These properties ensure that type inference behaves predictably and doesn&#39;t miss valid programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"error-reporting-system\">Error Reporting System</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Error Reporter</strong> serves as the &quot;translator&quot; between formal type theory violations and human-readable feedback. This component faces a unique challenge: it must present complex type mismatches, unification failures, and constraint violations in terms that make sense to programmers who may not understand type theory.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Detection Point</th>\n<th>Information Required</th>\n<th>Example Message</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Mismatch</td>\n<td>Basic type checking</td>\n<td>Expected type, actual type, source location</td>\n<td>&quot;Expected <code>int</code> but got <code>string</code> at line 15&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unification Failure</td>\n<td>Constraint solving</td>\n<td>Conflicting constraints, expression context</td>\n<td>&quot;Cannot unify <code>int -&gt; bool</code> with <code>string</code> in function call&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occurs Check</td>\n<td>Variable unification</td>\n<td>Type variable, infinite type being constructed</td>\n<td>&quot;Cannot construct infinite type: <code>a = a -&gt; int</code>&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Undefined Variable</td>\n<td>Environment lookup</td>\n<td>Variable name, available names in scope</td>\n<td>&quot;Undefined variable <code>x</code>. Did you mean <code>y</code>?&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The error reporter must maintain <strong>source location information</strong> throughout the type checking process. This requires threading location data from the original AST through constraint generation and into error messages. The reporter also implements <strong>error recovery</strong> strategies that allow type checking to continue after encountering errors, maximizing the number of issues found in a single pass.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>When Applied</th>\n<th>Recovery Mechanism</th>\n<th>Benefits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Variable Insertion</td>\n<td>Unification failure</td>\n<td>Replace failed type with fresh variable</td>\n<td>Allows checking to continue with unknown type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Extension</td>\n<td>Undefined variable</td>\n<td>Add variable with fresh type variable</td>\n<td>Prevents cascading undefined variable errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constraint Skipping</td>\n<td>Occurs check failure</td>\n<td>Skip constraints involving infinite types</td>\n<td>Continues with remaining solvable constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Default Type Assignment</td>\n<td>Missing type annotation</td>\n<td>Assign reasonable default (e.g., <code>int</code> for numbers)</td>\n<td>Provides feedback on missing annotations</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Structured Error Types with Source Locations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to provide helpful error messages that guide developers to fix type issues quickly</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>String-based error messages with manual formatting</li>\n<li>Structured error types with source locations and contextual information</li>\n<li>Exception-based error handling with stack unwinding</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Structured error types containing location, expected/actual types, and context</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Structured errors enable consistent formatting, IDE integration, and programmatic error analysis.

The <code>inference.mli</code> interface provides high-level functions like <code>infer_expression_type</code> but hides the constraint generation and unification algorithms. This <strong>information hiding</strong> principle allows us to change internal algorithms without affecting dependent code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfall: Circular Module Dependencies</strong></p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Importing inference in basic checker</strong></p>\n<p>Beginning implementers often create circular dependencies by making the basic checker import inference utilities, then having inference import the basic checker for some operations. This creates a compilation error in OCaml.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it&#39;s wrong</strong>: Circular dependencies indicate poor separation of concerns and make testing and reasoning about code much harder.</p>\n<p><strong>How to fix</strong>: Move shared utilities into a lower-level module that both can depend on, or redesign the interfaces to eliminate the circular dependency. The inference engine should build on top of basic checking, not the reverse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The type checker implementation requires careful attention to module organization and dependency management.

Hints</h4>\n<p><strong>OCaml-Specific Implementation Tips:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>List.assoc_opt</code> for safe dictionary lookup that returns <code>option</code> instead of raising exceptions</li>\n<li>Pattern matching on algebraic data types provides exhaustiveness checking—the compiler warns if you miss cases</li>\n<li>Use <code>ref</code> for the global type variable counter, but avoid mutable state elsewhere</li>\n<li>The <code>failwith</code> function is useful for unimplemented code branches during development</li>\n<li>Use <code>@@</code> operator for function application to avoid parentheses: <code>string_of_type @@ TFun (TInt, TBool)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Error Handling Patterns:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>Result.t</code> types for functions that can fail: <code>unify : ty -&gt; ty -&gt; (substitution, string) result</code></li>\n<li>Use <code>option</code> types for optional lookups: <code>TypeEnv.lookup : string -&gt; TypeEnv.t -&gt; ty option</code></li>\n<li>Create custom exception types for different error categories: <code>exception UnificationError of ty * ty</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type environments use lists for simplicity, but consider <code>Map.Make(String)</code> for programs with many variables</li>\n<li>Fresh variable generation is globally sequential—consider parameterizing it if you need parallel type checking</li>\n<li>Substitution application can be expensive for large types—consider memoization if performance becomes an issue</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"milestone-checkpoint\">Milestone Checkpoint</h4>\n<p>After implementing the architecture and basic components, verify your system works

Just as human languages have nouns, verbs, and adjectives with specific grammatical rules, our type checker needs a precise vocabulary for describing what kinds of values exist (primitives like integers), how they can be combined (functions), and what relationships exist between them (type equality, compatibility). The data structures we define here become the foundational &quot;words&quot; that all other components of the type checker use to communicate about program structure.</p>\n<p>This vocabulary must be rich enough to express everything from simple integer arithmetic to complex polymorphic functions, yet structured enough that we can write algorithms to manipulate it mechanically. The core insight is that <strong>types are data</strong> — they&#39;re not just annotations in the source code, but first-class values that our type checker program creates, stores, compares, and transforms throughout the checking process.</p>\n<p>The data model serves three critical functions in our type checker architecture. First, it provides the <strong>representational foundation</strong> — the concrete data structures that encode abstract type-theoretic concepts like &quot;function from integers to booleans&quot; or &quot;polymorphic identity function.&quot; Second, it defines the <strong>computational interface</strong> — the operations we can perform on these representations, like checking equality, applying substitutions, or generating fresh type variables. Third, it establishes the <strong>semantic relationships</strong> — how different type representations relate to each other through subtyping, unification, and polymorphic instantiation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-ast-structure\">Type AST Structure</h3>\n<p>The type abstract syntax tree forms the core vocabulary of our type system, representing every possible type that can exist in our language. Think of it as a <strong>construction kit</strong> where complex types are built from simpler components using well-defined combination rules. Just as mathematical expressions are built from numbers, variables, and operators, our type expressions are built from primitives, type variables, and type constructors.</p>\n<p>The algebraic data type approach gives us <strong>structural precision</strong> — each type construct has exactly the components it needs, no more and no less. A function type contains exactly two sub-types (parameter and return), while a primitive type stands alone. This precision eliminates entire classes of representation errors and makes pattern matching exhaustive, ensuring our type checking algorithms handle every possible case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-ast-structure.svg\" alt=\"Type AST Structure\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algebraic Data Types for Type Representation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to represent the full spectrum of types in our language, from simple primitives to complex polymorphic functions, with operations like equality checking, substitution, and pretty printing.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Class hierarchy with inheritance (OOP approach)</li>\n<li>Tagged unions/algebraic data types (functional approach)  </li>\n<li>String-based type representations with parsing</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Algebraic data types with exhaustive pattern matching</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: ADTs provide compile-time guarantees that all type cases are handled in every function, eliminate null pointer errors, and make the type structure explicit in the data definition rather than scattered across class methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Pattern matching becomes the primary way to inspect types, leading to more robust code but requiring functional programming familiarity.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type Construct</th>\n<th>OCaml Representation</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>Primitive integer type representing whole numbers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>Primitive boolean type for true/false values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TString</code></td>\n<td><code>TString</code></td>\n<td>Primitive string type for text values</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TVar</code></td>\n<td><code>TVar of string</code></td>\n<td>Type variable for inference and polymorphism, identified by name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TFun</code></td>\n<td><code>TFun of ty * ty</code></td>\n<td>Function type with parameter type and return type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TForall</code></td>\n<td><code>TForall of string list * ty</code></td>\n<td>Polymorphic type with quantified variables and body type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>ty</code> algebraic data type captures the essential structure of our type system. Primitive types (<code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code>) represent the atomic values in our language — these are the &quot;ground truth&quot; types that need no further decomposition. The <code>TVar</code> constructor represents type variables, which serve dual purposes: during inference, they act as unknowns to be solved, and in polymorphic types, they represent parameters that can be instantiated with concrete types.</p>\n<p>Function types (<code>TFun</code>) encode the fundamental computational abstraction of our language. The structure <code>TFun(param_ty, return_ty)</code> captures that functions are transformations from input types to output types. This binary structure naturally extends to multi-parameter functions through currying — a function taking two parameters becomes <code>TFun(param1, TFun(param2, return_ty))</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for function types is that <code>TFun</code> is right-associative by convention. The type <code>int -&gt; bool -&gt; string</code> parses as <code>TFun(TInt, TFun(TBool, TString))</code>, representing a function that takes an integer and returns a function from booleans to strings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Polymorphic types (<code>TForall</code>) represent the most sophisticated construct in our type system. The structure <code>TForall(vars, body)</code> explicitly quantifies over type variables, making polymorphism first-class in our representation. For example, the polymorphic identity function has type <code>TForall([&quot;a&quot;], TFun(TVar(&quot;a&quot;), TVar(&quot;a&quot;)))</code>, clearly showing that it works for any type <code>a</code>.</p>\n<p>The fundamental operations on types center around <strong>structural traversal</strong> and <strong>variable manipulation</strong>. Type equality requires deep structural comparison, checking that corresponding components have identical structure. Pretty printing involves recursive descent through the type structure, adding parentheses and formatting to produce readable representations. Most importantly, substitution operations replace type variables with concrete types throughout the structure, enabling the unification algorithm that drives type inference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: String-Based Type Variable Identity</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Type variables need unique identity for unification and substitution operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>String names with manual uniqueness management</li>\n<li>Integer IDs with separate name tracking</li>\n<li>Reference-based identity with mutable cells</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: String names with systematic fresh name generation</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: String names provide readable debugging output and integrate naturally with source-level type annotations, while fresh name generation ensures uniqueness without complex ID management.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Type variable names become part of the semantic identity, requiring careful handling during substitution and alpha-equivalence checking.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Core Type Operation</th>\n<th>Signature</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>type_equal(t1: ty, t2: ty): bool</code></td>\n<td>Two types → Boolean</td>\n<td>Structural equality check for identical type structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>string_of_type(ty: ty): string</code></td>\n<td>Type → String</td>\n<td>Pretty printer producing readable type representations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fresh_type_var(): ty</code></td>\n<td>Unit → Type</td>\n<td>Generates unique type variable for inference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>occurs_check(var: string, ty: ty): bool</code></td>\n<td>Variable name, Type → Boolean</td>\n<td>Detects if variable occurs in type structure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>occurs_check</code> function deserves special attention as it prevents the creation of infinite types during unification. When unifying a type variable <code>X</code> with a type <code>T</code>, the occurs check ensures that <code>X</code> does not appear anywhere within <code>T</code>. Without this check, we could generate paradoxical types like <code>X = X -&gt; int</code>, leading to infinite structures that break the type checker&#39;s termination guarantees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-environment-and-scoping\">Type Environment and Scoping</h3>\n<p>The type environment serves as the <strong>memory</strong> of our type checker, maintaining the association between variable names and their types as we traverse the program&#39;s scope structure. Think of it as a <strong>stack of symbol tables</strong> where each scope level can shadow bindings from outer scopes, but inner scopes can still access outer bindings when no shadowing occurs.</p>\n<p>The environment&#39;s scoping behavior mirrors the lexical structure of the source program. When we enter a new scope (function body, let expression, or block statement), we push a new binding layer onto the environment. When we exit the scope, we pop that layer, automatically restoring the previous bindings. This stack discipline ensures that variable lookups follow the <strong>inside-out</strong> principle — we search from the innermost scope outward until we find a binding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-environment-scoping.svg\" alt=\"Type Environment Scoping\"></p>\n<p>The <code>TypeEnv.t</code> type represents this layered structure as a list of binding lists, where each inner list represents one scope level. The head of the outer list is always the current (innermost) scope, making extension and lookup operations efficient. This representation naturally handles scope nesting without requiring complex tree structures or explicit parent pointers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: List-of-Lists Environment Representation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need efficient scope management with frequent extend/lookup operations and clean scope entry/exit.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Single flat map with scope-qualified names</li>\n<li>Tree structure with explicit parent pointers  </li>\n<li>List of binding lists (stack of scopes)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: List of binding lists with stack discipline</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides O(1) scope entry/exit, natural shadowing semantics, and simple implementation without memory management complexity.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Variable lookup becomes O(n) in scope depth, but typical programs have shallow nesting, and the simplicity benefits outweigh performance concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>TypeEnv Data Structure</th>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Scope stack</td>\n<td><code>(string * ty) list list</code></td>\n<td>Stack of scopes, each containing name-to-type bindings</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>TypeEnv Operations</th>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.empty</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Creates empty environment with single empty scope</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.extend</code></td>\n<td><code>name: string, ty: ty, env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Adds binding to innermost scope, shadowing outer bindings</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.lookup</code></td>\n<td><code>name: string, env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>ty option</code></td>\n<td>Searches scopes inside-out, returns first matching binding</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.enter_scope</code></td>\n<td><code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Pushes new empty scope onto environment stack</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.exit_scope</code></td>\n<td><code>env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td>Pops innermost scope, restoring previous bindings</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The scoping protocol follows a disciplined approach where scope changes are explicit and symmetric. Every <code>enter_scope</code> operation must be paired with a corresponding <code>exit_scope</code>, typically using the language&#39;s automatic resource management (like OCaml&#39;s <code>let ... in</code> expressions or explicit scope management in recursive functions). This discipline prevents scope leakage where inner scope bindings accidentally persist beyond their intended lifetime.</p>\n<p>Environment threading becomes critical during recursive type checking. As we recursively check sub-expressions, we pass the current environment down the call tree, and each recursive call may extend the environment with new bindings (like lambda parameters or let-bound variables). The key insight is that environment changes are <strong>local</strong> — extensions made in one branch of the recursion don&#39;t affect other branches, maintaining proper lexical scoping.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The environment extension protocol ensures that <code>extend</code> operations always add to the innermost scope. This means that <code>let x = 5 in let x = true in x</code> correctly binds the inner <code>x</code> to boolean type, shadowing the outer integer binding without destroying it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Consider a concrete example of environment evolution during type checking:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with empty environment: <code>[[]]</code> (one empty scope)</li>\n<li>Enter function scope: <code>[[], []]</code> (new empty scope pushed)</li>\n<li>Add parameter binding: <code>[[(&quot;x&quot;, TInt)], []]</code> (parameter added to inner scope)  </li>\n<li>Check function body with extended environment</li>\n<li>Exit function scope: <code>[[]]</code> (inner scope popped, parameter binding removed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The scoping semantics handle several important edge cases. Variable shadowing occurs naturally when inner scopes contain bindings with the same name as outer scopes — lookup finds the inner binding first and stops searching. Mutual recursion requires careful handling where multiple definitions extend the environment simultaneously before any individual definition is checked. Forward references within the same scope level need special treatment to avoid lookup failures during recursive checking.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Environment Mutation During Checking</strong>\nMany implementations incorrectly modify the environment in place during type checking, leading to scope pollution where inner scope bindings persist after exiting their scope. This breaks lexical scoping and can cause later expressions to see variables that should be out of scope. Always use functional environment updates that create new environment values rather than modifying existing ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constraints-and-substitutions\">Constraints and Substitutions</h3>\n<p>The constraint and substitution system forms the <strong>computational engine</strong> of type inference, transforming the declarative problem of &quot;what types make this program correct?&quot; into the algorithmic problem of &quot;what type variable assignments satisfy these equality constraints?&quot; Think of constraints as a system of <strong>type equations</strong> that we collect during program traversal, and substitutions as the <strong>solution</strong> that makes all equations simultaneously true.</p>\n<p>This approach separates type inference into two distinct phases: <strong>constraint generation</strong> walks the program structure and emits type equality requirements, while <strong>constraint solving</strong> uses unification to find type assignments that satisfy all requirements. This separation provides modularity — we can modify the constraint generation rules without changing the solver, or optimize the solver without affecting constraint generation.</p>\n<p>The constraint representation captures the fundamental operation of type inference: asserting that two types must be equal. Each constraint <code>(ty1, ty2)</code> represents the requirement that <code>ty1</code> and <code>ty2</code> have identical structure after applying the solution substitution. The constraint list accumulates these requirements as we traverse program constructs, building up a system of equations that characterizes all valid typing assignments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Constraint-Based Type Inference Architecture</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to infer types for expressions without explicit annotations while handling complex interactions between multiple type variables.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Direct recursive type assignment during AST traversal</li>\n<li>Constraint generation followed by batch solving</li>\n<li>Incremental unification during traversal</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate constraint generation and batch solving phases</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Separates concerns cleanly, allows global optimization of constraint solving, and handles complex constraint interactions that would be difficult to resolve incrementally.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires two passes over the program structure but provides more robust handling of polymorphic and recursive types.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Constraint System Types</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Structure</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>constraint_t</code></td>\n<td>Type equality constraint</td>\n<td><code>ty * ty</code></td>\n<td>Asserts two types must have identical structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>substitution</code></td>\n<td>Variable assignments</td>\n<td><code>(string * ty) list</code></td>\n<td>Maps type variable names to concrete types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>var_id</code></td>\n<td>Variable identifier</td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Unique integer for generating fresh type variables</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Constraint Operations</th>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>generate_constraints</code></td>\n<td><code>expr, env: TypeEnv.t</code></td>\n<td><code>ty * constraint_t list</code></td>\n<td>Infers expression type and collects equality constraints</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>unify</code></td>\n<td><code>t1: ty, t2: ty</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code></td>\n<td>Finds most general unifier making two types equal</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>apply_subst_to_type</code></td>\n<td><code>subst: substitution, ty: ty</code></td>\n<td><code>ty</code></td>\n<td>Replaces type variables with assigned types</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>compose_subst</code></td>\n<td><code>s1: substitution, s2: substitution</code></td>\n<td><code>substitution</code></td>\n<td>Combines two substitutions into equivalent single substitution</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The substitution data structure represents a <strong>partial function</strong> from type variable names to types, encoding the solution to our constraint system. A substitution <code>[(&quot;a&quot;, TInt); (&quot;b&quot;, TBool)]</code> means &quot;replace type variable <code>a</code> with <code>TInt</code> and type variable <code>b</code> with <code>TBool</code> everywhere.&quot; The key property is that applying a substitution to both sides of any constraint should make them syntactically equal.</p>\n<p>Substitution application transforms types by recursively replacing type variables with their assigned values. The operation <code>apply_subst_to_type(subst, ty)</code> performs a systematic traversal of the type structure, substituting variables when found and recursively processing sub-components. This operation must handle the occurs check implicitly — if a substitution would create an infinite type, the unification process should have already detected and rejected it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for substitution composition is that <code>compose_subst(s1, s2)</code> creates a substitution equivalent to applying <code>s2</code> first, then applying <code>s1</code> to the result. This ordering matches function composition and ensures that later substitutions can refine earlier ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Constraint generation follows the structure of the expression being typed, emitting equality requirements as it encounters type relationships. For a function call <code>f(arg)</code>, we generate constraints that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The function <code>f</code> has type <code>TFun(arg_ty, result_ty)</code> for fresh type variables</li>\n<li>The argument <code>arg</code> has type <code>arg_ty</code> (recursively determined)</li>\n<li>The overall call expression has type <code>result_ty</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This process builds a constraint system where solving for the type variables determines the types of all sub-expressions consistently.</p>\n<p>The unification algorithm serves as the <strong>constraint solver</strong>, finding type variable assignments that simultaneously satisfy all constraints. The algorithm works by case analysis on the structure of the types being unified:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Variable-Type unification</strong>: If unifying <code>TVar(x)</code> with type <code>T</code>, check the occurs check, then bind <code>x</code> to <code>T</code></li>\n<li><strong>Identical primitives</strong>: <code>TInt</code> unifies with <code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code> with <code>TBool</code>, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Function types</strong>: <code>TFun(p1, r1)</code> unifies with <code>TFun(p2, r2)</code> by recursively unifying parameters and return types</li>\n<li><strong>Failure cases</strong>: Different primitives, function vs. primitive, occurs check violations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The occurs check prevents infinite types by ensuring that when binding variable <code>x</code> to type <code>T</code>, the variable <code>x</code> does not occur anywhere within <code>T</code>. Without this check, we could create paradoxical assignments like <code>x = x -&gt; int</code>, leading to infinite type expressions that break the type checker&#39;s termination properties.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Incorrect Substitution Composition Order</strong>\nMany implementations get the order wrong in <code>compose_subst(s1, s2)</code>, creating substitutions that don&#39;t correspond to the intended sequence of applications. The correct composition applies <code>s2</code> first, then <code>s1</code>, matching the mathematical convention for function composition. Always test with non-commuting substitutions to verify the order is correct.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Missing Occurs Check in Unification</strong>\nOmitting the occurs check allows the creation of infinite types that can cause the type checker to loop indefinitely during substitution application. Always check that a type variable doesn&#39;t occur in the type it&#39;s being bound to, and fail unification if it does. This check is essential for termination guarantees.</p>\n<p>The constraint solving process transforms a collection of type equations into a concrete type assignment. Consider unifying the constraints from <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x + 1</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate constraints: <code>f : &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code>, <code>x : &#39;a</code>, <code>(+) : int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code>, <code>1 : int</code></li>\n<li>From <code>x + 1</code>, constrain <code>&#39;a = int</code> and <code>&#39;b = int</code></li>\n<li>Solve to get substitution <code>[(&#39;a, int); (&#39;b, int)]</code></li>\n<li>Apply substitution: <code>f : int -&gt; int</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This systematic approach ensures that type inference finds the most general solution that satisfies all constraints, or reports a clear error when no solution exists.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The data model implementation requires careful attention to both correctness and performance, as these data structures form the foundation for all type checker operations. The algebraic data type representation should leverage the language&#39;s pattern matching capabilities for exhaustive case handling, while the environment and constraint systems need efficient

System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 1 (Type Representation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the type representation system as the <strong>foundation and blueprint vocabulary</strong> for our type checker — much like how a legal system needs precise definitions of concepts like &quot;contract,&quot; &quot;property,&quot; and &quot;liability&quot; before it can reason about disputes. Our type checker needs precise representations of &quot;integer,&quot; &quot;function from A to B,&quot; and &quot;generic type T&quot; before it can verify that code follows the rules. This foundational layer defines the algebraic data structures that represent all possible types in our language, along with the fundamental operations for comparing types and managing type variables.</p>\n<p>The type representation system sits at the core of every type checker operation. When we parse <code>let add = fun x y -&gt; x + y</code>, we need to represent the type <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b -&gt; &#39;c</code> somewhere in memory, with clear distinctions between the type variables <code>&#39;a</code>, <code>&#39;b</code>, and <code>&#39;c</code>. When we later discover through inference that <code>&#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b</code> must both be <code>int</code> and <code>&#39;c</code> must also be <code>int</code>, we need precise operations to substitute those concrete types for the variables. Without a solid type representation foundation, the sophisticated algorithms of constraint generation and unification have nothing concrete to operate on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-ast-structure.svg\" alt=\"Type AST Structure\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"core-type-system-design\">Core Type System Design</h3>\n<p>The heart of our type representation lies in defining an <strong>algebraic data type</strong> that can express every possible type in our language. This type system needs to handle three fundamental categories: primitive types that are built into the language, composite types like functions that combine simpler types, and meta-types like type variables that represent unknown types during inference.</p>\n<p>Our <code>ty</code> type serves as the universal representation for all types in the system. Each variant captures a different category of type with the minimum information needed to distinguish it from other types and perform operations like equality checking and substitution.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type Variant</th>\n<th>Structure</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>No parameters</td>\n<td>Represents integer primitive type</td>\n<td><code>42</code>, <code>x + 1</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>No parameters</td>\n<td>Represents boolean primitive type</td>\n<td><code>true</code>, <code>x &gt; 0</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TString</code></td>\n<td>No parameters</td>\n<td>Represents string primitive type</td>\n<td><code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>, <code>name</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TVar of string</code></td>\n<td>Variable name</td>\n<td>Represents unknown type during inference</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code>, <code>&#39;result</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TFun of ty * ty</code></td>\n<td>Parameter type * Return type</td>\n<td>Represents function types</td>\n<td><code>int -&gt; bool</code>, <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TForall of string list * ty</code></td>\n<td>Quantified variables * Body type</td>\n<td>Represents polymorphic types</td>\n<td><code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Algebraic Data Type for Type Representation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need a precise way to represent all possible types that can appear in our language, support pattern matching for type operations, and enable recursive type structures like <code>(&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b) -&gt; &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Class hierarchy with inheritance (OOP approach)</li>\n<li>Tagged union/enum with associated data (ADT approach)</li>\n<li>String-based type representations with parsing</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Algebraic data type with pattern matching</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: ADTs provide exhaustive pattern matching that catches missing cases at compile time, enable recursive type definitions naturally, and make type transformations like substitution straightforward to implement.

Think of type variables as placeholders in a mathematical equation — when we see <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x + 1</code>, we initially represent the type of <code>x</code> as some type variable <code>&#39;a</code>, then later solve the constraint that <code>&#39;a</code> must support the <code>+</code> operator with <code>int</code>, concluding that <code>&#39;a = int</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>TFun</code> variant uses a <strong>curried representation</strong> where multi-parameter functions are represented as nested single-parameter functions. A function <code>int -&gt; int -&gt; bool</code> is represented as <code>TFun(TInt, TFun(TInt, TBool))</code>. This design choice simplifies partial application and type inference by treating all functions uniformly as single-argument functions that may return other functions.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Function Syntax</th>\n<th>Type Representation</th>\n<th>Curried Form</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>fun x -&gt; x + 1</code></td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TInt)</code></td>\n<td><code>int -&gt; int</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fun x y -&gt; x + y</code></td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TFun(TInt, TInt))</code></td>\n<td><code>int -&gt; (int -&gt; int)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fun f x -&gt; f x</code></td>\n<td><code>TFun(TFun(TVar &quot;a&quot;, TVar &quot;b&quot;), TFun(TVar &quot;a&quot;, TVar &quot;b&quot;))</code></td>\n<td><code>(&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b) -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b)</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"type-equality-and-compatibility\">Type Equality and Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Type equality forms the foundation for all type checking operations, but the notion of &quot;equality&quot; is more nuanced than it initially appears. Consider the question: are the types <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b -&gt; &#39;b</code> equal? They have the same structure but use different variable names. Our type equality system must handle these subtleties while remaining efficient for the thousands of type comparisons performed during checking.</p>\n<p><strong>Structural type equality</strong> compares types based on their shape and content rather than nominal declarations. Two function types are equal if their parameter types are equal and their return types are equal, regardless of where or how they were declared. This approach aligns naturally with type inference, where we derive types from usage patterns rather than explicit declarations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Structural Type Equality</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to determine when two types can be considered identical for the purposes of assignment compatibility, function application, and constraint solving.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Structural equality: types are equal if they have the same structure</li>\n<li>Nominal equality: types are equal only if they were declared with the same name</li>\n<li>Hybrid approach: structural for inferred types, nominal for declared types</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Pure structural equality for all types</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Structural equality aligns with type inference where types emerge from usage rather than declarations. It simplifies the type checker implementation by avoiding complex name resolution. Nominal typing would require maintaining type declaration information throughout inference.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Enables flexible type inference and composition, but prevents some abstraction benefits of nominal typing. Users cannot create distinct types with identical structure.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>type_equal</code> function implements deep structural comparison through recursive descent on type structures. For primitive types, equality is trivial — <code>TInt</code> equals only <code>TInt</code>. For composite types like functions, we recursively check that corresponding subcomponents are equal.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type Comparison</th>\n<th>Algorithm</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Primitives</td>\n<td>Direct variant comparison</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(TInt, TInt) = true</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Functions</td>\n<td>Recursive parameter and return comparison</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(TFun(TInt, TBool), TFun(TInt, TBool)) = true</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variables</td>\n<td>String name comparison</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(TVar &quot;a&quot;, TVar &quot;a&quot;) = true</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphic</td>\n<td>Variable list and body comparison</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(TForall([&quot;a&quot;], TVar &quot;a&quot;), TForall([&quot;b&quot;], TVar &quot;b&quot;)) = false</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The complexity arises with <strong>type variables and alpha-equivalence</strong>. The types <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b -&gt; &#39;b</code> represent the same concept (a function that returns the same type as its input) but use different variable names. However, for our basic type equality, we treat these as different types. Alpha-equivalence handling becomes important during type scheme instantiation and unification, but not for basic structural equality.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Confusing Type Equality with Type Compatibility</strong>\nMany implementations conflate type equality with type compatibility or subtyping. Type equality asks &quot;are these exactly the same type?&quot; while compatibility asks &quot;can I use this type where that type is expected?&quot; For example, if we had subtyping, <code>Student</code> might be compatible with <code>Person</code> but they wouldn&#39;t be equal. Keep these concepts distinct — equality is used for constraint solving, while compatibility is used for assignment and argument checking.</p>\n<p><strong>Type compatibility</strong> extends beyond equality to handle relationships like subtyping, where one type can be safely used in place of another. In our basic type system, compatibility typically matches equality, but the infrastructure prepares us for potential extensions like numeric type coercion (<code>int</code> compatible with <code>float</code>) or subtyping relationships.</p>\n<p>The <code>type_compatible</code> function provides the interface for these checks. Initially, it may simply delegate to <code>type_equal</code>, but it establishes the architectural pattern for more sophisticated compatibility rules:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Compatibility Check</th>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Identity</td>\n<td>Any type is compatible with itself</td>\n<td><code>int</code> compatible with <code>int</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function contravariance</td>\n<td>Parameters contravariant, returns covariant</td>\n<td>If <code>A &lt;: B</code>, then <code>(B -&gt; C) &lt;: (A -&gt; C)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable instantiation</td>\n<td>Type variables compatible with their instantiated types</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> compatible with <code>int</code> after substitution</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"type-variable-management\">Type Variable Management</h3>\n<p>Type variables serve as the <strong>unknowns in the type inference equation</strong> — they represent types that we haven&#39;t yet determined but will solve for through constraint collection and unification. Think of them like variables in algebra: when you write <code>2x + 3 = 7</code>, the <code>x</code> is unknown initially, but through algebraic manipulation you determine <code>x = 2</code>. Similarly, when we see <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x + 1</code>, the type of <code>x</code> starts as an unknown type variable <code>&#39;a</code>, but constraint solving determines <code>&#39;a = int</code>.</p>\n<p>The type variable management system must handle three critical responsibilities: generating fresh variables that don&#39;t conflict with existing names, detecting infinite type constructions that would make the type system unsound, and tracking variable substitutions as we solve constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Fresh variable generation</strong> ensures that each unknown type gets a unique identifier that won&#39;t accidentally unify with other unknowns. Consider the expression <code>let f = fun x -&gt; fun y -&gt; x + y</code>. The types of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are initially unknown, so we need two distinct type variables, say <code>&#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b</code>. If we accidentally reused the same variable name for both, we&#39;d incorrectly constrain them to have identical types before we&#39;ve analyzed their usage.</p>\n<p>The <code>fresh_type_var</code> function maintains a global counter that increments with each call, generating names like <code>&#39;_0</code>, <code>&#39;_1</code>, <code>&#39;_2</code>, etc. The underscore prefix distinguishes compiler-generated variables from user-written generic type parameters, avoiding conflicts in languages that allow explicit type variables.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Variable Generation Call</th>\n<th>Generated Type</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>fresh_type_var()</code></td>\n<td><code>TVar &quot;_0&quot;</code></td>\n<td>Type of first unknown parameter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fresh_type_var()</code></td>\n<td><code>TVar &quot;_1&quot;</code></td>\n<td>Type of second unknown parameter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fresh_type_var()</code></td>\n<td><code>TVar &quot;_2&quot;</code></td>\n<td>Return type of unknown function</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">ocaml</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;font-weight:bold\">(* Global counter for fresh variable generation *)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583;text-decoration:underline\">let</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> var_counter</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> ref </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">0</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583;text-decoration:underline\">let</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> fresh_type_var</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> ()</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> =</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  </span><span style=\"color:#F97583;text-decoration:underline\">let</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> id</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> =</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\"> !</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">var_counter </span><span style=\"color:#F97583;text-decoration:underline\">in</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">  incr var_counter</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#B392F0\">  TVar</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"_\"</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\"> ^</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> string_of_int id)</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Global Counter for Fresh Variables</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to generate unique type variable names during inference to avoid accidental unification of distinct unknowns.</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>:<ol>\n<li>Global mutable counter with underscore prefix</li>\n<li>UUID-based generation for guaranteed uniqueness</li>\n<li>Threading unique supply through all inference functions</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Global mutable counter with simple numeric suffixes</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Simple to implement and understand.

Consider attempting to unify the type variable <code>&#39;a</code> with the type <code>&#39;a -&gt; int</code>. If we allowed this, we&#39;d get the infinite type <code>&#39;a = &#39;a -&gt; int = (&#39;a -&gt; int) -&gt; int = ((&#39;a -&gt; int) -&gt; int) -&gt; int = ...</code>, which has no finite representation.</p>\n<p>The occurs check examines whether a type variable appears within a type expression before allowing unification. If variable <code>&#39;a</code> occurs anywhere within type <code>T</code>, then unifying <code>&#39;a</code> with <code>T</code> would create circularity. The check performs a recursive traversal of the type structure, looking for the variable name at any depth.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Unification Attempt</th>\n<th>Occurs Check</th>\n<th>Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>&#39;a ~ int</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> does not occur in <code>int</code></td>\n<td>Safe, allow unification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>&#39;a ~ &#39;a -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> occurs in <code>&#39;a -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td>Infinite type, reject</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>&#39;a ~ (&#39;b -&gt; &#39;a) -&gt; &#39;c</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> occurs in <code>(&#39;b -&gt; &#39;a) -&gt; &#39;c</code></td>\n<td>Infinite type, reject</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>&#39;a ~ &#39;b -&gt; &#39;c</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> does not occur in <code>&#39;b -&gt; &#39;c</code></td>\n<td>Safe, allow unification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>occurs_check</code> function implements this traversal through pattern matching on type structure:</p>\n<div class=\"code-block-wrapper\"><span class=\"code-lang\">ocaml</span><pre class=\"arch-pre shiki-highlighted\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583;text-decoration:underline\">let</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\"> rec</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> occurs_check</span><span> </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">var_name</span><span> </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">ty</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> =</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#F97583\">  match</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> ty </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">with</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">  |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TInt</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TBool</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TString</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> -></span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> false</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">  |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TVar</span><span> </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">name</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> -></span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\"> String</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">.</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">equal var_name name</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">  |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TFun</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">param_ty</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\">,</span><span> </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">return_ty</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">-></span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">      occurs_check var_name param_ty </span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\">||</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> occurs_check var_name return_ty</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">  |</span><span style=\"color:#B392F0\"> TForall</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> (</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">vars</span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\">,</span><span> </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF;text-decoration:underline\">body_ty</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">) </span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">-></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">      not (</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">List</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">.</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">mem var_name vars) </span><span style=\"color:#DBEDFF\">&#x26;&#x26;</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> occurs_check var_name body_ty</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting the Occurs Check</strong>\nA common mistake is implementing unification without the occurs check, which allows infinite types to be created. This leads to non-terminating type inference or stack overflow errors when trying to print types. The symptom is often mysterious infinite loops during unification. Always perform the occurs check before binding a type variable to a type that might contain it.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Occurs Check in Polymorphic Types</strong>\nWhen checking occurs in <code>TForall</code> types, remember that bound variables (those in the quantifier list) shadow free variables with the same name. The type <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code> contains the free variable <code>&#39;b</code> but not <code>&#39;a</code>, because <code>&#39;a</code> is bound by the quantifier. The occurs check should only worry about free occurrences.</p>\n<p><strong>Type variable substitution</strong> applies the solutions found by unification back to type expressions, replacing type variables with their resolved concrete types. Think of this as plugging values back into algebraic equations — once you&#39;ve determined that <code>x = 2</code>, you substitute <code>2</code> for every occurrence of <code>x</code> in your expressions.</p>\n<p>The substitution data structure maps type variable names to their replacement types. Applying a substitution walks through a type expression and replaces every occurrence of each variable with its corresponding replacement.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Original Type</th>\n<th>Substitution</th>\n<th>Result After Substitution</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code></td>\n<td><code>[(&#39;a, int); (&#39;b, bool)]</code></td>\n<td><code>int -&gt; bool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>(&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a) -&gt; &#39;b</code></td>\n<td><code>[(&#39;a, string)]</code></td>\n<td><code>(string -&gt; string) -&gt; &#39;b</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TForall([&#39;a&#39;], &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b)</code></td>\n<td><code>[(&#39;b, int)]</code></td>\n<td><code>TForall([&#39;a&#39;], &#39;a -&gt; int)</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>apply_subst_to_type</code> function performs this replacement through recursive descent, but must handle bound variables correctly in polymorphic types. When substituting within a <code>TForall</code> type, variables bound by the quantifier should not be replaced — they&#39;re local to that type scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>Substitution composition</strong> combines multiple substitutions into a single substitution that has the same effect as applying them in sequence. If you have substitution S1 that maps <code>&#39;a</code> to <code>&#39;b</code>, and substitution S2 that maps <code>&#39;b</code> to <code>int</code>, then the composed substitution should map <code>&#39;a</code> directly to <code>int</code>.</p>\n<p>The mathematical definition is: <code>compose_subst(S1, S2) = {(var, apply_subst_to_type(S2, ty)) | (var, ty) ∈ S1} ∪ S2</code>. This ensures that variables in S1&#39;s range get further substituted by S2, while preserving S2&#39;s bindings for variables not in S1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mutable Type Variables</strong>\nSome implementations make type variables mutable references that can be updated in place during unification. While this can be efficient, it creates subtle bugs when type variables are shared between different contexts or when backtracking is needed. Prefer immutable type representations with explicit substitution application.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: String-Based Type Variable Identity</strong>\nUsing string equality to compare type variables works for basic cases but breaks down with alpha-equivalence and variable capture. The types <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b -&gt; &#39;b</code> should be considered equivalent in many contexts, but string comparison treats them as different. Consider whether you need structural alpha-equivalence or nominal variable identity.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting Variable Scoping in Polymorphic Types</strong>\nThe type <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code> contains a bound variable <code>&#39;a</code> and a free variable <code>&#39;b</code>. Operations like substitution and the occurs check must respect this scoping — bound variables should not be replaced or considered free. Track which variables are bound at each nesting level.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Type Pretty Printing Without Precedence</strong>\nWhen printing function types, <code>int -&gt; int -&gt; bool</code> should be printed as <code>int -&gt; (int -&gt; bool)</code> or use left-associativity conventions. Without proper precedence handling, complex types become unreadable. Consider how users will read your type error messages.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inefficient Type Equality</strong>\nNaive structural type equality can be exponentially slow on large types with shared substructure. Consider memoizing equality results or using hash-consing to make equal types share representation. Profile your type checker on large codebases to identify performance bottlenecks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The type representation system requires careful attention to data structure design and fundamental algorithms that will be used throughout the type checker.

id=\"basic-type-checking-engine\">Basic Type Checking Engine</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the basic type checking engine as a <strong>strict contract enforcement system</strong> — much like how a building inspector verifies that construction follows building codes before issuing permits. Our type checker examines each expression and statement in the program, ensuring that all operations are performed on compatible types according to the language&#39;s type rules. Unlike inference (which we&#39;ll add later), basic type checking assumes that most types are explicitly declared and focuses on verification rather than deduction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-checking-pipeline.svg\" alt=\"Type Checking Pipeline Flow\"></p>\n<p>The basic type checking engine operates on the principle of <strong>bidirectional type flow</strong>. For each expression, we either know what type we expect (checking mode) or we need to determine what type it produces (synthesis mode). This dual approach allows us to provide precise error messages while maintaining algorithmic simplicity. The engine traverses the AST recursively, maintaining a type environment that tracks the types of all variables in scope.</p>\n<p>The architecture separates three distinct responsibilities: <strong>expression type synthesis</strong> (determining what type an expression produces), <strong>statement type checking</strong> (verifying that statements respect type constraints), and <strong>error reporting</strong> (providing actionable feedback when type rules are violated). This separation allows each component to focus on its specific concerns while maintaining clean interfaces between them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Separate Expression and Statement Type Checking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Programming languages distinguish between expressions (which produce values) and statements (which perform actions), and they have different type checking requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Unified checking function for all AST nodes, 2) Separate functions for expressions vs statements, 3) Visitor pattern with type-specific methods</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Separate functions with dedicated logic for expressions and statements</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Expressions always produce a type that can be synthesized, while statements often don&#39;t produce values and need compatibility checking instead. This separation makes the type rules clearer and error messages more specific.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Cleaner code organization and more precise error reporting, but requires careful coordination between expression and statement checking phases</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Checking Mode</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Expression Synthesis</td>\n<td>Determine type produced</td>\n<td>Expression AST</td>\n<td>Inferred type</td>\n<td><code>42</code> → <code>TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expression Checking</td>\n<td>Verify expected type</td>\n<td>Expression AST + Expected type</td>\n<td>Success/failure</td>\n<td><code>true</code> against <code>TBool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Statement Checking</td>\n<td>Verify type constraints</td>\n<td>Statement AST</td>\n<td>Success/failure</td>\n<td>Assignment compatibility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Declaration Processing</td>\n<td>Add new bindings</td>\n<td>Declaration AST</td>\n<td>Updated environment</td>\n<td><code>let x: int = 5</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The type checking engine maintains <strong>lexical scoping</strong> through a hierarchical type environment that mirrors the program&#39;s block structure. When entering a new scope (function body, block statement, etc.), we extend the environment with new bindings. When exiting the scope, we restore the previous environment state. This ensures that variable lookups respect the program&#39;s scoping rules and that inner declarations shadow outer ones appropriately.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-environment-scoping.svg\" alt=\"Type Environment Scoping\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"expression-type-rules\">Expression Type Rules</h3>\n<p>Expression type checking forms the foundation of our type system, implementing the formal type rules that govern how expressions combine to form well-typed programs. Think of expression type rules as <strong>grammatical rules for a mathematical language</strong> — just as mathematical notation has rules about what operations can be applied to what kinds of objects (you can&#39;t take the square root of a matrix without additional structure), our type system defines what operations are valid on what types.</p>\n<p>Each expression type rule follows a standard format: given the types of the sub-expressions and the operation being performed, determine either the resulting type (for synthesis) or whether the expression is well-typed for an expected type (for checking). These rules are compositional — the type of a complex expression depends only on the types of its immediate sub-expressions, not on their internal structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Literal Expression Rules</strong></p>\n<p>Literal expressions are the base case of our type system — they have known types that can be determined directly from their syntactic form. These rules are straightforward but establish the foundation for all other type checking.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Literal Type</th>\n<th>Syntax Form</th>\n<th>Synthesized Type</th>\n<th>Type Rule</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Integer</td>\n<td><code>42</code>, <code>-17</code>, <code>0</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>All integer literals have type <code>TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Boolean</td>\n<td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code></td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>All boolean literals have type <code>TBool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String</td>\n<td><code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code></td>\n<td><code>TString</code></td>\n<td>All string literals have type <code>TString</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unit</td>\n<td><code>()</code></td>\n<td><code>TUnit</code></td>\n<td>Unit literal has type <code>TUnit</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The literal type checking algorithm is deterministic and never fails — every well-formed literal in our language has a corresponding type. However, the type checker must handle malformed literals (detected during parsing) by reporting appropriate errors rather than crashing.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Reference Rules</strong></p>\n<p>Variable references require environment lookup to determine their types. The type rule states that a variable reference <code>x</code> has type <code>T</code> if and only if the variable <code>x</code> is bound to type <code>T</code> in the current type environment. This implements lexical scoping — we search environments from innermost to outermost scope.</p>\n<p>The variable lookup process follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Environment Search</strong>: Starting from the innermost scope, search each environment level for a binding of the variable name</li>\n<li><strong>Binding Verification</strong>: If found, return the associated type from the binding</li>\n<li><strong>Scope Traversal</strong>: If not found in current scope, move to the next outer scope and repeat</li>\n<li><strong>Error Reporting</strong>: If no binding is found in any scope, report an unbound variable error</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Variable State</th>\n<th>Environment Binding</th>\n<th>Type Result</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Bound in current scope</td>\n<td><code>x: TInt</code> in innermost env</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bound in outer scope</td>\n<td><code>x: TBool</code> in parent env</td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shadowed variable</td>\n<td>Inner: <code>x: TInt</code>, Outer: <code>x: TBool</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>None (inner shadows outer)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unbound variable</td>\n<td>No binding found</td>\n<td>Type error</td>\n<td>&quot;Unbound variable: x&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The critical insight for variable lookup is that <strong>shadowing is a feature, not a bug</strong>. When an inner scope declares a variable with the same name as an outer scope, the inner declaration should hide the outer one completely. This requires searching environments in inside-out order and stopping at the first match.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Binary Operator Rules</strong></p>\n<p>Binary operators implement the most complex expression type rules because they must check the compatibility of two operand types and determine the result type based on the specific operator. Different operators have different type requirements — arithmetic operators require numeric types, comparison operators accept multiple types but return boolean, and logical operators work only on booleans.</p>\n<p>The binary operator type checking algorithm follows this pattern:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Operand Type Synthesis</strong>: Recursively determine the types of both operands</li>\n<li><strong>Operator Lookup</strong>: Determine what type constraints the operator imposes</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility Check</strong>: Verify that both operand types satisfy the operator&#39;s requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Result Type Determination</strong>: Based on the operator and operand types, determine the result type</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operator Category</th>\n<th>Operators</th>\n<th>Operand Types Required</th>\n<th>Result Type</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Arithmetic</td>\n<td><code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code></td>\n<td>Both <code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>5 + 3</code> → <code>TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comparison</td>\n<td><code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></td>\n<td>Both same type</td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td><code>5 &lt; 3</code> → <code>TBool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Logical</td>\n<td><code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code></td>\n<td>Both <code>TBool</code></td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td><code>true &amp;&amp; false</code> → <code>TBool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>String Operations</td>\n<td><code>++</code> (concatenation)</td>\n<td>Both <code>TString</code></td>\n<td><code>TString</code></td>\n<td><code>&quot;hello&quot; ++ &quot;world&quot;</code> → <code>TString</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The comparison operators deserve special attention because they implement <strong>polymorphic equality</strong> — they can compare values of any type as long as both operands have the same type. This requires the type checker to verify type equality between operands rather than checking against a fixed type.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Polymorphic vs Monomorphic Operators</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Comparison operators like <code>==</code> could either work only on specific types or accept any type as long as both sides match</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Monomorphic — only allow comparison on primitive types, 2) Polymorphic — allow comparison on any equal types, 3) Type class based — require explicit equality implementation</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Polymorphic comparison with structural equality</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Provides more flexibility for users while maintaining type safety. Most values in our language support structural comparison naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Simplifies user code and reduces type annotations, but requires more complex type checking logic for equality operators</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Function Call Rules</strong></p>\n<p>Function call type checking implements the <strong>function application rule</strong> from type theory — if we have a function of type <code>T1 → T2</code> and an argument of type <code>T1</code>, then the application produces a result of type <code>T2</code>. This rule ensures that function calls respect the contracts established by function type signatures.</p>\n<p>The function call type checking algorithm performs these validations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Function Type Synthesis</strong>: Determine the type of the function expression being called</li>\n<li><strong>Function Type Verification</strong>: Ensure the function type is actually a function type <code>TFun(param_ty, return_ty)</code></li>\n<li><strong>Argument Type Synthesis</strong>: Determine the type of each argument expression</li>\n<li><strong>Arity Check</strong>: Verify that the number of arguments matches the function&#39;s parameter count</li>\n<li><strong>Parameter Compatibility</strong>: Check that each argument type is compatible with the corresponding parameter type</li>\n<li><strong>Return Type Synthesis</strong>: The call expression has the function&#39;s return type</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Validation Step</th>\n<th>Success Condition</th>\n<th>Failure Condition</th>\n<th>Error Message</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Function type check</td>\n<td>Function has type <code>TFun(T1, T2)</code></td>\n<td>Function has non-function type</td>\n<td>&quot;Cannot call non-function of type T&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arity check</td>\n<td>Argument count = Parameter count</td>\n<td>Mismatched counts</td>\n<td>&quot;Expected N arguments, got M&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Parameter compatibility</td>\n<td>Each arg type matches param type</td>\n<td>Type mismatch</td>\n<td>&quot;Expected T1, got T2 for parameter N&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For functions with multiple parameters, our type representation uses <strong>curried function types</strong> — a function taking two parameters has type <code>TFun(T1, TFun(T2, T3))</code> rather than a special multi-parameter type. This simplifies the type system and enables partial application, but requires careful handling during type checking to provide good error messages for multi-parameter calls.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Confusing Function Types and Function Values</strong></p>\n<p>A common mistake is trying to call something that has a function type in the source code but doesn&#39;t actually represent a callable function at runtime. For example, a variable declared as <code>let f: int -&gt; int</code> but never assigned a value should produce a &quot;unbound variable&quot; error at the variable lookup stage, not a &quot;cannot call&quot; error at the function call stage. Always check that the function expression is well-typed before validating the call.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statement-type-checking\">Statement Type Checking</h3>\n<p>Statement type checking differs fundamentally from expression type checking because statements perform actions rather than producing values. Think of statement type checking as <strong>auditing a series of commands</strong> rather than evaluating mathematical expressions. While expressions ask &quot;what type does this produce?&quot;, statements ask &quot;is this action permitted given the current type constraints?&quot;</p>\n<p>Most statements don&#39;t have types themselves, but they impose type constraints on their constituent expressions. A variable assignment requires that the right-hand side expression&#39;s type is compatible with the variable&#39;s declared type. A conditional statement requires that the condition expression has boolean type. These constraints ensure that the program&#39;s runtime behavior will respect the static type declarations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling and Recovery Flow\"></p>\n<p><strong>Variable Declaration Type Checking</strong></p>\n<p>Variable declarations establish new bindings in the type environment, connecting variable names to their types. The type checking process must handle both explicit type annotations (<code>let x: int = 42</code>) and cases where the type should be inferred from the initializer (<code>let x = 42</code>). In basic type checking mode, we primarily handle explicitly annotated declarations.</p>\n<p>The variable declaration type checking algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type Annotation Processing</strong>: If present, parse and validate the explicit type annotation</li>\n<li><strong>Initializer Type Synthesis</strong>: Determine the type of the initialization expression</li>\n<li><strong>Type Compatibility Check</strong>: Verify that the initializer type is compatible with the declared type (if annotated)</li>\n<li><strong>Type Assignment</strong>: If no explicit annotation, use the initializer type as the variable&#39;s type</li>\n<li><strong>Environment Extension</strong>: Add the new variable binding to the current scope&#39;s environment</li>\n<li><strong>Shadowing Check</strong>: Optionally warn if the new variable shadows an existing binding</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Declaration Form</th>\n<th>Type Source</th>\n<th>Compatibility Check</th>\n<th>Environment Update</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>let x: int = 42</code></td>\n<td>Explicit annotation <code>int</code></td>\n<td>Check <code>42: int</code> ✓</td>\n<td>Add <code>x: TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>let x: int = true</code></td>\n<td>Explicit annotation <code>int</code></td>\n<td>Check <code>true: int</code> ✗</td>\n<td>Type error</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>let x = 42</code></td>\n<td>Initializer synthesis</td>\n<td>No check needed</td>\n<td>Add <code>x: TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>let x: int</code></td>\n<td>Explicit annotation</td>\n<td>No initializer</td>\n<td>Add <code>x: TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The compatibility check between declared type and initializer type uses the same type equality function used throughout the type checker. In basic type checking, we require exact type matches — <code>TInt</code> is only compatible with <code>TInt</code>. Later, when we add subtyping, we&#39;ll relax this to allow more flexible assignments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Exact Type Equality vs Subtyping</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: When checking assignment compatibility, we could require exact type matches or allow subtype relationships</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Exact equality only, 2) Structural subtyping, 3) Nominal subtyping with explicit inheritance</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Start with exact equality, add subtyping in later milestones</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Exact equality is simpler to implement and reason about. It provides a solid foundation for understanding type checking before introducing the complexity of subtype relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More restrictive type system initially, but clearer error messages and simpler implementation. Users must be more explicit about type conversions.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Assignment Statement Type Checking</strong></p>\n<p>Assignment statements update existing variable bindings with new values. Unlike declarations, assignments cannot change a variable&#39;s type — they must respect the type established when the variable was declared. This maintains type consistency throughout the program and enables optimizations based on stable type information.</p>\n<p>The assignment type checking process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Target Variable Lookup</strong>: Find the variable in the type environment to determine its declared type</li>\n<li><strong>Value Expression Synthesis</strong>: Determine the type of the right-hand side expression</li>\n<li><strong>Assignment Compatibility</strong>: Verify that the value type is compatible with the variable type</li>\n<li><strong>Mutability Check</strong>: Ensure the variable is declared as mutable (if the language distinguishes mutable/immutable)</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Assignment Scenario</th>\n<th>Variable Type</th>\n<th>Value Type</th>\n<th>Compatibility Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>x = 42</code> where <code>x: int</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>✓ Compatible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>x = true</code> where <code>x: int</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>✗ Type mismatch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>y = 42</code> where <code>y</code> unbound</td>\n<td>Error</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>✗ Unbound variable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>x = f()</code> where <code>f: () -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>✓ Compatible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The assignment compatibility check is crucial for maintaining type safety. If we allowed assignments that change a variable&#39;s type, then other parts of the program that depend on the variable&#39;s declared type could fail at runtime. By enforcing type consistency, we guarantee that a variable declared as <code>int</code> will always contain an integer value.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Mutable vs Immutable Variable Confusion</strong></p>\n<p>Many functional languages distinguish between mutable variables (which can be reassigned) and immutable bindings (which cannot). Assignment type checking should verify mutability in addition to type compatibility. A common mistake is allowing assignment to immutable bindings just because the types match. Always check the variable&#39;s mutability status before performing assignment compatibility checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditional Statement Type Checking</strong></p>\n<p>Conditional statements (if-then-else) impose type constraints on their condition expression and recursively type-check their branch statements. The key insight is that conditional statements create <strong>branching control flow</strong> where different execution paths may have different type environments.</p>\n<p>The conditional type checking algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Condition Type Check</strong>: Verify that the condition expression has type <code>TBool</code></li>\n<li><strong>Then Branch Scoping</strong>: Create a new scope for the then branch and type-check all statements</li>\n<li><strong>Else Branch Scoping</strong>: Create a new scope for the else branch (if present) and type-check all statements</li>\n<li><strong>Environment Restoration</strong>: Restore the original environment after checking both branches</li>\n<li><strong>Return Type Analysis</strong>: If branches contain return statements, verify they have compatible return types</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Conditional Component</th>\n<th>Type Requirement</th>\n<th>Error Condition</th>\n<th>Scope Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Condition expression</td>\n<td>Must be <code>TBool</code></td>\n<td>Non-boolean condition</td>\n<td>Evaluated in current scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Then branch</td>\n<td>Statements must type-check</td>\n<td>Any statement type error</td>\n<td>New nested scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Else branch</td>\n<td>Statements must type-check</td>\n<td>Any statement type error</td>\n<td>New nested scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Overall statement</td>\n<td>No return type</td>\n<td>Branches have incompatible returns</td>\n<td>No type produced</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The scoping behavior of conditional statements is important for maintaining proper variable visibility. Variables declared inside a conditional branch should not be visible outside that branch, even if the branch is guaranteed to execute. This prevents the type checker from making assumptions about runtime execution paths.</p>\n<p><strong>Function Declaration Type Checking</strong></p>\n<p>Function declarations are among the most complex statements to type-check because they introduce <strong>recursive environments</strong> where the function being defined may appear in its own body. Additionally, function declarations must establish parameter bindings, check return type consistency, and handle the interaction between declared and inferred return types.</p>\n<p>The function declaration type checking process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Parameter Processing</strong>: Add parameter bindings to a new function scope environment</li>\n<li><strong>Return Type Annotation</strong>: Process explicit return type annotation if present</li>\n<li><strong>Recursive Binding</strong>: Add the function name to its own environment for recursive calls</li>\n<li><strong>Body Type Checking</strong>: Type-check all statements in the function body within the extended environment</li>\n<li><strong>Return Type Verification</strong>: Ensure all return statements produce types compatible with the declared return type</li>\n<li><strong>Function Type Construction</strong>: Build the complete function type from parameter and return types</li>\n<li><strong>Global Environment Update</strong>: Add the function binding to the module-level environment</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Function Component</th>\n<th>Type Processing</th>\n<th>Environment Impact</th>\n<th>Validation Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Parameter list</td>\n<td><code>(x: int, y: bool)</code> → <code>[TInt, TBool]</code></td>\n<td>Add to function scope</td>\n<td>Parameter name uniqueness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return annotation</td>\n<td><code>: string</code> → <code>TString</code></td>\n<td>Used for body validation</td>\n<td>Must be valid type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function body</td>\n<td>Statement sequence</td>\n<td>Function scope active</td>\n<td>All statements must type-check</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return statements</td>\n<td><code>return expr</code></td>\n<td>Current scope</td>\n<td><code>expr</code> type matches return type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The recursive binding aspect requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops during type checking. When processing a recursive function call within the function body, we must use the function type being constructed rather than attempting to re-derive it. This ensures that recursive calls are type-checked against the function&#39;s declared signature rather than creating circular dependencies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The key insight for function declaration type checking is <strong>environment layering</strong>. The function creates multiple nested scopes: the module scope (where the function name will be bound), the function scope (where parameters are bound), and potentially additional scopes for nested blocks within the function body. Each scope layer must be managed correctly to ensure proper variable resolution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"type-error-reporting\">Type Error Reporting</h3>\n<p>Type error reporting transforms the technical results of type checking into actionable feedback for programmers. Think of error reporting as <strong>translating between two languages</strong> — converting the formal language of type theory (where errors are constraint violations) into the natural language of human communication (where errors explain what went wrong and how to fix it).</p>\n<p>Effective type error reporting requires more than simply stating that a type check failed. It must provide context about what the type checker expected, what it actually found, where in the source code the error occurred, and suggestions for how to resolve the mismatch. The best error messages help programmers build better mental models of the type system while fixing immediate problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Message Structure</strong></p>\n<p>Well-structured error messages follow a consistent format that presents information in order of decreasing specificity. The message should start with the immediate problem, provide context about why it&#39;s a problem, show the specific location where it occurred, and offer concrete suggestions for resolution.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Message Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Content</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Error Classification</td>\n<td>Immediate problem identification</td>\n<td>Type of error in standardized format</td>\n<td>&quot;Type mismatch in assignment&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expected vs Actual</td>\n<td>Specific type incompatibility</td>\n<td>What was expected and what was found</td>\n<td>&quot;Expected: int, Found: bool&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Source Location</td>\n<td>Precise error position</td>\n<td>File, line, column, and code context</td>\n<td>&quot;at line 15, column 8: <code>x = true</code>&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contextual Information</td>\n<td>Why this matters</td>\n<td>Surrounding code or declaration info</td>\n<td>&quot;Variable x declared as int at line 10&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Suggested Fixes</td>\n<td>Actionable remediation</td>\n<td>Specific changes that would resolve error</td>\n<td>&quot;Change to <code>x = 42</code> or redeclare x as bool&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The error classification helps programmers quickly understand the category of problem they&#39;re dealing with. Common classifications include &quot;type mismatch&quot;, &quot;unbound variable&quot;, &quot;wrong arity&quot;, &quot;non-function call&quot;, and &quot;invalid operation&quot;. These categories map directly to the different type checking rules and help users understand which aspect of the type system they&#39;ve violated.</p>\n<p><strong>Source Location Tracking</strong></p>\n<p>Accurate source location reporting requires the type checker to maintain <strong>position information</strong> throughout the type checking process. Every AST node should carry information about its location in the original source code, and this information must be preserved and propagated through all type checking operations.</p>\n<p>The location tracking system maintains several pieces of information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>File Information</strong>: Which source file contains the problematic code</li>\n<li><strong>Line and Column Numbers</strong>: Precise position within the file using 1-based indexing</li>\n<li><strong>Span Information</strong>: Start and end positions for multi-character constructs</li>\n<li><strong>Context Lines</strong>: Surrounding source code lines for better error visualization</li>\n<li><strong>AST Node Mapping</strong>: Connection between error locations and specific AST constructs</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Location Component</th>\n<th>Data Structure</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>File path</td>\n<td><code>string</code></td>\n<td>Error message header</td>\n<td>&quot;In file: src/main.ml&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Line number</td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Error positioning</td>\n<td>&quot;Line 42:&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Column number</td>\n<td><code>int</code></td>\n<td>Precise character position</td>\n<td>&quot;Column 15:&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Source span</td>\n<td><code>(int * int) * (int * int)</code></td>\n<td>Multi-token highlighting</td>\n<td>&quot;Lines 10-15, columns 5-20&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Context buffer</td>\n<td><code>string list</code></td>\n<td>Code visualization</td>\n<td>Show 3 lines before/after error</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>When reporting errors, the system should highlight the specific tokens or expressions involved in the type error. For binary operators, this might highlight both operands and the operator. For function calls, it might highlight the function name and the problematic arguments. This visual emphasis helps programmers quickly locate the source of type problems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Precise vs Approximate Source Positions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Source location tracking can be implemented with exact character positions or approximate line-level positions</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Line-only tracking with minimal overhead, 2) Precise character positions with full span information, 3) Token-level positions with AST node mapping</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Precise character positions with span information</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Modern programmers expect IDE-quality error reporting with exact positioning. The additional implementation complexity pays off in user experience, especially for complex expressions where approximate positions are confusing.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: More complex AST representation and error tracking, but significantly better user experience and integration with development tools</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Context-Aware Error Messages</strong></p>\n<p>Context-aware error messages go beyond reporting the immediate type mismatch to explain <strong>why the types are incompatible</strong> and <strong>what the programmer likely intended</strong>. This requires the error reporting system to understand common programming patterns and frequent mistakes.</p>\n<p>The context analysis system examines several factors when generating error messages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Declaration Context</strong>: How and where relevant variables were declared</li>\n<li><strong>Usage Patterns</strong>: How the problematic expression fits into the larger code structure</li>\n<li><strong>Common Mistakes</strong>: Whether the error matches known anti-patterns or misconceptions</li>\n<li><strong>Similar Names</strong>: Whether there are similar variable names that might have been intended</li>\n<li><strong>Type Relationships</strong>: Whether the types are &quot;close&quot; in some sense (like <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Context Type</th>\n<th>Analysis Performed</th>\n<th>Enhanced Error Information</th>\n<th>Example Enhancement</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Variable shadowing</td>\n<td>Check for same name in outer scopes</td>\n<td>&quot;Variable x shadows outer declaration&quot;</td>\n<td>Suggest using different names</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Similar names</td>\n<td>Edit distance on variable names</td>\n<td>&quot;Did you mean variable y?&quot;</td>\n<td>Offer spelling corrections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Common conversions</td>\n<td>Known type conversion patterns</td>\n<td>&quot;Use int_of_bool to convert&quot;</td>\n<td>Suggest explicit conversions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scope confusion</td>\n<td>Variable declared in unreachable scope</td>\n<td>&quot;Variable x not in scope here&quot;</td>\n<td>Explain scoping rules</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>For function call errors, context-aware messages can provide especially valuable feedback. Instead of simply reporting &quot;expected 2 arguments, got 3&quot;, the error message can show the function&#39;s declaration, explain which arguments are problematic, and suggest corrections. This helps programmers understand not just what went wrong, but how to fix it.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Recovery and Continuation</strong></p>\n<p>Error recovery allows the type checker to continue processing after encountering a type error, enabling it to <strong>find multiple errors in a single pass</strong> rather than stopping at the first problem. This significantly improves the development experience by reducing the number of compile-fix-compile cycles required to resolve type issues.</p>\n<p>The error recovery strategy depends on the type of error encountered:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expression Errors</strong>: Replace the problematic expression with a placeholder type and continue</li>\n<li><strong>Variable Errors</strong>: Add a placeholder binding for unbound variables and continue</li>\n<li><strong>Statement Errors</strong>: Skip the problematic statement and continue with the next statement</li>\n<li><strong>Declaration Errors</strong>: Use a default type for problematic declarations and continue</li>\n<li><strong>Function Errors</strong>: Use placeholder types for function signatures and continue checking the body</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Placeholder Choice</th>\n<th>Impact on Later Checking</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Expression type mismatch</td>\n<td>Use expected type as placeholder</td>\n<td>Expected type from context</td>\n<td>Prevents cascading errors</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unbound variable</td>\n<td>Create binding with fresh type variable</td>\n<td>Fresh type variable</td>\n<td>Enables partial checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wrong function arity</td>\n<td>Assume correct arity with placeholder args</td>\n<td>Unit type for missing args</td>\n<td>Allows return type checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid operation</td>\n<td>Replace with well-typed equivalent</td>\n<td>Result type of similar operation</td>\n<td>Maintains type flow</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Error recovery must be careful not to generate <strong>cascading errors</strong> — situations where one error causes many additional spurious errors. The placeholder types chosen during recovery should be selected to minimize disruption to subsequent type checking phases. For example, when an expression has the wrong type, using the expected type as a placeholder often prevents errors in surrounding code that depends on that type.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Over-Aggressive Error Recovery</strong></p>\n<p>While error recovery is valuable, over-aggressive recovery can hide real errors or generate confusing error messages. If the recovery strategy makes too many assumptions about what the programmer intended, the subsequent error messages may not reflect the actual problems in the code. Balance error recovery with accuracy — recover enough to find additional errors, but not so much that the error messages become misleading.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Message Formatting and Presentation</strong></p>\n<p>Error message formatting significantly impacts how effectively programmers can understand and resolve type errors. The presentation should use consistent formatting, clear visual hierarchy, and appropriate use of color and highlighting to guide attention to the most important information.</p>\n<p>Modern error message formatting follows several principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong>: Use formatting to emphasize the most important information first</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent Structure</strong>: Follow the same format pattern for similar types of errors</li>\n<li><strong>Code Context</strong>: Show relevant source code with highlighting and annotations</li>\n<li><strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong>: Present basic information first, with details available on request</li>\n<li><strong>Actionable Language</strong>: Use imperative mood and specific suggestions rather than passive descriptions</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Formatting Element</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Implementation</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Error header</td>\n<td>Quick problem identification</td>\n<td>Bold, colored text</td>\n<td><code>error: type mismatch in assignment</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Location info</td>\n<td>Source positioning</td>\n<td>File:line:col format</td>\n<td><code>--&gt; src/main.ml:15:8</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Code display</td>\n<td>Visual context</td>\n<td>Syntax highlighting + annotations</td>\n<td>Show source with error markers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type information</td>\n<td>Specific type details</td>\n<td>Monospace font, clear labels</td>\n<td><code>expected: int, found: bool</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Suggestions</td>\n<td>Remediation guidance</td>\n<td>Bulleted list, specific actions</td>\n<td><code>• change true to 42</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The code context display should show enough surrounding lines to understand the error&#39;s context while avoiding information overload. Typically, showing 2-3 lines before and after the error location provides good context. The error location itself should be clearly marked with visual indicators like underlines, arrows, or highlighting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The basic type checking engine requires careful coordination between expression synthesis, statement checking, and error reporting. The implementation should prioritize clarity and correctness over performance optimization — type checking is typically not a performance bottleneck compared to parsing or code generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Recommendations</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced

clear error messages with source locations, expected vs actual types, and actionable suggestions for fixes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"type-inference-engine\">Type Inference Engine</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 3 (Type Inference)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of type inference as a <strong>detective investigation system</strong> — much like how a skilled detective pieces together clues from a crime scene to reconstruct what happened. The type inference engine examines an expression without explicit type annotations and uses contextual clues (literals, operators, function calls) to deduce what types must be involved. Just as a detective generates hypotheses (&quot;if the suspect was here at 9 PM, then they must have...&quot;) and then tests these hypotheses against all available evidence, our type inference engine generates <strong>type constraints</strong> (&quot;if this variable is used in addition, it must be numeric&quot;) and then uses <strong>unification</strong> to find a consistent assignment of types that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The power of type inference lies in its ability to provide the safety guarantees of static typing while reducing the annotation burden on programmers. Instead of requiring every variable and function to be explicitly typed, the inference engine can often deduce the intended types from usage patterns, making the language feel more dynamic while maintaining compile-time verification.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-checking-pipeline.svg\" alt=\"Type Checking Pipeline Flow\"></p>\n<p>Type inference operates through a three-phase process that mirrors how human reasoning works when understanding partially specified information. First, <strong>constraint generation</strong> systematically examines every expression and statement to collect requirements about what types must be related (&quot;this function parameter must have the same type as this argument&quot;). Second, <strong>unification</strong> attempts to solve this system of constraints by finding type assignments that make all the relationships consistent. Finally, <strong>substitution application</strong> propagates the solved types back through the program, replacing type variables with their inferred concrete types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constraint-generation\">Constraint Generation</h3>\n<p>Think of constraint generation as a <strong>systematic evidence collection process</strong> — like how a forensic team methodically catalogs every piece of evidence at a crime scene, noting relationships and dependencies without immediately jumping to conclusions. The constraint generation phase walks through every expression in the program and records type relationships that must hold for the program to be well-typed, without immediately trying to solve these relationships.</p>\n<p>The constraint generation process operates by <strong>synthesizing</strong> fresh type variables for unknown types and then establishing equality constraints based on language semantics. When we encounter an expression like <code>x + y</code>, we don&#39;t immediately insist that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be integers — instead, we generate constraints that capture the requirements: <code>typeof(x) = typeof(y)</code> and <code>typeof(x + y) = typeof(x)</code>. This allows the system to handle cases where the addition might involve integers, floats, or even custom numeric types with operator overloading.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Constraint-Based vs Direct Inference</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to choose between immediately inferring types during traversal vs collecting constraints first</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Direct inference (assign types immediately), constraint collection then solving, hybrid approaches</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Pure constraint-based approach with separate solving phase</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Constraint collection allows handling mutually recursive definitions, provides better error messages by seeing all constraints together, and supports more sophisticated inference algorithms like let-polymorphism</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Requires more memory to store constraints and an additional unification phase, but enables more powerful inference and clearer separation of concerns</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The constraint generation algorithm maintains several critical data structures during traversal. The <strong>type environment</strong> tracks known type bindings for variables in scope. A <strong>fresh variable generator</strong> creates unique type variables for unknown types. The <strong>constraint accumulator</strong> collects type equality requirements as they&#39;re discovered. Most importantly, each expression synthesis returns both an <strong>expression type</strong> (often a fresh type variable) and a <strong>list of constraints</strong> that must be satisfied for that type assignment to be valid.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Constraint Generation Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Data Maintained</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Environment</td>\n<td>Maps variable names to their types in current scope</td>\n<td>List of (variable_name, type) bindings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fresh Variable Generator</td>\n<td>Creates unique type variables for unknowns</td>\n<td>Current variable counter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constraint Accumulator</td>\n<td>Collects type equality requirements</td>\n<td>List of (type1, type2) constraint pairs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expression Type Synthesizer</td>\n<td>Determines type produced by each expression</td>\n<td>Returns (expression_type, constraint_list)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The heart of constraint generation lies in the <strong>expression synthesis rules</strong> that define how different syntactic constructs generate type constraints. For literal expressions, synthesis is straightforward — integer literals generate no constraints and return <code>TInt</code>, string literals return <code>TString</code>. For more complex expressions, synthesis becomes a process of constraint propagation.</p>\n<p><strong>Expression Synthesis Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Literal Synthesis</strong>: For literal values (integers, booleans, strings), return the corresponding primitive type with an empty constraint list, since literals have known, fixed types.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Variable Reference Synthesis</strong>: Look up the variable name in the current type environment. If found, return the bound type with no additional constraints. If not found, generate an <code>UnboundVariable</code> error.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Binary Operation Synthesis</strong>: Generate fresh type variables for both operands and the result. Create constraints that both operands have the same type and that the result type matches the operand type (for arithmetic) or is boolean (for comparisons).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Function Call Synthesis</strong>: Generate a fresh type variable for the return type. Look up the function type from the environment. If it&#39;s a function type <code>TFun(param_ty, return_ty)</code>, create a constraint that the argument type equals <code>param_ty</code> and return <code>return_ty</code>. If it&#39;s a type variable, create a constraint that it equals <code>TFun(arg_ty, fresh_return_ty)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Conditional Expression Synthesis</strong>: Generate constraints that the condition has type <code>TBool</code> and that both branches have the same type. Return the branch type (which may be a fresh type variable if both branches have unknown types).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Let Expression Synthesis</strong>: This is the most complex case. First, synthesize the type of the bound expression and collect its constraints. Then, extend the environment with the binding and synthesize the body type. The key insight is that let-expressions are where <strong>generalization</strong> can occur — if the bound expression&#39;s type contains type variables that don&#39;t appear elsewhere, they can be generalized into a polymorphic type scheme.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fconstraint-solving-sequence.svg\" alt=\"Constraint Solving Sequence\"></p>\n<p>Consider a concrete example of constraint generation for the expression <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x + 1 in f 42</code>. The synthesis process works as follows:</p>\n<p>The function <code>fun x -&gt; x + 1</code> generates a fresh type variable <code>&#39;a</code> for parameter <code>x</code>. The addition <code>x + 1</code> creates constraints <code>&#39;a = TInt</code> (since <code>1</code> is an integer literal) and the function type becomes <code>TFun(TInt, TInt)</code>. The binding <code>f = fun x -&gt; x + 1</code> adds <code>f : TFun(TInt, TInt)</code> to the environment. The call <code>f 42</code> generates a constraint that <code>TFun(TInt, TInt) = TFun(TInt, &#39;b)</code> for some fresh return type <code>&#39;b</code>, which unifies to give <code>&#39;b = TInt</code>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression</th>\n<th>Fresh Variables Generated</th>\n<th>Constraints Created</th>\n<th>Result Type</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>1</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>x</code> (parameter)</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>x + 1</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;b</code> (result)</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a = TInt</code>, <code>&#39;b = TInt</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;b</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>fun x -&gt; x + 1</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>TFun(&#39;a, &#39;b)</code> with constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>42</code></td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td>none</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>f 42</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;c</code> (result)</td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TInt) = TFun(TInt, &#39;c)</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;c</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The power of constraint generation becomes apparent when dealing with <strong>mutually recursive functions</strong> or <strong>forward references</strong>. Traditional direct inference struggles with these cases because it tries to determine types before having complete information. Constraint-based inference handles these naturally — it generates constraints for all function definitions simultaneously, then solves the entire constraint system to find a consistent type assignment.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Premature Constraint Solving</strong>\nMany implementations try to solve constraints immediately as they&#39;re generated, which breaks down for recursive definitions. For example, if function <code>f</code> calls function <code>g</code> and <code>g</code> calls <code>f</code>, immediate solving fails because neither function&#39;s type is known when processing the other. Instead, generate all constraints first, then solve them as a complete system. The constraint solver can handle circular dependencies that would confuse eager type assignment.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting to Thread Type Environment</strong>\nConstraint generation must carefully maintain the type environment as it traverses nested scopes. A common mistake is using a global environment that gets corrupted by inner scopes. Instead, each recursive call should receive a properly extended environment, and environment changes should not escape their scope. For let-expressions, extend the environment for the body but not for subsequent expressions at the same level.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Generating Fresh Variables for Each Expression</strong>\nReusing type variables across different expressions can create spurious constraints. Each unknown type should get its own fresh variable. For example, if two separate function calls both need fresh return types, they should get different type variables (<code>&#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b</code>) even if they might end up with the same concrete type. The unification phase will merge them if necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unification-algorithm\">Unification Algorithm</h3>\n<p>Think of unification as a <strong>diplomatic negotiation process</strong> where multiple parties (type constraints) each have requirements, and the goal is to find a compromise (type substitution) that satisfies everyone&#39;s needs simultaneously. Just as skilled diplomats look for creative solutions that address underlying interests rather than stated positions, the unification algorithm searches for type assignments that satisfy the structural requirements of all constraints, even when they initially appear contradictory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Funification-algorithm.svg\" alt=\"Unification Algorithm Process\"></p>\n<p>Unification implements the <strong>Robinson unification algorithm</strong>, which is both <strong>sound</strong> (never produces incorrect unifiers) and <strong>complete</strong> (always finds the most general unifier when one exists). The algorithm works by systematically decomposing complex type constraints into simpler ones, binding type variables to concrete types when possible, and detecting inconsistencies that indicate type errors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Robinson vs Alternative Unification Algorithms</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Need to choose a unification algorithm that balances correctness, completeness, and implementation complexity</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: Robinson unification, higher-order unification, nominal unification with subtyping</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Classical Robinson unification with occurs check</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Robinson unification is well-understood, proven correct, handles structural type equality elegantly, and has optimal complexity for our constraint domain</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: Limited to structural type equality (no subtyping), requires explicit occurs check implementation, but provides strong theoretical foundation and predictable behavior</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The unification algorithm maintains a <strong>substitution</strong> as its primary data structure — a mapping from type variables to concrete types that represents the &quot;solution&quot; discovered so far. As the algorithm processes each constraint, it extends the substitution with new variable bindings or detects inconsistencies that indicate unsatisfiable constraints.</p>\n<p><strong>Unification Algorithm Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Initialize Empty Substitution</strong>: Start with an empty mapping from type variables to types, representing that no variables have been bound yet.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Process Each Constraint</strong>: For each constraint <code>(t1, t2)</code> in the constraint list, apply the current substitution to both types to get their most up-to-date forms, then attempt to unify them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Variable-Type Unification</strong>: If one side is a type variable and the other is any type, perform the occurs check (ensure the variable doesn&#39;t appear in the type), then bind the variable to the type in the substitution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Identical Type Unification</strong>: If both sides are identical primitive types (<code>TInt = TInt</code>), the constraint is already satisfied and requires no additional binding.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Function Type Decomposition</strong>: If both sides are function types <code>TFun(p1, r1)</code> and <code>TFun(p2, r2)</code>, decompose this into two smaller constraints: <code>p1 = p2</code> and <code>r1 = r2</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Composition and Propagation</strong>: When adding a new variable binding to the substitution, apply this binding to all existing bindings to maintain consistency (substitution composition).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Failure Detection</strong>: If none of the above rules apply (e.g., trying to unify <code>TInt</code> with <code>TBool</code>), the constraint system is unsatisfiable and unification fails.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>occurs check</strong> is a critical component that prevents the algorithm from creating infinite types. Without this check, a constraint like <code>&#39;a = TFun(&#39;a, TInt)</code> would create an infinitely nested function type <code>TFun(TFun(TFun(..., TInt), TInt), TInt)</code>. The occurs check detects when a type variable appears within the type it&#39;s being bound to and rejects such bindings as invalid.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Unification Case</th>\n<th>Example Constraint</th>\n<th>Action Taken</th>\n<th>Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Variable-Concrete</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a = TInt</code></td>\n<td>Bind <code>&#39;a</code> to <code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>Substitution extended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable-Variable</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a = &#39;b</code></td>\n<td>Bind <code>&#39;a</code> to <code>&#39;b</code> (or vice versa)</td>\n<td>Substitution extended</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identical Concrete</td>\n<td><code>TInt = TInt</code></td>\n<td>No action needed</td>\n<td>Constraint satisfied</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function Decomposition</td>\n<td><code>TFun(&#39;a, &#39;b) = TFun(TInt, &#39;c)</code></td>\n<td>Generate <code>&#39;a = TInt</code>, <code>&#39;b = &#39;c</code></td>\n<td>New constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Mismatch</td>\n<td><code>TInt = TBool</code></td>\n<td>Cannot unify</td>\n<td>Unification failure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occurs Check Failure</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a = TFun(&#39;a, TInt)</code></td>\n<td>Infinite type detected</td>\n<td>Unification failure</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Consider unifying the constraint set generated from <code>let f = fun x -&gt; x in (f 1, f true)</code>. The constraint generation produces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>f : TFun(&#39;a, &#39;b)</code> (from the function definition)</li>\n<li><code>&#39;a = TInt</code> and <code>&#39;b = TInt</code> (from <code>f 1</code>)</li>\n<li><code>&#39;a = TBool</code> and <code>&#39;b = TBool</code> (from <code>f true</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The unification algorithm processes these constraints and discovers the conflict: <code>&#39;a</code> cannot be both <code>TInt</code> and <code>TBool</code> simultaneously. This generates a type error indicating that the function <code>f</code> is being used at incompatible types. In a system with let-polymorphism (covered in the next milestone), this example would succeed by generalizing <code>f</code>&#39;s type to be polymorphic.</p>\n<p><strong>Substitution Composition</strong> is essential for maintaining consistency as new variable bindings are discovered. When we bind <code>&#39;a</code> to <code>TInt</code>, we must apply this binding to all existing entries in the substitution. If we previously had <code>&#39;b</code> mapped to <code>TFun(&#39;a, TBool)</code>, it must be updated to <code>TFun(TInt, TBool)</code> to reflect the new information about <code>&#39;a</code>.</p>\n<p>The unification algorithm&#39;s <strong>complexity</strong> is nearly linear in the size of the type expressions being unified, making it efficient even for large programs. The occurs check adds some overhead but is essential for correctness — without it, the type system becomes unsound and can accept programs that would crash at runtime.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting Substitution Composition</strong>\nA common error is treating the substitution as a simple map without maintaining consistency. When you bind a type variable <code>&#39;a</code> to a type <code>T</code>, you must apply this binding to all existing entries in the substitution. Failing to do this leads to inconsistent substitutions where some types mention the old unbound variable while others use the new binding. Always compose substitutions rather than simply adding new bindings.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Skipping the Occurs Check</strong>\nThe occurs check prevents infinite types but is often omitted in initial implementations because it seems like an edge case. However, recursive function definitions routinely generate constraints where a type variable appears on both sides of an equation. Without the occurs check, unification can succeed but produce infinite types that crash the type printer or subsequent analysis phases. The occurs check is not optional — it&#39;s required for soundness.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Processing Constraints in Wrong Order</strong>\nWhile unification is theoretically order-independent, practical implementations can be sensitive to constraint ordering due to error reporting. Process simple constraints (variable bindings) before complex ones (function decompositions) to get cleaner error messages. If unification fails, the order of constraint processing affects which constraint appears to &quot;cause&quot; the failure in error messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"substitution-application\">Substitution Application</h3>\n<p>Think of substitution application as a <strong>global find-and-replace operation</strong> — much like using an editor&#39;s find-and-replace feature to update every occurrence of a placeholder with its final value throughout a document. After unification discovers the &quot;solution&quot; to the constraint system (which type variables should be bound to which concrete types), substitution application propagates this solution throughout the entire program, replacing type variables with their resolved types.</p>\n<p>Substitution application is the <strong>bridge between inference and checking</strong> — it transforms a program full of unknown type variables into a program with concrete, checkable types. This phase is crucial because it&#39;s where the abstract constraint solving results become concrete type assignments that can be verified and reported to the programmer.</p>\n<p>The substitution data structure produced by unification is a mapping from type variable names to their resolved types. However, applying this substitution is more complex than simple replacement because types can be nested (function types contain parameter and return types) and because substitutions can be <strong>chained</strong> (a type variable might be bound to another type variable that is itself bound to a concrete type).</p>\n<p><strong>Substitution Application Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Type Variable Resolution</strong>: When applying substitution to a type variable, look it up in the substitution mapping. If found, recursively apply the substitution to the bound type (handling chains like <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b -&gt; TInt</code>). If not found, the variable remains unbound.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Primitive Type Passthrough</strong>: Concrete types like <code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, and <code>TString</code> are unchanged by substitution application since they contain no variables to replace.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Function Type Recursion</strong>: For function types <code>TFun(param_ty, return_ty)</code>, recursively apply the substitution to both the parameter type and return type, reconstructing the function type with the substituted components.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Polymorphic Type Handling</strong>: For type schemes <code>TForall(vars, ty)</code>, apply substitution to the body type while being careful not to substitute for variables that are bound by the forall quantifier (avoiding <strong>variable capture</strong>).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Environment Substitution</strong>: Apply the substitution to every type binding in the type environment, ensuring that variable types reflect the inferred concrete types.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Expression Annotation</strong>: If maintaining type-annotated ASTs, apply substitution to the type annotation of every expression node, replacing inferred type variables with their concrete types.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Substitution Application Target</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Variable <code>&#39;a</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> with <code>{&#39;a -&gt; TInt}</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>Direct lookup and replace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chained Variable <code>&#39;a</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;a</code> with <code>{&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b, &#39;b -&gt; TInt}</code></td>\n<td><code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>Follow chain to final type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function Type</td>\n<td><code>TFun(&#39;a, &#39;b)</code> with <code>{&#39;a -&gt; TInt, &#39;b -&gt; TBool}</code></td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TBool)</code></td>\n<td>Recursive application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unbound Variable <code>&#39;c</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;c</code> with <code>{&#39;a -&gt; TInt}</code></td>\n<td><code>&#39;c</code></td>\n<td>Remains as type variable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment Binding</td>\n<td><code>x : &#39;a</code> with <code>{&#39;a -&gt; TInt}</code></td>\n<td><code>x : TInt</code></td>\n<td>Update environment</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most subtle aspect of substitution application is <strong>handling substitution chains</strong> correctly. Consider a substitution <code>{&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b, &#39;b -&gt; &#39;c, &#39;c -&gt; TInt}</code>. When applying this to type variable <code>&#39;a</code>, we must follow the chain: <code>&#39;a</code> maps to <code>&#39;b</code>, which maps to <code>&#39;c</code>, which maps to <code>TInt</code>. The final result should be <code>TInt</code>, not <code>&#39;b</code> or <code>&#39;c</code>. This requires recursive application of substitution to the bound type.</p>\n<p><strong>Substitution Composition</strong> becomes important when substitutions are built incrementally or when combining substitutions from different sources. Composing substitutions <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> means creating a new substitution that has the same effect as applying <code>s1</code> first, then applying <code>s2</code> to the result. The composition algorithm must apply <code>s2</code> to all the values in <code>s1</code>, then add any new bindings from <code>s2</code>.</p>\n<p>Consider the type inference process for a concrete example: <code>let double = fun x -&gt; x + x in double 3.14</code>. During constraint generation, we generate fresh variables and constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>x : &#39;a</code> (function parameter)</li>\n<li><code>x + x</code> requires <code>&#39;a = &#39;a</code> (trivially satisfied) and produces type <code>&#39;a</code></li>\n<li><code>double : TFun(&#39;a, &#39;a)</code> (function type)</li>\n<li><code>double 3.14</code> requires <code>TFun(&#39;a, &#39;a) = TFun(TFloat, &#39;b)</code> for fresh <code>&#39;b</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unification discovers <code>&#39;a = TFloat</code> and <code>&#39;b = TFloat</code>. Substitution application then transforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>double : TFun(&#39;a, &#39;a)</code> becomes <code>double : TFun(TFloat, TFloat)</code></li>\n<li>The entire expression gets type <code>TFloat</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One crucial consideration is <strong>partial substitution handling</strong>. Not all type variables may be resolved after unification — some might remain unbound if they represent truly polymorphic types or if type information is insufficient. The substitution application phase must decide how to handle these unbound variables. In many cases, unbound variables indicate an error (insufficient type information), but in polymorphic systems, they might be intentionally left unbound for later instantiation.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Following Substitution Chains</strong>\nA substitution might contain chains like <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b -&gt; TInt</code>. Simply looking up <code>&#39;a</code> and returning <code>&#39;b</code> is incorrect — you must recursively apply substitution until reaching a concrete type or unbound variable. Failing to follow chains leads to type variables appearing in final results where concrete types are expected, causing later phases to crash or produce confusing error messages.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Variable Capture in Polymorphic Types</strong>\nWhen applying substitution to polymorphic types <code>TForall(vars, ty)</code>, be careful not to substitute for variables that are bound by the forall quantifier. For example, applying substitution <code>{&#39;a -&gt; TInt}</code> to <code>TForall([&#39;a], TFun(&#39;a, &#39;a))</code> should not change the type at all because the <code>&#39;a</code> inside is bound by the forall, not the one being substituted. This is similar to variable scoping in programming languages.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Forgetting to Update Environments</strong>\nAfter discovering type variable bindings through unification, the type environment still contains the old type variables. You must apply the substitution to every binding in the environment to replace inferred type variables with their concrete types. Forgetting this step means that subsequent type checking phases see stale type variables instead of the inferred types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Generating Constraints for Error Cases</strong>\nWhen constraint generation encounters an error (like an unbound variable), inexperienced implementations often try to generate constraints anyway, leading to confusing cascading errors. Instead, detect errors early and use error recovery techniques like inserting placeholder types that don&#39;t generate additional spurious constraints.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inefficient Occurs Check Implementation</strong>\nThe naive occurs check recursively searches through type structures for every variable binding, leading to quadratic behavior. More efficient implementations maintain &quot;levels&quot; or use union-find data structures to make occurs checks constant time. For learning purposes, the simple recursive implementation is fine, but be aware of the performance implications.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Not Handling Recursive Type Definitions</strong>\nWhile our basic type system doesn&#39;t include recursive types (like lists or trees), the constraint generation and unification infrastructure should be designed to handle them cleanly. This means avoiding assumptions that type checking always terminates quickly and being prepared for constraint systems that require more sophisticated solving techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p>The type inference engine represents the most algorithmically sophisticated component of the type checker. Unlike the previous components which were primarily about data structure design and straightforward rule application, type inference requires implementing two non-trivial algorithms: constraint-based type inference and Robinson unification.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology Recommendations:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Simple Option</th>\n<th>Advanced

Once this component works correctly, you&#39;ll have a system that can deduce types for complex expressions without requiring explicit annotations — a significant step toward a practical programming language implementation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"polymorphic-type-system\">Polymorphic Type System</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of a polymorphic type system as a <strong>smart template library</strong> — much like how a single blueprint for a storage container can be instantiated as a box for books, a box for tools, or a box for electronics, polymorphic types allow a single function or data structure definition to work with many different concrete types. The key insight is that we need two complementary operations: <strong>generalization</strong> (abstracting a concrete type into a reusable template) and <strong>instantiation</strong> (creating a fresh concrete version from the template).</p>\n<p>The polymorphic type system represents the culmination of our type checker&#39;s sophistication. While basic type checking verifies that concrete types match, and type inference discovers unknown types through constraints, polymorphism enables code reuse by allowing a single definition to work at multiple types. This requires extending our type representation to include quantified type variables, implementing algorithms to generalize inferred types at appropriate points, and instantiating polymorphic types with fresh variables at use sites.</p>\n<p>The mental model that guides polymorphic type checking is <strong>template instantiation with scope-aware generalization</strong>. When we encounter a let-binding like <code>let id = fun x -&gt; x</code>, we don&#39;t just infer that <code>id</code> has some specific type like <code>int -&gt; int</code>. Instead, we recognize that this function works for any type, so we generalize it to the polymorphic type scheme <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code>. Later, when we see <code>id 42</code> and <code>id true</code> in the same program, we instantiate the polymorphic type twice with different type variables, allowing the unification algorithm to specialize each use appropriately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-schemes-and-quantification\">Type Schemes and Quantification</h3>\n<p>Type schemes provide the representation mechanism for polymorphic types by explicitly tracking which type variables are quantified (bound by forall) versus which are free (still being inferred). Think of a type scheme as a <strong>factory blueprint with parameter slots</strong> — the blueprint <code>forall &#39;a &#39;b. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;b -&gt; &#39;a</code> describes a family of function types where the caller can fill in any concrete types for the parameters <code>&#39;a</code> and <code>&#39;b</code>.</p>\n<p>The distinction between bound and free type variables is crucial for correctness. A bound type variable like <code>&#39;a</code> in <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> represents a parameter that can be instantiated to any type, but both occurrences of <code>&#39;a</code> must be instantiated to the same type. A free type variable represents an unknown type that is still being inferred by the unification algorithm. When we generalize a type into a type scheme, we promote free type variables to bound type variables, effectively saying &quot;this type works for any choice of these variables.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Type Scheme Data Structures:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>quantified_vars</td>\n<td>string list</td>\n<td>Type variable names bound by forall quantification</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>body_type</td>\n<td>ty</td>\n<td>The underlying type with quantified variables as TVar nodes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method Name</th>\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Returns</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>make_type_scheme</td>\n<td>quantified_vars: string list, body: ty</td>\n<td>type_scheme</td>\n<td>Constructs type scheme with given quantified variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>scheme_to_string</td>\n<td>scheme: type_scheme</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>Pretty prints type scheme with forall notation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>free_vars_in_scheme</td>\n<td>scheme: type_scheme</td>\n<td>string list</td>\n<td>Returns type variables free in scheme body but not quantified</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>scheme_contains_var</td>\n<td>scheme: type_scheme, var_name: string</td>\n<td>bool</td>\n<td>Checks if variable appears free in scheme</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The <code>type_scheme</code> representation uses explicit quantification rather than implicit generalization to make the polymorphic structure clear and enable precise control over instantiation. The <code>quantified_vars</code> list contains the names of type variables that should be treated as parameters, while <code>body_type</code> contains the actual type structure with those variables appearing as <code>TVar</code> nodes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: We represent type schemes explicitly rather than using implicit generalization because we need to distinguish between &quot;this variable can be anything&quot; (bound) and &quot;this variable is unknown but will be determined by unification&quot; (free). This distinction is essential for correct let-polymorphism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Type Scheme Operations:</strong></p>\n<p>The fundamental operations on type schemes support the generalization-instantiation cycle. Generalization takes a monomorphic type and abstracts over its free type variables to create a polymorphic type scheme. Instantiation takes a polymorphic type scheme and replaces its quantified variables with fresh type variables, creating a new monomorphic type that can be used in constraint generation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operation</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Generalization</td>\n<td>Inferred type + type environment</td>\n<td>Type scheme</td>\n<td>Abstract over variables free in type but not environment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instantiation</td>\n<td>Type scheme</td>\n<td>Monomorphic type</td>\n<td>Replace quantified variables with fresh variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scheme Equality</td>\n<td>Two type schemes</td>\n<td>Boolean</td>\n<td>Check if schemes represent same polymorphic type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scheme Substitution</td>\n<td>Type scheme + substitution</td>\n<td>Type scheme</td>\n<td>Apply substitution to free variables in scheme</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"type-generalization\">Type Generalization</h3>\n<p>Type generalization implements the <strong>let-polymorphism</strong> rule that makes functional programming languages so expressive. The key insight is that when we infer a type for a let-bound variable, we should generalize over any type variables that are free in the inferred type but not free in the surrounding type environment. This captures the intuition that &quot;this definition doesn&#39;t depend on any unknown types from the context, so it can work at any type.&quot;</p>\n<p>Think of generalization as <strong>context-sensitive abstraction</strong> — we look at what type variables appear in the inferred type, then check which of those variables represent genuine unknowns versus which represent dependencies on the surrounding context. Variables that don&#39;t appear in the environment are good candidates for generalization because they represent internal polymorphism within the definition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Let-Polymorphism Generalization Point</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: We need to decide when to generalize inferred types into polymorphic type schemes</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: <ol>\n<li>Generalize at every variable binding</li>\n<li>Generalize only at let-bindings</li>\n<li>Generalize at let-bindings with value restriction</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Generalize at let-bindings with value restriction</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: This matches ML-family languages and prevents unsound generalization of effects.

Think of instantiation as <strong>template expansion with fresh parameters</strong> — each time we instantiate <code>forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code>, we create a new copy like <code>&#39;b -&gt; &#39;b</code> where <code>&#39;b</code> is a completely fresh type variable.</p>\n<p>The key insight behind instantiation is that each use of a polymorphic value should be independent. When we see two calls to a polymorphic function like <code>id 42</code> and <code>id true</code>, each call should get its own fresh instantiation of the polymorphic type. This allows the unification algorithm to specialize each use differently without interference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Principle</strong>: Instantiation must always generate fresh type variables to avoid accidental sharing between different uses of the same polymorphic value. Reusing type variables would create spurious constraints that prevent independent specialization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Instantiation Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<p>The instantiation process systematically replaces quantified type variables with fresh type variables while preserving the structure of the type:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Generate fresh variables</strong>: For each quantified variable in the type scheme, generate a completely fresh type variable using <code>fresh_type_var()</code></li>\n<li><strong>Build substitution</strong>: Create a substitution mapping from each quantified variable name to its corresponding fresh variable</li>\n<li><strong>Apply substitution</strong>: Use <code>apply_subst_to_type</code> to replace all occurrences of quantified variables in the scheme body</li>\n<li><strong>Return monomorphic type</strong>: The result is a monomorphic type with fresh variables that can participate in constraint generation</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Instantiation Step</th>\n<th>Input</th>\n<th>Processing</th>\n<th>Output</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Fresh Generation</td>\n<td>Quantified variable list</td>\n<td>Call <code>fresh_type_var()</code> for each</td>\n<td>List of fresh TVar nodes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substitution Building</td>\n<td>Variable names + fresh vars</td>\n<td>Zip into (name, fresh_var) pairs</td>\n<td>Substitution mapping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Substitution</td>\n<td>Scheme body + substitution</td>\n<td>Apply substitution to type</td>\n<td>Type with fresh variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monomorphic Result</td>\n<td>Substituted type</td>\n<td>Return as regular type</td>\n<td>Type ready for constraint generation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Instantiation Implementation Details:</strong></p>\n<p>The instantiation process must handle nested type structures correctly, ensuring that all occurrences of a quantified variable are replaced consistently. The substitution application recursively traverses the type structure, replacing <code>TVar</code> nodes that match quantified variables.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type Constructor</th>\n<th>Instantiation Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code></td>\n<td>No change - primitives have no variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TVar(name)</code></td>\n<td>Replace with fresh variable if name is quantified, otherwise unchanged</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TFun(arg, ret)</code></td>\n<td>Recursively instantiate both argument and return types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TForall(vars, body)</code></td>\n<td>Error - nested quantification not supported in this system</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Multiple Instantiation Example:</strong></p>\n<p>Consider the polymorphic identity function <code>id : forall &#39;a. &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> used in the expression <code>(id 42, id true)</code>:</p>\n<p><strong>First instantiation</strong> for <code>id 42</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate fresh variable: <code>&#39;b1</code> </li>\n<li>Build substitution: <code>[(&#39;a&#39;, TVar(&#39;b1&#39;))]</code></li>\n<li>Apply to <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code>: Result is <code>&#39;b1 -&gt; &#39;b1</code></li>\n<li>Constraint generation: <code>id 42</code> generates constraint <code>&#39;b1 = int</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Second instantiation</strong> for <code>id true</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate fresh variable: <code>&#39;b2</code> (different from <code>&#39;b1</code>)</li>\n<li>Build substitution: <code>[(&#39;a&#39;, TVar(&#39;b2&#39;))]</code>  </li>\n<li>Apply to <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code>: Result is <code>&#39;b2 -&gt; &#39;b2</code></li>\n<li>Constraint generation: <code>id true</code> generates constraint <code>&#39;b2 = bool</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Unification result</strong>: The constraints <code>&#39;b1 = int</code> and <code>&#39;b2 = bool</code> are solved independently, allowing the first use to specialize to <code>int -&gt; int</code> and the second to <code>bool -&gt; bool</code>. This is exactly the behavior we want from polymorphism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Reusing Type Variables Across Instantiations</strong>\nIf we accidentally reused the same fresh variable <code>&#39;b</code> for both instantiations, we would generate conflicting constraints <code>&#39;b = int</code> and <code>&#39;b = bool</code>, causing a unification failure. Each instantiation must use completely fresh variables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Polymorphic Recursion Limitations:</strong></p>\n<p>Our let-polymorphism system does not support polymorphic recursion, where a recursive function calls itself at different types within its own definition. This limitation is intentional for decidability - supporting polymorphic recursion would require more sophisticated analysis or programmer annotations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Recursion Pattern</th>\n<th>Supported</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Monomorphic recursion</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td><code>let rec factorial n = if n &lt;= 1 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1)</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mutually recursive functions</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>`let rec even n = n = 0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphic recursion</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td><code>let rec f x = ... f (Some x) ...</code> (calling f at different type)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The restriction to non-polymorphic recursion means that within a recursive function&#39;s definition, all recursive calls must use the same type instantiation. Only after the function is fully defined and generalized can it be used polymorphically.</p>\n<p><img

The key insight is that generalization and instantiation work as bookends around the normal constraint generation and unification process, allowing the existing algorithms to handle the monomorphic instances while the polymorphic system manages the abstraction and specialization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"component-interactions-and-data-flow\">Component Interactions and Data Flow</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of the component interactions in our type checker as a <strong>well-orchestrated symphony orchestra</strong> — each component has a specific role and timing, but the magic happens in how they coordinate together to produce a harmonious result. The conductor (our pipeline orchestrator) ensures that the string section (type representation) provides the foundational melody, while the brass section (inference engine) adds the complex harmonies, and the percussion section (error reporter) provides crucial feedback when something goes wrong. Just as musicians must pass musical phrases between sections and maintain perfect timing, our type checker components must thread data through a carefully choreographed sequence while maintaining consistency and recovering gracefully from errors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-checking-pipeline.svg\" alt=\"Type Checking Pipeline Flow\"></p>\n<p>The component interactions represent one of the most critical aspects of our type checker architecture. Unlike simple sequential processing, type checking requires sophisticated coordination between components because type information flows bidirectionally — inference generates constraints that flow forward to unification, while solved substitutions flow backward to update expressions. Additionally, the type environment must thread through recursive calls while maintaining proper scoping semantics, and error recovery must allow continued processing even when individual components fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"type-checking-pipeline\">Type Checking Pipeline</h3>\n<p>The type checking pipeline represents the <strong>main arteries of our type system</strong> — much like how blood circulation carries oxygen and nutrients throughout the body while removing waste products. Each stage in our pipeline receives typed information, processes it according to specific rules, potentially generates constraints or errors, and passes enriched information to the next stage.

This phase serves as the <strong>foundation layer</strong> where we establish the ground truth about program structure and prepare the initial typing context.</p>\n<p><strong>AST Preprocessing Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Source Location Attachment</strong>: Every AST node receives complete source location information including file name, line/column start and end positions. This metadata becomes crucial for error reporting but doesn&#39;t affect type checking logic.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Built-in Type Registration</strong>: The initial type environment is populated with primitive types (<code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code>) and any built-in functions or operators. This creates the base context that all subsequent typing builds upon.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Scope Structure Analysis</strong>: The preprocessor identifies all binding constructs (let expressions, function parameters, lambda bindings) and creates a scope nesting structure. This analysis ensures proper environment threading during the main type checking phase.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Declaration Dependency Analysis</strong>: For languages with forward references or mutual recursion, this step builds a dependency graph to determine the order of type checking. This prevents issues where a binding is used before its type is established.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The environment setup creates the initial <code>env</code> structure that threads through all subsequent pipeline phases:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Environment Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Contents</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Global Scope</td>\n<td>Built-in types and functions</td>\n<td><code>[(&quot;int&quot;, Monomorphic TInt), (&quot;+&quot;, Monomorphic (TFun (TInt, TFun (TInt, TInt))))]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Module Scope</td>\n<td>Top-level definitions</td>\n<td><code>[(&quot;main&quot;, Monomorphic (TFun (TString, TInt)))]</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Empty Local Scopes</td>\n<td>Placeholder for nested bindings</td>\n<td><code>[]</code> (added as needed during traversal)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Implementation Note</strong>: The environment setup must complete successfully before any expression analysis begins. Failures here (like missing built-in definitions) are fatal and should terminate the pipeline with a clear setup error message.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"phase-2-expression-analysis-and-constraint-generation\">Phase 2: Expression Analysis and Constraint Generation</h4>\n<p>Expression analysis forms the <strong>core reasoning engine</strong> of our pipeline. This phase traverses the AST, applying type rules to expressions while generating constraints that capture type relationships. The process combines immediate type checking (for expressions with known types) with constraint generation (for expressions requiring inference).</p>\n<p>The analysis operates through a mutual recursion between <code>synthesize_expression_type</code> (determining what type an expression produces) and <code>check_expression_type</code> (verifying an expression against an expected type). This bidirectional approach allows the type checker to leverage context from both directions, improving inference quality and error messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Expression Analysis Algorithm:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Expression Classification</strong>: Each expression is classified as either synthesizable (we can determine its type from structure alone) or checkable (requires expected type context). Literals, variables, and function calls are synthesizable; lambda bodies and conditional branches are often checkable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type Rule Application</strong>: For synthesizable expressions, apply the corresponding type rule to compute the result type. For example, integer literals produce <code>TInt</code>, variable references require environment lookup, function calls require parameter/argument matching.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Constraint Collection</strong>: When type relationships cannot be resolved immediately (especially with type variables), generate constraints that capture the required relationships. A function call <code>f(x)</code> where <code>f</code> has type <code>α → β</code> and <code>x</code> has type <code>γ</code> generates the constraint <code>α = γ</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Recursive Subexpression Processing</strong>: Process all subexpressions recursively, threading the type environment appropriately for scoping rules and collecting constraints from all nested expressions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type Variable Management</strong>: Generate fresh type variables for unknowns and maintain substitution contexts to ensure consistency across constraint generation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Constraint Generation Examples:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Expression Type</th>\n<th>Generated Constraints</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Function Call <code>f(arg)</code></td>\n<td><code>typeof(f) = α → β</code>, <code>typeof(arg) = α</code>, result type <code>β</code></td>\n<td>Function type must match argument type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conditional <code>if c then e1 else e2</code></td>\n<td><code>typeof(c) = TBool</code>, <code>typeof(e1) = typeof(e2)</code></td>\n<td>Condition must be boolean, branches must match</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Let Binding <code>let x = e1 in e2</code></td>\n<td>Constraints from <code>e1</code>, then check <code>e2</code> with <code>x : typeof(e1)</code> in environment</td>\n<td>Binding creates new scope with inferred type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Binary Operation <code>e1 + e2</code></td>\n<td><code>typeof(e1) = TInt</code>, <code>typeof(e2) = TInt</code>, result type <code>TInt</code></td>\n<td>Both operands must be integers</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The constraint generation process must handle <strong>polymorphic instantiation</strong> carefully. When a polymorphic binding like <code>id : ∀α. α → α</code> is referenced, the constraint generator must create fresh type variables and instantiate the type scheme, generating <code>id : β → β</code> where <code>β</code> is fresh.</p>\n<h4 id=\"phase-3-constraint-solving-and-unification\">Phase 3: Constraint Solving and Unification</h4>\n<p>Constraint solving represents the <strong>puzzle-solving heart</strong> of type inference. This phase takes the collection of type constraints generated from expressions and attempts to find a consistent assignment of concrete types to all type variables. The process uses Robinson unification with an occurs check to ensure termination and detect impossible type requirements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Fsystem-architecture.svg\" alt=\"System Architecture\"></p>\n<p>The unification algorithm processes constraints iteratively, building up a substitution that represents the solution. Each constraint <code>t1 = t2</code> is unified by finding the most general substitution that makes the types equal, then composing this substitution with previous solutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Unification Algorithm Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Constraint Queue Initialization</strong>: All generated constraints are added to a processing queue. The order can affect performance but not correctness due to the mathematical properties of unification.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Constraint Selection</strong>: Select the next constraint from the queue. Simple heuristics like processing variable-to-concrete constraints first can improve efficiency.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Constraint Decomposition</strong>: Break down complex constraints into simpler ones. For example, <code>TFun(α, β) = TFun(TInt, γ)</code> becomes two constraints: <code>α = TInt</code> and <code>β = γ</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Occurs Check</strong>: Before binding a type variable <code>α</code> to a type <code>t</code>, verify that <code>α</code> does not occur free in <code>t</code>. This prevents infinite types like <code>α = α → β</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Substitution Generation</strong>: Create a binding <code>α ↦ t</code> and compose it with the existing substitution. Apply the new substitution to all remaining constraints in the queue.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Termination Check</strong>: Continue until the queue is empty (success) or an unsatisfiable constraint is encountered (failure).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Unification Failure Cases:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Type</th>\n<th>Example</th>\n<th>Error Message Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Constructor Mismatch</td>\n<td><code>TInt = TBool</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Expected integer, but got boolean&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arity Mismatch</td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TBool) = TFun(TInt, TBool, TString)</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Function expects 2 arguments, got 3&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occurs Check Violation</td>\n<td><code>α = α → TInt</code></td>\n<td>&quot;Cannot construct infinite type&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rigid Type Clash</td>\n<td><code>TInt = TString</code> in function signature</td>\n<td>&quot;Function signature requires string, expression produces integer&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Design Decision</strong>: When unification fails, the system must decide whether to abort type checking or continue with error recovery. Our pipeline chooses continuation with placeholder types, allowing detection of additional errors in the same program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"phase-4-type-substitution-and-final-resolution\">Phase 4: Type Substitution and Final Resolution</h4>\n<p>The type substitution phase <strong>applies the solution</strong> found by unification back to the original program AST. This phase transforms the constraint-laden intermediate representation into a fully typed AST where every expression has a concrete, resolved type.</p>\n<p><strong>Substitution Application Process:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Global Substitution Application</strong>: Apply the final substitution to every type annotation in the AST. Type variables are replaced with their solved concrete types, while already-concrete types remain unchanged.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type Scheme Instantiation</strong>: For polymorphic bindings, ensure that the generalized type schemes are properly instantiated at each use site. This prevents inappropriate sharing of type variables across different uses of the same polymorphic value.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Remaining Variable Detection</strong>: Any type variables that remain after substitution application indicate inference failures or underconstrainted programs. These should be reported as ambiguous type errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type Annotation Insertion</strong>: Generate explicit type annotations for expressions that were originally unannotated but now have inferred types. This produces a fully annotated program suitable for code generation or further analysis.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The substitution application must preserve the <strong>semantic equivalence</strong> between the original program and the typed program. Only type information should change; the computational behavior must remain identical.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pipeline-error-handling-strategy\">Pipeline Error Handling Strategy</h4>\n<p>The pipeline implements a <strong>resilient error handling strategy</strong> that balances early error detection with comprehensive error reporting. Rather than terminating on the first error, the system attempts to recover and continue analysis to surface as many issues as possible in a single compilation run.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Decision: Continuation-Based Error Recovery</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Type errors often cascade, where one mistake causes many spurious downstream errors.

The type environment must flow through every recursive call in the type checking process, ensuring that variable bindings are properly scoped, new bindings are visible in appropriate contexts, and lexical scoping rules are enforced correctly. Unlike simple parameter passing, environment threading requires careful attention to when environments are extended, how they are restored, and how bindings interact with polymorphism and constraint solving.</p>\n<p>The complexity of environment threading arises from the interaction between lexical scoping (variables are visible in nested scopes), type inference (new bindings might have polymorphic types), and error recovery (malformed bindings shouldn&#39;t break subsequent analysis).

Cases</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of error handling in a type checker as an <strong>emergency response system</strong> — much like how a hospital emergency room must simultaneously treat multiple patients while maintaining the capacity to help new arrivals. When the type checker encounters an error, it can&#39;t simply stop and give up; it must provide meaningful diagnosis, continue checking to find additional problems, and gracefully handle edge cases that could cause the system to crash or produce infinite loops.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in type checker error handling is balancing precision with resilience. We need to detect genuine type violations while avoiding cascading errors that obscure the root cause. Additionally, certain algorithmic edge cases like infinite types during unification can cause the system to loop forever if not properly detected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-model-medical-diagnosis-and-treatment\">Mental Model: Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>\n<p>Consider how an experienced emergency physician approaches multiple trauma patients. First, they perform triage — identifying the most critical issues that need immediate attention. Then, they treat each problem systematically while monitoring for complications. If one treatment fails, they don&#39;t abandon the patient; they try alternative approaches and continue addressing other issues. Finally, they document everything clearly so other physicians can understand what happened and what treatments were attempted.</p>\n<p>Our type checker follows this same principle: detect errors early (triage), provide clear diagnostics (documentation), attempt recovery when possible (alternative treatments), and continue checking to find additional issues (treating multiple problems simultaneously).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ferror-handling-flow.svg\" alt=\"Error Handling and Recovery Flow\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"error-classification-and-recovery-strategy\">Error Classification and Recovery Strategy</h3>\n<p>The type checker encounters several categories of errors, each requiring different recovery strategies to enable continued checking:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Category</th>\n<th>Examples</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n<th>Impact on Continued Checking</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Mismatches</td>\n<td><code>int</code> used where <code>bool</code> expected</td>\n<td>Assume expected type for expression</td>\n<td>Continue with expected type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unbound Variables</td>\n<td>Variable <code>x</code> not in scope</td>\n<td>Create fresh type variable</td>\n<td>Continue with placeholder type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arity Mismatches</td>\n<td>Function expects 2 args, given 3</td>\n<td>Check available arguments</td>\n<td>Continue with partial application</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Non-Function Calls</td>\n<td>Calling <code>int</code> as function</td>\n<td>Treat as function returning fresh var</td>\n<td>Continue with return type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Infinite Types</td>\n<td><code>&#39;a = &#39;a -&gt; int</code> during unification</td>\n<td>Reject unification</td>\n<td>Continue with original types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constraint Solving Failures</td>\n<td>Unsatisfiable constraint set</td>\n<td>Report conflicts, use partial solution</td>\n<td>Continue with best-effort types</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The core design principle is <strong>graceful degradation</strong>: when the type checker encounters an error, it should provide the most specific error message possible while making reasonable assumptions that allow type checking to continue. This approach maximizes the number of genuine errors found in a single checking pass.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: The goal is not to produce a perfectly typed program after errors, but to find as many genuine type violations as possible while avoiding spurious errors caused by earlier failures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"type-error-recovery\">Type Error Recovery</h3>\n<p>Type error recovery represents the type checker&#39;s ability to continue analysis after encountering type violations. The recovery mechanism must balance two competing goals: avoiding cascading errors that hide real problems, and maintaining enough context to perform meaningful checking of subsequent code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"error-recovery-architecture\">Error Recovery Architecture</h4>\n<p>The error recovery system operates through three interconnected mechanisms working together:</p>\n<p><strong>Error Detection and Classification</strong>: When the type checker encounters a violation, it first classifies the error type and determines the appropriate recovery strategy. Each error kind has associated recovery rules that specify what placeholder types or assumptions to make.</p>\n<p><strong>Context Preservation</strong>: The recovery system maintains as much type environment context as possible, ensuring that well-typed portions of the program continue to be checked accurately. This prevents one error from invalidating the analysis of unrelated code sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Suppression Logic</strong>: The system tracks which errors are likely consequences of previous errors and suppresses reporting of these cascading failures. This prevents error floods that obscure the original problem.</p>\n<h4 id=\"recovery-type-generation\">Recovery Type Generation</h4>\n<p>When the type checker encounters an error, it must generate a placeholder type that allows continued checking. The <code>recover_from_error</code> function implements this logic:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Kind</th>\n<th>Recovery Type Strategy</th>\n<th>Rationale</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TypeMismatch</code></td>\n<td>Use expected type if available</td>\n<td>Assumes programmer intended correct type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>UnboundVariable</code></td>\n<td>Fresh type variable</td>\n<td>Allows constraint collection to continue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>WrongArity</code></td>\n<td>Function type with correct arity</td>\n<td>Enables checking of provided arguments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>NonFunctionCall</code></td>\n<td>Function type returning fresh variable</td>\n<td>Treats expression as callable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>InvalidOperation</code></td>\n<td>Result type of operation</td>\n<td>Continues with operation&#39;s expected result</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h4 id=\"error-context-threading\">Error Context Threading</h4>\n<p>The type checker threads error information through the checking process using the <code>check_result</code> type. Each checking function returns both a type (for successful recovery) and a list of accumulated errors:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Result Variant</th>\n<th>Type Field</th>\n<th>Error List</th>\n<th>Usage Pattern</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>Success of ty</code></td>\n<td>Inferred/checked type</td>\n<td>Empty list</td>\n<td>Normal successful checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Error of type_error list</code></td>\n<td>Recovery type embedded</td>\n<td>All detected errors</td>\n<td>Failed checking with recovery</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The threading mechanism allows errors from nested expressions to bubble up while maintaining the overall checking structure. Parent expressions receive both the recovery type (for continued checking) and the error list (for reporting).</p>\n<h4 id=\"cascading-error-prevention\">Cascading Error Prevention</h4>\n<p>One of the most challenging aspects of error recovery is preventing cascading errors — spurious error reports caused by the propagation of earlier genuine errors. The system employs several strategies:</p>\n<p><strong>Error Source Tracking</strong>: Each type error includes source location information and context about what checking operation produced it. This allows the system to identify when multiple errors stem from the same root cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Conservative Error Reporting</strong>: When the checker encounters a type mismatch involving a recovery type (like a fresh type variable generated from an earlier error), it applies more lenient reporting rules. These secondary errors are often consequences rather than independent problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Suppression Windows</strong>: After reporting a significant error (like an unbound variable), the system temporarily suppresses related errors in the immediate syntactic vicinity. This prevents a single typo from generating dozens of follow-up error messages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Design Decision: Conservative Recovery</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Context</strong>: Type checkers can either be aggressive (try to infer what the programmer meant) or conservative (make minimal assumptions)</li>\n<li><strong>Options Considered</strong>: 1) Aggressive inference with heuristics, 2) Conservative placeholder types, 3) Immediate failure on first error</li>\n<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Conservative recovery with placeholder types</li>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong>: Aggressive inference often guesses wrong and hides real errors; immediate failure prevents finding multiple issues in one pass</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: May require multiple compile cycles to fix all errors, but each reported error is likely genuine</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"infinite-type-detection\">Infinite Type Detection</h3>\n<p>Infinite type detection represents one of the most critical safety mechanisms in the unification algorithm. Without proper infinite type detection (the <strong>occurs check</strong>), the unification process can generate infinitely large type expressions that cause the type checker to run out of memory or loop forever.</p>\n<h4 id=\"understanding-infinite-types\">Understanding Infinite Types</h4>\n<p>Consider the constraint <code>&#39;a = &#39;a -&gt; int</code> arising from a recursive definition where a variable is used as both a value and a function. If we naively tried to solve this constraint by substitution, we would generate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>&#39;a = &#39;a -&gt; int</code></li>\n<li>Substitute first <code>&#39;a</code>: <code>&#39;a = (&#39;a -&gt; int) -&gt; int</code></li>\n<li>Substitute again: <code>&#39;a = ((&#39;a -&gt; int) -&gt; int) -&gt; int</code></li>\n<li>Continue infinitely: <code>&#39;a = (((&#39;a -&gt; int) -&gt; int) -&gt; int) -&gt; int</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This infinite expansion would continue until the system runs out of memory. The occurs check prevents this by detecting when a type variable appears within its own solution before performing the substitution.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-occurs-check-algorithm\">The Occurs Check Algorithm</h4>\n<p>The <code>occurs_check</code> function implements a depth-first traversal of a type expression to determine if a given type variable appears anywhere within it:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type Expression</th>\n<th>Occurs Check Behavior</th>\n<th>Result</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>TVar(name)</code></td>\n<td>Direct variable comparison</td>\n<td>True if names match</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code></td>\n<td>No variables present</td>\n<td>Always false</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TFun(param, return)</code></td>\n<td>Recursive check on both param and return types</td>\n<td>True if variable occurs in either</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>TForall(vars, body)</code></td>\n<td>Check if variable is quantified, then check body</td>\n<td>False if quantified, else recurse</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The algorithm must handle quantified variables correctly — a variable quantified by a <code>TForall</code> is bound within that scope and doesn&#39;t represent the same variable being checked for occurrence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"occurs-check-integration-in-unification\">Occurs Check Integration in Unification</h4>\n<p>The occurs check integrates into the unification algorithm at the point where we attempt to bind a type variable to a type expression. The check occurs before performing the substitution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Variable Binding Attempt</strong>: Unification determines that type variable <code>&#39;a</code> should be bound to type expression <code>t</code></li>\n<li><strong>Occurs Check</strong>: Call <code>occurs_check(&quot;a&quot;, t)</code> to verify <code>&#39;a</code> doesn&#39;t appear in <code>t</code></li>\n<li><strong>Binding Decision</strong>: If occurs check fails, reject the unification; if it passes, proceed with binding</li>\n<li><strong>Substitution Application</strong>: Apply the binding <code>&#39;a → t</code> to all remaining constraints</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This integration point is critical because it catches infinite types before they can propagate through the constraint system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"handling-occurs-check-failures\">Handling Occurs Check Failures</h4>\n<p>When the occurs check detects a potential infinite type, the unification algorithm must handle the failure gracefully:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Failure Context</th>\n<th>Error Reporting</th>\n<th>Recovery Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Simple recursive binding</td>\n<td>Report infinite type error with specific variables</td>\n<td>Leave variables unbound</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complex constraint system</td>\n<td>Report unsatisfiable constraints</td>\n<td>Continue with partial solution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphic instantiation</td>\n<td>Report instantiation failure</td>\n<td>Use monomorphic fallback</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The error reporting for infinite types requires careful explanation because the concept is subtle. The error message should explain both what constraint caused the problem and why the constraint represents an impossible type.</p>\n<h4 id=\"edge-cases-in-occurs-checking\">Edge Cases in Occurs Checking</h4>\n<p>Several edge cases require special handling in the occurs check implementation:</p>\n<p><strong>Quantified Variable Shadowing</strong>: When a type variable is quantified by a <code>TForall</code>, it shadows any variable with the same name in the outer scope. The occurs check must respect this scoping to avoid false positives.</p>\n<p><strong>Nested Function Types</strong>: Function types create nested structure where the same variable might appear in multiple positions. The occurs check must traverse all positions to detect any occurrence.</p>\n<p><strong>Partial Substitution Context</strong>: During constraint solving, some variables may already have partial substitutions applied. The occurs check must consider the fully expanded type after applying existing substitutions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Pitfall: Incomplete Occurs Check</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Problem</strong>: Only checking the immediate structure without recursing into nested types</li>\n<li><strong>Consequence</strong>: Missing infinite types in complex expressions like <code>&#39;a = (&#39;a * int) -&gt; bool</code></li>\n<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Implement complete recursive traversal of all type constructors</li>\n<li><strong>Detection</strong>: Unification loops or memory exhaustion during constraint solving</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"performance-considerations\">Performance Considerations</h4>\n<p>The occurs check adds overhead to unification because it requires traversing type expressions. However, this overhead is necessary for correctness:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Optimization Strategy</th>\n<th>Benefit</th>\n<th>Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Cached occurs results</td>\n<td>Faster repeated checks</td>\n<td>Memory usage for cache</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Early termination</td>\n<td>Stop on first occurrence found</td>\n<td>None — pure optimization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Structural sharing</td>\n<td>Reuse type expression nodes</td>\n<td>Complex implementation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The most important optimization is early termination — as soon as the occurs check finds the target variable, it can return <code>true</code> without checking the remaining structure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"common-pitfalls-in-error-handling\">Common Pitfalls in Error Handling</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Generating Cascading Errors</strong>\nMany type checker implementations generate dozens of follow-up errors from a single root cause. For example, if variable <code>x</code> is misspelled as <code>y</code>, every subsequent use of <code>y</code> generates an &quot;unbound variable&quot; error. The fix is implementing error suppression logic that recognizes when errors are likely consequences of previous failures.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inadequate Error Recovery Types</strong>\nUsing overly generic recovery types (like always generating <code>TInt</code>) can hide genuine errors in subsequent code. Instead, use context-appropriate recovery types — if expecting a function, generate a function type; if expecting a specific type, use that type.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Occurs Check Bypass</strong>\nImplementing unification without a proper occurs check leads to infinite types that crash the system. Some developers try to optimize by skipping the check, but this is always incorrect. The occurs check is mandatory for sound unification.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Error Location Loss</strong>\nFailing to preserve source location information through error recovery makes it impossible for users to locate problems. Every error should include precise location data, even when the error is detected several steps removed from its source.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Terminology</strong>\nUsing technical jargon or inconsistent terminology in error messages confuses users. Establish a consistent vocabulary for error reporting and always explain technical terms in user-friendly language.</p>\n<h3 id=\"error-message-design-principles\">Error Message Design Principles</h3>\n<p>Effective error messages in type checkers follow several key design principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Specificity Over Generality</strong>: Instead of &quot;type error,&quot; specify exactly what types were involved and why they&#39;re incompatible. Include the expected type, actual type, and the operation that required compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Context Explanation</strong>: Explain not just what went wrong, but why the type checker expected a particular type. This helps users understand the reasoning behind type requirements.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Suggestions</strong>: When possible, suggest specific fixes. If a variable is unbound, suggest nearby variables with similar names. If types don&#39;t match, suggest explicit conversions or corrections.</p>\n<p><strong>Progressive Detail</strong>: Start with a clear summary, then provide additional detail for users who need it. This serves both beginners (who want simple explanations) and experts (who want precise technical information).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Component</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Example Content</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Primary Message</td>\n<td>Clear problem statement</td>\n<td>&quot;Cannot apply function of type <code>int -&gt; bool</code> to argument of type <code>string</code>&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Context Explanation</td>\n<td>Why this is required</td>\n<td>&quot;Function <code>f</code> expects an integer argument, but received a string&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Location Information</td>\n<td>Where the error occurred</td>\n<td>&quot;at line 15, column 8 in file <code>main.ml</code>&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Suggested Fixes</td>\n<td>Actionable remedies</td>\n<td>&quot;Consider using <code>int_of_string</code> to convert the argument&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Related Information</td>\n<td>Connected context</td>\n<td>&quot;Function <code>f</code> was declared at line 5&quot;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"integration-with-ide-support\">Integration with IDE Support</h3>\n<p>Modern type checkers must integrate effectively with development environments to provide real-time feedback. This requires careful design of the error handling system:</p>\n<p><strong>Incremental Error Reporting</strong>: The type checker should report errors as they&#39;re discovered rather than waiting for complete checking. This enables faster feedback cycles in interactive environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Categorization</strong>: Different error types require different IDE presentation. Syntax errors should be highlighted immediately, while type errors might be presented as squiggly underlines with hover information.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Fix Integration</strong>: Error messages should include structured information that IDEs can use to offer automatic fixes. This requires embedding fix suggestions in a machine-readable format alongside human-readable messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<h4

Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of testing a type checker as <strong>quality assurance for a complex manufacturing plant</strong> — much like how an automotive factory has inspection checkpoints at every stage of assembly to catch defects early, our type checker testing strategy establishes verification points at each milestone to ensure the foundation is solid before building the next layer. Just as a car manufacturer tests individual components (brakes, engine, transmission) before testing the complete vehicle, we systematically verify type representations, then basic checking, then inference, and finally polymorphism in isolation and combination.</p>\n<p>The challenge with testing a type checker lies in its <strong>multi-layered verification requirements</strong>. Unlike testing a simple function that transforms input to output, a type checker must verify correctness across multiple dimensions simultaneously: syntactic correctness (does the code parse?), semantic correctness (do types match?), inference correctness (are inferred types most general?), and error quality (are error messages helpful?). Each milestone introduces new complexity that could break previously working functionality, making systematic regression testing essential.</p>\n<p>Our testing strategy follows a <strong>pyramid architecture</strong> where unit tests form the broad base, integration tests verify component interactions, and end-to-end tests validate complete workflows. This mirrors how civil engineers test bridge components individually (steel strength, bolt tensile strength), then test assemblies (beam connections), and finally test the complete structure under load. The key insight is that type checker bugs often manifest as cascading failures — a subtle bug in unification can cause polymorphism to fail mysteriously, so we need fine-grained tests that isolate the failure source.</p>\n<h3 id=\"milestone-verification\">Milestone Verification</h3>\n<p>Each milestone represents a <strong>checkpoint gate</strong> in our manufacturing analogy — a point where we must verify all functionality works correctly before proceeding. Think of this like software release gates in large companies, where automated tests must pass before code can be promoted to the next environment. The verification strategy ensures we catch integration issues early rather than debugging a complex system where the root cause could be anywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1 Verification focuses on the foundational type system infrastructure.</strong> At this stage, we&#39;re essentially testing the &quot;vocabulary and grammar&quot; of our type language — can we represent all necessary types correctly, can we compare them for equality, and can we manage type environments properly. This is analogous to testing a compiler&#39;s lexer and parser before attempting code generation.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>What to Verify</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Red Flags to Watch For</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Construction</td>\n<td>All type variants can be created and accessed</td>\n<td><code>TInt</code>, <code>TBool</code>, <code>TString</code>, <code>TVar &quot;a&quot;</code>, <code>TFun(TInt, TBool)</code> all construct correctly</td>\n<td>Segmentation faults or pattern match failures when accessing type fields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Equality</td>\n<td><code>type_equal</code> correctly identifies structurally identical types</td>\n<td><code>type_equal(TFun(TInt, TBool), TFun(TInt, TBool))</code> returns true</td>\n<td>False negatives on identical types or false positives on different types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Variable Management</td>\n<td>Fresh variables are unique and <code>fresh_type_var()</code> never repeats</td>\n<td>Multiple calls produce <code>TVar &quot;a1&quot;</code>, <code>TVar &quot;a2&quot;</code>, etc. with different names</td>\n<td>Variable name collisions or non-deterministic generation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Environment Operations</td>\n<td><code>TypeEnv.extend</code> and <code>TypeEnv.lookup</code> handle scoping correctly</td>\n<td>Variables added to inner scope shadow outer scope, lookup searches inside-out</td>\n<td>Variables leaking between scopes or lookup finding wrong binding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Pretty Printing</td>\n<td><code>string_of_type</code> produces readable output for debugging</td>\n<td><code>TFun(TInt, TBool)</code> formats as &quot;int -&gt; bool&quot;</td>\n<td>Cryptic output that makes debugging impossible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The critical insight for Milestone 1 is that <strong>type representation bugs cascade through every subsequent milestone</strong>. If <code>type_equal</code> has subtle bugs or type variable generation isn&#39;t truly unique, you&#39;ll see mysterious failures in unification or polymorphism that are extremely difficult to debug. The verification must be exhaustive at this foundational layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2 Verification tests the basic type checking engine without inference.</strong> Here we&#39;re testing the &quot;contract enforcement&quot; system — can we verify that explicitly typed code follows the type rules correctly? This is like testing a building inspector&#39;s ability to verify that construction matches the approved blueprints.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>What to Verify</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Red Flags to Watch For</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Expression Synthesis</td>\n<td><code>synthesize_expression_type</code> correctly determines expression types</td>\n<td>Literals infer correct types, binary operations check operand compatibility</td>\n<td>Wrong types inferred for literals or operators accepting incompatible types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expression Checking</td>\n<td><code>check_expression_type</code> validates expressions against expected types</td>\n<td>Type-annotated expressions verified correctly, mismatches produce clear errors</td>\n<td>False positives accepting wrong types or false negatives rejecting correct types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function Call Validation</td>\n<td>Function applications check arity and argument types</td>\n<td>Calling <code>f: int -&gt; bool</code> with <code>int</code> argument succeeds, wrong arity fails</td>\n<td>Functions accepting wrong argument types or arity mismatches going undetected</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type Error Generation</td>\n<td>Errors include source locations and helpful messages</td>\n<td><code>make_error</code> produces errors with file/line information and suggested fixes</td>\n<td>Generic error messages without context or missing source location tracking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error Recovery</td>\n<td>Type checking continues after errors to find multiple issues</td>\n<td>Multiple type errors in same program all reported, not just first one</td>\n<td>Type checking aborting on first error or cascading spurious errors</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The key verification principle for Milestone 2 is <strong>independent testability</strong> — each type rule should be testable in isolation. If testing function calls requires complex setup of polymorphic types, there&#39;s too much coupling between milestones.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3 Verification focuses on constraint-based type inference correctness.</strong> This is where testing becomes significantly more complex because we&#39;re verifying not just correctness but <strong>optimality</strong> — does the inference produce the most general type possible? Think of this like testing an optimization algorithm where correctness isn&#39;t binary but measured against the theoretical optimum.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>What to Verify</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Red Flags to Watch For</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Constraint Generation</td>\n<td><code>generate_constraints</code> produces correct equality constraints</td>\n<td><code>let x = 5 in x + 1</code> generates constraints <code>typeof(x) = int</code>, <code>typeof(+) = int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td>Missing constraints that allow invalid programs or spurious constraints that over-constrain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unification Algorithm</td>\n<td><code>unify</code> finds most general unifiers when they exist</td>\n<td>Unifying <code>&#39;a -&gt; bool</code> with <code>int -&gt; &#39;b</code> produces <code>[&#39;a := int, &#39;b := bool]</code></td>\n<td>Unification failing on solvable constraints or producing overly specific solutions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occurs Check</td>\n<td>Infinite types detected and prevented during unification</td>\n<td>Unifying <code>&#39;a</code> with <code>&#39;a -&gt; bool</code> fails with occurs check error</td>\n<td>Infinite types accepted causing stack overflow or infinite loops later</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substitution Application</td>\n<td><code>apply_subst_to_type</code> correctly replaces variables throughout type</td>\n<td>Applying <code>[&#39;a := int]</code> to <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code> produces <code>int -&gt; &#39;b</code></td>\n<td>Variables not replaced or replaced incorrectly in complex nested types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inference Integration</td>\n<td>Complete inference pipeline produces most general types</td>\n<td><code>let id = fun x -&gt; x</code> infers <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> not overly specific type</td>\n<td>Inference producing <code>int -&gt; int</code> instead of polymorphic <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The critical testing insight for Milestone 3 is <strong>most general type verification</strong> — it&#39;s not enough to verify that inference produces a correct type; you must verify it produces the <strong>most general</strong> correct type. This requires understanding the theoretical optimum for each test case.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4 Verification tests polymorphism with let-generalization and instantiation.</strong> This is the most complex milestone because polymorphism interacts with all previous systems. Think of this like testing a complex mechanical system where every component must work perfectly in isolation and in combination.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Test Category</th>\n<th>What to Verify</th>\n<th>Acceptance Criteria</th>\n<th>Red Flags to Watch For</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Type Scheme Operations</td>\n<td>Type schemes correctly represent and manipulate quantified types</td>\n<td><code>make_type_scheme([&quot;a&quot;], TFun(TVar &quot;a&quot;, TVar &quot;a&quot;))</code> creates proper forall type</td>\n<td>Quantified variables not properly tracked or incorrectly captured</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Generalization</td>\n<td><code>generalize_type</code> abstracts over appropriate free variables</td>\n<td><code>let id = fun x -&gt; x</code> generalizes to <code>forall a. a -&gt; a</code></td>\n<td>Over-generalization violating value restriction or under-generalization losing polymorphism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instantiation</td>\n<td><code>instantiate_scheme</code> creates fresh instances with unique variables</td>\n<td>Using polymorphic <code>id</code> twice gives <code>&#39;a1 -&gt; &#39;a1</code> and <code>&#39;a2 -&gt; &#39;a2</code> with different variables</td>\n<td>Variable capture where instances share variables incorrectly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Value Restriction</td>\n<td>Generalization correctly applies value restriction</td>\n<td><code>let r = ref []</code> stays monomorphic, doesn&#39;t generalize to <code>forall a. ref (list a)</code></td>\n<td>Unsafe generalization that could violate type soundness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphic Usage</td>\n<td>Polymorphic functions can be used at multiple types in same program</td>\n<td><code>id 5</code> and <code>id true</code> both type check with same polymorphic <code>id</code></td>\n<td>Polymorphic functions locked to first usage type</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Key Design Insight</strong>: Milestone verification isn&#39;t just about testing new functionality — each milestone must also include <strong>regression tests</strong> that verify all previous milestone functionality still works. Polymorphism changes how types are represented and manipulated, which can subtly break basic type checking in hard-to-detect ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"test-case-categories\">Test Case Categories</h3>\n<p>Testing a type checker requires <strong>systematic coverage across multiple orthogonal dimensions</strong> rather than ad-hoc test cases. Think of this like testing a complex chemical plant where you must verify correct operation under normal conditions, boundary conditions, error conditions, and combinations thereof. The challenge is ensuring comprehensive coverage without writing thousands of redundant test cases.</p>\n<p>Our test categorization follows <strong>black-box and white-box testing principles</strong>. Black-box categories test the external behavior (does the type checker accept/reject programs correctly?), while white-box categories test internal algorithm correctness (does unification produce correct substitutions?). This dual approach catches both specification violations and implementation bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Type Rule Verification tests the fundamental type system rules systematically.</strong> These tests verify that our type checker correctly implements the theoretical type rules from type theory literature. Think of these as testing the &quot;constitutional law&quot; of our type system — the foundational rules that define what programs are legal.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule Category</th>\n<th>Test Focus</th>\n<th>Example Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Literal Typing</td>\n<td>Primitive values have correct built-in types</td>\n<td><code>5</code> has type <code>int</code>, <code>true</code> has type <code>bool</code>, <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> has type <code>string</code></td>\n<td>Literal expressions synthesize correct primitive types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Variable Lookup</td>\n<td>Variable references resolve to declared types</td>\n<td><code>let x : int = 5 in x</code> where <code>x</code> has type <code>int</code></td>\n<td>Variable expressions synthesize type from environment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function Application</td>\n<td>Function calls check argument/parameter compatibility</td>\n<td><code>(fun x : int -&gt; x + 1) 5</code> where argument matches parameter</td>\n<td>Function applications type check with compatible arguments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Function Abstraction</td>\n<td>Lambda expressions have proper arrow types</td>\n<td><code>fun x : int -&gt; x + 1</code> has type <code>int -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td>Lambda expressions synthesize arrow types from parameter and body</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Let Binding</td>\n<td>Let expressions extend environment correctly</td>\n<td><code>let x = 5 in x + 1</code> where <code>x</code> available in body with inferred type</td>\n<td>Let expressions extend environment for body evaluation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Binary Operations</td>\n<td>Operators enforce operand type requirements</td>\n<td><code>5 + 3</code> succeeds, <code>5 + true</code> fails with type mismatch</td>\n<td>Binary operators require compatible operand types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conditional Expressions</td>\n<td>If expressions require boolean condition and matching branches</td>\n<td><code>if true then 5 else 3</code> succeeds, <code>if 5 then true else false</code> fails</td>\n<td>Conditionals enforce boolean condition and unified branch types</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The systematic approach here tests <strong>each type rule in isolation</strong> before testing combinations. This is crucial because when a complex expression fails to type check, you need to know which specific rule is violated.</p>\n<p><strong>Type Inference Correctness tests the constraint generation and solving algorithms.</strong> These are white-box tests that verify the internal inference mechanisms work correctly. Think of these as testing the &quot;reasoning engine&quot; that deduces types from incomplete information.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Inference Category</th>\n<th>Algorithm Focus</th>\n<th>Example Test Cases</th>\n<th>Expected Behavior</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Constraint Generation</td>\n<td><code>generate_constraints</code> produces complete constraint sets</td>\n<td><code>let f = fun x -&gt; x + 1</code> generates <code>typeof(x) = typeof(1) = int</code>, <code>typeof(+) = int -&gt; int -&gt; int</code>, etc.</td>\n<td>All type relationships captured as constraints</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Simple Unification</td>\n<td><code>unify</code> solves basic variable-type constraints</td>\n<td>Unify <code>&#39;a</code> with <code>int</code> produces substitution <code>[&#39;a := int]</code></td>\n<td>Basic unification produces correct substitutions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Complex Unification</td>\n<td><code>unify</code> handles nested type structures</td>\n<td>Unify <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b</code> with <code>int -&gt; bool</code> produces <code>[&#39;a := int, &#39;b := bool]</code></td>\n<td>Structural unification decomposes and solves recursively</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unification Failure</td>\n<td><code>unify</code> detects unsolvable constraints</td>\n<td>Unify <code>int</code> with <code>bool</code> fails with type mismatch error</td>\n<td>Incompatible types detected and reported clearly</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Occurs Check</td>\n<td>Infinite type prevention during unification</td>\n<td>Unify <code>&#39;a</code> with <code>&#39;a -&gt; int</code> fails with occurs check error</td>\n<td>Infinite types prevented with clear diagnostic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substitution Composition</td>\n<td>Multiple substitutions combine correctly</td>\n<td>Composing <code>[&#39;a := int]</code> and <code>[&#39;b := &#39;a]</code> produces <code>[&#39;a := int, &#39;b := int]</code></td>\n<td>Substitution composition maintains consistency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Most General Inference</td>\n<td>Complete inference produces optimal types</td>\n<td><code>fun x -&gt; x</code> infers <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code> not specific type like <code>int -&gt; int</code></td>\n<td>Inference maximizes polymorphism where possible</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The key insight for inference testing is <strong>theoretical optimality verification</strong> — you must know what the most general type should be for each test case and verify that inference achieves it.</p>\n<p><strong>Error Handling and Recovery tests verify that the type checker behaves gracefully when encountering invalid programs.</strong> These tests are crucial because in practice, most programs a type checker sees are incorrect during development.

Just as medical diagnosis requires understanding how different organ systems interact, type checker debugging demands deep understanding of how type environments, constraint generation, unification, and error recovery components work together.</p>\n<p>The fundamental challenge in type checker debugging lies in the <strong>cascade effect</strong> — a single algorithmic error can propagate through multiple phases, causing symptoms that appear far from the actual root cause. Unlike simpler programs where bugs manifest locally, type checker bugs often involve complex interactions between constraint generation, unification, environment threading, and substitution application. A bug in occurs check implementation might not surface until polymorphic instantiation fails mysteriously, or an environment scoping error might only become apparent when let-polymorphism produces incorrect generalizations.</p>\n<p>This section provides systematic debugging methodologies for the three most challenging areas: unification algorithm failures, type environment scoping problems, and type inference behavioral issues. Each area requires different diagnostic approaches because they involve different algorithmic phases and data structures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unification-algorithm-debugging\">Unification Algorithm Debugging</h3>\n<p>Think of debugging unification as <strong>forensic analysis of a negotiation breakdown</strong> — much like how diplomatic negotiations can fail at various stages (miscommunication, incompatible demands, procedural violations), unification can fail during constraint decomposition, occurs check violations, or substitution composition errors. The key to successful debugging lies in systematic tracing of the constraint solving process to identify exactly where and why the negotiation broke down.</p>\n<p>The unification algorithm represents the heart of constraint-based type inference, and its failures can manifest in numerous ways. Understanding the anatomy of unification failures requires deep knowledge of how constraints are generated, how the Robinson unification algorithm processes them, and how substitutions compose and apply to type expressions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Funification-algorithm.svg\" alt=\"Unification Algorithm Process\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"constraint-generation-trace-analysis\">Constraint Generation Trace Analysis</h4>\n<p>The first step in unification debugging involves tracing constraint generation to ensure the initial constraint set accurately reflects the program&#39;s type requirements.

Each expression construct should generate appropriate constraints based on its typing rules. For function calls, this means generating constraints between each argument and its corresponding parameter type. For binary operators, this means constraining both operands to be compatible with the operator&#39;s type signature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Insight</strong>: Constraint generation bugs often manifest as &quot;phantom&quot; type errors — the unification algorithm correctly identifies that constraints cannot be satisfied, but the constraints themselves don&#39;t accurately represent the program&#39;s intended typing behavior.

Environment bugs often manifest as access control failures: variables that should be accessible become unreachable, or variables that should be out of scope remain accessible with stale type information.</p>\n<p>Type environment debugging presents unique challenges because environment state changes continuously during type checking, and environment threading errors can cause subtle bugs that only manifest in complex nested scoping scenarios. The type environment serves as the authoritative source for variable type information, and any corruption or incorrect threading can cascade through the entire type checking process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/api/project/type-checker/architecture-doc/asset?path=diagrams%2Ftype-environment-scoping.svg\" alt=\"Type Environment Scoping\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"lexical-scoping-violation-diagnosis\">Lexical Scoping Violation Diagnosis</h4>\n<p>Lexical scoping requires that variable visibility follows the program&#39;s textual structure — inner scopes can access outer scope variables, but outer scopes cannot access inner scope variables, and variable shadowing should hide outer definitions without destroying them.

Environment threading requires that each type checking function receives the current environment state and returns an updated environment reflecting any new bindings introduced during checking.

Polymorphic bindings require instantiation at each use site (replacing quantified variables with fresh variables), while monomorphic bindings can be used directly. Mixing up these binding types leads to incorrect generalization behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Critical Implementation Detail</strong>: The <code>lookup</code> function must distinguish between finding no binding (<code>None</code>) and finding a binding with an incorrect type. Type compatibility checking happens after successful lookup, not during the lookup process itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"environment-extension-and-restoration-patterns\">Environment Extension and Restoration Patterns</h4>\n<p>Environment extension adds new variable bindings to the innermost scope, while environment restoration removes temporary scopes when exiting scope boundaries. These operations must maintain environment invariants and properly handle the interaction between temporary bindings and permanent bindings.</p>\n<p><strong>Environment Lifecycle Management:</strong></p>\n<p>Environment extension using <code>extend_mono</code> and <code>extend_poly</code> adds bindings to the current innermost scope layer.

Premature generalization leads to incorrect polymorphism, while delayed generalization loses polymorphic opportunities.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Free Variable Calculation</strong>: For each generalization site, verify that the free variable calculation correctly identifies which type variables should be quantified. Variables free in the current environment should not be generalized.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Value Restriction Compliance</strong>: Verify that value restriction properly prevents generalization of expressions that might contain mutable references or other side-effecting operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Instantiation Consistency</strong>: At polymorphic variable use sites, verify that instantiation creates fresh type variables and properly substitutes them for quantified variables.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Type Scheme Representation</strong>: Verify that type schemes correctly represent polymorphic types and that type scheme operations (instantiation, substitution application) preserve polymorphic type structure.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Polymorphism Debugging Error Patterns:</strong></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Error Pattern</th>\n<th>Symptom</th>\n<th>Algorithmic Cause</th>\n<th>Debugging Focus</th>\n<th>Fix Strategy</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Variables lose polymorphic types</td>\n<td>Functions that should be polymorphic become monomorphic</td>\n<td>Generalization not occurring or quantifying wrong variables</td>\n<td>Examine generalization trigger conditions and free variable calculation</td>\n<td>Fix generalization algorithm and variable scoping</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Invalid polymorphic generalization</td>\n<td>Variables generalized that should remain monomorphic</td>\n<td>Value restriction not applied or environment analysis incorrect</td>\n<td>Investigate value restriction implementation and environment free variable analysis</td>\n<td>Implement proper value restriction and environment analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instantiation creates wrong types</td>\n<td>Polymorphic functions called with wrong inferred argument types</td>\n<td>Instantiation algorithm creates incorrect fresh variables</td>\n<td>Trace instantiation process and variable substitution</td>\n<td>Fix instantiation to properly handle quantified variables</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Type scheme operations corrupt polymorphic types</td>\n<td>Polymorphic types become malformed during constraint solving</td>\n<td>Type scheme substitution or composition errors</td>\n<td>Examine type scheme representation and operations</td>\n<td>Implement correct type scheme operations with proper variable handling</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Polymorphic recursion fails</td>\n<td>Recursive functions can&#39;t call themselves at different types</td>\n<td>Recursive generalization or environment handling incorrect</td>\n<td>Investigate recursive function type checking and environment threading</td>\n<td>Handle recursive function generalization properly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Premature Generalization</strong>\nA common error involves generalizing types too early in the inference process, before all constraints have been solved. This leads to polymorphic types that don&#39;t reflect the actual constraint requirements. Always perform generalization after complete constraint solving, and only at syntactic let-binding sites.</p>\n<p>The value restriction represents a critical correctness requirement for generalization. Expressions that might contain mutable state or perform side effects cannot be safely generalized because polymorphic instantiation might violate type safety. The value restriction prevents generalization of non-syntactic values, ensuring that only genuinely pure expressions receive polymorphic types.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation

Extensions</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Milestone(s):</strong> Beyond Milestone 4 (Polymorphism) - Advanced features that build upon the complete type checker foundation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of future extensions as <strong>architectural expansion plans for a well-built house</strong> — much like how a solidly constructed home with good foundations, electrical, and plumbing can later be expanded with new rooms, smart home systems, or energy-efficient upgrades. Our type checker, once built with the four core milestones, provides a robust foundation that can support sophisticated type system features without requiring fundamental rewrites. Each extension leverages the existing infrastructure while adding new capabilities that enhance the language&#39;s expressiveness and safety guarantees.</p>\n<p>The beauty of our constraint-based architecture is that it naturally accommodates extensions through additional constraint generation rules, new type constructors in the <code>ty</code> algebraic data type, and enhanced unification procedures. The modular design separating type representation, environment management, inference engine, and error reporting means that most extensions can be added incrementally without disrupting the core functionality.</p>\n<p>This section explores the most impactful extensions that would transform our basic functional language type checker into a production-ready system comparable to languages like Haskell, Rust, or modern TypeScript. Each extension is presented with its conceptual foundation, integration approach, implementation complexity, and the new capabilities it unlocks for language users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"algebraic-data-types-and-pattern-matching\">Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching</h3>\n<p><strong>Algebraic data types (ADTs)</strong> represent the next logical evolution beyond basic types — think of them as <strong>structured data blueprints with multiple construction patterns</strong>, much like how a vehicle can be constructed as either a car (with doors, engine, seats) or a motorcycle (with handlebars, engine, wheels) or a truck (with cargo bed, engine, cab).

For example, type classes with higher-kinded types require sophisticated constraint resolution, while dependent types with modules need careful abstraction boundary management. Implement extensions incrementally and test their interactions thoroughly.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Performance Regression</strong>\nAdvanced type system features can significantly impact compilation performance. Constraint solving becomes more expensive with type classes, row unification is complex, and dependent type checking requires theorem proving. Profile your implementation and consider optimization strategies early.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Error Message Quality Degradation</strong>\nSophisticated type system features often produce complex error messages that confuse users. Type class resolution failures, row type mismatches, and dependent type constraint violations need specially crafted error reporting to remain understandable.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure for

In type theory, precision of language is critical because subtle differences in terminology often reflect important algorithmic or theoretical distinctions that can make or break an implementation.</p>\n<p>The type checking domain draws from several academic fields including programming language theory, mathematical logic, and compiler design. Each field contributes specialized vocabulary that has evolved over decades of research. Understanding these terms precisely is essential for implementing a correct type checker, reading academic literature, communicating with other compiler engineers, and debugging complex type system issues.</p>\n<p>This glossary organizes terms into logical categories to help you understand how concepts relate to each other. Terms are defined not just formally, but with practical context about how they appear in our type checker implementation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"core-type-theory-terminology\">Core Type Theory

implementing correct algorithms, reading research literature, and communicating effectively with other type system implementers. Each term represents not just a concept but often a specific algorithmic challenge or design decision that affects the behavior and capabilities of your type checker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"common-terminology-pitfalls\">Common Terminology Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Confusing &quot;type checking&quot; and &quot;type inference&quot;</strong>\nMany beginners use these terms interchangeably, but they represent different processes. Type checking verifies that explicit annotations match usage, while type inference determines types for unannotated expressions. Our system does both - it checks explicit annotations and infers types where they&#39;re missing.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Misunderstanding &quot;polymorphism&quot; scope</strong>\nNot all polymorphism is the same. Parametric polymorphism (our focus) is different from ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading) and subtype polymorphism (inheritance). When discussing polymorphic types, be specific about which form you mean.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Conflating &quot;substitution&quot; and &quot;unification&quot;</strong>\nSubstitution is a mapping from variables to types, while unification is the algorithm that finds substitutions. Unification produces substitutions as its result, but the two concepts are distinct and serve different roles in the type checking process.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Assuming &quot;fresh variables&quot; are optional</strong>\nFresh variable generation is critical for correctness, not just convenience. Using non-fresh variables during instantiation can cause variable capture and incorrect type checking results. Always use <code>fresh_type_var()</code> when creating new unknowns.</p>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Pitfall: Treating &quot;generalization&quot; and &quot;instantiation&quot; as inverses</strong>\nWhile related, these operations are not simple inverses. Generalization abstracts over specific type variables in specific contexts, while instantiation creates fresh variables. The relationship is more subtle than mathematical function inversion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation-guidance\">Implementation Guidance</h3>\n<p><strong>A.

statically typed language that performs type inference, validation, and error reporting. The key architectural challenge is building a constraint-based type inference engine that can unify type constraints while supporting polymorphism through let-generalization.\n\n\n> This guide is meant to help you understand the big picture before diving into each milestone. Refer back to it whenever you need context on how components connect.\n\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nType checking serves as the foundational safety mechanism in statically typed programming languages, catching errors at compile time before they manifest as runtime failures. Building a type checker requires sophisticated algorithms that can not only validate explicit type annotations but also infer types where they are omitted, unify conflicting constraints, and support advanced features like polymorphism. Understanding why these algorithms are necessary—and how they work together—is crucial for implementing a robust type system that provides both safety and expressiveness.\n\n### Type Checking as Contract Verification\n\nThink of type checking as a legal contract verification system in a complex business transaction. Just as lawyers review contracts to ensure all parties' obligations are clearly defined, mutually compatible, and legally enforceable, a type checker examines program code to verify that all data flows, function calls, and variable assignments respect the \"contracts\" defined by type annotations.\n\nIn this analogy, **types are contracts** that specify what operations are permissible on a piece of data. When you declare a variable as `int`, you're establishing a contract that this storage location will only hold integer values and support integer operations like arithmetic. When you define a function with signature `string -> int`, you're creating a contract promising to accept any string input and produce an integer output.\n\nThe **type checker acts as the contract lawyer**, examining every interaction between program components to ensure contract compliance. When it encounters a function call, it verifies that the arguments provided match the parameter contracts, just as a lawyer would verify that each party in a business deal can fulfill their stated obligations. When it sees an assignment, it checks that the value being stored satisfies the variable's contract requirements.\n\nBut unlike simple contract verification, type checking must handle **implicit contracts**—situations where the programmer hasn't explicitly stated the types involved. This is where type inference becomes essential. Imagine a business lawyer who must not only verify explicit contract terms but also infer unstated obligations from context and industry standards. If a contract mentions \"delivery within 30 days\" but doesn't specify the delivery method, the lawyer might infer reasonable constraints based on the product type and industry norms.\n\nSimilarly, when a type checker encounters code like `let x = 42 + y`, it must infer that `x` has integer type based on the integer literal `42` and the addition operation, while also constraining `y` to be integer-compatible. This inference process generates **type constraints**—requirements that must be satisfied for the program to be well-typed.\n\nThe most sophisticated part of this analogy involves **contract templates**—polymorphic types that can be instantiated with specific terms for different situations. Just as a business might use template contracts where blanks are filled in based on the specific deal (vendor name, delivery date, payment amount), polymorphic functions use type variables that get instantiated with concrete types at each call site. The type checker must ensure that each instantiation of the template produces valid, consistent contracts.\n\n> **Key Insight**: Type checking is fundamentally about proving that a program's implicit promises can be consistently fulfilled. Every expression makes promises about what type of value it produces, and every context makes demands about what types it can accept. The type checker's job is to verify that all promises match all demands throughout the program.\n\n### Existing Type System Approaches\n\nDifferent programming languages have evolved distinct approaches to type checking, each representing different trade-offs between safety, expressiveness, implementation complexity, and programmer burden. Understanding these approaches helps clarify why our constraint-based inference system requires sophisticated algorithms.\n\n#### Simple Type Checking Approach\n\nThe simplest approach requires **explicit type annotations everywhere** and performs **direct syntactic verification** without inference. Languages like early versions of Pascal or C follow this model, where every variable declaration must include a type annotation, and the type checker simply verifies that each operation's operand types exactly match the expected types.\n\n| Aspect | Simple Type Checking |\n|--------|---------------------|\n| Annotation Requirement | Explicit types required on all variables, parameters, return values |\n| Inference Capability | None—types are only propagated, never inferred |\n| Algorithm Complexity | Linear pass through AST checking local compatibility |\n| Error Detection | Immediate—mismatch detected at each operation |\n| Polymorphism Support | None, or limited to ad-hoc overloading |\n| Implementation Effort | Low—straightforward recursive AST traversal |\n\nIn this system, checking a function call involves three simple steps: look up the function's declared signature, check that each argument's type exactly matches the corresponding parameter type, and propagate the declared return type to the call site. There's no constraint solving, no unification, and no type variable instantiation.\n\nThe major limitation is **annotation burden**—programmers must write type annotations for every binding, even when the types are obvious from context. Code like `let length: int = 0` feels redundant when the integer literal makes the type clear. More importantly, this approach cannot support **parametric polymorphism**—generic functions that work with multiple types—because there's no mechanism for type variables or constraint solving.\n\n#### Hindley-Milner Inference Approach\n\nThe **Hindley-Milner type system** represents the opposite extreme: maximal type inference with minimal annotations. Languages like ML, Haskell, and our target implementation use this approach, where most type annotations are optional and the system infers the most general types possible through constraint-based unification.\n\n| Aspect | Hindley-Milner Inference |\n|--------|-------------------------|\n| Annotation Requirement | Optional except at module boundaries |\n| Inference Capability | Complete—can infer most general types without annotations |\n| Algorithm Complexity | Constraint generation + unification (roughly linear in practice) |\n| Error Detection | Deferred—errors surface when constraints become unsatisfiable |\n| Polymorphism Support | Full parametric polymorphism with let-generalization |\n| Implementation Effort | High—requires constraint solving and unification algorithms |\n\nThe Hindley-Milner approach works through **constraint generation** and **unification**. When the type checker encounters an expression like `f(x)`, it doesn't immediately verify compatibility. Instead, it generates constraints: \"the type of `f` must be a function type from the type of `x` to some result type.\" These constraints accumulate throughout the program, forming a system of type equations.\n\nThe **unification algorithm** then solves this constraint system by finding type substitutions that make all constraints simultaneously satisfiable. If unification succeeds, the program is well-typed and the algorithm has discovered the most general type for every expression. If unification fails, the constraints are inconsistent and the program contains a type error.\n\nThe key insight enabling this approach is **let-polymorphism**: when a value is bound in a let-expression, its inferred type is generalized by quantifying over any type variables that don't escape the binding's scope. This allows the same function to be used at multiple types within the same program.\n\n> **Decision: Constraint-Based Inference with Hindley-Milner**\n> - **Context**: We want to support both type safety and programmer convenience, with optional annotations and generic functions\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Simple explicit typing (like early Pascal)\n>   2. Constraint-based inference (Hindley-Milner)\n>   3. Gradual typing (mixed static/dynamic)\n> - **Decision**: Implement constraint-based inference following the Hindley-Milner approach\n> - **Rationale**: Provides maximum expressiveness with minimal annotation burden, supports full parametric polymorphism, and has well-understood theoretical foundations with proven decidability\n> - **Consequences**: Requires implementing constraint generation, unification algorithm, and let-generalization, but provides excellent user experience and catches errors statically\n\n#### Gradual Typing Approach\n\n**Gradual typing** attempts to bridge static and dynamic typing by allowing programmers to add type annotations incrementally. Languages like TypeScript, Python with type hints, and Dart use this approach, where unannotated code is assigned a special \"dynamic\" type that bypasses static checking.\n\n| Aspect | Gradual Typing |\n|--------|----------------|\n| Annotation Requirement | Optional, with dynamic fallback for unannotated code |\n| Inference Capability | Limited—inference within typed regions, dynamic elsewhere |\n| Algorithm Complexity | Multi-phase: static analysis where possible, runtime checks at boundaries |\n| Error Detection | Mixed—static errors in typed code, runtime errors at dynamic boundaries |\n| Polymorphism Support | Varies—full polymorphism in static regions, duck typing in dynamic regions |\n| Implementation Effort | Very high—requires both static analysis and runtime type checking infrastructure |\n\nGradual typing introduces **consistency checking** instead of strict type equality. A dynamically-typed value is considered \"consistent\" with any static type, allowing gradual migration from dynamic to static typing. However, this consistency must be verified at runtime through **type casts** and **proxy wrappers** that check contracts at the boundaries between typed and untyped code.\n\nThe complexity comes from maintaining **type soundness** in the presence of dynamic code. The static portions of the program must be protected from type violations that might originate in dynamic code, requiring sophisticated runtime monitoring and error reporting.\n\n#### Approach Comparison and Selection\n\n| Approach | Safety Guarantees | Programmer Burden | Implementation Complexity | Expressiveness |\n|----------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Simple Explicit | Full static safety | High annotation burden | Low | Limited polymorphism |\n| Hindley-Milner | Full static safety | Minimal annotations | Medium-High | Full polymorphism |\n| Gradual | Partial safety | Optional annotations | Very High | Mixed paradigms |\n\nFor our educational type checker implementation, the Hindley-Milner approach provides the best balance of learning value and practical utility. It requires understanding sophisticated algorithms (constraint generation, unification, generalization) while producing a system that feels modern and expressive to use.\n\nThe constraint-based inference approach also demonstrates important computer science concepts: the unification algorithm is a fundamental technique in automated reasoning, constraint solving appears throughout AI and optimization, and the type system's mathematical foundations connect to logic and formal methods.\n\n> **Critical Understanding**: The need for sophisticated algorithms in type checking stems from the tension between expressiveness and verification. Simple type checking is easy to implement but forces programmers to state the obvious repeatedly. Powerful inference systems allow natural expression of polymorphic, generic code but require complex algorithms to ensure that the inferred types are sound and consistent.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Core Data Structures | Basic algebraic data types with pattern matching | Extensible visitor pattern with type-safe dispatch |\n| Constraint Solving | Direct recursive unification | Constraint propagation with backtracking |\n| Error Reporting | Simple string messages | Rich error objects with source locations and suggestions |\n| Type Environment | Single global symbol table | Nested scopes with efficient lookup chains |\n| Testing Framework | Unit tests with manual test cases | Property-based testing with random program generation |\n\n#### Recommended File Structure\n\nOur type checker implementation will be organized around the major algorithmic components, with clear separation between type representation, constraint handling, and the main inference engine:\n\n```ocaml\ntype-checker/\n  lib/\n    types/\n      type_ast.ml          ← Core type representation (primitives, functions, variables)\n      type_env.ml          ← Type environment and scoping management  \n      type_scheme.ml       ← Polymorphic type schemes with quantification\n    inference/\n      constraints.ml       ← Constraint generation from expressions\n      unification.ml       ← Robinson unification algorithm with occurs check\n      substitution.ml      ← Type variable substitution and composition\n    checking/\n      type_checker.ml      ← Main type checking orchestration\n      error_reporter.ml    ← Type error formatting and source location tracking\n    utils/\n      fresh_vars.ml        ← Fresh type variable generation\n      pretty_print.ml      ← Type and expression pretty printing\n  test/\n    unit/\n      test_unification.ml  ← Unification algorithm test cases\n      test_inference.ml    ← Type inference test scenarios\n      test_polymorphism.ml ← Let-polymorphism and generalization tests\n    integration/\n      test_programs.ml     ← Complete programs with expected types/errors\n  examples/\n    simple_programs/       ← Example programs showing type system features\n    error_examples/        ← Programs that should produce specific type errors\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\n**Fresh Variable Generation** (complete utility module):\n\n```ocaml\n(* fresh_vars.ml -

It should successfully infer types for the first two bindings and produce a clear error for the third, showing that your type representation, environment management, and basic checking components work together correctly.\n\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nBuilding a type checker is like constructing a sophisticated quality assurance system for a manufacturing line. Just as a quality inspector must understand the specifications for each product, know how components fit together, and catch defects before they reach customers, our type checker must understand type specifications, verify that program components interact correctly, and catch type errors before runtime. However, unlike a simple inspection checklist, our type checker must also be a detective—inferring missing specifications and solving constraints to determine what types should be where no explicit annotations exist.\n\nThe scope of this type checker project strikes a careful balance between educational value and implementation complexity. We aim to build a system sophisticated enough to demonstrate the core principles of modern type systems while remaining focused enough that a single developer can implement it thoroughly. This means including the essential features that make type checking both challenging and useful, while deliberately excluding advanced features that would multiply implementation complexity without proportional learning benefit.\n\n### Primary Goals\n\nOur type checker will accomplish four major objectives that progressively build upon each other to create a complete type inference system.\n\n**Foundational Type System Implementation** forms the bedrock of our checker. We will implement a complete algebraic data type system for representing primitive types (`TInt`, `TBool`, `TString`), function types (`TFun`), type variables (`TVar`), and polymorphic types (`TForall`). The system will include structural type equality checking through `type_equal`, proper scoping through a hierarchical `TypeEnv.t` structure, and fundamental type compatibility rules. This foundation must be rock-solid because every other component depends on these type representations and environment operations.\n\n**Constraint-Based Type Inference Engine** represents the intellectual heart of the project. We will implement a complete Hindley-Milner style inference system that can deduce types for expressions without explicit annotations. The system will generate type constraints from expressions, solve them through a Robinson unification algorithm with `occurs_check` protection against infinite types, and apply the resulting substitutions to produce fully concrete types. This goes far beyond simple type checking—it's a constraint solver that can work backwards from usage patterns to determine what types variables and expressions must have.\n\n**Let-Polymorphism Support** enables our type checker to handle generic programming patterns that are essential in real programming languages. We will implement type scheme representation with quantified variables, automatic generalization at let-bindings that abstracts over free type variables, and instantiation at use sites that creates fresh type variables for each polymorphic usage. This allows a single function definition to work at multiple types—a critical feature for writing reusable code.\n\n**Comprehensive Error Reporting System** ensures that our type checker is actually usable by developers. We will implement detailed error messages that include source locations, clear descriptions of what went wrong, and helpful suggestions for fixes. The system will continue checking after encountering errors to find multiple problems in a single pass, and it will provide meaningful diagnostics when constraint solving fails or unification encounters impossible requirements.\n\nThe following table summarizes our core deliverables and their acceptance criteria:\n\n| Component | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Type Representation | Complete algebraic data type system | All primitive, function, and generic types representable; structural equality works correctly |\n| Type Environment | Scoped symbol table with lookup/extension | Proper lexical scoping; variable shadowing handled correctly |\n| Type Checking | Expression and statement type validation | All language constructs type-checked; operator compatibility enforced |\n| Type Inference | Constraint generation and unification | Types inferred where not annotated; unification finds most general types |\n| Polymorphism | Let-polymorphism with generalization | Single definitions usable at multiple types; proper quantification |\n| Error Reporting | Clear messages with source locations | Multiple errors found per pass; helpful diagnostic information |\n\n### Explicit Non-Goals\n\nTo maintain focus and achievable scope, we explicitly exclude several advanced type system features that would significantly complicate implementation without proportional educational benefit for understanding core type checking principles.\n\n**Dependent Types and Advanced Type Theory Features** are deliberately excluded. We will not implement dependent types where types can depend on runtime values, type-level computation, or sophisticated type families. While these features appear in languages like Agda, Idris, and recent Haskell extensions, they require substantially more complex type checking algorithms and would shift the focus from understanding basic inference to navigating advanced type theory. Our goal is to understand how types flow through programs, not to explore the cutting edge of type system research.\n\n**Effect Systems and Advanced Control Flow Analysis** remain outside our scope. We will not track side effects, exceptions, or other computational effects in our type system. Similarly, we exclude advanced control flow features like continuations, coroutines, or sophisticated exception handling mechanisms. While effect systems are increasingly important in modern functional languages, they represent a separate layer of complexity that would double the implementation burden without reinforcing the core type inference concepts we want to master.\n\n**Object-Oriented Type Features and Inheritance** are not included in this implementation. We will not build support for classes, inheritance hierarchies, method dispatch, or subtyping beyond simple function type compatibility. While these features are central to languages like Java or C++, they introduce architectural complexity around vtables, method resolution, and inheritance diamond problems that distract from the core algorithms of constraint-based type inference.\n\n**Advanced Polymorphism Beyond Let-Polymorphism** is excluded to keep the scope manageable. We will not implement higher-ranked types, existential quantification, type classes, or GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types). While these features enable powerful programming patterns, they require significantly more sophisticated constraint solving algorithms and would multiply the complexity of our unification engine beyond what's needed to understand the fundamental principles.\n\n**Production Language Features and Optimizations** are consciously omitted. We will not implement module systems, separate compilation, incremental type checking, or performance optimizations like constraint caching or parallel inference. Similarly, we exclude features like type annotations for optimization hints, calling convention specifications, or memory layout controls. Our focus is on correctness and understanding, not on building a production-ready compiler infrastructure.\n\n**Gradual Typing and Dynamic Interaction** features are excluded. We will not implement any form of gradual typing that allows mixing typed and untyped code, runtime type reflection, or dynamic type checking mechanisms. While these features are increasingly important for language interoperability, they introduce runtime components and dynamic analysis that are orthogonal to the static analysis principles we want to understand.\n\nThe following table clarifies what we explicitly will not implement:\n\n| Category | Excluded Features | Rationale |\n|----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Advanced Types | Dependent types, type families, GADTs | Requires advanced type theory beyond core inference |\n| Effects | Effect systems, exception tracking, continuations | Separate complexity domain from basic type checking |\n| OOP Features | Classes, inheritance, method dispatch | Different architectural complexity than functional type inference |\n| Advanced Polymorphism | Higher-ranked types, type classes, existentials | Would require sophisticated constraint solving extensions |\n| Production Features | Modules, separate compilation, optimizations | Focus on correctness over performance and scale |\n| Dynamic Interaction | Gradual typing, reflection, runtime types | Introduces runtime components beyond static analysis |\n\n### Target Complexity and Learning Outcomes\n\nOur type checker targets the complexity level of a sophisticated undergraduate compiler course final project or a graduate-level programming languages assignment. The implementation should require approximately 2000-3000 lines of well-structured code, with roughly equal complexity distributed across type representation, constraint generation, unification algorithm implementation, and polymorphism support.\n\n**Algorithm Implementation Depth** will focus on understanding and implementing the core algorithms from first principles. Students will implement the Robinson unification algorithm with occurs check, understand why the occurs check prevents infinite types, and see how substitution composition works in practice. They will implement constraint generation that walks expression trees and collects type equality requirements, then solve those constraints to determine concrete types. This hands-on implementation of fundamental algorithms provides deep understanding that cannot be gained from just reading about them.\n\n**Type Theory Understanding** will emerge naturally from implementing the system rather than being taught abstractly. Students will understand why let-polymorphism generalizes at let-bindings but not at lambda expressions, what the value restriction prevents, and how type schemes with quantified variables enable generic programming. They will see how type environments implement lexical scoping and why proper environment threading is crucial for correct type checking in nested expressions.\n\n**Software Architecture Skills** will be developed through building a multi-component system where type representation, environment management, constraint solving, and error reporting must work together cleanly. Students will learn how to design algebraic data types that naturally represent the problem domain, how to structure recursive algorithms that traverse and transform complex data structures, and how to build error handling that provides useful feedback without crashing the entire system.\n\nThe learning progression follows a carefully designed sequence where each milestone builds essential concepts needed for the next stage, ensuring that students understand not just what to implement, but why each component is necessary and how the pieces fit together to enable type inference.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The power of this project lies not in implementing any single algorithm perfectly, but in understanding how type representation, constraint generation, unification, and polymorphism work together as a complete system. Each component constrains and enables the others, creating a whole that demonstrates the elegant interplay between theory and practice in programming language implementation.\n\n### Success Metrics and Validation\n\nSuccess in this project will be measured through both functional correctness and conceptual understanding, with specific checkpoints at each milestone to ensure steady progress toward a complete system.\n\n**Functional Correctness Metrics** provide objective measures of implementation quality. The type checker must correctly infer types for polymorphic expressions like `let id = fun x -> x in (id 42, id true)`, producing types `(int * bool)` without any explicit annotations. It must detect type errors like `1 + true` and provide clear error messages explaining why integer addition cannot be applied to boolean operands. The unification algorithm must handle complex constraint sets and properly implement the occurs check to reject infinite types like `'a = 'a -> int`. Error recovery must continue checking after encountering problems to find multiple type errors in a single pass.\n\n**Conceptual Understanding Assessment** focuses on whether students grasp the underlying principles rather than just copying implementation patterns. Students should be able to explain why let-polymorphism generalizes `let f = fun x -> x` to type `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a` but does not generalize the same expression when it appears as a function argument. They should understand why the occurs check prevents infinite types and be able to trace through the unification algorithm on specific examples. Most importantly, they should see how constraint-based inference enables type checking without explicit annotations while maintaining the safety guarantees of static typing.\n\n**Code Quality and Architecture Standards** ensure that the implementation demonstrates good software engineering practices alongside algorithmic correctness. The code should exhibit clear separation between type representation, environment management, constraint generation, and unification solving. Error handling should be comprehensive without being defensive to the point of obscuring the main logic. The type representations should naturally reflect the mathematical structure of the type system, making the code serve as executable documentation of the algorithms.\n\nThe following table defines specific validation criteria for each milestone:\n\n| Milestone | Functional Test | Conceptual Check | Code Quality Standard |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Type Representation | All primitive and composite types representable | Explain structural vs nominal typing choice | Clean algebraic data type definitions |\n| Basic Type Checking | Expressions and statements type-checked correctly | Trace type rule applications by hand | Clear separation of checking vs inference |\n| Type Inference | Types inferred for unannotated expressions | Explain constraint generation process | Unification algorithm cleanly separated |\n| Polymorphism | Polymorphic functions work at multiple types | Explain generalization vs instantiation | Type scheme handling properly abstracted |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe implementation approach balances theoretical understanding with practical software construction, providing complete infrastructure components while ensuring students implement the core algorithms themselves.\n\n#### A.

Language-Specific Hints\n\n**OCaml Implementation Tips:**\n- Use pattern matching exhaustively with compiler warnings enabled (`-w +8`) to catch missing cases\n- Implement `string_of_type` early for debugging - you'll need to inspect types constantly\n- Use `failwith` with descriptive messages for unification failures, then refine to proper error handling\n- The `ref` type works well for generating fresh type variable names with global counter\n- List.fold_left is perfect for applying multiple substitutions in sequence\n\n**Testing and Debugging Strategies:**\n- Start with simple expressions like `42` and `true` before moving to function types\n- Test unification algorithm independently with hand-constructed type pairs\n- Use the REPL to test small functions interactively during development\n- Print intermediate constraint sets to understand what the inference algorithm is trying to solve\n- Implement `string_of_constraints` for debugging constraint generation\n\n#### F. Milestone Checkpoints\n\n**Milestone 1 Checkpoint - Type Representation:**\n- Run: `ocaml -i types.ml` should show clean type signatures\n- Test: Create values of each type variant, verify `string_of_type` output\n- Verify: `type_equal (TFun(TInt, TBool)) (TFun(TInt, TBool))` returns `true`\n- Check: `occurs_check \"x\" (TFun(TVar \"x\", TInt))` returns `true`\n\n**Milestone 2 Checkpoint - Basic Type Checking:**\n- Run: Compile and test basic expressions without type inference\n- Test: `1 + 2` should type-check successfully as `int`\n- Test: `1 + true` should produce a clear type error\n- Verify: Function calls with wrong argument types are rejected\n\n**Milestone 3 Checkpoint - Type Inference:**\n- Run: `let id = fun x -> x in id 42` should infer type `int`\n- Test: Unification algorithm handles complex constraint sets\n- Verify: `occurs_check` prevents infinite types during unification\n- Check: Multiple constraints from single expression are solved correctly\n\n**Milestone 4 Checkpoint - Polymorphism:**\n- Run: `let id = fun x -> x in (id 42, id true)` should infer `int * bool`\n- Test: Same polymorphic function works at different types\n- Verify: Let-polymorphism generalizes at let-bindings but not lambda-expressions\n- Check: Type schemes are instantiated with fresh variables at each use site\n\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of a type checker as a sophisticated contract verification system for a large corporation. Just as a legal department has specialized teams for contract review (lawyers), document management (paralegals), dispute resolution (mediators), and reporting (clerks), our type checker divides the complex task of type verification into specialized components. Each component has a clear responsibility, well-defined interfaces, and specific expertise, but they must work together seamlessly to transform raw source code into a verified, type-safe program.\n\nThe type checker architecture follows a **pipeline model** where each stage adds more semantic understanding to the program representation. We start with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that captures the structural syntax of the program, then progressively annotate it with type information, resolve type constraints, and finally produce either a fully type-checked AST or comprehensive error reports. This pipeline approach allows us to separate concerns cleanly while maintaining the ability to recover from errors and continue checking to find multiple issues in a single pass.\n\n![Type Checker System Architecture](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\nThe architecture is built around four core principles that guide component design and interaction patterns. **Separation of concerns** ensures that type representation logic is independent of inference algorithms, which are independent of error reporting mechanisms. **Composability** allows us to combine basic type checking with sophisticated inference without modifying existing components. **Error resilience** enables the system to continue checking after encountering type errors, maximizing the feedback provided to developers. **Extensibility** supports adding new type constructs (like algebraic data types) without requiring fundamental architectural changes.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The type checker's architecture mirrors the conceptual structure of type theory itself. Type representations correspond to the syntax of types, the type environment models variable binding and scoping rules, the inference engine implements type rules and constraint solving, and the error reporter translates formal type theory violations into human-readable feedback.\n\n### Component Responsibilities\n\nThe type checker system consists of four primary components, each with distinct responsibilities and clear boundaries. Understanding these boundaries is crucial because violations lead to tightly coupled code that becomes difficult to extend and debug.\n\n#### Type Representation System\n\nThe **Type Representation** component serves as the foundation layer, defining the abstract syntax and semantics of types themselves. Think of this component as the \"type theory textbook\" of our system—it contains all the formal definitions of what constitutes a valid type, how types relate to each other, and the fundamental operations we can perform on types.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Key Operations |\n|----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Type Definition | Algebraic data type defining the universe of possible types | `TInt`, `TBool`, `TString`, `TVar`, `TFun`, `TForall` constructors |\n| Type Equality | Structural comparison of types for compatibility checking | `type_equal(t1, t2)` determines if two types are identical |\n| Type Manipulation | Operations for constructing, deconstructing, and transforming types | `fresh_type_var()`, `string_of_type()`, substitution application |\n| Subtyping Rules | Formal rules defining when one type can be used in place of another | Coercion rules for function types and polymorphic instantiation |\n\nThis component deliberately avoids any knowledge of source code syntax, variable environments, or inference algorithms. It operates purely on type values and provides the primitive operations that higher-level components use to reason about type relationships. The type representation must be **immutable** to prevent subtle bugs during constraint solving, where the same type might be referenced from multiple constraints.\n\n> **Decision: Algebraic Data Types for Type Representation**\n> - **Context**: Need to represent the variety of types (primitives, functions, variables, polymorphic types) in a way that supports pattern matching and ensures exhaustive case handling\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1.

Algebraic data types with pattern matching\n> - **Decision**: Algebraic data types (`ty` type with constructors)\n> - **Rationale**: Pattern matching ensures exhaustive handling of type cases, prevents null pointer errors, and makes the type structure explicit. OCaml's type system guarantees we handle all type constructor cases.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables reliable constraint generation and unification algorithms, but requires functional programming comfort from implementers.\n\n#### Type Environment Manager\n\nThe **Type Environment** component functions as the \"symbol table with scoping awareness\" for our type checker. Just as a compiler's symbol table tracks variable declarations across nested scopes, the type environment maintains the mapping from variable names to their types, handling lexical scoping rules correctly.\n\n| Responsibility | Description | Implementation Strategy |\n|----------------|-------------|------------------------|\n| Variable Binding | Associates variable names with their declared or inferred types | Stack of scope frames, each containing name-to-type mappings |\n| Scope Management | Tracks entry/exit from lexical scopes (functions, blocks, let bindings) | Push/pop operations on scope stack during AST traversal |\n| Name Resolution | Looks up variable types following lexical scoping rules | Search scopes from innermost to outermost until name found |\n| Shadowing Handling | Correctly handles variable shadowing in nested scopes | Inner scope bindings hide outer scope bindings with same name |\n\nThe environment uses a **stack of frames** approach where each frame represents a single lexical scope. When entering a new scope (function body, let binding, block), we push a new frame. When exiting, we pop the frame, automatically restoring the previous scope's bindings. This approach naturally handles variable shadowing—inner scope variables with the same name as outer scope variables correctly hide the outer bindings.\n\n| Environment Operation | Input Parameters | Return Value | Side Effects |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| `TypeEnv.extend` | `name: string`, `ty: ty`, `env: TypeEnv.t` | Updated environment | Adds binding to innermost scope frame |\n| `TypeEnv.lookup` | `name: string`, `env: TypeEnv.t` | `ty option` | None (pure function) |\n| `TypeEnv.push_scope` | `env: TypeEnv.t` | Updated environment | Creates new empty scope frame |\n| `TypeEnv.pop_scope` | `env: TypeEnv.t` | Updated environment | Removes innermost scope frame |\n\n> **Decision: Immutable Environment with Scope Stack**\n> - **Context**: Need to track variable types across nested scopes while supporting backtracking during constraint generation\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Mutable hashtable with manual scope tracking\n>   2. Immutable environment with scope stack\n>   3. Persistent data structure with path copying\n> - **Decision**: Immutable environment with scope stack (`(string * ty) list list`)\n> - **Rationale**: Immutability prevents bugs during backtracking and parallel constraint generation. Stack structure directly models lexical scoping semantics.\n> - **Consequences**: Thread-safe and backtrack-friendly, but requires careful memory management for deeply nested scopes.\n\n#### Type Inference Engine\n\nThe **Type Inference Engine** represents the \"mathematical reasoning core\" of our system. Think of it as a theorem prover that takes type constraints (equations like \"the type of `x + 1` must equal the type of `x` unified with `TInt`\") and finds consistent solutions. This component implements the heart of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm.\n\n| Inference Phase | Input | Output | Algorithm |\n|----------------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Constraint Generation | Expression AST + Type Environment | Type variable + Constraint list | Recursive traversal generating equality constraints |\n| Constraint Solving | Constraint list | Substitution or Error | Robinson unification algorithm with occurs check |\n| Substitution Application | Substitution + Type | Concrete Type | Replace type variables with solved types |\n| Type Generalization | Inferred type + Environment | Type scheme | Abstract over free type variables (let-polymorphism) |\n\nThe inference engine operates in two distinct phases that must remain separate for correctness. **Constraint generation** walks the expression AST and collects type equality requirements without attempting to solve them. This separation is crucial because constraint generation may encounter expressions whose types depend on solving constraints from other expressions. **Constraint solving** then takes the complete set of constraints and finds a substitution (mapping from type variables to concrete types) that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.\n\n| Core Algorithm | Input Types | Return Type | Failure Conditions |\n|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `generate_constraints` | `expr`, `TypeEnv.t` | `ty * constraint_t list` | Undefined variable reference |\n| `unify` | `ty`, `ty` | `substitution` | Occurs check failure, incompatible types |\n| `apply_subst_to_type` | `substitution`, `ty` | `ty` | Never fails (total function) |\n| `compose_subst` | `substitution`, `substitution` | `substitution` | Never fails (total function) |\n\nThe **unification algorithm** lies at the heart of constraint solving. When asked to unify two types `t1` and `t2`, it returns a substitution `s` such that applying `s` to both `t1` and `t2` produces identical types. The algorithm handles several cases: identical types unify with the empty substitution, type variables unify by binding the variable to the other type (after occurs check), and structured types (like functions) unify by recursively unifying their components.\n\n> **Critical Design Insight**: The inference engine must be **deterministic** and **complete**. Deterministic means that given the same constraints, it always produces the same substitution (modulo variable renaming). Complete means that if a solution exists, the algorithm finds it. These properties ensure that type inference behaves predictably and doesn't miss valid programs.\n\n#### Error Reporting System\n\nThe **Error Reporter** serves as the \"translator\" between formal type theory violations and human-readable feedback. This component faces a unique challenge: it must present complex type mismatches, unification failures, and constraint violations in terms that make sense to programmers who may not understand type theory.\n\n| Error Category | Detection Point | Information Required | Example Message |\n|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Type Mismatch | Basic type checking | Expected type, actual type, source location | \"Expected `int` but got `string` at line 15\" |\n| Unification Failure | Constraint solving | Conflicting constraints, expression context | \"Cannot unify `int -> bool` with `string` in function call\" |\n| Occurs Check | Variable unification | Type variable, infinite type being constructed | \"Cannot construct infinite type: `a = a -> int`\" |\n| Undefined Variable | Environment lookup | Variable name, available names in scope | \"Undefined variable `x`. Did you mean `y`?\" |\n\nThe error reporter must maintain **source location information** throughout the type checking process. This requires threading location data from the original AST through constraint generation and into error messages. The reporter also implements **error recovery** strategies that allow type checking to continue after encountering errors, maximizing the number of issues found in a single pass.\n\n| Error Recovery Strategy | When Applied | Recovery Mechanism | Benefits |\n|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Type Variable Insertion | Unification failure | Replace failed type with fresh variable | Allows checking to continue with unknown type |\n| Environment Extension | Undefined variable | Add variable with fresh type variable | Prevents cascading undefined variable errors |\n| Constraint Skipping | Occurs check failure | Skip constraints involving infinite types | Continues with remaining solvable constraints |\n| Default Type Assignment | Missing type annotation | Assign reasonable default (e.g., `int` for numbers) | Provides feedback on missing annotations |\n\n> **Decision: Structured Error Types with Source Locations**\n> - **Context**: Need to provide helpful error messages that guide developers to fix type issues quickly\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. String-based error messages with manual formatting\n>   2. Structured error types with source locations and contextual information\n>   3. Exception-based error handling with stack unwinding\n> - **Decision**: Structured error types containing location, expected/actual types, and context\n> - **Rationale**: Structured errors enable consistent formatting, IDE integration, and programmatic error analysis. Source locations are essential for developer productivity.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires careful location tracking throughout pipeline, but enables high-quality error reporting and tooling integration.\n\n### Recommended File Structure\n\nThe module organization reflects our architectural principles by creating clear boundaries between components and establishing a logical dependency hierarchy. Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility and minimal dependencies on other modules.\n\n```\ntype-checker/\n├── src/\n│   ├── types/\n│   │   ├── types.ml                 ← Core type definitions and constructors\n│   │   ├── type_ops.ml              ← Type manipulation operations\n│   │   ├── substitution.ml          ← Substitution operations and composition\n│   │   └── types.mli                ← Public interface for type system\n│   │\n│   ├── environment/\n│   │   ├── type_env.ml              ← Type environment implementation\n│   │   ├── scoping.ml               ← Scope management utilities\n│   │   └── type_env.mli             ← Environment interface\n│   │\n│   ├── inference/\n│   │   ├── constraints.ml           ← Constraint generation from expressions\n│   │   ├── unification.ml           ← Robinson unification algorithm\n│   │   ├── inference_engine.ml      ← Main inference coordination\n│   │   └── inference.mli            ← Inference engine interface\n│   │\n│   ├── checking/\n│   │   ├── basic_checker.ml         ← Simple type checking without inference\n│   │   ├── expr_checker.ml          ← Expression type rules\n│   │   ├── stmt_checker.ml          ← Statement type checking\n│   │   └── checker.mli              ← Type checker interface\n│   │\n│   ├── polymorphism/\n│   │   ├── type_schemes.ml          ← Type scheme representation and operations\n│   │   ├── generalization.ml        ← Let-polymorphism generalization\n│   │   ├── instantiation.ml         ← Type scheme instantiation\n│   │   └── polymorphism.mli         ← Polymorphism interface\n│   │\n│   ├── errors/\n│   │   ├── type_errors.ml           ← Error type definitions\n│   │   ├── error_reporter.ml        ← Error message generation\n│   │   ├── source_locations.ml      ← Source position tracking\n│   │   └── errors.mli               ← Error handling interface\n│   │\n│   └── type_checker.ml              ← Main entry point and pipeline coordination\n│\n├── test/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   ├── test_types.ml            ← Unit tests for type operations\n│   │   ├── test_unification.ml      ← Unification algorithm tests\n│   │   ├── test_inference.ml        ← Inference engine tests\n│   │   └── test_polymorphism.ml     ← Polymorphism tests\n│   │\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   ├── test_programs/           ← Sample programs for integration testing\n│   │   └── test_type_checker.ml     ← End-to-end type checker tests\n│   │\n│   └── examples/\n│       ├── simple_expressions.ml    ← Basic type checking examples\n│       ├── inference_examples.ml    ← Type inference examples\n│       └── polymorphic_examples.ml  ← Polymorphic code examples\n│\n└── dune-project                     ← OCaml build configuration\n```\n\nThis file structure supports **incremental development** where you can implement and test each milestone independently. Milestone 1 focuses on the `types/` and `environment/` modules. Milestone 2 adds the `checking/` module for basic type checking. Milestone 3 implements the `inference/` module for constraint-based type inference. Milestone 4 adds the `polymorphism/` module for let-polymorphism support.\n\n#### Module Dependency Graph\n\nThe dependency relationships between modules form a directed acyclic graph that prevents circular dependencies and enables independent testing:\n\n| Module | Dependencies | Exports | Used By |\n|--------|--------------|---------|----------|\n| `types` | None (foundation layer) | Type definitions, equality, operations | All other modules |\n| `environment` | `types` | Environment operations, scope management | `checking`, `inference`, `polymorphism` |\n| `checking` | `types`, `environment` | Basic type checking functions | `type_checker` main entry point |\n| `inference` | `types`, `environment`, `checking` | Constraint generation and solving | `type_checker` main entry point |\n| `polymorphism` | `types`, `environment`, `inference` | Type schemes, generalization, instantiation | `type_checker` main entry point |\n| `errors` | `types` | Error types and reporting functions | `checking`, `inference`, `polymorphism` |\n\n#### Interface Design Philosophy\n\nEach module exposes a **minimal public interface** that hides implementation details while providing all necessary functionality for dependent modules. The `.mli` interface files serve as contracts that define exactly what operations are available and how they should be used.\n\nThe `types.mli` interface exposes type constructors, equality checking, and basic operations, but hides substitution implementation details. The `inference.mli` interface provides high-level functions like `infer_expression_type` but hides the constraint generation and unification algorithms. This **information hiding** principle allows us to change internal algorithms without affecting dependent code.\n\n> **Common Pitfall: Circular Module Dependencies**\n> \n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Importing inference in basic checker**\n> \n> Beginning implementers often create circular dependencies by making the basic checker import inference utilities, then having inference import the basic checker for some operations. This creates a compilation error in OCaml.\n> \n> **Why it's wrong**: Circular dependencies indicate poor separation of concerns and make testing and reasoning about code much harder.\n> \n> **How to fix**: Move shared utilities into a lower-level module that both can depend on, or redesign the interfaces to eliminate the circular dependency. The inference engine should build on top of basic checking, not the reverse.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe type checker implementation requires careful attention to module organization and dependency management. OCaml's strong module system helps enforce architectural boundaries, but requires understanding how to structure interfaces and implementations correctly.\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Type Representation | Algebraic data types with pattern matching | GADTs with type-level guarantees |\n| Environment Management | List of association lists for scope stack | Persistent hash maps with structural sharing |\n| Constraint Solving | Simple Robinson unification | Unification with constraint optimization |\n| Error Reporting | Printf-style string formatting | Structured errors with JSON serialization |\n| Testing Framework | OCaml built-in assertions | OUnit2 with property-based testing |\n| Build System | Simple `ocamlc` compilation | Dune with automatic dependency management |\n\n#### Recommended Project Structure\n\nStart with this minimal directory structure and expand as you implement each milestone:\n\n```ocaml\n(* dune-project file *)\n(lang dune 3.0)\n(package\n (name type_checker)\n (depends ocaml dune))\n```\n\n```ocaml\n(* src/dune file *)\n(executables\n (public_names type_checker)\n (name type_checker)\n (libraries str))\n\n(* test/dune file *) \n(test\n (name test_type_checker)\n (libraries type_checker))\n```\n\n#### Infrastructure Starter Code\n\nHere's the complete foundation you need to get started.

The signatures and TODO comments map directly to the algorithms described in the design sections:\n\n```ocaml\n(* src/inference/unification.ml - Skeleton for you to implement *)\ntype substitution = (string * ty) list\ntype constraint_t = ty * ty\n\nlet empty_subst = []\n\nlet apply_subst_to_type subst ty =\n  (* TODO 1: Implement recursive substitution application *)\n  (* TODO 2: For TVar, look up in substitution and apply recursively *)\n  (* TODO 3: For structured types, apply to components *)\n  (* TODO 4: Handle TForall by avoiding capture of quantified variables *)\n  failwith \"implement apply_subst_to_type\"\n\nlet compose_subst s1 s2 =\n  (* TODO 1: Apply s1 to all type values in s2 *)\n  (* TODO 2: Combine results, with s2 taking precedence for conflicts *)\n  (* TODO 3: Ensure result substitution is idempotent *)\n  failwith \"implement compose_subst\"\n\nlet unify t1 t2 =\n  (* TODO 1: Handle identical types -> return empty_subst *)\n  (* TODO 2: Handle type variables -> check occurs check, return binding *)  \n  (* TODO 3: Handle function types -> recursively unify components *)\n  (* TODO 4: Handle incompatible types -> raise unification error *)\n  (* TODO 5: Use substitution composition for recursive calls *)\n  failwith \"implement unify\"\n```\n\n```ocaml\n(* src/inference/constraints.ml - Skeleton for constraint generation *)\nlet generate_constraints expr env =\n  (* TODO 1: Pattern match on expression type *)\n  (* TODO 2: For literals -> return appropriate primitive type, no constraints *)\n  (* TODO 3: For variables -> lookup in environment, no constraints *)\n  (* TODO 4: For binary operators -> generate constraints for operands *)\n  (* TODO 5: For function calls -> constrain argument and result types *)\n  (* TODO 6: Collect all constraints from subexpressions *)\n  (* Return: (expression_type, constraint_list) *)\n  failwith \"implement generate_constraints\"\n```\n\n#### Language-Specific Hints\n\n**OCaml-Specific Implementation Tips:**\n- Use `List.assoc_opt` for safe dictionary lookup that returns `option` instead of raising exceptions\n- Pattern matching on algebraic data types provides exhaustiveness checking—the compiler warns if you miss cases\n- Use `ref` for the global type variable counter, but avoid mutable state elsewhere\n- The `failwith` function is useful for unimplemented code branches during development\n- Use `@@` operator for function application to avoid parentheses: `string_of_type @@ TFun (TInt, TBool)`\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Use `Result.t` types for functions that can fail: `unify : ty -> ty -> (substitution, string) result`\n- Use `option` types for optional lookups: `TypeEnv.lookup : string -> TypeEnv.t -> ty option`\n- Create custom exception types for different error categories: `exception UnificationError of ty * ty`\n\n**Performance Considerations:**\n- Type environments use lists for simplicity, but consider `Map.Make(String)` for programs with many variables\n- Fresh variable generation is globally sequential—consider parameterizing it if you need parallel type checking\n- Substitution application can be expensive for large types—consider memoization if performance becomes an issue\n\n#### Milestone Checkpoint\n\nAfter implementing the architecture and basic components, verify your system works correctly:\n\n**Checkpoint 1 (After Types and Environment):**\n```bash\n# Test basic type operations\nocaml\n# In OCaml REPL:\n#use \"src/types/types.ml\";;\n#use \"src/environment/type_env.ml\";;\nlet t1 = TFun(TInt, TBool);;\nlet t2 = TFun(TInt, TBool);;\ntype_equal t1 t2;;  (* Should return true *)\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Type equality works for all type constructors\n- Fresh variable generation produces unique names\n- Environment lookup finds variables in correct scopes\n- Environment shadowing hides outer scope variables correctly\n\n**Checkpoint 2 (After Basic Checking):**\n- Simple expressions type check correctly (literals, variables, operators)\n- Function calls verify argument types match parameters  \n- Type errors produce clear messages with source locations\n- Error recovery allows checking to continue after type mismatches\n\n**Signs something is wrong:**\n- **Type equality returns false for identical types**: Check pattern matching is exhaustive and handles all constructors\n- **Environment lookup fails for defined variables**: Verify scope stack is managed correctly during traversal\n- **Fresh variables have duplicate names**: Ensure variable counter is properly incremented\n- **Occurs check allows infinite types**: Review recursive type traversal in occurs check implementation\n\n\n## Data Model and Type Representations\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of the type system's data model as the **vocabulary** of a formal language for describing program structure. Just as human languages have nouns, verbs, and adjectives with specific grammatical rules, our type checker needs a precise vocabulary for describing what kinds of values exist (primitives like integers), how they can be combined (functions), and what relationships exist between them (type equality, compatibility). The data structures we define here become the foundational \"words\" that all other components of the type checker use to communicate about program structure.\n\nThis vocabulary must be rich enough to express everything from simple integer arithmetic to complex polymorphic functions, yet structured enough that we can write algorithms to manipulate it mechanically. The core insight is that **types are data** — they're not just annotations in the source code, but first-class values that our type checker program creates, stores, compares, and transforms throughout the checking process.\n\nThe data model serves three critical functions in our type checker architecture. First, it provides the **representational foundation** — the concrete data structures that encode abstract type-theoretic concepts like \"function from integers to booleans\" or \"polymorphic identity function.\" Second, it defines the **computational interface** — the operations we can perform on these representations, like checking equality, applying substitutions, or generating fresh type variables. Third, it establishes the **semantic relationships** — how different type representations relate to each other through subtyping, unification, and polymorphic instantiation.\n\n### Type AST Structure\n\nThe type abstract syntax tree forms the core vocabulary of our type system, representing every possible type that can exist in our language. Think of it as a **construction kit** where complex types are built from simpler components using well-defined combination rules. Just as mathematical expressions are built from numbers, variables, and operators, our type expressions are built from primitives, type variables, and type constructors.\n\nThe algebraic data type approach gives us **structural precision** — each type construct has exactly the components it needs, no more and no less. A function type contains exactly two sub-types (parameter and return), while a primitive type stands alone. This precision eliminates entire classes of representation errors and makes pattern matching exhaustive, ensuring our type checking algorithms handle every possible case.\n\n![Type AST Structure](./diagrams/type-ast-structure.svg)\n\n> **Decision: Algebraic Data Types for Type Representation**\n> - **Context**: We need to represent the full spectrum of types in our language, from simple primitives to complex polymorphic functions, with operations like equality checking, substitution, and pretty printing.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Class hierarchy with inheritance (OOP approach)\n>   2. Tagged unions/algebraic data types (functional approach)  \n>   3. String-based type representations with parsing\n> - **Decision**: Algebraic data types with exhaustive pattern matching\n> - **Rationale**: ADTs provide compile-time guarantees that all type cases are handled in every function, eliminate null pointer errors, and make the type structure explicit in the data definition rather than scattered across class methods.\n> - **Consequences**: Pattern matching becomes the primary way to inspect types, leading to more robust code but requiring functional programming familiarity.\n\n| Type Construct | OCaml Representation | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `TInt` | `TInt` | Primitive integer type representing whole numbers |\n| `TBool` | `TBool` | Primitive boolean type for true/false values |\n| `TString` | `TString` | Primitive string type for text values |\n| `TVar` | `TVar of string` | Type variable for inference and polymorphism, identified by name |\n| `TFun` | `TFun of ty * ty` | Function type with parameter type and return type |\n| `TForall` | `TForall of string list * ty` | Polymorphic type with quantified variables and body type |\n\nThe `ty` algebraic data type captures the essential structure of our type system. Primitive types (`TInt`, `TBool`, `TString`) represent the atomic values in our language — these are the \"ground truth\" types that need no further decomposition. The `TVar` constructor represents type variables, which serve dual purposes: during inference, they act as unknowns to be solved, and in polymorphic types, they represent parameters that can be instantiated with concrete types.\n\nFunction types (`TFun`) encode the fundamental computational abstraction of our language. The structure `TFun(param_ty, return_ty)` captures that functions are transformations from input types to output types. This binary structure naturally extends to multi-parameter functions through currying — a function taking two parameters becomes `TFun(param1, TFun(param2, return_ty))`.\n\n> The key insight for function types is that `TFun` is right-associative by convention. The type `int -> bool -> string` parses as `TFun(TInt, TFun(TBool, TString))`, representing a function that takes an integer and returns a function from booleans to strings.\n\nPolymorphic types (`TForall`) represent the most sophisticated construct in our type system. The structure `TForall(vars, body)` explicitly quantifies over type variables, making polymorphism first-class in our representation. For example, the polymorphic identity function has type `TForall([\"a\"], TFun(TVar(\"a\"), TVar(\"a\")))`, clearly showing that it works for any type `a`.\n\nThe fundamental operations on types center around **structural traversal** and **variable manipulation**. Type equality requires deep structural comparison, checking that corresponding components have identical structure. Pretty printing involves recursive descent through the type structure, adding parentheses and formatting to produce readable representations. Most importantly, substitution operations replace type variables with concrete types throughout the structure, enabling the unification algorithm that drives type inference.\n\n> **Decision: String-Based Type Variable Identity**\n> - **Context**: Type variables need unique identity for unification and substitution operations.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. String names with manual uniqueness management\n>   2. Integer IDs with separate name tracking\n>   3. Reference-based identity with mutable cells\n> - **Decision**: String names with systematic fresh name generation\n> - **Rationale**: String names provide readable debugging output and integrate naturally with source-level type annotations, while fresh name generation ensures uniqueness without complex ID management.\n> - **Consequences**: Type variable names become part of the semantic identity, requiring careful handling during substitution and alpha-equivalence checking.\n\n| Core Type Operation | Signature | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `type_equal(t1: ty, t2: ty): bool` | Two types → Boolean | Structural equality check for identical type structure |\n| `string_of_type(ty: ty): string` | Type → String | Pretty printer producing readable type representations |\n| `fresh_type_var(): ty` | Unit → Type | Generates unique type variable for inference |\n| `occurs_check(var: string, ty: ty): bool` | Variable name, Type → Boolean | Detects if variable occurs in type structure |\n\nThe `occurs_check` function deserves special attention as it prevents the creation of infinite types during unification. When unifying a type variable `X` with a type `T`, the occurs check ensures that `X` does not appear anywhere within `T`. Without this check, we could generate paradoxical types like `X = X -> int`, leading to infinite structures that break the type checker's termination guarantees.\n\n### Type Environment and Scoping\n\nThe type environment serves as the **memory** of our type checker, maintaining the association between variable names and their types as we traverse the program's scope structure. Think of it as a **stack of symbol tables** where each scope level can shadow bindings from outer scopes, but inner scopes can still access outer bindings when no shadowing occurs.\n\nThe environment's scoping behavior mirrors the lexical structure of the source program. When we enter a new scope (function body, let expression, or block statement), we push a new binding layer onto the environment. When we exit the scope, we pop that layer, automatically restoring the previous bindings. This stack discipline ensures that variable lookups follow the **inside-out** principle — we search from the innermost scope outward until we find a binding.\n\n![Type Environment Scoping](./diagrams/type-environment-scoping.svg)\n\nThe `TypeEnv.t` type represents this layered structure as a list of binding lists, where each inner list represents one scope level. The head of the outer list is always the current (innermost) scope, making extension and lookup operations efficient. This representation naturally handles scope nesting without requiring complex tree structures or explicit parent pointers.\n\n> **Decision: List-of-Lists Environment Representation**\n> - **Context**: Need efficient scope management with frequent extend/lookup operations and clean scope entry/exit.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Single flat map with scope-qualified names\n>   2. Tree structure with explicit parent pointers  \n>   3. List of binding lists (stack of scopes)\n> - **Decision**: List of binding lists with stack discipline\n> - **Rationale**: Provides O(1) scope entry/exit, natural shadowing semantics, and simple implementation without memory management complexity.\n> - **Consequences**: Variable lookup becomes O(n) in scope depth, but typical programs have shallow nesting, and the simplicity benefits outweigh performance concerns.\n\n| TypeEnv Data Structure | Field | Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `TypeEnv.t` | Scope stack | `(string * ty) list list` | Stack of scopes, each containing name-to-type bindings |\n\n| TypeEnv Operations | Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `TypeEnv.empty` | None | `TypeEnv.t` | Creates empty environment with single empty scope |\n| `TypeEnv.extend` | `name: string, ty: ty, env: TypeEnv.t` | `TypeEnv.t` | Adds binding to innermost scope, shadowing outer bindings |\n| `TypeEnv.lookup` | `name: string, env: TypeEnv.t` | `ty option` | Searches scopes inside-out, returns first matching binding |\n| `TypeEnv.enter_scope` | `env: TypeEnv.t` | `TypeEnv.t` | Pushes new empty scope onto environment stack |\n| `TypeEnv.exit_scope` | `env: TypeEnv.t` | `TypeEnv.t` | Pops innermost scope, restoring previous bindings |\n\nThe scoping protocol follows a disciplined approach where scope changes are explicit and symmetric. Every `enter_scope` operation must be paired with a corresponding `exit_scope`, typically using the language's automatic resource management (like OCaml's `let ... in` expressions or explicit scope management in recursive functions). This discipline prevents scope leakage where inner scope bindings accidentally persist beyond their intended lifetime.\n\nEnvironment threading becomes critical during recursive type checking. As we recursively check sub-expressions, we pass the current environment down the call tree, and each recursive call may extend the environment with new bindings (like lambda parameters or let-bound variables). The key insight is that environment changes are **local** — extensions made in one branch of the recursion don't affect other branches, maintaining proper lexical scoping.\n\n> The environment extension protocol ensures that `extend` operations always add to the innermost scope. This means that `let x = 5 in let x = true in x` correctly binds the inner `x` to boolean type, shadowing the outer integer binding without destroying it.\n\nConsider a concrete example of environment evolution during type checking:\n\n1. Start with empty environment: `[[]]` (one empty scope)\n2. Enter function scope: `[[], []]` (new empty scope pushed)\n3. Add parameter binding: `[[(\"x\", TInt)], []]` (parameter added to inner scope)  \n4. Check function body with extended environment\n5. Exit function scope: `[[]]` (inner scope popped, parameter binding removed)\n\nThe scoping semantics handle several important edge cases. Variable shadowing occurs naturally when inner scopes contain bindings with the same name as outer scopes — lookup finds the inner binding first and stops searching. Mutual recursion requires careful handling where multiple definitions extend the environment simultaneously before any individual definition is checked. Forward references within the same scope level need special treatment to avoid lookup failures during recursive checking.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Environment Mutation During Checking**\nMany implementations incorrectly modify the environment in place during type checking, leading to scope pollution where inner scope bindings persist after exiting their scope. This breaks lexical scoping and can cause later expressions to see variables that should be out of scope. Always use functional environment updates that create new environment values rather than modifying existing ones.\n\n### Constraints and Substitutions\n\nThe constraint and substitution system forms the **computational engine** of type inference, transforming the declarative problem of \"what types make this program correct?\" into the algorithmic problem of \"what type variable assignments satisfy these equality constraints?\" Think of constraints as a system of **type equations** that we collect during program traversal, and substitutions as the **solution** that makes all equations simultaneously true.\n\nThis approach separates type inference into two distinct phases: **constraint generation** walks the program structure and emits type equality requirements, while **constraint solving** uses unification to find type assignments that satisfy all requirements. This separation provides modularity — we can modify the constraint generation rules without changing the solver, or optimize the solver without affecting constraint generation.\n\nThe constraint representation captures the fundamental operation of type inference: asserting that two types must be equal. Each constraint `(ty1, ty2)` represents the requirement that `ty1` and `ty2` have identical structure after applying the solution substitution. The constraint list accumulates these requirements as we traverse program constructs, building up a system of equations that characterizes all valid typing assignments.\n\n> **Decision: Constraint-Based Type Inference Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Need to infer types for expressions without explicit annotations while handling complex interactions between multiple type variables.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Direct recursive type assignment during AST traversal\n>   2. Constraint generation followed by batch solving\n>   3. Incremental unification during traversal\n> - **Decision**: Separate constraint generation and batch solving phases\n> - **Rationale**: Separates concerns cleanly, allows global optimization of constraint solving, and handles complex constraint interactions that would be difficult to resolve incrementally.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires two passes over the program structure but provides more robust handling of polymorphic and recursive types.\n\n| Constraint System Types | Name | Structure | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `constraint_t` | Type equality constraint | `ty * ty` | Asserts two types must have identical structure |\n| `substitution` | Variable assignments | `(string * ty) list` | Maps type variable names to concrete types |\n| `var_id` | Variable identifier | `int` | Unique integer for generating fresh type variables |\n\n| Constraint Operations | Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `generate_constraints` | `expr, env: TypeEnv.t` | `ty * constraint_t list` | Infers expression type and collects equality constraints |\n| `unify` | `t1: ty, t2: ty` | `substitution` | Finds most general unifier making two types equal |\n| `apply_subst_to_type` | `subst: substitution, ty: ty` | `ty` | Replaces type variables with assigned types |\n| `compose_subst` | `s1: substitution, s2: substitution` | `substitution` | Combines two substitutions into equivalent single substitution |\n\nThe substitution data structure represents a **partial function** from type variable names to types, encoding the solution to our constraint system. A substitution `[(\"a\", TInt); (\"b\", TBool)]` means \"replace type variable `a` with `TInt` and type variable `b` with `TBool` everywhere.\" The key property is that applying a substitution to both sides of any constraint should make them syntactically equal.\n\nSubstitution application transforms types by recursively replacing type variables with their assigned values. The operation `apply_subst_to_type(subst, ty)` performs a systematic traversal of the type structure, substituting variables when found and recursively processing sub-components. This operation must handle the occurs check implicitly — if a substitution would create an infinite type, the unification process should have already detected and rejected it.\n\n> The critical insight for substitution composition is that `compose_subst(s1, s2)` creates a substitution equivalent to applying `s2` first, then applying `s1` to the result. This ordering matches function composition and ensures that later substitutions can refine earlier ones.\n\nConstraint generation follows the structure of the expression being typed, emitting equality requirements as it encounters type relationships. For a function call `f(arg)`, we generate constraints that:\n\n1. The function `f` has type `TFun(arg_ty, result_ty)` for fresh type variables\n2. The argument `arg` has type `arg_ty` (recursively determined)\n3. The overall call expression has type `result_ty`\n\nThis process builds a constraint system where solving for the type variables determines the types of all sub-expressions consistently.\n\nThe unification algorithm serves as the **constraint solver**, finding type variable assignments that simultaneously satisfy all constraints. The algorithm works by case analysis on the structure of the types being unified:\n\n1. **Variable-Type unification**: If unifying `TVar(x)` with type `T`, check the occurs check, then bind `x` to `T`\n2. **Identical primitives**: `TInt` unifies with `TInt`, `TBool` with `TBool`, etc.\n3. **Function types**: `TFun(p1, r1)` unifies with `TFun(p2, r2)` by recursively unifying parameters and return types\n4. **Failure cases**: Different primitives, function vs. primitive, occurs check violations\n\nThe occurs check prevents infinite types by ensuring that when binding variable `x` to type `T`, the variable `x` does not occur anywhere within `T`. Without this check, we could create paradoxical assignments like `x = x -> int`, leading to infinite type expressions that break the type checker's termination properties.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Incorrect Substitution Composition Order**\nMany implementations get the order wrong in `compose_subst(s1, s2)`, creating substitutions that don't correspond to the intended sequence of applications. The correct composition applies `s2` first, then `s1`, matching the mathematical convention for function composition. Always test with non-commuting substitutions to verify the order is correct.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Missing Occurs Check in Unification**\nOmitting the occurs check allows the creation of infinite types that can cause the type checker to loop indefinitely during substitution application. Always check that a type variable doesn't occur in the type it's being bound to, and fail unification if it does. This check is essential for termination guarantees.\n\nThe constraint solving process transforms a collection of type equations into a concrete type assignment. Consider unifying the constraints from `let f = fun x -> x + 1`:\n\n1. Generate constraints: `f : 'a -> 'b`, `x : 'a`, `(+) : int -> int -> int`, `1 : int`\n2. From `x + 1`, constrain `'a = int` and `'b = int`\n3. Solve to get substitution `[('a, int); ('b, int)]`\n4. Apply substitution: `f : int -> int`\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that type inference finds the most general solution that satisfies all constraints, or reports a clear error when no solution exists.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe data model implementation requires careful attention to both correctness and performance, as these data structures form the foundation for all type checker operations. The algebraic data type representation should leverage the language's pattern matching capabilities for exhaustive case handling, while the environment and constraint systems need efficient implementations of their core operations.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Approach | Advanced Approach |\n|---|---|---|\n| Type Representation | Basic algebraic data types | Optimized with hash-consing for type equality |\n| Type Environment | List of association lists | Persistent hash maps with path copying |\n| Constraint Solving | Basic unification algorithm | Union-find with path compression |\n| Pretty Printing | Simple recursive descent | Precedence-aware with minimal parentheses |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n```\ntype-checker/\n  src/\n    types.ml                 ← Core type representation (ty, type_scheme)\n    typeenv.ml              ← Environment operations (extend, lookup, scoping)\n    constraints.ml          ← Constraint types and substitution operations  \n    unify.ml               ← Unification algorithm and occurs check\n    pretty.ml              ← Pretty printing for types and constraints\n  test/\n    test_types.ml          ← Type equality and operations tests\n    test_typeenv.ml        ← Environment scoping and lookup tests\n    test_unify.ml          ← Unification algorithm and edge case tests\n```\n\n**Core Type System Implementation:**\n\n```ocaml\n(* types.ml -

Our type checker needs precise representations of \"integer,\" \"function from A to B,\" and \"generic type T\" before it can verify that code follows the rules. This foundational layer defines the algebraic data structures that represent all possible types in our language, along with the fundamental operations for comparing types and managing type variables.\n\nThe type representation system sits at the core of every type checker operation. When we parse `let add = fun x y -> x + y`, we need to represent the type `'a -> 'b -> 'c` somewhere in memory, with clear distinctions between the type variables `'a`, `'b`, and `'c`. When we later discover through inference that `'a` and `'b` must both be `int` and `'c` must also be `int`, we need precise operations to substitute those concrete types for the variables. Without a solid type representation foundation, the sophisticated algorithms of constraint generation and unification have nothing concrete to operate on.\n\n![Type AST Structure](./diagrams/type-ast-structure.svg)\n\n### Core Type System Design\n\nThe heart of our type representation lies in defining an **algebraic data type** that can express every possible type in our language. This type system needs to handle three fundamental categories: primitive types that are built into the language, composite types like functions that combine simpler types, and meta-types like type variables that represent unknown types during inference.\n\nOur `ty` type serves as the universal representation for all types in the system. Each variant captures a different category of type with the minimum information needed to distinguish it from other types and perform operations like equality checking and substitution.\n\n| Type Variant | Structure | Purpose | Example |\n|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| `TInt` | No parameters | Represents integer primitive type | `42`, `x + 1` |\n| `TBool` | No parameters | Represents boolean primitive type | `true`, `x > 0` |\n| `TString` | No parameters | Represents string primitive type | `\"hello\"`, `name` |\n| `TVar of string` | Variable name | Represents unknown type during inference | `'a`, `'result` |\n| `TFun of ty * ty` | Parameter type * Return type | Represents function types | `int -> bool`, `'a -> 'a` |\n| `TForall of string list * ty` | Quantified variables * Body type | Represents polymorphic types | `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a` |\n\n> **Decision: Algebraic Data Type for Type Representation**\n> - **Context**: Need a precise way to represent all possible types that can appear in our language, support pattern matching for type operations, and enable recursive type structures like `('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b`.\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Class hierarchy with inheritance (OOP approach)\n>   2. Tagged union/enum with associated data (ADT approach)\n>   3. String-based type representations with parsing\n> - **Decision**: Algebraic data type with pattern matching\n> - **Rationale**: ADTs provide exhaustive pattern matching that catches missing cases at compile time, enable recursive type definitions naturally, and make type transformations like substitution straightforward to implement. Class hierarchies require visitor patterns for operations, while string representations are error-prone and inefficient.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables clean pattern matching in all type operations, but requires functional programming concepts. Makes adding new type variants require updating all pattern matches.\n\nThe `TVar` variant deserves special attention because it represents the **unknown types** that drive our inference engine. Think of type variables as placeholders in a mathematical equation — when we see `let f = fun x -> x + 1`, we initially represent the type of `x` as some type variable `'a`, then later solve the constraint that `'a` must support the `+` operator with `int`, concluding that `'a = int`.\n\nThe `TFun` variant uses a **curried representation** where multi-parameter functions are represented as nested single-parameter functions. A function `int -> int -> bool` is represented as `TFun(TInt, TFun(TInt, TBool))`. This design choice simplifies partial application and type inference by treating all functions uniformly as single-argument functions that may return other functions.\n\n| Function Syntax | Type Representation | Curried Form |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| `fun x -> x + 1` | `TFun(TInt, TInt)` | `int -> int` |\n| `fun x y -> x + y` | `TFun(TInt, TFun(TInt, TInt))` | `int -> (int -> int)` |\n| `fun f x -> f x` | `TFun(TFun(TVar \"a\", TVar \"b\"), TFun(TVar \"a\", TVar \"b\"))` | `('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'b)` |\n\n### Type Equality and Compatibility\n\nType equality forms the foundation for all type checking operations, but the notion of \"equality\" is more nuanced than it initially appears. Consider the question: are the types `'a -> 'a` and `'b -> 'b` equal? They have the same structure but use different variable names. Our type equality system must handle these subtleties while remaining efficient for the thousands of type comparisons performed during checking.\n\n**Structural type equality** compares types based on their shape and content rather than nominal declarations. Two function types are equal if their parameter types are equal and their return types are equal, regardless of where or how they were declared. This approach aligns naturally with type inference, where we derive types from usage patterns rather than explicit declarations.\n\n> **Decision: Structural Type Equality**\n> - **Context**: Need to determine when two types can be considered identical for the purposes of assignment compatibility, function application, and constraint solving.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Structural equality: types are equal if they have the same structure\n>   2. Nominal equality: types are equal only if they were declared with the same name\n>   3. Hybrid approach: structural for inferred types, nominal for declared types\n> - **Decision**: Pure structural equality for all types\n> - **Rationale**: Structural equality aligns with type inference where types emerge from usage rather than declarations. It simplifies the type checker implementation by avoiding complex name resolution. Nominal typing would require maintaining type declaration information throughout inference.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables flexible type inference and composition, but prevents some abstraction benefits of nominal typing. Users cannot create distinct types with identical structure.\n\nThe `type_equal` function implements deep structural comparison through recursive descent on type structures. For primitive types, equality is trivial — `TInt` equals only `TInt`. For composite types like functions, we recursively check that corresponding subcomponents are equal.\n\n| Type Comparison | Algorithm | Example |\n|-----------------|-----------|---------|\n| Primitives | Direct variant comparison | `type_equal(TInt, TInt) = true` |\n| Functions | Recursive parameter and return comparison | `type_equal(TFun(TInt, TBool), TFun(TInt, TBool)) = true` |\n| Variables | String name comparison | `type_equal(TVar \"a\", TVar \"a\") = true` |\n| Polymorphic | Variable list and body comparison | `type_equal(TForall([\"a\"], TVar \"a\"), TForall([\"b\"], TVar \"b\")) = false` |\n\nThe complexity arises with **type variables and alpha-equivalence**. The types `'a -> 'a` and `'b -> 'b` represent the same concept (a function that returns the same type as its input) but use different variable names. However, for our basic type equality, we treat these as different types. Alpha-equivalence handling becomes important during type scheme instantiation and unification, but not for basic structural equality.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Confusing Type Equality with Type Compatibility**\nMany implementations conflate type equality with type compatibility or subtyping. Type equality asks \"are these exactly the same type?\" while compatibility asks \"can I use this type where that type is expected?\" For example, if we had subtyping, `Student` might be compatible with `Person` but they wouldn't be equal. Keep these concepts distinct — equality is used for constraint solving, while compatibility is used for assignment and argument checking.\n\n**Type compatibility** extends beyond equality to handle relationships like subtyping, where one type can be safely used in place of another. In our basic type system, compatibility typically matches equality, but the infrastructure prepares us for potential extensions like numeric type coercion (`int` compatible with `float`) or subtyping relationships.\n\nThe `type_compatible` function provides the interface for these checks. Initially, it may simply delegate to `type_equal`, but it establishes the architectural pattern for more sophisticated compatibility rules:\n\n| Compatibility Check | Rule | Example |\n|---------------------|------|---------|\n| Identity | Any type is compatible with itself | `int` compatible with `int` |\n| Function contravariance | Parameters contravariant, returns covariant | If `A <: B`, then `(B -> C) <: (A -> C)` |\n| Variable instantiation | Type variables compatible with their instantiated types | `'a` compatible with `int` after substitution |\n\n### Type Variable Management\n\nType variables serve as the **unknowns in the type inference equation** — they represent types that we haven't yet determined but will solve for through constraint collection and unification. Think of them like variables in algebra: when you write `2x + 3 = 7`, the `x` is unknown initially, but through algebraic manipulation you determine `x = 2`. Similarly, when we see `let f = fun x -> x + 1`, the type of `x` starts as an unknown type variable `'a`, but constraint solving determines `'a = int`.\n\nThe type variable management system must handle three critical responsibilities: generating fresh variables that don't conflict with existing names, detecting infinite type constructions that would make the type system unsound, and tracking variable substitutions as we solve constraints.\n\n**Fresh variable generation** ensures that each unknown type gets a unique identifier that won't accidentally unify with other unknowns. Consider the expression `let f = fun x -> fun y -> x + y`. The types of `x` and `y` are initially unknown, so we need two distinct type variables, say `'a` and `'b`. If we accidentally reused the same variable name for both, we'd incorrectly constrain them to have identical types before we've analyzed their usage.\n\nThe `fresh_type_var` function maintains a global counter that increments with each call, generating names like `'_0`, `'_1`, `'_2`, etc. The underscore prefix distinguishes compiler-generated variables from user-written generic type parameters, avoiding conflicts in languages that allow explicit type variables.\n\n| Variable Generation Call | Generated Type | Purpose |\n|-------------------------|----------------|---------|\n| `fresh_type_var()` | `TVar \"_0\"` | Type of first unknown parameter |\n| `fresh_type_var()` | `TVar \"_1\"` | Type of second unknown parameter |\n| `fresh_type_var()` | `TVar \"_2\"` | Return type of unknown function |\n\n```ocaml\n(* Global counter for fresh variable generation *)\nlet var_counter = ref 0\n\nlet fresh_type_var () =\n  let id = !var_counter in\n  incr var_counter;\n  TVar (\"_\" ^ string_of_int id)\n```\n\n> **Decision: Global Counter for Fresh Variables**\n> - **Context**: Need to generate unique type variable names during inference to avoid accidental unification of distinct unknowns.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Global mutable counter with underscore prefix\n>   2. UUID-based generation for guaranteed uniqueness\n>   3. Threading unique supply through all inference functions\n> - **Decision**: Global mutable counter with simple numeric suffixes\n> - **Rationale**: Simple to implement and understand. Performance is excellent for typical program sizes. Underscore prefix avoids conflicts with user-defined type variables. Global state is acceptable since type checking is typically single-threaded.\n> - **Consequences**: Requires mutable state but provides clean interface. Variable names are predictable and debuggable. Not thread-safe, but type checking is typically sequential.\n\n**The occurs check** prevents the creation of infinite types during unification, which would break the type system's decidability. Consider attempting to unify the type variable `'a` with the type `'a -> int`. If we allowed this, we'd get the infinite type `'a = 'a -> int = ('a -> int) -> int = (('a -> int) -> int) -> int = ...`, which has no finite representation.\n\nThe occurs check examines whether a type variable appears within a type expression before allowing unification. If variable `'a` occurs anywhere within type `T`, then unifying `'a` with `T` would create circularity. The check performs a recursive traversal of the type structure, looking for the variable name at any depth.\n\n| Unification Attempt | Occurs Check | Result |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------|\n| `'a ~ int` | `'a` does not occur in `int` | Safe, allow unification |\n| `'a ~ 'a -> int` | `'a` occurs in `'a -> int` | Infinite type, reject |\n| `'a ~ ('b -> 'a) -> 'c` | `'a` occurs in `('b -> 'a) -> 'c` | Infinite type, reject |\n| `'a ~ 'b -> 'c` | `'a` does not occur in `'b -> 'c` | Safe, allow unification |\n\nThe `occurs_check` function implements this traversal through pattern matching on type structure:\n\n```ocaml\nlet rec occurs_check var_name ty =\n  match ty with\n  | TInt | TBool | TString -> false\n  | TVar name -> String.equal var_name name\n  | TFun (param_ty, return_ty) -> \n      occurs_check var_name param_ty || occurs_check var_name return_ty\n  | TForall (vars, body_ty) ->\n      not (List.mem var_name vars) && occurs_check var_name body_ty\n```\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting the Occurs Check**\nA common mistake is implementing unification without the occurs check, which allows infinite types to be created. This leads to non-terminating type inference or stack overflow errors when trying to print types. The symptom is often mysterious infinite loops during unification. Always perform the occurs check before binding a type variable to a type that might contain it.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Occurs Check in Polymorphic Types**\nWhen checking occurs in `TForall` types, remember that bound variables (those in the quantifier list) shadow free variables with the same name. The type `forall 'a. 'a -> 'b` contains the free variable `'b` but not `'a`, because `'a` is bound by the quantifier. The occurs check should only worry about free occurrences.\n\n**Type variable substitution** applies the solutions found by unification back to type expressions, replacing type variables with their resolved concrete types. Think of this as plugging values back into algebraic equations — once you've determined that `x = 2`, you substitute `2` for every occurrence of `x` in your expressions.\n\nThe substitution data structure maps type variable names to their replacement types. Applying a substitution walks through a type expression and replaces every occurrence of each variable with its corresponding replacement.\n\n| Original Type | Substitution | Result After Substitution |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| `'a -> 'b` | `[('a, int); ('b, bool)]` | `int -> bool` |\n| `('a -> 'a) -> 'b` | `[('a, string)]` | `(string -> string) -> 'b` |\n| `TForall(['a'], 'a -> 'b)` | `[('b, int)]` | `TForall(['a'], 'a -> int)` |\n\nThe `apply_subst_to_type` function performs this replacement through recursive descent, but must handle bound variables correctly in polymorphic types. When substituting within a `TForall` type, variables bound by the quantifier should not be replaced — they're local to that type scheme.\n\n**Substitution composition** combines multiple substitutions into a single substitution that has the same effect as applying them in sequence. If you have substitution S1 that maps `'a` to `'b`, and substitution S2 that maps `'b` to `int`, then the composed substitution should map `'a` directly to `int`.\n\nThe mathematical definition is: `compose_subst(S1, S2) = {(var, apply_subst_to_type(S2, ty)) | (var, ty) ∈ S1} ∪ S2`. This ensures that variables in S1's range get further substituted by S2, while preserving S2's bindings for variables not in S1.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mutable Type Variables**\nSome implementations make type variables mutable references that can be updated in place during unification. While this can be efficient, it creates subtle bugs when type variables are shared between different contexts or when backtracking is needed. Prefer immutable type representations with explicit substitution application.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: String-Based Type Variable Identity**\nUsing string equality to compare type variables works for basic cases but breaks down with alpha-equivalence and variable capture. The types `'a -> 'a` and `'b -> 'b` should be considered equivalent in many contexts, but string comparison treats them as different. Consider whether you need structural alpha-equivalence or nominal variable identity.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting Variable Scoping in Polymorphic Types**\nThe type `forall 'a. 'a -> 'b` contains a bound variable `'a` and a free variable `'b`. Operations like substitution and the occurs check must respect this scoping — bound variables should not be replaced or considered free. Track which variables are bound at each nesting level.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Type Pretty Printing Without Precedence**\nWhen printing function types, `int -> int -> bool` should be printed as `int -> (int -> bool)` or use left-associativity conventions. Without proper precedence handling, complex types become unreadable. Consider how users will read your type error messages.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inefficient Type Equality**\nNaive structural type equality can be exponentially slow on large types with shared substructure. Consider memoizing equality results or using hash-consing to make equal types share representation. Profile your type checker on large codebases to identify performance bottlenecks.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe type representation system requires careful attention to data structure design and fundamental algorithms that will be used throughout the type checker.

Our type checker examines each expression and statement in the program, ensuring that all operations are performed on compatible types according to the language's type rules. Unlike inference (which we'll add later), basic type checking assumes that most types are explicitly declared and focuses on verification rather than deduction.\n\n![Type Checking Pipeline Flow](./diagrams/type-checking-pipeline.svg)\n\nThe basic type checking engine operates on the principle of **bidirectional type flow**. For each expression, we either know what type we expect (checking mode) or we need to determine what type it produces (synthesis mode). This dual approach allows us to provide precise error messages while maintaining algorithmic simplicity. The engine traverses the AST recursively, maintaining a type environment that tracks the types of all variables in scope.\n\nThe architecture separates three distinct responsibilities: **expression type synthesis** (determining what type an expression produces), **statement type checking** (verifying that statements respect type constraints), and **error reporting** (providing actionable feedback when type rules are violated). This separation allows each component to focus on its specific concerns while maintaining clean interfaces between them.\n\n> **Decision: Separate Expression and Statement Type Checking**\n> - **Context**: Programming languages distinguish between expressions (which produce values) and statements (which perform actions), and they have different type checking requirements\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Unified checking function for all AST nodes, 2) Separate functions for expressions vs statements, 3) Visitor pattern with type-specific methods\n> - **Decision**: Separate functions with dedicated logic for expressions and statements\n> - **Rationale**: Expressions always produce a type that can be synthesized, while statements often don't produce values and need compatibility checking instead. This separation makes the type rules clearer and error messages more specific.\n> - **Consequences**: Cleaner code organization and more precise error reporting, but requires careful coordination between expression and statement checking phases\n\n| Checking Mode | Purpose | Input | Output | Example |\n|---------------|---------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Expression Synthesis | Determine type produced | Expression AST | Inferred type | `42` → `TInt` |\n| Expression Checking | Verify expected type | Expression AST + Expected type | Success/failure | `true` against `TBool` |\n| Statement Checking | Verify type constraints | Statement AST | Success/failure | Assignment compatibility |\n| Declaration Processing | Add new bindings | Declaration AST | Updated environment | `let x: int = 5` |\n\nThe type checking engine maintains **lexical scoping** through a hierarchical type environment that mirrors the program's block structure. When entering a new scope (function body, block statement, etc.), we extend the environment with new bindings. When exiting the scope, we restore the previous environment state. This ensures that variable lookups respect the program's scoping rules and that inner declarations shadow outer ones appropriately.\n\n![Type Environment Scoping](./diagrams/type-environment-scoping.svg)\n\n### Expression Type Rules\n\nExpression type checking forms the foundation of our type system, implementing the formal type rules that govern how expressions combine to form well-typed programs. Think of expression type rules as **grammatical rules for a mathematical language** — just as mathematical notation has rules about what operations can be applied to what kinds of objects (you can't take the square root of a matrix without additional structure), our type system defines what operations are valid on what types.\n\nEach expression type rule follows a standard format: given the types of the sub-expressions and the operation being performed, determine either the resulting type (for synthesis) or whether the expression is well-typed for an expected type (for checking). These rules are compositional — the type of a complex expression depends only on the types of its immediate sub-expressions, not on their internal structure.\n\n**Literal Expression Rules**\n\nLiteral expressions are the base case of our type system — they have known types that can be determined directly from their syntactic form. These rules are straightforward but establish the foundation for all other type checking.\n\n| Literal Type | Syntax Form | Synthesized Type | Type Rule |\n|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|\n| Integer | `42`, `-17`, `0` | `TInt` | All integer literals have type `TInt` |\n| Boolean | `true`, `false` | `TBool` | All boolean literals have type `TBool` |\n| String | `\"hello\"`, `\"\"` | `TString` | All string literals have type `TString` |\n| Unit | `()` | `TUnit` | Unit literal has type `TUnit` |\n\nThe literal type checking algorithm is deterministic and never fails — every well-formed literal in our language has a corresponding type. However, the type checker must handle malformed literals (detected during parsing) by reporting appropriate errors rather than crashing.\n\n**Variable Reference Rules**\n\nVariable references require environment lookup to determine their types. The type rule states that a variable reference `x` has type `T` if and only if the variable `x` is bound to type `T` in the current type environment. This implements lexical scoping — we search environments from innermost to outermost scope.\n\nThe variable lookup process follows these steps:\n\n1. **Environment Search**: Starting from the innermost scope, search each environment level for a binding of the variable name\n2. **Binding Verification**: If found, return the associated type from the binding\n3. **Scope Traversal**: If not found in current scope, move to the next outer scope and repeat\n4. **Error Reporting**: If no binding is found in any scope, report an unbound variable error\n\n| Variable State | Environment Binding | Type Result | Error Condition |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Bound in current scope | `x: TInt` in innermost env | `TInt` | None |\n| Bound in outer scope | `x: TBool` in parent env | `TBool` | None |\n| Shadowed variable | Inner: `x: TInt`, Outer: `x: TBool` | `TInt` | None (inner shadows outer) |\n| Unbound variable | No binding found | Type error | \"Unbound variable: x\" |\n\n> The critical insight for variable lookup is that **shadowing is a feature, not a bug**. When an inner scope declares a variable with the same name as an outer scope, the inner declaration should hide the outer one completely. This requires searching environments in inside-out order and stopping at the first match.\n\n**Binary Operator Rules**\n\nBinary operators implement the most complex expression type rules because they must check the compatibility of two operand types and determine the result type based on the specific operator. Different operators have different type requirements — arithmetic operators require numeric types, comparison operators accept multiple types but return boolean, and logical operators work only on booleans.\n\nThe binary operator type checking algorithm follows this pattern:\n\n1. **Operand Type Synthesis**: Recursively determine the types of both operands\n2. **Operator Lookup**: Determine what type constraints the operator imposes\n3. **Compatibility Check**: Verify that both operand types satisfy the operator's requirements\n4. **Result Type Determination**: Based on the operator and operand types, determine the result type\n\n| Operator Category | Operators | Operand Types Required | Result Type | Example |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | Both `TInt` | `TInt` | `5 + 3` → `TInt` |\n| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | Both same type | `TBool` | `5 < 3` → `TBool` |\n| Logical | `&&`, `\\|\\|` | Both `TBool` | `TBool` | `true && false` → `TBool` |\n| String Operations | `++` (concatenation) | Both `TString` | `TString` | `\"hello\" ++ \"world\"` → `TString` |\n\nThe comparison operators deserve special attention because they implement **polymorphic equality** — they can compare values of any type as long as both operands have the same type. This requires the type checker to verify type equality between operands rather than checking against a fixed type.\n\n> **Decision: Polymorphic vs Monomorphic Operators**\n> - **Context**: Comparison operators like `==` could either work only on specific types or accept any type as long as both sides match\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Monomorphic — only allow comparison on primitive types, 2) Polymorphic — allow comparison on any equal types, 3) Type class based — require explicit equality implementation\n> - **Decision**: Polymorphic comparison with structural equality\n> - **Rationale**: Provides more flexibility for users while maintaining type safety. Most values in our language support structural comparison naturally.\n> - **Consequences**: Simplifies user code and reduces type annotations, but requires more complex type checking logic for equality operators\n\n**Function Call Rules**\n\nFunction call type checking implements the **function application rule** from type theory — if we have a function of type `T1 → T2` and an argument of type `T1`, then the application produces a result of type `T2`. This rule ensures that function calls respect the contracts established by function type signatures.\n\nThe function call type checking algorithm performs these validations:\n\n1. **Function Type Synthesis**: Determine the type of the function expression being called\n2. **Function Type Verification**: Ensure the function type is actually a function type `TFun(param_ty, return_ty)`\n3. **Argument Type Synthesis**: Determine the type of each argument expression\n4. **Arity Check**: Verify that the number of arguments matches the function's parameter count\n5. **Parameter Compatibility**: Check that each argument type is compatible with the corresponding parameter type\n6. **Return Type Synthesis**: The call expression has the function's return type\n\n| Validation Step | Success Condition | Failure Condition | Error Message |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Function type check | Function has type `TFun(T1, T2)` | Function has non-function type | \"Cannot call non-function of type T\" |\n| Arity check | Argument count = Parameter count | Mismatched counts | \"Expected N arguments, got M\" |\n| Parameter compatibility | Each arg type matches param type | Type mismatch | \"Expected T1, got T2 for parameter N\" |\n\nFor functions with multiple parameters, our type representation uses **curried function types** — a function taking two parameters has type `TFun(T1, TFun(T2, T3))` rather than a special multi-parameter type. This simplifies the type system and enables partial application, but requires careful handling during type checking to provide good error messages for multi-parameter calls.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Confusing Function Types and Function Values**\n\nA common mistake is trying to call something that has a function type in the source code but doesn't actually represent a callable function at runtime. For example, a variable declared as `let f: int -> int` but never assigned a value should produce a \"unbound variable\" error at the variable lookup stage, not a \"cannot call\" error at the function call stage. Always check that the function expression is well-typed before validating the call.\n\n### Statement Type Checking\n\nStatement type checking differs fundamentally from expression type checking because statements perform actions rather than producing values. Think of statement type checking as **auditing a series of commands** rather than evaluating mathematical expressions. While expressions ask \"what type does this produce?\", statements ask \"is this action permitted given the current type constraints?\"\n\nMost statements don't have types themselves, but they impose type constraints on their constituent expressions. A variable assignment requires that the right-hand side expression's type is compatible with the variable's declared type. A conditional statement requires that the condition expression has boolean type. These constraints ensure that the program's runtime behavior will respect the static type declarations.\n\n![Error Handling and Recovery Flow](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\n**Variable Declaration Type Checking**\n\nVariable declarations establish new bindings in the type environment, connecting variable names to their types. The type checking process must handle both explicit type annotations (`let x: int = 42`) and cases where the type should be inferred from the initializer (`let x = 42`). In basic type checking mode, we primarily handle explicitly annotated declarations.\n\nThe variable declaration type checking algorithm:\n\n1. **Type Annotation Processing**: If present, parse and validate the explicit type annotation\n2. **Initializer Type Synthesis**: Determine the type of the initialization expression\n3. **Type Compatibility Check**: Verify that the initializer type is compatible with the declared type (if annotated)\n4. **Type Assignment**: If no explicit annotation, use the initializer type as the variable's type\n5. **Environment Extension**: Add the new variable binding to the current scope's environment\n6. **Shadowing Check**: Optionally warn if the new variable shadows an existing binding\n\n| Declaration Form | Type Source | Compatibility Check | Environment Update |\n|------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| `let x: int = 42` | Explicit annotation `int` | Check `42: int` ✓ | Add `x: TInt` |\n| `let x: int = true` | Explicit annotation `int` | Check `true: int` ✗ | Type error |\n| `let x = 42` | Initializer synthesis | No check needed | Add `x: TInt` |\n| `let x: int` | Explicit annotation | No initializer | Add `x: TInt` |\n\nThe compatibility check between declared type and initializer type uses the same type equality function used throughout the type checker. In basic type checking, we require exact type matches — `TInt` is only compatible with `TInt`. Later, when we add subtyping, we'll relax this to allow more flexible assignments.\n\n> **Decision: Exact Type Equality vs Subtyping**\n> - **Context**: When checking assignment compatibility, we could require exact type matches or allow subtype relationships\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Exact equality only, 2) Structural subtyping, 3) Nominal subtyping with explicit inheritance\n> - **Decision**: Start with exact equality, add subtyping in later milestones\n> - **Rationale**: Exact equality is simpler to implement and reason about. It provides a solid foundation for understanding type checking before introducing the complexity of subtype relationships.\n> - **Consequences**: More restrictive type system initially, but clearer error messages and simpler implementation. Users must be more explicit about type conversions.\n\n**Assignment Statement Type Checking**\n\nAssignment statements update existing variable bindings with new values. Unlike declarations, assignments cannot change a variable's type — they must respect the type established when the variable was declared. This maintains type consistency throughout the program and enables optimizations based on stable type information.\n\nThe assignment type checking process:\n\n1. **Target Variable Lookup**: Find the variable in the type environment to determine its declared type\n2. **Value Expression Synthesis**: Determine the type of the right-hand side expression\n3. **Assignment Compatibility**: Verify that the value type is compatible with the variable type\n4. **Mutability Check**: Ensure the variable is declared as mutable (if the language distinguishes mutable/immutable)\n\n| Assignment Scenario | Variable Type | Value Type | Compatibility Result |\n|---------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|\n| `x = 42` where `x: int` | `TInt` | `TInt` | ✓ Compatible |\n| `x = true` where `x: int` | `TInt` | `TBool` | ✗ Type mismatch |\n| `y = 42` where `y` unbound | Error | `TInt` | ✗ Unbound variable |\n| `x = f()` where `f: () -> int` | `TInt` | `TInt` | ✓ Compatible |\n\nThe assignment compatibility check is crucial for maintaining type safety. If we allowed assignments that change a variable's type, then other parts of the program that depend on the variable's declared type could fail at runtime. By enforcing type consistency, we guarantee that a variable declared as `int` will always contain an integer value.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Mutable vs Immutable Variable Confusion**\n\nMany functional languages distinguish between mutable variables (which can be reassigned) and immutable bindings (which cannot). Assignment type checking should verify mutability in addition to type compatibility. A common mistake is allowing assignment to immutable bindings just because the types match. Always check the variable's mutability status before performing assignment compatibility checks.\n\n**Conditional Statement Type Checking**\n\nConditional statements (if-then-else) impose type constraints on their condition expression and recursively type-check their branch statements. The key insight is that conditional statements create **branching control flow** where different execution paths may have different type environments.\n\nThe conditional type checking algorithm:\n\n1. **Condition Type Check**: Verify that the condition expression has type `TBool`\n2. **Then Branch Scoping**: Create a new scope for the then branch and type-check all statements\n3. **Else Branch Scoping**: Create a new scope for the else branch (if present) and type-check all statements\n4. **Environment Restoration**: Restore the original environment after checking both branches\n5. **Return Type Analysis**: If branches contain return statements, verify they have compatible return types\n\n| Conditional Component | Type Requirement | Error Condition | Scope Behavior |\n|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Condition expression | Must be `TBool` | Non-boolean condition | Evaluated in current scope |\n| Then branch | Statements must type-check | Any statement type error | New nested scope |\n| Else branch | Statements must type-check | Any statement type error | New nested scope |\n| Overall statement | No return type | Branches have incompatible returns | No type produced |\n\nThe scoping behavior of conditional statements is important for maintaining proper variable visibility. Variables declared inside a conditional branch should not be visible outside that branch, even if the branch is guaranteed to execute. This prevents the type checker from making assumptions about runtime execution paths.\n\n**Function Declaration Type Checking**\n\nFunction declarations are among the most complex statements to type-check because they introduce **recursive environments** where the function being defined may appear in its own body. Additionally, function declarations must establish parameter bindings, check return type consistency, and handle the interaction between declared and inferred return types.\n\nThe function declaration type checking process:\n\n1. **Parameter Processing**: Add parameter bindings to a new function scope environment\n2. **Return Type Annotation**: Process explicit return type annotation if present\n3. **Recursive Binding**: Add the function name to its own environment for recursive calls\n4. **Body Type Checking**: Type-check all statements in the function body within the extended environment\n5. **Return Type Verification**: Ensure all return statements produce types compatible with the declared return type\n6. **Function Type Construction**: Build the complete function type from parameter and return types\n7. **Global Environment Update**: Add the function binding to the module-level environment\n\n| Function Component | Type Processing | Environment Impact | Validation Required |\n|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Parameter list | `(x: int, y: bool)` → `[TInt, TBool]` | Add to function scope | Parameter name uniqueness |\n| Return annotation | `: string` → `TString` | Used for body validation | Must be valid type |\n| Function body | Statement sequence | Function scope active | All statements must type-check |\n| Return statements | `return expr` | Current scope | `expr` type matches return type |\n\nThe recursive binding aspect requires careful handling to avoid infinite loops during type checking. When processing a recursive function call within the function body, we must use the function type being constructed rather than attempting to re-derive it. This ensures that recursive calls are type-checked against the function's declared signature rather than creating circular dependencies.\n\n> The key insight for function declaration type checking is **environment layering**. The function creates multiple nested scopes: the module scope (where the function name will be bound), the function scope (where parameters are bound), and potentially additional scopes for nested blocks within the function body. Each scope layer must be managed correctly to ensure proper variable resolution.\n\n### Type Error Reporting\n\nType error reporting transforms the technical results of type checking into actionable feedback for programmers. Think of error reporting as **translating between two languages** — converting the formal language of type theory (where errors are constraint violations) into the natural language of human communication (where errors explain what went wrong and how to fix it).\n\nEffective type error reporting requires more than simply stating that a type check failed. It must provide context about what the type checker expected, what it actually found, where in the source code the error occurred, and suggestions for how to resolve the mismatch. The best error messages help programmers build better mental models of the type system while fixing immediate problems.\n\n**Error Message Structure**\n\nWell-structured error messages follow a consistent format that presents information in order of decreasing specificity. The message should start with the immediate problem, provide context about why it's a problem, show the specific location where it occurred, and offer concrete suggestions for resolution.\n\n| Message Component | Purpose | Content | Example |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Error Classification | Immediate problem identification | Type of error in standardized format | \"Type mismatch in assignment\" |\n| Expected vs Actual | Specific type incompatibility | What was expected and what was found | \"Expected: int, Found: bool\" |\n| Source Location | Precise error position | File, line, column, and code context | \"at line 15, column 8: `x = true`\" |\n| Contextual Information | Why this matters | Surrounding code or declaration info | \"Variable x declared as int at line 10\" |\n| Suggested Fixes | Actionable remediation | Specific changes that would resolve error | \"Change to `x = 42` or redeclare x as bool\" |\n\nThe error classification helps programmers quickly understand the category of problem they're dealing with. Common classifications include \"type mismatch\", \"unbound variable\", \"wrong arity\", \"non-function call\", and \"invalid operation\". These categories map directly to the different type checking rules and help users understand which aspect of the type system they've violated.\n\n**Source Location Tracking**\n\nAccurate source location reporting requires the type checker to maintain **position information** throughout the type checking process. Every AST node should carry information about its location in the original source code, and this information must be preserved and propagated through all type checking operations.\n\nThe location tracking system maintains several pieces of information:\n\n1. **File Information**: Which source file contains the problematic code\n2. **Line and Column Numbers**: Precise position within the file using 1-based indexing\n3. **Span Information**: Start and end positions for multi-character constructs\n4. **Context Lines**: Surrounding source code lines for better error visualization\n5. **AST Node Mapping**: Connection between error locations and specific AST constructs\n\n| Location Component | Data Structure | Usage | Example |\n|--------------------|----------------|-------|---------|\n| File path | `string` | Error message header | \"In file: src/main.ml\" |\n| Line number | `int` | Error positioning | \"Line 42:\" |\n| Column number | `int` | Precise character position | \"Column 15:\" |\n| Source span | `(int * int) * (int * int)` | Multi-token highlighting | \"Lines 10-15, columns 5-20\" |\n| Context buffer | `string list` | Code visualization | Show 3 lines before/after error |\n\nWhen reporting errors, the system should highlight the specific tokens or expressions involved in the type error. For binary operators, this might highlight both operands and the operator. For function calls, it might highlight the function name and the problematic arguments. This visual emphasis helps programmers quickly locate the source of type problems.\n\n> **Decision: Precise vs Approximate Source Positions**\n> - **Context**: Source location tracking can be implemented with exact character positions or approximate line-level positions\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Line-only tracking with minimal overhead, 2) Precise character positions with full span information, 3) Token-level positions with AST node mapping\n> - **Decision**: Precise character positions with span information\n> - **Rationale**: Modern programmers expect IDE-quality error reporting with exact positioning. The additional implementation complexity pays off in user experience, especially for complex expressions where approximate positions are confusing.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex AST representation and error tracking, but significantly better user experience and integration with development tools\n\n**Context-Aware Error Messages**\n\nContext-aware error messages go beyond reporting the immediate type mismatch to explain **why the types are incompatible** and **what the programmer likely intended**. This requires the error reporting system to understand common programming patterns and frequent mistakes.\n\nThe context analysis system examines several factors when generating error messages:\n\n1. **Declaration Context**: How and where relevant variables were declared\n2. **Usage Patterns**: How the problematic expression fits into the larger code structure\n3. **Common Mistakes**: Whether the error matches known anti-patterns or misconceptions\n4. **Similar Names**: Whether there are similar variable names that might have been intended\n5. **Type Relationships**: Whether the types are \"close\" in some sense (like `int` and `float`)\n\n| Context Type | Analysis Performed | Enhanced Error Information | Example Enhancement |\n|--------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| Variable shadowing | Check for same name in outer scopes | \"Variable x shadows outer declaration\" | Suggest using different names |\n| Similar names | Edit distance on variable names | \"Did you mean variable y?\" | Offer spelling corrections |\n| Common conversions | Known type conversion patterns | \"Use int_of_bool to convert\" | Suggest explicit conversions |\n| Scope confusion | Variable declared in unreachable scope | \"Variable x not in scope here\" | Explain scoping rules |\n\nFor function call errors, context-aware messages can provide especially valuable feedback. Instead of simply reporting \"expected 2 arguments, got 3\", the error message can show the function's declaration, explain which arguments are problematic, and suggest corrections. This helps programmers understand not just what went wrong, but how to fix it.\n\n**Error Recovery and Continuation**\n\nError recovery allows the type checker to continue processing after encountering a type error, enabling it to **find multiple errors in a single pass** rather than stopping at the first problem. This significantly improves the development experience by reducing the number of compile-fix-compile cycles required to resolve type issues.\n\nThe error recovery strategy depends on the type of error encountered:\n\n1. **Expression Errors**: Replace the problematic expression with a placeholder type and continue\n2. **Variable Errors**: Add a placeholder binding for unbound variables and continue\n3. **Statement Errors**: Skip the problematic statement and continue with the next statement\n4. **Declaration Errors**: Use a default type for problematic declarations and continue\n5. **Function Errors**: Use placeholder types for function signatures and continue checking the body\n\n| Error Category | Recovery Strategy | Placeholder Choice | Impact on Later Checking |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Expression type mismatch | Use expected type as placeholder | Expected type from context | Prevents cascading errors |\n| Unbound variable | Create binding with fresh type variable | Fresh type variable | Enables partial checking |\n| Wrong function arity | Assume correct arity with placeholder args | Unit type for missing args | Allows return type checking |\n| Invalid operation | Replace with well-typed equivalent | Result type of similar operation | Maintains type flow |\n\nError recovery must be careful not to generate **cascading errors** — situations where one error causes many additional spurious errors. The placeholder types chosen during recovery should be selected to minimize disruption to subsequent type checking phases. For example, when an expression has the wrong type, using the expected type as a placeholder often prevents errors in surrounding code that depends on that type.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Over-Aggressive Error Recovery**\n\nWhile error recovery is valuable, over-aggressive recovery can hide real errors or generate confusing error messages. If the recovery strategy makes too many assumptions about what the programmer intended, the subsequent error messages may not reflect the actual problems in the code. Balance error recovery with accuracy — recover enough to find additional errors, but not so much that the error messages become misleading.\n\n**Error Message Formatting and Presentation**\n\nError message formatting significantly impacts how effectively programmers can understand and resolve type errors. The presentation should use consistent formatting, clear visual hierarchy, and appropriate use of color and highlighting to guide attention to the most important information.\n\nModern error message formatting follows several principles:\n\n1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use formatting to emphasize the most important information first\n2. **Consistent Structure**: Follow the same format pattern for similar types of errors\n3. **Code Context**: Show relevant source code with highlighting and annotations\n4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Present basic information first, with details available on request\n5. **Actionable Language**: Use imperative mood and specific suggestions rather than passive descriptions\n\n| Formatting Element | Purpose | Implementation | Example |\n|--------------------|---------|----------------|---------|\n| Error header | Quick problem identification | Bold, colored text | `error: type mismatch in assignment` |\n| Location info | Source positioning | File:line:col format | `--> src/main.ml:15:8` |\n| Code display | Visual context | Syntax highlighting + annotations | Show source with error markers |\n| Type information | Specific type details | Monospace font, clear labels | `expected: int, found: bool` |\n| Suggestions | Remediation guidance | Bulleted list, specific actions | `• change true to 42` |\n\nThe code context display should show enough surrounding lines to understand the error's context while avoiding information overload. Typically, showing 2-3 lines before and after the error location provides good context. The error location itself should be clearly marked with visual indicators like underlines, arrows, or highlighting.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe basic type checking engine requires careful coordination between expression synthesis, statement checking, and error reporting. The implementation should prioritize clarity and correctness over performance optimization — type checking is typically not a performance bottleneck compared to parsing or code generation.\n\n**Technology Recommendations**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|----------------|\n| Error Reporting | String concatenation with manual formatting | Structured error types with pretty-printing |\n| Source Locations | Line/column pairs in AST nodes | Full span information with source maps |\n| Type Environment | List of association lists for scopes | Hash tables with scope chain pointers |\n| Error Recovery | Stop at first error | Continue with placeholder types |\n\n**Recommended File Structure**\n\n```\nsrc/\n  type_checker/\n    type_check.ml           ← main type checking entry point  \n    expression_check.ml     ← expression type synthesis/checking\n    statement_check.ml      ← statement type checking\n    type_error.ml          ← error types and reporting\n    type_env.ml           ← type environment operations\n    test/\n      test_expressions.ml   ← expression type rule tests\n      test_statements.ml    ← statement type checking tests  \n      test_errors.ml       ← error message tests\n```\n\n**Core Type Checking Infrastructure**\n\n```ocaml\n(* Type checking result with error accumulation *)\ntype check_result = \n  | Success of ty\n  | Error of type_error list\n\ntype type_error = {\n  error_kind: error_kind;\n  location: source_location;\n  expected_type: ty option;\n  actual_type: ty option;\n  message: string;\n  suggestions: string list;\n}\n\ntype error_kind = \n  | TypeMismatch \n  | UnboundVariable of string\n  | WrongArity of int * int  (* expected, actual *)\n  | NonFunctionCall\n  | InvalidOperation of string\n\ntype source_location = {\n  file: string;\n  line: int;\n  column: int;\n  end_line: int;\n  end_column: int;\n}\n\n(* Helper functions for error reporting -

The type inference engine examines an expression without explicit type annotations and uses contextual clues (literals, operators, function calls) to deduce what types must be involved. Just as a detective generates hypotheses (\"if the suspect was here at 9 PM, then they must have...\") and then tests these hypotheses against all available evidence, our type inference engine generates **type constraints** (\"if this variable is used in addition, it must be numeric\") and then uses **unification** to find a consistent assignment of types that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.\n\nThe power of type inference lies in its ability to provide the safety guarantees of static typing while reducing the annotation burden on programmers. Instead of requiring every variable and function to be explicitly typed, the inference engine can often deduce the intended types from usage patterns, making the language feel more dynamic while maintaining compile-time verification.\n\n![Type Checking Pipeline Flow](./diagrams/type-checking-pipeline.svg)\n\nType inference operates through a three-phase process that mirrors how human reasoning works when understanding partially specified information. First, **constraint generation** systematically examines every expression and statement to collect requirements about what types must be related (\"this function parameter must have the same type as this argument\"). Second, **unification** attempts to solve this system of constraints by finding type assignments that make all the relationships consistent. Finally, **substitution application** propagates the solved types back through the program, replacing type variables with their inferred concrete types.\n\n### Constraint Generation\n\nThink of constraint generation as a **systematic evidence collection process** — like how a forensic team methodically catalogs every piece of evidence at a crime scene, noting relationships and dependencies without immediately jumping to conclusions. The constraint generation phase walks through every expression in the program and records type relationships that must hold for the program to be well-typed, without immediately trying to solve these relationships.\n\nThe constraint generation process operates by **synthesizing** fresh type variables for unknown types and then establishing equality constraints based on language semantics. When we encounter an expression like `x + y`, we don't immediately insist that `x` and `y` must be integers — instead, we generate constraints that capture the requirements: `typeof(x) = typeof(y)` and `typeof(x + y) = typeof(x)`. This allows the system to handle cases where the addition might involve integers, floats, or even custom numeric types with operator overloading.\n\n> **Decision: Constraint-Based vs Direct Inference**\n> - **Context**: We need to choose between immediately inferring types during traversal vs collecting constraints first\n> - **Options Considered**: Direct inference (assign types immediately), constraint collection then solving, hybrid approaches\n> - **Decision**: Pure constraint-based approach with separate solving phase\n> - **Rationale**: Constraint collection allows handling mutually recursive definitions, provides better error messages by seeing all constraints together, and supports more sophisticated inference algorithms like let-polymorphism\n> - **Consequences**: Requires more memory to store constraints and an additional unification phase, but enables more powerful inference and clearer separation of concerns\n\nThe constraint generation algorithm maintains several critical data structures during traversal. The **type environment** tracks known type bindings for variables in scope. A **fresh variable generator** creates unique type variables for unknown types. The **constraint accumulator** collects type equality requirements as they're discovered. Most importantly, each expression synthesis returns both an **expression type** (often a fresh type variable) and a **list of constraints** that must be satisfied for that type assignment to be valid.\n\n| Constraint Generation Component | Purpose | Data Maintained |\n|--------------------------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Type Environment | Maps variable names to their types in current scope | List of (variable_name, type) bindings |\n| Fresh Variable Generator | Creates unique type variables for unknowns | Current variable counter |\n| Constraint Accumulator | Collects type equality requirements | List of (type1, type2) constraint pairs |\n| Expression Type Synthesizer | Determines type produced by each expression | Returns (expression_type, constraint_list) |\n\nThe heart of constraint generation lies in the **expression synthesis rules** that define how different syntactic constructs generate type constraints. For literal expressions, synthesis is straightforward — integer literals generate no constraints and return `TInt`, string literals return `TString`. For more complex expressions, synthesis becomes a process of constraint propagation.\n\n**Expression Synthesis Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Literal Synthesis**: For literal values (integers, booleans, strings), return the corresponding primitive type with an empty constraint list, since literals have known, fixed types.\n\n2. **Variable Reference Synthesis**: Look up the variable name in the current type environment. If found, return the bound type with no additional constraints. If not found, generate an `UnboundVariable` error.\n\n3. **Binary Operation Synthesis**: Generate fresh type variables for both operands and the result. Create constraints that both operands have the same type and that the result type matches the operand type (for arithmetic) or is boolean (for comparisons).\n\n4. **Function Call Synthesis**: Generate a fresh type variable for the return type. Look up the function type from the environment. If it's a function type `TFun(param_ty, return_ty)`, create a constraint that the argument type equals `param_ty` and return `return_ty`. If it's a type variable, create a constraint that it equals `TFun(arg_ty, fresh_return_ty)`.\n\n5. **Conditional Expression Synthesis**: Generate constraints that the condition has type `TBool` and that both branches have the same type. Return the branch type (which may be a fresh type variable if both branches have unknown types).\n\n6. **Let Expression Synthesis**: This is the most complex case. First, synthesize the type of the bound expression and collect its constraints. Then, extend the environment with the binding and synthesize the body type. The key insight is that let-expressions are where **generalization** can occur — if the bound expression's type contains type variables that don't appear elsewhere, they can be generalized into a polymorphic type scheme.\n\n![Constraint Solving Sequence](./diagrams/constraint-solving-sequence.svg)\n\nConsider a concrete example of constraint generation for the expression `let f = fun x -> x + 1 in f 42`. The synthesis process works as follows:\n\nThe function `fun x -> x + 1` generates a fresh type variable `'a` for parameter `x`. The addition `x + 1` creates constraints `'a = TInt` (since `1` is an integer literal) and the function type becomes `TFun(TInt, TInt)`. The binding `f = fun x -> x + 1` adds `f : TFun(TInt, TInt)` to the environment. The call `f 42` generates a constraint that `TFun(TInt, TInt) = TFun(TInt, 'b)` for some fresh return type `'b`, which unifies to give `'b = TInt`.\n\n| Expression | Fresh Variables Generated | Constraints Created | Result Type |\n|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| `1` | none | none | `TInt` |\n| `x` (parameter) | `'a` | none | `'a` |\n| `x + 1` | `'b` (result) | `'a = TInt`, `'b = TInt` | `'b` |\n| `fun x -> x + 1` | none | none | `TFun('a, 'b)` with constraints |\n| `42` | none | none | `TInt` |\n| `f 42` | `'c` (result) | `TFun(TInt, TInt) = TFun(TInt, 'c)` | `'c` |\n\nThe power of constraint generation becomes apparent when dealing with **mutually recursive functions** or **forward references**. Traditional direct inference struggles with these cases because it tries to determine types before having complete information. Constraint-based inference handles these naturally — it generates constraints for all function definitions simultaneously, then solves the entire constraint system to find a consistent type assignment.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Premature Constraint Solving**\nMany implementations try to solve constraints immediately as they're generated, which breaks down for recursive definitions. For example, if function `f` calls function `g` and `g` calls `f`, immediate solving fails because neither function's type is known when processing the other. Instead, generate all constraints first, then solve them as a complete system. The constraint solver can handle circular dependencies that would confuse eager type assignment.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting to Thread Type Environment**\nConstraint generation must carefully maintain the type environment as it traverses nested scopes. A common mistake is using a global environment that gets corrupted by inner scopes. Instead, each recursive call should receive a properly extended environment, and environment changes should not escape their scope. For let-expressions, extend the environment for the body but not for subsequent expressions at the same level.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Generating Fresh Variables for Each Expression**\nReusing type variables across different expressions can create spurious constraints. Each unknown type should get its own fresh variable. For example, if two separate function calls both need fresh return types, they should get different type variables (`'a` and `'b`) even if they might end up with the same concrete type. The unification phase will merge them if necessary.\n\n### Unification Algorithm\n\nThink of unification as a **diplomatic negotiation process** where multiple parties (type constraints) each have requirements, and the goal is to find a compromise (type substitution) that satisfies everyone's needs simultaneously. Just as skilled diplomats look for creative solutions that address underlying interests rather than stated positions, the unification algorithm searches for type assignments that satisfy the structural requirements of all constraints, even when they initially appear contradictory.\n\n![Unification Algorithm Process](./diagrams/unification-algorithm.svg)\n\nUnification implements the **Robinson unification algorithm**, which is both **sound** (never produces incorrect unifiers) and **complete** (always finds the most general unifier when one exists). The algorithm works by systematically decomposing complex type constraints into simpler ones, binding type variables to concrete types when possible, and detecting inconsistencies that indicate type errors.\n\n> **Decision: Robinson vs Alternative Unification Algorithms**\n> - **Context**: Need to choose a unification algorithm that balances correctness, completeness, and implementation complexity\n> - **Options Considered**: Robinson unification, higher-order unification, nominal unification with subtyping\n> - **Decision**: Classical Robinson unification with occurs check\n> - **Rationale**: Robinson unification is well-understood, proven correct, handles structural type equality elegantly, and has optimal complexity for our constraint domain\n> - **Consequences**: Limited to structural type equality (no subtyping), requires explicit occurs check implementation, but provides strong theoretical foundation and predictable behavior\n\nThe unification algorithm maintains a **substitution** as its primary data structure — a mapping from type variables to concrete types that represents the \"solution\" discovered so far. As the algorithm processes each constraint, it extends the substitution with new variable bindings or detects inconsistencies that indicate unsatisfiable constraints.\n\n**Unification Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialize Empty Substitution**: Start with an empty mapping from type variables to types, representing that no variables have been bound yet.\n\n2. **Process Each Constraint**: For each constraint `(t1, t2)` in the constraint list, apply the current substitution to both types to get their most up-to-date forms, then attempt to unify them.\n\n3. **Variable-Type Unification**: If one side is a type variable and the other is any type, perform the occurs check (ensure the variable doesn't appear in the type), then bind the variable to the type in the substitution.\n\n4. **Identical Type Unification**: If both sides are identical primitive types (`TInt = TInt`), the constraint is already satisfied and requires no additional binding.\n\n5. **Function Type Decomposition**: If both sides are function types `TFun(p1, r1)` and `TFun(p2, r2)`, decompose this into two smaller constraints: `p1 = p2` and `r1 = r2`.\n\n6. **Composition and Propagation**: When adding a new variable binding to the substitution, apply this binding to all existing bindings to maintain consistency (substitution composition).\n\n7. **Failure Detection**: If none of the above rules apply (e.g., trying to unify `TInt` with `TBool`), the constraint system is unsatisfiable and unification fails.\n\nThe **occurs check** is a critical component that prevents the algorithm from creating infinite types. Without this check, a constraint like `'a = TFun('a, TInt)` would create an infinitely nested function type `TFun(TFun(TFun(..., TInt), TInt), TInt)`. The occurs check detects when a type variable appears within the type it's being bound to and rejects such bindings as invalid.\n\n| Unification Case | Example Constraint | Action Taken | Result |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|\n| Variable-Concrete | `'a = TInt` | Bind `'a` to `TInt` | Substitution extended |\n| Variable-Variable | `'a = 'b` | Bind `'a` to `'b` (or vice versa) | Substitution extended |\n| Identical Concrete | `TInt = TInt` | No action needed | Constraint satisfied |\n| Function Decomposition | `TFun('a, 'b) = TFun(TInt, 'c)` | Generate `'a = TInt`, `'b = 'c` | New constraints |\n| Type Mismatch | `TInt = TBool` | Cannot unify | Unification failure |\n| Occurs Check Failure | `'a = TFun('a, TInt)` | Infinite type detected | Unification failure |\n\nConsider unifying the constraint set generated from `let f = fun x -> x in (f 1, f true)`. The constraint generation produces:\n\n- `f : TFun('a, 'b)` (from the function definition)\n- `'a = TInt` and `'b = TInt` (from `f 1`)\n- `'a = TBool` and `'b = TBool` (from `f true`)\n\nThe unification algorithm processes these constraints and discovers the conflict: `'a` cannot be both `TInt` and `TBool` simultaneously. This generates a type error indicating that the function `f` is being used at incompatible types. In a system with let-polymorphism (covered in the next milestone), this example would succeed by generalizing `f`'s type to be polymorphic.\n\n**Substitution Composition** is essential for maintaining consistency as new variable bindings are discovered. When we bind `'a` to `TInt`, we must apply this binding to all existing entries in the substitution. If we previously had `'b` mapped to `TFun('a, TBool)`, it must be updated to `TFun(TInt, TBool)` to reflect the new information about `'a`.\n\nThe unification algorithm's **complexity** is nearly linear in the size of the type expressions being unified, making it efficient even for large programs. The occurs check adds some overhead but is essential for correctness — without it, the type system becomes unsound and can accept programs that would crash at runtime.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting Substitution Composition**\nA common error is treating the substitution as a simple map without maintaining consistency. When you bind a type variable `'a` to a type `T`, you must apply this binding to all existing entries in the substitution. Failing to do this leads to inconsistent substitutions where some types mention the old unbound variable while others use the new binding. Always compose substitutions rather than simply adding new bindings.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Skipping the Occurs Check**\nThe occurs check prevents infinite types but is often omitted in initial implementations because it seems like an edge case. However, recursive function definitions routinely generate constraints where a type variable appears on both sides of an equation. Without the occurs check, unification can succeed but produce infinite types that crash the type printer or subsequent analysis phases. The occurs check is not optional — it's required for soundness.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Processing Constraints in Wrong Order**\nWhile unification is theoretically order-independent, practical implementations can be sensitive to constraint ordering due to error reporting. Process simple constraints (variable bindings) before complex ones (function decompositions) to get cleaner error messages. If unification fails, the order of constraint processing affects which constraint appears to \"cause\" the failure in error messages.\n\n### Substitution Application\n\nThink of substitution application as a **global find-and-replace operation** — much like using an editor's find-and-replace feature to update every occurrence of a placeholder with its final value throughout a document. After unification discovers the \"solution\" to the constraint system (which type variables should be bound to which concrete types), substitution application propagates this solution throughout the entire program, replacing type variables with their resolved types.\n\nSubstitution application is the **bridge between inference and checking** — it transforms a program full of unknown type variables into a program with concrete, checkable types. This phase is crucial because it's where the abstract constraint solving results become concrete type assignments that can be verified and reported to the programmer.\n\nThe substitution data structure produced by unification is a mapping from type variable names to their resolved types. However, applying this substitution is more complex than simple replacement because types can be nested (function types contain parameter and return types) and because substitutions can be **chained** (a type variable might be bound to another type variable that is itself bound to a concrete type).\n\n**Substitution Application Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Type Variable Resolution**: When applying substitution to a type variable, look it up in the substitution mapping. If found, recursively apply the substitution to the bound type (handling chains like `'a -> 'b -> TInt`). If not found, the variable remains unbound.\n\n2. **Primitive Type Passthrough**: Concrete types like `TInt`, `TBool`, and `TString` are unchanged by substitution application since they contain no variables to replace.\n\n3. **Function Type Recursion**: For function types `TFun(param_ty, return_ty)`, recursively apply the substitution to both the parameter type and return type, reconstructing the function type with the substituted components.\n\n4. **Polymorphic Type Handling**: For type schemes `TForall(vars, ty)`, apply substitution to the body type while being careful not to substitute for variables that are bound by the forall quantifier (avoiding **variable capture**).\n\n5. **Environment Substitution**: Apply the substitution to every type binding in the type environment, ensuring that variable types reflect the inferred concrete types.\n\n6. **Expression Annotation**: If maintaining type-annotated ASTs, apply substitution to the type annotation of every expression node, replacing inferred type variables with their concrete types.\n\n| Substitution Application Target | Input | Output | Notes |\n|--------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|\n| Type Variable `'a` | `'a` with `{'a -> TInt}` | `TInt` | Direct lookup and replace |\n| Chained Variable `'a` | `'a` with `{'a -> 'b, 'b -> TInt}` | `TInt` | Follow chain to final type |\n| Function Type | `TFun('a, 'b)` with `{'a -> TInt, 'b -> TBool}` | `TFun(TInt, TBool)` | Recursive application |\n| Unbound Variable `'c` | `'c` with `{'a -> TInt}` | `'c` | Remains as type variable |\n| Environment Binding | `x : 'a` with `{'a -> TInt}` | `x : TInt` | Update environment |\n\nThe most subtle aspect of substitution application is **handling substitution chains** correctly. Consider a substitution `{'a -> 'b, 'b -> 'c, 'c -> TInt}`. When applying this to type variable `'a`, we must follow the chain: `'a` maps to `'b`, which maps to `'c`, which maps to `TInt`. The final result should be `TInt`, not `'b` or `'c`. This requires recursive application of substitution to the bound type.\n\n**Substitution Composition** becomes important when substitutions are built incrementally or when combining substitutions from different sources. Composing substitutions `s1` and `s2` means creating a new substitution that has the same effect as applying `s1` first, then applying `s2` to the result. The composition algorithm must apply `s2` to all the values in `s1`, then add any new bindings from `s2`.\n\nConsider the type inference process for a concrete example: `let double = fun x -> x + x in double 3.14`. During constraint generation, we generate fresh variables and constraints:\n\n- `x : 'a` (function parameter)\n- `x + x` requires `'a = 'a` (trivially satisfied) and produces type `'a`\n- `double : TFun('a, 'a)` (function type)\n- `double 3.14` requires `TFun('a, 'a) = TFun(TFloat, 'b)` for fresh `'b`\n\nUnification discovers `'a = TFloat` and `'b = TFloat`. Substitution application then transforms:\n- `double : TFun('a, 'a)` becomes `double : TFun(TFloat, TFloat)`\n- The entire expression gets type `TFloat`\n\nOne crucial consideration is **partial substitution handling**. Not all type variables may be resolved after unification — some might remain unbound if they represent truly polymorphic types or if type information is insufficient. The substitution application phase must decide how to handle these unbound variables. In many cases, unbound variables indicate an error (insufficient type information), but in polymorphic systems, they might be intentionally left unbound for later instantiation.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Following Substitution Chains**\nA substitution might contain chains like `'a -> 'b -> TInt`. Simply looking up `'a` and returning `'b` is incorrect — you must recursively apply substitution until reaching a concrete type or unbound variable. Failing to follow chains leads to type variables appearing in final results where concrete types are expected, causing later phases to crash or produce confusing error messages.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Variable Capture in Polymorphic Types**\nWhen applying substitution to polymorphic types `TForall(vars, ty)`, be careful not to substitute for variables that are bound by the forall quantifier. For example, applying substitution `{'a -> TInt}` to `TForall(['a], TFun('a, 'a))` should not change the type at all because the `'a` inside is bound by the forall, not the one being substituted. This is similar to variable scoping in programming languages.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Forgetting to Update Environments**\nAfter discovering type variable bindings through unification, the type environment still contains the old type variables. You must apply the substitution to every binding in the environment to replace inferred type variables with their concrete types. Forgetting this step means that subsequent type checking phases see stale type variables instead of the inferred types.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Generating Constraints for Error Cases**\nWhen constraint generation encounters an error (like an unbound variable), inexperienced implementations often try to generate constraints anyway, leading to confusing cascading errors. Instead, detect errors early and use error recovery techniques like inserting placeholder types that don't generate additional spurious constraints.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inefficient Occurs Check Implementation**\nThe naive occurs check recursively searches through type structures for every variable binding, leading to quadratic behavior. More efficient implementations maintain \"levels\" or use union-find data structures to make occurs checks constant time. For learning purposes, the simple recursive implementation is fine, but be aware of the performance implications.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Not Handling Recursive Type Definitions**\nWhile our basic type system doesn't include recursive types (like lists or trees), the constraint generation and unification infrastructure should be designed to handle them cleanly. This means avoiding assumptions that type checking always terminates quickly and being prepared for constraint systems that require more sophisticated solving techniques.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe type inference engine represents the most algorithmically sophisticated component of the type checker. Unlike the previous components which were primarily about data structure design and straightforward rule application, type inference requires implementing two non-trivial algorithms: constraint-based type inference and Robinson unification.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Constraint Storage | `constraint_t list` (simple list) | `Set.Make(ConstraintOrd)` (efficient set) |\n| Substitution | `(string * ty) list` (association list) | `Map.Make(String)` (balanced tree map) |\n| Fresh Variable Generation | `ref int` counter | Unique ID with prefixes for debugging |\n| Type Variable Representation | `string` names | Separate type for levels and scopes |\n\n**Recommended File Structure:**\n\n```\nsrc/\n  types.ml              ← type definitions (from previous sections)\n  type_env.ml           ← type environment (from previous sections)\n  constraints.ml        ← constraint generation logic\n  unification.ml        ← unification algorithm implementation\n  substitution.ml       ← substitution data structure and application\n  inference.ml          ← main type inference driver\n  inference_test.ml     ← comprehensive test suite\n```\n\nThis organization separates the three main algorithmic components (constraint generation, unification, substitution) into distinct modules while providing a clean interface through the main inference module.\n\n**Infrastructure Starter Code:**\n\nThe constraint generation and unification algorithms require several utility components that, while not the core learning objectives, are necessary for a working implementation.\n\n```ocaml\n(* substitution.ml - Complete substitution implementation *)\n\ntype substitution = (string * ty) list\n\nlet empty_subst = []\n\nlet rec lookup_var var = function\n  | [] -> None\n  | (v, t) :: rest -> if v = var then Some t else lookup_var var rest\n\nlet extend_subst var ty subst = (var, ty) :: subst\n\n(* Apply substitution to a type, following chains *)\nlet rec apply_subst_to_type subst = function\n  | TVar var -> \n    (match lookup_var var subst with\n     | None -> TVar var\n     | Some ty -> apply_subst_to_type subst ty)  (* Follow chains *)\n  | TFun(param, ret) -> \n    TFun(apply_subst_to_type subst param, apply_subst_to_type subst ret)\n  | TForall(vars, ty) ->\n    (* Careful: don't substitute bound variables *)\n    let filtered_subst = List.filter (fun (v, _) -> not (List.mem v vars)) subst in\n    TForall(vars, apply_subst_to_type filtered_subst ty)\n  | t -> t  (* Primitives unchanged *)\n\n(* Compose two substitutions: (compose s1 s2) = apply s1 then s2 *)\nlet compose_subst s1 s2 =\n  (* Apply s2 to all values in s1 *)\n  let s1_updated = List.map (fun (var, ty) -> (var, apply_subst_to_type s2 ty)) s1 in\n  (* Add bindings from s2 that aren't in s1 *)\n  let s2_new = List.filter (fun (var, _) -> not (List.mem_assoc var s1)) s2 in\n  s1_updated @ s2_new\n\n(* Fresh variable generation *)\nlet var_counter = ref 0\nlet fresh_type_var () = \n  incr var_counter;\n  TVar (\"t\" ^ string_of_int !var_counter)\n```\n\n**Core Logic Skeleton Code:**\n\nThe heart of type inference lies in the constraint generation and unification algorithms.

Once this component works correctly, you'll have a system that can deduce types for complex expressions without requiring explicit annotations — a significant step toward a practical programming language implementation.\n\n\n## Polymorphic Type System\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of a polymorphic type system as a **smart template library** — much like how a single blueprint for a storage container can be instantiated as a box for books, a box for tools, or a box for electronics, polymorphic types allow a single function or data structure definition to work with many different concrete types. The key insight is that we need two complementary operations: **generalization** (abstracting a concrete type into a reusable template) and **instantiation** (creating a fresh concrete version from the template).\n\nThe polymorphic type system represents the culmination of our type checker's sophistication. While basic type checking verifies that concrete types match, and type inference discovers unknown types through constraints, polymorphism enables code reuse by allowing a single definition to work at multiple types. This requires extending our type representation to include quantified type variables, implementing algorithms to generalize inferred types at appropriate points, and instantiating polymorphic types with fresh variables at use sites.\n\nThe mental model that guides polymorphic type checking is **template instantiation with scope-aware generalization**. When we encounter a let-binding like `let id = fun x -> x`, we don't just infer that `id` has some specific type like `int -> int`. Instead, we recognize that this function works for any type, so we generalize it to the polymorphic type scheme `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`. Later, when we see `id 42` and `id true` in the same program, we instantiate the polymorphic type twice with different type variables, allowing the unification algorithm to specialize each use appropriately.\n\n### Type Schemes and Quantification\n\nType schemes provide the representation mechanism for polymorphic types by explicitly tracking which type variables are quantified (bound by forall) versus which are free (still being inferred). Think of a type scheme as a **factory blueprint with parameter slots** — the blueprint `forall 'a 'b. 'a -> 'b -> 'a` describes a family of function types where the caller can fill in any concrete types for the parameters `'a` and `'b`.\n\nThe distinction between bound and free type variables is crucial for correctness. A bound type variable like `'a` in `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a` represents a parameter that can be instantiated to any type, but both occurrences of `'a` must be instantiated to the same type. A free type variable represents an unknown type that is still being inferred by the unification algorithm. When we generalize a type into a type scheme, we promote free type variables to bound type variables, effectively saying \"this type works for any choice of these variables.\"\n\n**Type Scheme Data Structures:**\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| quantified_vars | string list | Type variable names bound by forall quantification |\n| body_type | ty | The underlying type with quantified variables as TVar nodes |\n\n| Method Name | Parameters | Returns | Description |\n|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|\n| make_type_scheme | quantified_vars: string list, body: ty | type_scheme | Constructs type scheme with given quantified variables |\n| scheme_to_string | scheme: type_scheme | string | Pretty prints type scheme with forall notation |\n| free_vars_in_scheme | scheme: type_scheme | string list | Returns type variables free in scheme body but not quantified |\n| scheme_contains_var | scheme: type_scheme, var_name: string | bool | Checks if variable appears free in scheme |\n\nThe `type_scheme` representation uses explicit quantification rather than implicit generalization to make the polymorphic structure clear and enable precise control over instantiation. The `quantified_vars` list contains the names of type variables that should be treated as parameters, while `body_type` contains the actual type structure with those variables appearing as `TVar` nodes.\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: We represent type schemes explicitly rather than using implicit generalization because we need to distinguish between \"this variable can be anything\" (bound) and \"this variable is unknown but will be determined by unification\" (free). This distinction is essential for correct let-polymorphism.\n\n**Type Scheme Operations:**\n\nThe fundamental operations on type schemes support the generalization-instantiation cycle. Generalization takes a monomorphic type and abstracts over its free type variables to create a polymorphic type scheme. Instantiation takes a polymorphic type scheme and replaces its quantified variables with fresh type variables, creating a new monomorphic type that can be used in constraint generation.\n\n| Operation | Input | Output | Purpose |\n|-----------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Generalization | Inferred type + type environment | Type scheme | Abstract over variables free in type but not environment |\n| Instantiation | Type scheme | Monomorphic type | Replace quantified variables with fresh variables |\n| Scheme Equality | Two type schemes | Boolean | Check if schemes represent same polymorphic type |\n| Scheme Substitution | Type scheme + substitution | Type scheme | Apply substitution to free variables in scheme |\n\n### Type Generalization\n\nType generalization implements the **let-polymorphism** rule that makes functional programming languages so expressive. The key insight is that when we infer a type for a let-bound variable, we should generalize over any type variables that are free in the inferred type but not free in the surrounding type environment. This captures the intuition that \"this definition doesn't depend on any unknown types from the context, so it can work at any type.\"\n\nThink of generalization as **context-sensitive abstraction** — we look at what type variables appear in the inferred type, then check which of those variables represent genuine unknowns versus which represent dependencies on the surrounding context. Variables that don't appear in the environment are good candidates for generalization because they represent internal polymorphism within the definition.\n\n> **Decision: Let-Polymorphism Generalization Point**\n> - **Context**: We need to decide when to generalize inferred types into polymorphic type schemes\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Generalize at every variable binding\n>   2. Generalize only at let-bindings\n>   3. Generalize at let-bindings with value restriction\n> - **Decision**: Generalize at let-bindings with value restriction\n> - **Rationale**: This matches ML-family languages and prevents unsound generalization of effects. Generalizing everywhere would make type inference undecidable, while never generalizing would lose expressiveness.\n> - **Consequences**: Enables powerful polymorphic programming while maintaining soundness and decidability\n\n**Generalization Algorithm:**\n\nThe generalization algorithm follows these steps to safely abstract over free type variables:\n\n1. **Collect free variables in inferred type**: Walk the type structure and gather all `TVar` nodes that appear in the type\n2. **Collect free variables in environment**: Walk all type schemes in the current environment and gather type variables that appear free (not quantified)\n3. **Compute generalizable variables**: Take the set difference - variables free in the type but not free in the environment\n4. **Apply value restriction**: Check if the let-bound expression is a syntactic value (lambda, literal, constructor) - if not, don't generalize\n5. **Create type scheme**: If generalization is allowed, create a `type_scheme` with the generalizable variables as quantified variables\n\n| Generalization Step | Input | Processing | Output |\n|---------------------|--------|------------|--------|\n| Free Variable Collection | Inferred type | Traverse type collecting TVar names | String set of free variables |\n| Environment Analysis | Type environment | Traverse environment collecting free vars | String set of context variables |\n| Generalization Set | Two string sets | Set difference operation | Variables to generalize over |\n| Value Restriction | Let-bound expression | Syntactic value check | Boolean: allow generalization |\n| Scheme Construction | Variables + type | Create Forall quantification | Polymorphic type scheme |\n\n**Value Restriction Implementation:**\n\nThe value restriction prevents generalization of expressions that might have computational effects or mutable state. This restriction is crucial for soundness in languages with mutation or exceptions. The restriction allows generalization only when the let-bound expression is syntactically a value.\n\n| Expression Form | Generalizable | Reasoning |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----------|\n| Literals (`42`, `true`, `\"hello\"`) | Yes | No computation performed |\n| Lambda expressions (`fun x -> e`) | Yes | Function values are safe to generalize |\n| Variable references (`x`) | Yes | No computation, just lookup |\n| Constructor applications (`Cons(1, Nil)`) | Yes | Pure value construction |\n| Function calls (`f x`) | No | May have effects or create mutable state |\n| Conditionals (`if b then e1 else e2`) | No | Involves computation to evaluate guard |\n| Let expressions (`let x = e1 in e2`) | Depends on e2 | Check if final expression is value |\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Overgeneralization Without Value Restriction**\n> Forgetting the value restriction can lead to unsound types. For example, `let r = ref None` might be generalized to `forall 'a. 'a option ref`, allowing `r := Some 42; !r` to be typed as `string option`, which would crash at runtime. The value restriction prevents generalizing non-values like `ref None`.\n\n**Generalization Example Walkthrough:**\n\nConsider generalizing the type of `let id = fun x -> x` in an empty environment:\n\n1. **Infer type**: The function `fun x -> x` gets inferred type `'a -> 'a` where `'a` is a fresh type variable\n2. **Collect type variables**: Free variables in `'a -> 'a` are `{'a'}`\n3. **Check environment**: Empty environment has no free variables: `{}`\n4. **Compute generalization set**: `{'a'} - {} = {'a'}` - we can generalize over `'a`\n5. **Apply value restriction**: `fun x -> x` is a lambda, so it's a syntactic value - generalization allowed\n6. **Create scheme**: Result is `Forall(['a'], TFun(TVar('a'), TVar('a')))` representing `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`\n\nNow consider `let f = g h` where `g : 'b -> 'c` and `h : 'd`:\n\n1. **Infer type**: Application `g h` unifies `'b` with `'d`, resulting in type `'c`\n2. **Collect type variables**: Free variables in `'c` are `{'c'}`\n3. **Check environment**: Environment contains `g` and `h` with free variable `'c`, so environment free variables are `{'c'}`\n4. **Compute generalization set**: `{'c'} - {'c'} = {}` - no variables to generalize\n5. **Result**: Type remains monomorphic `'c`\n\n### Type Instantiation\n\nType instantiation performs the complementary operation to generalization by taking a polymorphic type scheme and creating a fresh monomorphic type that can be used in constraint generation. Think of instantiation as **template expansion with fresh parameters** — each time we instantiate `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`, we create a new copy like `'b -> 'b` where `'b` is a completely fresh type variable.\n\nThe key insight behind instantiation is that each use of a polymorphic value should be independent. When we see two calls to a polymorphic function like `id 42` and `id true`, each call should get its own fresh instantiation of the polymorphic type. This allows the unification algorithm to specialize each use differently without interference.\n\n> **Key Design Principle**: Instantiation must always generate fresh type variables to avoid accidental sharing between different uses of the same polymorphic value. Reusing type variables would create spurious constraints that prevent independent specialization.\n\n**Instantiation Algorithm:**\n\nThe instantiation process systematically replaces quantified type variables with fresh type variables while preserving the structure of the type:\n\n1. **Generate fresh variables**: For each quantified variable in the type scheme, generate a completely fresh type variable using `fresh_type_var()`\n2. **Build substitution**: Create a substitution mapping from each quantified variable name to its corresponding fresh variable\n3. **Apply substitution**: Use `apply_subst_to_type` to replace all occurrences of quantified variables in the scheme body\n4. **Return monomorphic type**: The result is a monomorphic type with fresh variables that can participate in constraint generation\n\n| Instantiation Step | Input | Processing | Output |\n|--------------------|--------|------------|--------|\n| Fresh Generation | Quantified variable list | Call `fresh_type_var()` for each | List of fresh TVar nodes |\n| Substitution Building | Variable names + fresh vars | Zip into (name, fresh_var) pairs | Substitution mapping |\n| Type Substitution | Scheme body + substitution | Apply substitution to type | Type with fresh variables |\n| Monomorphic Result | Substituted type | Return as regular type | Type ready for constraint generation |\n\n**Instantiation Implementation Details:**\n\nThe instantiation process must handle nested type structures correctly, ensuring that all occurrences of a quantified variable are replaced consistently. The substitution application recursively traverses the type structure, replacing `TVar` nodes that match quantified variables.\n\n| Type Constructor | Instantiation Behavior |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| `TInt`, `TBool`, `TString` | No change - primitives have no variables |\n| `TVar(name)` | Replace with fresh variable if name is quantified, otherwise unchanged |\n| `TFun(arg, ret)` | Recursively instantiate both argument and return types |\n| `TForall(vars, body)` | Error - nested quantification not supported in this system |\n\n**Multiple Instantiation Example:**\n\nConsider the polymorphic identity function `id : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a` used in the expression `(id 42, id true)`:\n\n**First instantiation** for `id 42`:\n1. Generate fresh variable: `'b1` \n2. Build substitution: `[('a', TVar('b1'))]`\n3. Apply to `'a -> 'a`: Result is `'b1 -> 'b1`\n4. Constraint generation: `id 42` generates constraint `'b1 = int`\n\n**Second instantiation** for `id true`:\n1. Generate fresh variable: `'b2` (different from `'b1`)\n2. Build substitution: `[('a', TVar('b2'))]`  \n3. Apply to `'a -> 'a`: Result is `'b2 -> 'b2`\n4. Constraint generation: `id true` generates constraint `'b2 = bool`\n\n**Unification result**: The constraints `'b1 = int` and `'b2 = bool` are solved independently, allowing the first use to specialize to `int -> int` and the second to `bool -> bool`. This is exactly the behavior we want from polymorphism.\n\n> ⚠️ **Pitfall: Reusing Type Variables Across Instantiations**\n> If we accidentally reused the same fresh variable `'b` for both instantiations, we would generate conflicting constraints `'b = int` and `'b = bool`, causing a unification failure. Each instantiation must use completely fresh variables.\n\n**Polymorphic Recursion Limitations:**\n\nOur let-polymorphism system does not support polymorphic recursion, where a recursive function calls itself at different types within its own definition. This limitation is intentional for decidability - supporting polymorphic recursion would require more sophisticated analysis or programmer annotations.\n\n| Recursion Pattern | Supported | Example |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Monomorphic recursion | Yes | `let rec factorial n = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * factorial (n-1)` |\n| Mutually recursive functions | Yes | `let rec even n = n = 0 || odd (n-1) and odd n = n > 0 && even (n-1)` |\n| Polymorphic recursion | No | `let rec f x = ... f (Some x) ...` (calling f at different type) |\n\nThe restriction to non-polymorphic recursion means that within a recursive function's definition, all recursive calls must use the same type instantiation. Only after the function is fully defined and generalized can it be used polymorphically.\n\n![Polymorphic Type Lifecycle](./diagrams/polymorphism-lifecycle.svg)\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThis subsection provides concrete implementation guidance for building the polymorphic type system components in OCaml, focusing on the data structures, algorithms, and integration points needed to extend our existing type checker with let-polymorphism.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Component | Simple Option | Advanced Option |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Type Schemes | Explicit forall with string list | De Bruijn indices with level-based quantification |\n| Fresh Variable Generation | Global counter with string prefixes | UUID-based generation with conflict detection |\n| Substitution Representation | Association list (string * ty) list | Map-based with path compression |\n| Value Restriction | Syntactic pattern matching | Effect analysis with purity tracking |\n\n**Recommended Module Structure:**\n\nThe polymorphic type system integrates with existing modules while adding new functionality for type schemes, generalization, and instantiation:\n\n```\nsrc/\n  types/\n    type_repr.ml          ← extend with TForall constructor\n    type_scheme.ml        ← new: type schemes and operations  \n    type_env.ml           ← extend to store type schemes\n  inference/\n    constraint_gen.ml     ← extend with instantiation calls\n    unification.ml        ← existing unification algorithm\n    generalization.ml     ← new: let-polymorphism generalization\n  checker/\n    type_checker.ml       ← integrate generalization at let-bindings\n```\n\n**Type Scheme Infrastructure (Complete Implementation):**\n\n```ocaml\n(* type_scheme.ml *)\ntype type_scheme = Forall of string list * ty\n\nlet make_type_scheme quantified_vars body_type =\n  Forall (quantified_vars, body_type)\n\nlet scheme_to_string (Forall (vars, body)) =\n  match vars with\n  | [] -> string_of_type body\n  | _ -> \"forall \" ^ String.concat \" \" vars ^ \". \" ^ string_of_type body\n\nlet rec free_vars_in_type = function\n  | TInt | TBool | TString -> []\n  | TVar name -> [name]\n  | TFun (arg, ret) -> free_vars_in_type arg @ free_vars_in_type ret\n  | TForall (_, _) -> failwith \"Nested quantification not supported\"\n\nlet free_vars_in_scheme (Forall (quantified, body)) =\n  let all_free = free_vars_in_type body in\n  List.filter (fun v -> not (List.mem v quantified)) all_free\n\nlet scheme_contains_var (Forall (quantified, body)) var_name =\n  let free_vars = free_vars_in_type body in\n  List.mem var_name free_vars && not (List.mem var_name quantified)\n```\n\n**Fresh Variable Generation (Complete Implementation):**\n\n```ocaml\n(* Fresh variable generation with global counter *)\nlet var_counter = ref 0\n\nlet fresh_type_var () =\n  incr var_counter;\n  TVar (\"'t\" ^ string_of_int !var_counter)\n\nlet fresh_var_name () =\n  incr var_counter;\n  \"'t\" ^ string_of_int !var_counter\n\n(* Generate multiple fresh variables at once *)\nlet fresh_type_vars count =\n  let rec gen acc n =\n    if n <= 0 then List.rev acc\n    else gen (fresh_type_var () :: acc) (n -

are non-values being generalized? | Implement proper `can_generalize` syntactic check |\n| \"Infinite type\" errors in polymorphic contexts | Fresh variable generation collision | Check if same variable name used in multiple instantiations | Ensure `fresh_type_var()` returns globally unique names |\n| Polymorphic recursion accepted incorrectly | Generalizing recursive definitions too early | Check when generalization happens in recursive let | Only generalize after complete recursive definition group |\n\n**Debugging Trace Utilities:**\n\n```ocaml\nlet debug_generalization var_name inferred_type env =\n  Printf.printf \"Generalizing %s : %s\\n\" var_name (string_of_type inferred_type);\n  Printf.printf \"Free in type: [%s]\\n\" \n    (String.concat \"; \" (free_vars_in_type inferred_type));\n  Printf.printf \"Free in env: [%s]\\n\"\n    (String.concat \"; \" (TypeEnv.free_vars_in_env env))\n\nlet debug_instantiation scheme =\n  Printf.printf \"Instantiating %s\\n\" (scheme_to_string scheme);\n  let result = instantiate_scheme scheme in\n  Printf.printf \"Result: %s\\n\" (string_of_type result);\n  result\n```\n\nThis implementation provides the foundation for let-polymorphism while maintaining integration with the existing constraint-based type inference system. The key insight is that generalization and instantiation work as bookends around the normal constraint generation and unification process, allowing the existing algorithms to handle the monomorphic instances while the polymorphic system manages the abstraction and specialization.\n\n\n## Component Interactions and Data Flow\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of the component interactions in our type checker as a **well-orchestrated symphony orchestra** — each component has a specific role and timing, but the magic happens in how they coordinate together to produce a harmonious result. The conductor (our pipeline orchestrator) ensures that the string section (type representation) provides the foundational melody, while the brass section (inference engine) adds the complex harmonies, and the percussion section (error reporter) provides crucial feedback when something goes wrong. Just as musicians must pass musical phrases between sections and maintain perfect timing, our type checker components must thread data through a carefully choreographed sequence while maintaining consistency and recovering gracefully from errors.\n\n![Type Checking Pipeline Flow](./diagrams/type-checking-pipeline.svg)\n\nThe component interactions represent one of the most critical aspects of our type checker architecture. Unlike simple sequential processing, type checking requires sophisticated coordination between components because type information flows bidirectionally — inference generates constraints that flow forward to unification, while solved substitutions flow backward to update expressions. Additionally, the type environment must thread through recursive calls while maintaining proper scoping semantics, and error recovery must allow continued processing even when individual components fail.\n\n### Type Checking Pipeline\n\nThe type checking pipeline represents the **main arteries of our type system** — much like how blood circulation carries oxygen and nutrients throughout the body while removing waste products. Each stage in our pipeline receives typed information, processes it according to specific rules, potentially generates constraints or errors, and passes enriched information to the next stage. The pipeline must handle both the happy path (successful type checking) and error paths (type mismatches, unification failures) while maintaining enough state to provide meaningful error messages and continue processing.\n\n![Constraint Solving Sequence](./diagrams/constraint-solving-sequence.svg)\n\nThe pipeline operates through a series of distinct phases, each with specific responsibilities and interfaces. Understanding this flow is crucial because it determines how components communicate, where errors can occur, and how recovery mechanisms work. The pipeline is not purely sequential — some phases may iterate or backtrack, particularly during constraint solving and error recovery.\n\n#### Pipeline Phase Breakdown\n\nThe complete type checking pipeline consists of several interconnected phases, each building upon the previous stages while potentially feeding information back to earlier components.\n\n| Phase | Input | Output | Primary Component | Error Recovery |\n|-------|-------|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| AST Preprocessing | Raw AST from parser | Annotated AST with source locations | Type Environment | Continue with location-less errors |\n| Environment Setup | Annotated AST | Initial type environment with built-ins | Type Environment | Fatal - cannot proceed |\n| Expression Analysis | AST expressions + environment | Typed expressions + constraints | Basic Type Checker / Inference Engine | Insert error types, continue |\n| Constraint Generation | Typed expressions | Type constraint sets | Inference Engine | Skip malformed expressions |\n| Constraint Solving | Type constraints | Substitutions | Unification Algorithm | Report unsatisfiable constraints |\n| Type Substitution | Expressions + substitutions | Fully typed AST | Type Representation | Use original types for failures |\n| Error Formatting | Accumulated errors | Human-readable messages | Error Reporter | Best-effort formatting |\n| Final Validation | Fully typed AST | Validated program or error report | Pipeline Coordinator | Report validation failures |\n\n> **Design Insight**: The pipeline uses a \"collect errors and continue\" strategy rather than failing fast. This allows developers to see multiple type errors in a single compilation, significantly improving the development experience.\n\n#### Phase 1: AST Preprocessing and Environment Setup\n\nThe pipeline begins with preprocessing the input AST to ensure all necessary metadata is available for type checking. This phase serves as the **foundation layer** where we establish the ground truth about program structure and prepare the initial typing context.\n\n**AST Preprocessing Steps:**\n\n1. **Source Location Attachment**: Every AST node receives complete source location information including file name, line/column start and end positions. This metadata becomes crucial for error reporting but doesn't affect type checking logic.\n\n2. **Built-in Type Registration**: The initial type environment is populated with primitive types (`TInt`, `TBool`, `TString`) and any built-in functions or operators. This creates the base context that all subsequent typing builds upon.\n\n3. **Scope Structure Analysis**: The preprocessor identifies all binding constructs (let expressions, function parameters, lambda bindings) and creates a scope nesting structure. This analysis ensures proper environment threading during the main type checking phase.\n\n4. **Declaration Dependency Analysis**: For languages with forward references or mutual recursion, this step builds a dependency graph to determine the order of type checking. This prevents issues where a binding is used before its type is established.\n\nThe environment setup creates the initial `env` structure that threads through all subsequent pipeline phases:\n\n| Environment Component | Purpose | Example Contents |\n|----------------------|---------|------------------|\n| Global Scope | Built-in types and functions | `[(\"int\", Monomorphic TInt), (\"+\", Monomorphic (TFun (TInt, TFun (TInt, TInt))))]` |\n| Module Scope | Top-level definitions | `[(\"main\", Monomorphic (TFun (TString, TInt)))]` |\n| Empty Local Scopes | Placeholder for nested bindings | `[]` (added as needed during traversal) |\n\n> **Critical Implementation Note**: The environment setup must complete successfully before any expression analysis begins. Failures here (like missing built-in definitions) are fatal and should terminate the pipeline with a clear setup error message.\n\n#### Phase 2: Expression Analysis and Constraint Generation\n\nExpression analysis forms the **core reasoning engine** of our pipeline. This phase traverses the AST, applying type rules to expressions while generating constraints that capture type relationships. The process combines immediate type checking (for expressions with known types) with constraint generation (for expressions requiring inference).\n\nThe analysis operates through a mutual recursion between `synthesize_expression_type` (determining what type an expression produces) and `check_expression_type` (verifying an expression against an expected type). This bidirectional approach allows the type checker to leverage context from both directions, improving inference quality and error messages.\n\n**Expression Analysis Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Expression Classification**: Each expression is classified as either synthesizable (we can determine its type from structure alone) or checkable (requires expected type context). Literals, variables, and function calls are synthesizable; lambda bodies and conditional branches are often checkable.\n\n2. **Type Rule Application**: For synthesizable expressions, apply the corresponding type rule to compute the result type. For example, integer literals produce `TInt`, variable references require environment lookup, function calls require parameter/argument matching.\n\n3. **Constraint Collection**: When type relationships cannot be resolved immediately (especially with type variables), generate constraints that capture the required relationships. A function call `f(x)` where `f` has type `α → β` and `x` has type `γ` generates the constraint `α = γ`.\n\n4. **Recursive Subexpression Processing**: Process all subexpressions recursively, threading the type environment appropriately for scoping rules and collecting constraints from all nested expressions.\n\n5. **Type Variable Management**: Generate fresh type variables for unknowns and maintain substitution contexts to ensure consistency across constraint generation.\n\n**Constraint Generation Examples:**\n\n| Expression Type | Generated Constraints | Rationale |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Function Call `f(arg)` | `typeof(f) = α → β`, `typeof(arg) = α`, result type `β` | Function type must match argument type |\n| Conditional `if c then e1 else e2` | `typeof(c) = TBool`, `typeof(e1) = typeof(e2)` | Condition must be boolean, branches must match |\n| Let Binding `let x = e1 in e2` | Constraints from `e1`, then check `e2` with `x : typeof(e1)` in environment | Binding creates new scope with inferred type |\n| Binary Operation `e1 + e2` | `typeof(e1) = TInt`, `typeof(e2) = TInt`, result type `TInt` | Both operands must be integers |\n\nThe constraint generation process must handle **polymorphic instantiation** carefully. When a polymorphic binding like `id : ∀α. α → α` is referenced, the constraint generator must create fresh type variables and instantiate the type scheme, generating `id : β → β` where `β` is fresh.\n\n#### Phase 3: Constraint Solving and Unification\n\nConstraint solving represents the **puzzle-solving heart** of type inference. This phase takes the collection of type constraints generated from expressions and attempts to find a consistent assignment of concrete types to all type variables. The process uses Robinson unification with an occurs check to ensure termination and detect impossible type requirements.\n\n![System Architecture](./diagrams/system-architecture.svg)\n\nThe unification algorithm processes constraints iteratively, building up a substitution that represents the solution. Each constraint `t1 = t2` is unified by finding the most general substitution that makes the types equal, then composing this substitution with previous solutions.\n\n**Unification Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1. **Constraint Queue Initialization**: All generated constraints are added to a processing queue. The order can affect performance but not correctness due to the mathematical properties of unification.\n\n2. **Constraint Selection**: Select the next constraint from the queue. Simple heuristics like processing variable-to-concrete constraints first can improve efficiency.\n\n3. **Constraint Decomposition**: Break down complex constraints into simpler ones. For example, `TFun(α, β) = TFun(TInt, γ)` becomes two constraints: `α = TInt` and `β = γ`.\n\n4. **Occurs Check**: Before binding a type variable `α` to a type `t`, verify that `α` does not occur free in `t`. This prevents infinite types like `α = α → β`.\n\n5. **Substitution Generation**: Create a binding `α ↦ t` and compose it with the existing substitution. Apply the new substitution to all remaining constraints in the queue.\n\n6. **Termination Check**: Continue until the queue is empty (success) or an unsatisfiable constraint is encountered (failure).\n\n**Unification Failure Cases:**\n\n| Failure Type | Example | Error Message Strategy |\n|-------------|---------|----------------------|\n| Type Constructor Mismatch | `TInt = TBool` | \"Expected integer, but got boolean\" |\n| Arity Mismatch | `TFun(TInt, TBool) = TFun(TInt, TBool, TString)` | \"Function expects 2 arguments, got 3\" |\n| Occurs Check Violation | `α = α → TInt` | \"Cannot construct infinite type\" |\n| Rigid Type Clash | `TInt = TString` in function signature | \"Function signature requires string, expression produces integer\" |\n\n> **Critical Design Decision**: When unification fails, the system must decide whether to abort type checking or continue with error recovery. Our pipeline chooses continuation with placeholder types, allowing detection of additional errors in the same program.\n\n#### Phase 4: Type Substitution and Final Resolution\n\nThe type substitution phase **applies the solution** found by unification back to the original program AST. This phase transforms the constraint-laden intermediate representation into a fully typed AST where every expression has a concrete, resolved type.\n\n**Substitution Application Process:**\n\n1. **Global Substitution Application**: Apply the final substitution to every type annotation in the AST. Type variables are replaced with their solved concrete types, while already-concrete types remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Type Scheme Instantiation**: For polymorphic bindings, ensure that the generalized type schemes are properly instantiated at each use site. This prevents inappropriate sharing of type variables across different uses of the same polymorphic value.\n\n3. **Remaining Variable Detection**: Any type variables that remain after substitution application indicate inference failures or underconstrainted programs. These should be reported as ambiguous type errors.\n\n4. **Type Annotation Insertion**: Generate explicit type annotations for expressions that were originally unannotated but now have inferred types. This produces a fully annotated program suitable for code generation or further analysis.\n\nThe substitution application must preserve the **semantic equivalence** between the original program and the typed program. Only type information should change; the computational behavior must remain identical.\n\n#### Pipeline Error Handling Strategy\n\nThe pipeline implements a **resilient error handling strategy** that balances early error detection with comprehensive error reporting. Rather than terminating on the first error, the system attempts to recover and continue analysis to surface as many issues as possible in a single compilation run.\n\n> **Decision: Continuation-Based Error Recovery**\n> - **Context**: Type errors often cascade, where one mistake causes many spurious downstream errors. However, failing fast means developers see only the first error and must fix-and-recompile repeatedly.\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Fail-fast: Stop on first error\n>   2. Collect-and-continue: Insert placeholder types and continue\n>   3. Speculative-recovery: Try multiple possible fixes and continue with the best\n> - **Decision**: Collect-and-continue with intelligent error filtering\n> - **Rationale**: Maximizes useful feedback per compilation while avoiding overwhelming cascading errors. Placeholder types (`TError`) allow continued analysis without affecting correctness of subsequent phases.\n> - **Consequences**: More complex error recovery logic, but significantly better developer experience. Requires careful error filtering to avoid spurious cascading errors.\n\n**Error Recovery Mechanisms:**\n\n| Error Type | Recovery Strategy | Placeholder Type | Continued Analysis |\n|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Unbound Variable | Insert error binding in environment | `TVar(\"error_\" ^ fresh_id)` | Continue with error type |\n| Type Mismatch | Use expected type for expression | Expected type | Continue normally |\n| Unification Failure | Use one of the conflicting types | First type in constraint | Continue with warning |\n| Missing Function Argument | Insert dummy argument with fresh type variable | `TVar(fresh_var())` | Analyze remaining arguments |\n| Extra Function Argument | Ignore extra argument | N/A | Report arity error, continue |\n\n### Environment Threading\n\nEnvironment threading represents the **nervous system** of our type checker — much like how the human nervous system carries signals throughout the body while maintaining proper routing and timing. The type environment must flow through every recursive call in the type checking process, ensuring that variable bindings are properly scoped, new bindings are visible in appropriate contexts, and lexical scoping rules are enforced correctly. Unlike simple parameter passing, environment threading requires careful attention to when environments are extended, how they are restored, and how bindings interact with polymorphism and constraint solving.\n\nThe complexity of environment threading arises from the interaction between lexical scoping (variables are visible in nested scopes), type inference (new bindings might have polymorphic types), and error recovery (malformed bindings shouldn't break subsequent analysis). The environment must evolve as type checking progresses while maintaining the invariant that variable lookups always find the appropriate binding according to the language's scoping rules.\n\n#### Environment Structure and Scoping Rules\n\nThe environment structure implements **lexical scoping with nested scope layers**. Each scope layer represents a binding context (function parameters, let bindings, lambda parameters), and lookups search from innermost to outermost scope until a binding is found.\n\nOur `env` type uses a list-of-lists structure where each inner list represents a scope level:\n\n| Environment Layer | Contents | Example Bindings |\n|------------------|----------|------------------|\n| Built-in Scope (outermost) | Primitive types, built-in functions | `[(\"int\", Monomorphic TInt), (\"+\", Monomorphic (TFun(TInt, TFun(TInt, TInt))))]` |\n| Module Scope | Top-level function definitions | `[(\"factorial\", Polymorphic (Forall([\"a\"], TFun(TInt, TInt))))]` |\n| Function Parameter Scope | Current function's parameters | `[(\"n\", Monomorphic TInt), (\"acc\", Monomorphic TInt)]` |\n| Local Binding Scopes | Let bindings, lambda parameters | `[(\"x\", Monomorphic TBool)]` |\n\nThe scoping rules follow standard lexical scoping semantics:\n\n1. **Innermost Binding Wins**: If multiple scopes contain bindings for the same variable name, the innermost (most recently added) binding shadows outer bindings.\n\n2. **Scope Extension**: New bindings extend the innermost scope layer. Function calls and lambda expressions create entirely new scope layers.\n\n3. **Scope Restoration**: When exiting a binding construct, the scope layers added during that construct are removed, restoring the previous environment state.\n\n4. **Polymorphic Binding Instantiation**: Each lookup of a polymorphic binding creates a fresh instantiation, ensuring that different uses of the same polymorphic function don't interfere with each other.\n\n#### Environment Operations and Threading Patterns\n\nEnvironment threading follows specific patterns depending on the AST construct being processed. Understanding these patterns is crucial for correct type checker implementation, as improper threading leads to scoping violations or binding visibility errors.\n\n**Core Environment Operations:**\n\n| Operation | Signature | Purpose | Usage Pattern |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| `extend_mono` | `string * ty * env -> env` | Add monomorphic binding | Local variables, function parameters |\n| `extend_poly` | `string * type_scheme * env -> env` | Add polymorphic binding | Let-bound polymorphic functions |\n| `lookup` | `string * env -> binding option` | Find variable binding | Variable references |\n| `fresh_scope` | `env -> env` | Create new scope layer | Function calls, lambda expressions |\n| `restore_scope` | `env * env -> env` | Restore previous scope | Exiting binding constructs |\n\n**Threading Pattern Examples:**\n\n1. **Function Definition Threading**:\n   - Extend environment with function name (for recursion)\n   - Create fresh scope layer for parameters\n   - Extend parameter scope with each parameter binding\n   - Type check function body with extended environment\n   - Restore original environment for subsequent definitions\n\n2. **Let Expression Threading**:\n   - Type check binding expression with current environment\n   - Generalize inferred type if applicable\n   - Extend environment with new binding\n   - Type check body expression with extended environment\n   - Use body type as let expression type\n   - Environment extension persists if let is at top level\n\n3. **Conditional Expression Threading**:\n   - Type check condition with current environment\n   - Type check then-branch with current environment (no extension)\n   - Type check else-branch with current environment (no extension)\n   - Neither branch extends the environment for subsequent expressions\n\n#### Polymorphic Binding Management\n\nPolymorphic binding management adds significant complexity to environment threading because polymorphic bindings must be **generalized at definition sites** and **instantiated at use sites**. This process requires careful coordination between the environment, the generalization algorithm, and the instantiation mechanism.\n\n> **Design Principle**: Generalization happens only at let bindings (let-polymorphism), while instantiation happens at every use of a polymorphic binding. This ensures predictable polymorphism without the complexity of full higher-rank types.\n\n**Generalization Process:**\n\n1. **Type Inference**: Infer the most general type for the let-bound expression using constraint generation and unification.\n\n2. **Free Variable Collection**: Identify all type variables that appear in the inferred type but are not bound by the current environment. These variables are candidates for generalization.\n\n3. **Value Restriction Check**: Verify that the let-bound expression is a syntactic value (variable, literal, or lambda). Non-values are not generalized to prevent unsound polymorphism with side effects.\n\n4. **Type Scheme Construction**: Create a type scheme by quantifying over the free type variables: `∀α₁...αₙ. τ` where `α₁...αₙ` are the free variables and `τ` is the inferred type.\n\n5. **Environment Extension**: Add the polymorphic binding to the environment using `extend_poly`.\n\n**Instantiation Process:**\n\n1. **Binding Lookup**: Retrieve the binding from the environment using `lookup`.\n\n2. **Binding Classification**: Determine whether the binding is `Monomorphic ty` or `Polymorphic type_scheme`.\n\n3. **Fresh Variable Generation**: For polymorphic bindings, generate fresh type variables for each quantified variable in the type scheme.\n\n4. **Substitution Application**: Replace quantified variables with fresh variables throughout the type scheme body.\n\n5. **Type Return**: Return the instantiated type for use in expression typing.\n\n**Environment Threading with Polymorphism:**\n\n| Construct | Generalization | Instantiation | Environment Threading |\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| Top-level Let | Generalize over environment-free variables | N/A | Extend global environment with polymorphic binding |\n| Local Let | Generalize over environment-free variables | N/A | Extend local environment with polymorphic binding |\n| Variable Reference | N/A | Instantiate polymorphic bindings with fresh variables | No environment change |\n| Function Parameter | No generalization (monomorphic) | N/A | Extend parameter environment with monomorphic binding |\n| Lambda Binding | No generalization (monomorphic) | N/A | Extend lambda environment with monomorphic binding |\n\n#### Error Recovery and Environment Consistency\n\nError recovery in environment threading requires maintaining **environment consistency invariants** even when individual type checking operations fail. The environment must remain in a valid state that allows continued analysis of subsequent program constructs.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Environment Corruption During Error Recovery**\nMany type checker implementations fail to properly maintain environment state when errors occur. For example, if type checking a let binding fails, the implementation might still add the binding to the environment with an invalid type, causing cascading errors. The correct approach is to add error bindings with placeholder types that don't interfere with subsequent analysis.\n\n**Error Recovery Strategies:**\n\n1. **Placeholder Binding Insertion**: When a binding cannot be properly typed, insert a binding with a fresh error type variable. This allows variable references to succeed while marking the error for reporting.\n\n2. **Scope Restoration Guarantee**: Even if type checking within a scope fails, ensure that the environment is properly restored to its pre-scope state. Use exception handling or explicit cleanup to guarantee this invariant.\n\n3. **Partial Environment Updates**: For complex binding constructs (like recursive function groups), apply successfully typed bindings to the environment while skipping failed bindings with appropriate error reporting.\n\n4. **Environment Validation**: Periodically validate environment consistency, checking that all bindings are well-formed and that scope nesting is correct. This helps detect environment threading bugs during development.\n\n**Error Recovery Environment Operations:**\n\n| Error Scenario | Recovery Action | Environment State | Continued Analysis |\n|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Let binding type error | Add `(name, Monomorphic (TVar \"error_X\"))` | Valid environment with error binding | Continue normally |\n| Function parameter error | Add parameter with fresh error type | Valid parameter environment | Type check body with error types |\n| Variable lookup failure | Report unbound variable error | Unchanged environment | Use fresh error type for expression |\n| Scope corruption | Restore from saved environment snapshot | Previous valid state | Skip corrupted construct, continue |\n| Recursive binding failure | Add partial bindings for successful cases | Partially extended environment | Continue with available bindings |\n\n> **Implementation Strategy**: Use environment snapshots at key points (before processing binding constructs) to enable rollback on catastrophic failures. This provides a safety net for environment threading bugs during development and testing.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe component interactions and data flow represent the most complex aspect of type checker implementation because they require coordinating multiple interdependent systems while maintaining correctness invariants.

([\"a\"], TFun (TVar \"a\", TFun (TVar \"a\", TBool)))));\n    ] in\n    [builtins]\n\n  let extend_mono (name: string) (ty: ty) (env: t): t =\n    match env with\n    | [] -> failwith \"Environment invariant violated: empty environment\"\n    | scope :: rest -> ((name, Monomorphic ty) :: scope) :: rest\n\n  let extend_poly (name: string) (scheme: type_scheme) (env: t): t =\n    match env with\n

|\n\n\n## Error Handling and Edge Cases\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of error handling in a type checker as an **emergency response system** — much like how a hospital emergency room must simultaneously treat multiple patients while maintaining the capacity to help new arrivals. When the type checker encounters an error, it can't simply stop and give up; it must provide meaningful diagnosis, continue checking to find additional problems, and gracefully handle edge cases that could cause the system to crash or produce infinite loops.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in type checker error handling is balancing precision with resilience. We need to detect genuine type violations while avoiding cascading errors that obscure the root cause. Additionally, certain algorithmic edge cases like infinite types during unification can cause the system to loop forever if not properly detected.\n\n### Mental Model: Medical Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nConsider how an experienced emergency physician approaches multiple trauma patients. First, they perform triage — identifying the most critical issues that need immediate attention. Then, they treat each problem systematically while monitoring for complications. If one treatment fails, they don't abandon the patient; they try alternative approaches and continue addressing other issues. Finally, they document everything clearly so other physicians can understand what happened and what treatments were attempted.\n\nOur type checker follows this same principle: detect errors early (triage), provide clear diagnostics (documentation), attempt recovery when possible (alternative treatments), and continue checking to find additional issues (treating multiple problems simultaneously).\n\n![Error Handling and Recovery Flow](./diagrams/error-handling-flow.svg)\n\n### Error Classification and Recovery Strategy\n\nThe type checker encounters several categories of errors, each requiring different recovery strategies to enable continued checking:\n\n| Error Category | Examples | Recovery Strategy | Impact on Continued Checking |\n|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------------------|\n| Type Mismatches | `int` used where `bool` expected | Assume expected type for expression | Continue with expected type |\n| Unbound Variables | Variable `x` not in scope | Create fresh type variable | Continue with placeholder type |\n| Arity Mismatches | Function expects 2 args, given 3 | Check available arguments | Continue with partial application |\n| Non-Function Calls | Calling `int` as function | Treat as function returning fresh var | Continue with return type |\n| Infinite Types | `'a = 'a -> int` during unification | Reject unification | Continue with original types |\n| Constraint Solving Failures | Unsatisfiable constraint set | Report conflicts, use partial solution | Continue with best-effort types |\n\nThe core design principle is **graceful degradation**: when the type checker encounters an error, it should provide the most specific error message possible while making reasonable assumptions that allow type checking to continue. This approach maximizes the number of genuine errors found in a single checking pass.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: The goal is not to produce a perfectly typed program after errors, but to find as many genuine type violations as possible while avoiding spurious errors caused by earlier failures.\n\n### Type Error Recovery\n\nType error recovery represents the type checker's ability to continue analysis after encountering type violations. The recovery mechanism must balance two competing goals: avoiding cascading errors that hide real problems, and maintaining enough context to perform meaningful checking of subsequent code.\n\n#### Error Recovery Architecture\n\nThe error recovery system operates through three interconnected mechanisms working together:\n\n**Error Detection and Classification**: When the type checker encounters a violation, it first classifies the error type and determines the appropriate recovery strategy. Each error kind has associated recovery rules that specify what placeholder types or assumptions to make.\n\n**Context Preservation**: The recovery system maintains as much type environment context as possible, ensuring that well-typed portions of the program continue to be checked accurately. This prevents one error from invalidating the analysis of unrelated code sections.\n\n**Error Suppression Logic**: The system tracks which errors are likely consequences of previous errors and suppresses reporting of these cascading failures. This prevents error floods that obscure the original problem.\n\n#### Recovery Type Generation\n\nWhen the type checker encounters an error, it must generate a placeholder type that allows continued checking. The `recover_from_error` function implements this logic:\n\n| Error Kind | Recovery Type Strategy | Rationale |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| `TypeMismatch` | Use expected type if available | Assumes programmer intended correct type |\n| `UnboundVariable` | Fresh type variable | Allows constraint collection to continue |\n| `WrongArity` | Function type with correct arity | Enables checking of provided arguments |\n| `NonFunctionCall` | Function type returning fresh variable | Treats expression as callable |\n| `InvalidOperation` | Result type of operation | Continues with operation's expected result |\n\n#### Error Context Threading\n\nThe type checker threads error information through the checking process using the `check_result` type. Each checking function returns both a type (for successful recovery) and a list of accumulated errors:\n\n| Result Variant | Type Field | Error List | Usage Pattern |\n|---------------|------------|------------|---------------|\n| `Success of ty` | Inferred/checked type | Empty list | Normal successful checking |\n| `Error of type_error list` | Recovery type embedded | All detected errors | Failed checking with recovery |\n\nThe threading mechanism allows errors from nested expressions to bubble up while maintaining the overall checking structure. Parent expressions receive both the recovery type (for continued checking) and the error list (for reporting).\n\n#### Cascading Error Prevention\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of error recovery is preventing cascading errors — spurious error reports caused by the propagation of earlier genuine errors. The system employs several strategies:\n\n**Error Source Tracking**: Each type error includes source location information and context about what checking operation produced it. This allows the system to identify when multiple errors stem from the same root cause.\n\n**Conservative Error Reporting**: When the checker encounters a type mismatch involving a recovery type (like a fresh type variable generated from an earlier error), it applies more lenient reporting rules. These secondary errors are often consequences rather than independent problems.\n\n**Error Suppression Windows**: After reporting a significant error (like an unbound variable), the system temporarily suppresses related errors in the immediate syntactic vicinity. This prevents a single typo from generating dozens of follow-up error messages.\n\n> **Design Decision: Conservative Recovery**\n> - **Context**: Type checkers can either be aggressive (try to infer what the programmer meant) or conservative (make minimal assumptions)\n> - **Options Considered**: 1) Aggressive inference with heuristics, 2) Conservative placeholder types, 3) Immediate failure on first error\n> - **Decision**: Conservative recovery with placeholder types\n> - **Rationale**: Aggressive inference often guesses wrong and hides real errors; immediate failure prevents finding multiple issues in one pass\n> - **Consequences**: May require multiple compile cycles to fix all errors, but each reported error is likely genuine\n\n### Infinite Type Detection\n\nInfinite type detection represents one of the most critical safety mechanisms in the unification algorithm. Without proper infinite type detection (the **occurs check**), the unification process can generate infinitely large type expressions that cause the type checker to run out of memory or loop forever.\n\n#### Understanding Infinite Types\n\nConsider the constraint `'a = 'a -> int` arising from a recursive definition where a variable is used as both a value and a function. If we naively tried to solve this constraint by substitution, we would generate:\n\n1. `'a = 'a -> int`\n2. Substitute first `'a`: `'a = ('a -> int) -> int`\n3. Substitute again: `'a = (('a -> int) -> int) -> int`\n4. Continue infinitely: `'a = ((('a -> int) -> int) -> int) -> int`\n\nThis infinite expansion would continue until the system runs out of memory. The occurs check prevents this by detecting when a type variable appears within its own solution before performing the substitution.\n\n#### The Occurs Check Algorithm\n\nThe `occurs_check` function implements a depth-first traversal of a type expression to determine if a given type variable appears anywhere within it:\n\n| Type Expression | Occurs Check Behavior | Result |\n|-----------------|----------------------|--------|\n| `TVar(name)` | Direct variable comparison | True if names match |\n| `TInt`, `TBool`, `TString` | No variables present | Always false |\n| `TFun(param, return)` | Recursive check on both param and return types | True if variable occurs in either |\n| `TForall(vars, body)` | Check if variable is quantified, then check body | False if quantified, else recurse |\n\nThe algorithm must handle quantified variables correctly — a variable quantified by a `TForall` is bound within that scope and doesn't represent the same variable being checked for occurrence.\n\n#### Occurs Check Integration in Unification\n\nThe occurs check integrates into the unification algorithm at the point where we attempt to bind a type variable to a type expression. The check occurs before performing the substitution:\n\n1. **Variable Binding Attempt**: Unification determines that type variable `'a` should be bound to type expression `t`\n2. **Occurs Check**: Call `occurs_check(\"a\", t)` to verify `'a` doesn't appear in `t`\n3. **Binding Decision**: If occurs check fails, reject the unification; if it passes, proceed with binding\n4. **Substitution Application**: Apply the binding `'a → t` to all remaining constraints\n\nThis integration point is critical because it catches infinite types before they can propagate through the constraint system.\n\n#### Handling Occurs Check Failures\n\nWhen the occurs check detects a potential infinite type, the unification algorithm must handle the failure gracefully:\n\n| Failure Context | Error Reporting | Recovery Strategy |\n|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Simple recursive binding | Report infinite type error with specific variables | Leave variables unbound |\n| Complex constraint system | Report unsatisfiable constraints | Continue with partial solution |\n| Polymorphic instantiation | Report instantiation failure | Use monomorphic fallback |\n\nThe error reporting for infinite types requires careful explanation because the concept is subtle. The error message should explain both what constraint caused the problem and why the constraint represents an impossible type.\n\n#### Edge Cases in Occurs Checking\n\nSeveral edge cases require special handling in the occurs check implementation:\n\n**Quantified Variable Shadowing**: When a type variable is quantified by a `TForall`, it shadows any variable with the same name in the outer scope. The occurs check must respect this scoping to avoid false positives.\n\n**Nested Function Types**: Function types create nested structure where the same variable might appear in multiple positions. The occurs check must traverse all positions to detect any occurrence.\n\n**Partial Substitution Context**: During constraint solving, some variables may already have partial substitutions applied. The occurs check must consider the fully expanded type after applying existing substitutions.\n\n> **Critical Pitfall: Incomplete Occurs Check**\n> - **Problem**: Only checking the immediate structure without recursing into nested types\n> - **Consequence**: Missing infinite types in complex expressions like `'a = ('a * int) -> bool`\n> - **Solution**: Implement complete recursive traversal of all type constructors\n> - **Detection**: Unification loops or memory exhaustion during constraint solving\n\n#### Performance Considerations\n\nThe occurs check adds overhead to unification because it requires traversing type expressions. However, this overhead is necessary for correctness:\n\n| Optimization Strategy | Benefit | Trade-off |\n|----------------------|---------|-----------|\n| Cached occurs results | Faster repeated checks | Memory usage for cache |\n| Early termination | Stop on first occurrence found | None — pure optimization |\n| Structural sharing | Reuse type expression nodes | Complex implementation |\n\nThe most important optimization is early termination — as soon as the occurs check finds the target variable, it can return `true` without checking the remaining structure.\n\n### Common Pitfalls in Error Handling\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Generating Cascading Errors**\nMany type checker implementations generate dozens of follow-up errors from a single root cause. For example, if variable `x` is misspelled as `y`, every subsequent use of `y` generates an \"unbound variable\" error. The fix is implementing error suppression logic that recognizes when errors are likely consequences of previous failures.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inadequate Error Recovery Types**\nUsing overly generic recovery types (like always generating `TInt`) can hide genuine errors in subsequent code. Instead, use context-appropriate recovery types — if expecting a function, generate a function type; if expecting a specific type, use that type.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Occurs Check Bypass**\nImplementing unification without a proper occurs check leads to infinite types that crash the system. Some developers try to optimize by skipping the check, but this is always incorrect. The occurs check is mandatory for sound unification.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Error Location Loss**\nFailing to preserve source location information through error recovery makes it impossible for users to locate problems. Every error should include precise location data, even when the error is detected several steps removed from its source.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Inconsistent Error Terminology**\nUsing technical jargon or inconsistent terminology in error messages confuses users. Establish a consistent vocabulary for error reporting and always explain technical terms in user-friendly language.\n\n### Error Message Design Principles\n\nEffective error messages in type checkers follow several key design principles:\n\n**Specificity Over Generality**: Instead of \"type error,\" specify exactly what types were involved and why they're incompatible. Include the expected type, actual type, and the operation that required compatibility.\n\n**Context Explanation**: Explain not just what went wrong, but why the type checker expected a particular type. This helps users understand the reasoning behind type requirements.\n\n**Actionable Suggestions**: When possible, suggest specific fixes. If a variable is unbound, suggest nearby variables with similar names. If types don't match, suggest explicit conversions or corrections.\n\n**Progressive Detail**: Start with a clear summary, then provide additional detail for users who need it. This serves both beginners (who want simple explanations) and experts (who want precise technical information).\n\n| Error Component | Purpose | Example Content |\n|----------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Primary Message | Clear problem statement | \"Cannot apply function of type `int -> bool` to argument of type `string`\" |\n| Context Explanation | Why this is required | \"Function `f` expects an integer argument, but received a string\" |\n| Location Information | Where the error occurred | \"at line 15, column 8 in file `main.ml`\" |\n| Suggested Fixes | Actionable remedies | \"Consider using `int_of_string` to convert the argument\" |\n| Related Information | Connected context | \"Function `f` was declared at line 5\" |\n\n### Integration with IDE Support\n\nModern type checkers must integrate effectively with development environments to provide real-time feedback. This requires careful design of the error handling system:\n\n**Incremental Error Reporting**: The type checker should report errors as they're discovered rather than waiting for complete checking. This enables faster feedback cycles in interactive environments.\n\n**Error Categorization**: Different error types require different IDE presentation. Syntax errors should be highlighted immediately, while type errors might be presented as squiggly underlines with hover information.\n\n**Quick Fix Integration**: Error messages should include structured information that IDEs can use to offer automatic fixes. This requires embedding fix suggestions in a machine-readable format alongside human-readable messages.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n#### Technology Recommendations\n\n| Component | Simple Option

intentional type errors — checker should continue and find multiple issues\n- Verify error messages include location information and helpful suggestions\n- Check that cascading errors are suppressed appropriately\n\n**After Occurs Check Implementation:**\n- Create test cases with recursive type constraints like `'a = 'a -> int`\n- Verify that unification rejects these constraints instead of looping\n- Test performance with deeply nested type expressions\n- Ensure quantified variables are handled correctly in occurs check\n\n#### Debugging Tips for Error Handling\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Type checker crashes on recursive types | Missing occurs check | Add debug prints in unification | Implement proper occurs_check |\n| Floods of similar error messages | No cascading error prevention | Check error context tracking | Add error suppression logic |\n| Unhelpful \"type error\" messages | Generic error reporting | Examine error construction sites | Use specific error_kind variants |\n| Errors reported at wrong locations | Location information not threaded | Trace location through checking pipeline | Preserve source_location in all contexts |\n| Recovery produces worse errors later | Poor recovery type choice | Log recovery types and subsequent checking | Use context-appropriate recovery types |\n\n\n## Testing Strategy and Milestones\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of testing a type checker as **quality assurance for a complex manufacturing plant** — much like how an automotive factory has inspection checkpoints at every stage of assembly to catch defects early, our type checker testing strategy establishes verification points at each milestone to ensure the foundation is solid before building the next layer. Just as a car manufacturer tests individual components (brakes, engine, transmission) before testing the complete vehicle, we systematically verify type representations, then basic checking, then inference, and finally polymorphism in isolation and combination.\n\nThe challenge with testing a type checker lies in its **multi-layered verification requirements**. Unlike testing a simple function that transforms input to output, a type checker must verify correctness across multiple dimensions simultaneously: syntactic correctness (does the code parse?), semantic correctness (do types match?), inference correctness (are inferred types most general?), and error quality (are error messages helpful?). Each milestone introduces new complexity that could break previously working functionality, making systematic regression testing essential.\n\nOur testing strategy follows a **pyramid architecture** where unit tests form the broad base, integration tests verify component interactions, and end-to-end tests validate complete workflows. This mirrors how civil engineers test bridge components individually (steel strength, bolt tensile strength), then test assemblies (beam connections), and finally test the complete structure under load. The key insight is that type checker bugs often manifest as cascading failures — a subtle bug in unification can cause polymorphism to fail mysteriously, so we need fine-grained tests that isolate the failure source.\n\n### Milestone Verification\n\nEach milestone represents a **checkpoint gate** in our manufacturing analogy — a point where we must verify all functionality works correctly before proceeding. Think of this like software release gates in large companies, where automated tests must pass before code can be promoted to the next environment. The verification strategy ensures we catch integration issues early rather than debugging a complex system where the root cause could be anywhere.\n\n**Milestone 1 Verification focuses on the foundational type system infrastructure.** At this stage, we're essentially testing the \"vocabulary and grammar\" of our type language — can we represent all necessary types correctly, can we compare them for equality, and can we manage type environments properly. This is analogous to testing a compiler's lexer and parser before attempting code generation.\n\n| Test Category | What to Verify | Acceptance Criteria | Red Flags to Watch For |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Type Construction | All type variants can be created and accessed | `TInt`, `TBool`, `TString`, `TVar \"a\"`, `TFun(TInt, TBool)` all construct correctly | Segmentation faults or pattern match failures when accessing type fields |\n| Type Equality | `type_equal` correctly identifies structurally identical types | `type_equal(TFun(TInt, TBool), TFun(TInt, TBool))` returns true | False negatives on identical types or false positives on different types |\n| Type Variable Management | Fresh variables are unique and `fresh_type_var()` never repeats | Multiple calls produce `TVar \"a1\"`, `TVar \"a2\"`, etc. with different names | Variable name collisions or non-deterministic generation |\n| Type Environment Operations | `TypeEnv.extend` and `TypeEnv.lookup` handle scoping correctly | Variables added to inner scope shadow outer scope, lookup searches inside-out | Variables leaking between scopes or lookup finding wrong binding |\n| Type Pretty Printing | `string_of_type` produces readable output for debugging | `TFun(TInt, TBool)` formats as \"int -> bool\" | Cryptic output that makes debugging impossible |\n\nThe critical insight for Milestone 1 is that **type representation bugs cascade through every subsequent milestone**. If `type_equal` has subtle bugs or type variable generation isn't truly unique, you'll see mysterious failures in unification or polymorphism that are extremely difficult to debug. The verification must be exhaustive at this foundational layer.\n\n**Milestone 2 Verification tests the basic type checking engine without inference.** Here we're testing the \"contract enforcement\" system — can we verify that explicitly typed code follows the type rules correctly? This is like testing a building inspector's ability to verify that construction matches the approved blueprints.\n\n| Test Category | What to Verify | Acceptance Criteria | Red Flags to Watch For |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Expression Synthesis | `synthesize_expression_type` correctly determines expression types | Literals infer correct types, binary operations check operand compatibility | Wrong types inferred for literals or operators accepting incompatible types |\n| Expression Checking | `check_expression_type` validates expressions against expected types | Type-annotated expressions verified correctly, mismatches produce clear errors | False positives accepting wrong types or false negatives rejecting correct types |\n| Function Call Validation | Function applications check arity and argument types | Calling `f: int -> bool` with `int` argument succeeds, wrong arity fails | Functions accepting wrong argument types or arity mismatches going undetected |\n| Type Error Generation | Errors include source locations and helpful messages | `make_error` produces errors with file/line information and suggested fixes | Generic error messages without context or missing source location tracking |\n| Error Recovery | Type checking continues after errors to find multiple issues | Multiple type errors in same program all reported, not just first one | Type checking aborting on first error or cascading spurious errors |\n\nThe key verification principle for Milestone 2 is **independent testability** — each type rule should be testable in isolation. If testing function calls requires complex setup of polymorphic types, there's too much coupling between milestones.\n\n**Milestone 3 Verification focuses on constraint-based type inference correctness.** This is where testing becomes significantly more complex because we're verifying not just correctness but **optimality** — does the inference produce the most general type possible? Think of this like testing an optimization algorithm where correctness isn't binary but measured against the theoretical optimum.\n\n| Test Category | What to Verify | Acceptance Criteria | Red Flags to Watch For |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Constraint Generation | `generate_constraints` produces correct equality constraints | `let x = 5 in x + 1` generates constraints `typeof(x) = int`, `typeof(+) = int -> int -> int` | Missing constraints that allow invalid programs or spurious constraints that over-constrain |\n| Unification Algorithm | `unify` finds most general unifiers when they exist | Unifying `'a -> bool` with `int -> 'b` produces `['a := int, 'b := bool]` | Unification failing on solvable constraints or producing overly specific solutions |\n| Occurs Check | Infinite types detected and prevented during unification | Unifying `'a` with `'a -> bool` fails with occurs check error | Infinite types accepted causing stack overflow or infinite loops later |\n| Substitution Application | `apply_subst_to_type` correctly replaces variables throughout type | Applying `['a := int]` to `'a -> 'b` produces `int -> 'b` | Variables not replaced or replaced incorrectly in complex nested types |\n| Inference Integration | Complete inference pipeline produces most general types | `let id = fun x -> x` infers `'a -> 'a` not overly specific type | Inference producing `int -> int` instead of polymorphic `'a -> 'a` |\n\nThe critical testing insight for Milestone 3 is **most general type verification** — it's not enough to verify that inference produces a correct type; you must verify it produces the **most general** correct type. This requires understanding the theoretical optimum for each test case.\n\n**Milestone 4 Verification tests polymorphism with let-generalization and instantiation.** This is the most complex milestone because polymorphism interacts with all previous systems. Think of this like testing a complex mechanical system where every component must work perfectly in isolation and in combination.\n\n| Test Category | What to Verify | Acceptance Criteria | Red Flags to Watch For |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Type Scheme Operations | Type schemes correctly represent and manipulate quantified types | `make_type_scheme([\"a\"], TFun(TVar \"a\", TVar \"a\"))` creates proper forall type | Quantified variables not properly tracked or incorrectly captured |\n| Generalization | `generalize_type` abstracts over appropriate free variables | `let id = fun x -> x` generalizes to `forall a. a -> a` | Over-generalization violating value restriction or under-generalization losing polymorphism |\n| Instantiation | `instantiate_scheme` creates fresh instances with unique variables | Using polymorphic `id` twice gives `'a1 -> 'a1` and `'a2 -> 'a2` with different variables | Variable capture where instances share variables incorrectly |\n| Value Restriction | Generalization correctly applies value restriction | `let r = ref []` stays monomorphic, doesn't generalize to `forall a. ref (list a)` | Unsafe generalization that could violate type soundness |\n| Polymorphic Usage | Polymorphic functions can be used at multiple types in same program | `id 5` and `id true` both type check with same polymorphic `id` | Polymorphic functions locked to first usage type |\n\n> **Key Design Insight**: Milestone verification isn't just about testing new functionality — each milestone must also include **regression tests** that verify all previous milestone functionality still works. Polymorphism changes how types are represented and manipulated, which can subtly break basic type checking in hard-to-detect ways.\n\n### Test Case Categories\n\nTesting a type checker requires **systematic coverage across multiple orthogonal dimensions** rather than ad-hoc test cases. Think of this like testing a complex chemical plant where you must verify correct operation under normal conditions, boundary conditions, error conditions, and combinations thereof. The challenge is ensuring comprehensive coverage without writing thousands of redundant test cases.\n\nOur test categorization follows **black-box and white-box testing principles**. Black-box categories test the external behavior (does the type checker accept/reject programs correctly?), while white-box categories test internal algorithm correctness (does unification produce correct substitutions?). This dual approach catches both specification violations and implementation bugs.\n\n**Type Rule Verification tests the fundamental type system rules systematically.** These tests verify that our type checker correctly implements the theoretical type rules from type theory literature. Think of these as testing the \"constitutional law\" of our type system — the foundational rules that define what programs are legal.\n\n| Rule Category | Test Focus | Example Test Cases | Expected Behavior |\n|---------------|------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Literal Typing | Primitive values have correct built-in types | `5` has type `int`, `true` has type `bool`, `\"hello\"` has type `string` | Literal expressions synthesize correct primitive types |\n| Variable Lookup | Variable references resolve to declared types | `let x : int = 5 in x` where `x` has type `int` | Variable expressions synthesize type from environment |\n| Function Application | Function calls check argument/parameter compatibility | `(fun x : int -> x + 1) 5` where argument matches parameter | Function applications type check with compatible arguments |\n| Function Abstraction | Lambda expressions have proper arrow types | `fun x : int -> x + 1` has type `int -> int` | Lambda expressions synthesize arrow types from parameter and body |\n| Let Binding | Let expressions extend environment correctly | `let x = 5 in x + 1` where `x` available in body with inferred type | Let expressions extend environment for body evaluation |\n| Binary Operations | Operators enforce operand type requirements | `5 + 3` succeeds, `5 + true` fails with type mismatch | Binary operators require compatible operand types |\n| Conditional Expressions | If expressions require boolean condition and matching branches | `if true then 5 else 3` succeeds, `if 5 then true else false` fails | Conditionals enforce boolean condition and unified branch types |\n\nThe systematic approach here tests **each type rule in isolation** before testing combinations. This is crucial because when a complex expression fails to type check, you need to know which specific rule is violated.\n\n**Type Inference Correctness tests the constraint generation and solving algorithms.** These are white-box tests that verify the internal inference mechanisms work correctly. Think of these as testing the \"reasoning engine\" that deduces types from incomplete information.\n\n| Inference Category | Algorithm Focus | Example Test Cases | Expected Behavior |\n|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Constraint Generation | `generate_constraints` produces complete constraint sets | `let f = fun x -> x + 1` generates `typeof(x) = typeof(1) = int`, `typeof(+) = int -> int -> int`, etc. | All type relationships captured as constraints |\n| Simple Unification | `unify` solves basic variable-type constraints | Unify `'a` with `int` produces substitution `['a := int]` | Basic unification produces correct substitutions |\n| Complex Unification | `unify` handles nested type structures | Unify `'a -> 'b` with `int -> bool` produces `['a := int, 'b := bool]` | Structural unification decomposes and solves recursively |\n| Unification Failure | `unify` detects unsolvable constraints | Unify `int` with `bool` fails with type mismatch error | Incompatible types detected and reported clearly |\n| Occurs Check | Infinite type prevention during unification | Unify `'a` with `'a -> int` fails with occurs check error | Infinite types prevented with clear diagnostic |\n| Substitution Composition | Multiple substitutions combine correctly | Composing `['a := int]` and `['b := 'a]` produces `['a := int, 'b := int]` | Substitution composition maintains consistency |\n| Most General Inference | Complete inference produces optimal types | `fun x -> x` infers `'a -> 'a` not specific type like `int -> int` | Inference maximizes polymorphism where possible |\n\nThe key insight for inference testing is **theoretical optimality verification** — you must know what the most general type should be for each test case and verify that inference achieves it.\n\n**Error Handling and Recovery tests verify that the type checker behaves gracefully when encountering invalid programs.** These tests are crucial because in practice, most programs a type checker sees are incorrect during development. Think of this like testing a medical diagnostic system's behavior on edge cases and unusual symptoms.\n\n| Error Category | Error Scenario | Test Cases | Expected Recovery Behavior |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Type Mismatch | Incompatible types in context | `5 + true`, `if 5 then 1 else 2` | Clear error message with expected vs actual types |\n| Unbound Variables | Variable used before declaration | `x + 1` where `x` not in scope | Error with suggestion to declare variable |\n| Arity Mismatch | Function called with wrong number of arguments | `(fun x y -> x + y) 5` missing second argument | Error showing expected vs actual argument count |\n| Non-function Call | Attempting to call non-function value | `5(3)` trying to call integer | Error explaining that value is not a function |\n| Multiple Errors | Program with several independent type errors | Function with multiple type mismatches | All errors reported, not just first one |\n| Cascading Errors | Error recovery prevents spurious follow-on errors | Unbound variable doesn't cause every usage to error | Error recovery limits cascading failures |\n| Error Context | Error messages include helpful source location and context | Errors show file, line, column, and surrounding code | Developers can quickly locate and understand errors |\n\n> **Critical Testing Principle**: Error recovery testing is just as important as correctness testing. A type checker that produces avalanches of spurious errors after encountering one real error is unusable in practice, even if it's theoretically correct on valid programs.\n\n**Polymorphism Integration tests verify that let-polymorphism works correctly in complex scenarios.** These are the most sophisticated tests because polymorphism interacts with every other system component. Think of these as integration tests for a complex distributed system where timing and coordination matter.\n\n| Polymorphism Category | Integration Scenario | Test Cases | Expected Polymorphic Behavior |\n|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|------------------------------|\n| Let Generalization | Polymorphic bindings created at let sites | `let id = fun x -> x in (id 5, id true)` | `id` generalized to `forall a. a -> a` and usable at multiple types |\n| Value Restriction | Generalization appropriately restricted for non-values | `let r = ref []` stays monomorphic | Potentially unsafe expressions not generalized |\n| Instantiation | Polymorphic values instantiated with fresh variables | Using `id` twice creates independent type variable instances | Each usage gets fresh type variables avoiding capture |\n| Nested Polymorphism | Polymorphic functions within polymorphic contexts | `let outer = fun f -> let inner = fun x -> f x in (inner 1, inner true)` | Nested generalization and instantiation work correctly |\n| Recursive Functions | Polymorphic recursion with type annotations | `let rec length : forall a. list a -> int = ...` | Recursive functions can be polymorphic with proper annotation |\n| Higher-Order Polymorphism | Polymorphic functions as arguments and results | `let twice f x = f (f x)` infers `('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a` | Higher-order functions maintain polymorphism correctly |\n\nThe polymorphism tests are **integration tests by nature** because they exercise the entire type checking pipeline with maximum complexity. These tests often reveal subtle bugs in earlier milestones that only manifest under polymorphic conditions.\n\n**Systematic Edge Case Coverage ensures robustness under unusual but legal conditions.** Real-world type checkers must handle programs that push the boundaries of the type system.

Just as medical diagnosis requires understanding how different organ systems interact, type checker debugging demands deep understanding of how type environments, constraint generation, unification, and error recovery components work together.\n\nThe fundamental challenge in type checker debugging lies in the **cascade effect** — a single algorithmic error can propagate through multiple phases, causing symptoms that appear far from the actual root cause. Unlike simpler programs where bugs manifest locally, type checker bugs often involve complex interactions between constraint generation, unification, environment threading, and substitution application. A bug in occurs check implementation might not surface until polymorphic instantiation fails mysteriously, or an environment scoping error might only become apparent when let-polymorphism produces incorrect generalizations.\n\nThis section provides systematic debugging methodologies for the three most challenging areas: unification algorithm failures, type environment scoping problems, and type inference behavioral issues. Each area requires different diagnostic approaches because they involve different algorithmic phases and data structures.\n\n### Unification Algorithm Debugging\n\nThink of debugging unification as **forensic analysis of a negotiation breakdown** — much like how diplomatic negotiations can fail at various stages (miscommunication, incompatible demands, procedural violations), unification can fail during constraint decomposition, occurs check violations, or substitution composition errors. The key to successful debugging lies in systematic tracing of the constraint solving process to identify exactly where and why the negotiation broke down.\n\nThe unification algorithm represents the heart of constraint-based type inference, and its failures can manifest in numerous ways. Understanding the anatomy of unification failures requires deep knowledge of how constraints are generated, how the Robinson unification algorithm processes them, and how substitutions compose and apply to type expressions.\n\n![Unification Algorithm Process](./diagrams/unification-algorithm.svg)\n\n#### Constraint Generation Trace Analysis\n\nThe first step in unification debugging involves tracing constraint generation to ensure the initial constraint set accurately reflects the program's type requirements. Constraint generation failures often manifest as missing constraints (leading to overly permissive inference) or incorrect constraints (leading to unsatisfiable constraint sets).\n\n**Constraint Generation Debugging Table:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Root Cause | Diagnostic Steps | Corrective Action |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Function calls accept wrong argument types | Missing argument-parameter constraints | Print generated constraints for function call expressions | Add constraint generation for each argument position |\n| Binary operators succeed with incompatible types | Operator constraints not generated | Trace constraint generation through binary expression handling | Implement operator-specific type constraint generation |\n| Variable references have wrong inferred types | Environment lookup produces wrong type during constraint generation | Print environment contents at variable reference sites | Fix environment threading or lookup implementation |\n| Let-bound variables lose polymorphic types | Generalization constraints missing | Trace let-binding constraint generation and generalization | Add proper generalization constraint handling |\n| Assignment statements allow type mismatches | Assignment compatibility constraints missing | Examine assignment statement constraint generation | Generate equality constraints between LHS and RHS types |\n\nThe constraint generation phase must produce a complete and accurate representation of all type requirements in the program. Each expression construct should generate appropriate constraints based on its typing rules. For function calls, this means generating constraints between each argument and its corresponding parameter type. For binary operators, this means constraining both operands to be compatible with the operator's type signature.\n\n> **Critical Insight**: Constraint generation bugs often manifest as \"phantom\" type errors — the unification algorithm correctly identifies that constraints cannot be satisfied, but the constraints themselves don't accurately represent the program's intended typing behavior. Always verify constraint correctness before debugging unification failures.\n\n#### Robinson Unification Algorithm Tracing\n\nThe core unification algorithm processes constraints by decomposing complex type expressions into simpler unifiable components and building substitutions that make constraint pairs equal. Unification failures typically occur during occurs check violations, incompatible constructor mismatches, or substitution composition errors.\n\n**Unification Step-by-Step Debugging Process:**\n\n1. **Constraint Preprocessing**: Examine the input constraint set for obviously unsatisfiable constraints (like `TInt` unified with `TBool`). These indicate constraint generation problems rather than unification algorithm issues.\n\n2. **Constraint Ordering Analysis**: Verify that constraint processing order doesn't affect the final result. The unification algorithm should be deterministic regardless of constraint ordering, but implementation bugs can introduce order dependencies.\n\n3. **Variable Binding Tracing**: For each type variable unification, trace the binding process. Verify that the occurs check correctly prevents infinite type creation and that variable substitutions properly propagate through the constraint set.\n\n4. **Constructor Decomposition Verification**: When unifying complex types like `TFun(TInt, TVar \"a\")` with `TFun(TVar \"b\", TBool)`, verify that the algorithm correctly decomposes into parameter and return type constraints.\n\n5. **Substitution Composition Checking**: Trace how individual variable bindings compose into the final substitution. Verify that substitution application maintains type structure integrity.\n\n**Unification Failure Pattern Analysis:**\n\n| Failure Pattern | Algorithmic Cause | Debugging Focus | Implementation Fix |\n|----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| \"Cannot unify TInt with TBool\" on seemingly compatible expressions | Constraint generation produced wrong constraint | Trace constraint generation for the failing expression | Fix constraint generation logic |\n| \"Occurs check failed\" on recursive type definitions | Infinite type created during unification | Examine occurs check implementation and recursive type handling | Implement proper occurs check with cycle detection |\n| \"Substitution application failed\" during constraint solving | Substitution composition or application error | Trace substitution building and application steps | Fix substitution data structure and application logic |\n| \"Cannot unify function types\" with matching signatures | Function type decomposition error | Examine function type constraint decomposition | Fix function type unification to properly handle parameter and return types |\n| \"Type variable escapes its scope\" during polymorphic unification | Variable capture during substitution | Trace variable scoping and substitution application | Implement proper variable scoping and fresh variable generation |\n\nThe occurs check deserves special attention because its failures often indicate deeper issues with type variable scoping or constraint generation. When the occurs check reports `TVar \"a\"` occurs in `TFun(TVar \"a\", TInt)`, this might indicate a genuine recursive type attempt, or it might reveal that constraint generation incorrectly created self-referential constraints.\n\n#### Substitution Application and Composition Debugging\n\nSubstitution application represents the final phase of constraint solving, where the computed variable bindings transform type expressions into their concrete forms. Substitution bugs often manifest as variables remaining unsubstituted, incorrect type structure after substitution, or substitution composition producing inconsistent results.\n\n**Substitution Debugging Methodology:**\n\nThe substitution system maintains mappings from type variables to concrete types, and these mappings must be consistently applied throughout the type checker. Substitution composition combines multiple partial solutions into complete variable bindings, and this process can fail if the individual substitutions conflict or if the composition algorithm doesn't properly handle variable dependencies.\n\n**Substitution Application Trace Points:**\n\n1. **Variable Resolution Verification**: For each type variable in the original constraint set, verify that the final substitution contains an appropriate binding and that the binding doesn't introduce new unresolved variables.\n\n2. **Composition Consistency Checking**: When composing substitutions `s1` and `s2`, verify that variables bound in both substitutions receive consistent bindings and that the composition properly handles variable dependencies.\n\n3. **Type Structure Preservation**: After substitution application, verify that the resulting type expressions maintain proper structure and don't contain malformed type constructions.\n\n4. **Occurs Check Preservation**: Ensure that substitution application doesn't introduce occurs check violations that weren't present in the original constraint set.\n\n> **Decision: Substitution Representation Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Substitutions can be represented as association lists, hash tables, or functional maps, each with different performance and correctness characteristics\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   - Association lists with linear lookup\n>   - Mutable hash tables with constant-time lookup\n>   - Immutable functional maps with logarithmic lookup\n> - **Decision**: Use immutable functional maps for substitution representation\n> - **Rationale**: Immutable maps prevent substitution corruption bugs, support efficient composition operations, and provide automatic conflict detection during composition\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly higher memory usage but significantly easier debugging and guaranteed correctness properties\n\n### Type Environment Issues\n\nThink of debugging type environment problems as **investigating security clearance violations** — much like how security systems must properly track who has access to what resources at what times, type environments must accurately track which variables are in scope with what types throughout the program's execution. Environment bugs often manifest as access control failures: variables that should be accessible become unreachable, or variables that should be out of scope remain accessible with stale type information.\n\nType environment debugging presents unique challenges because environment state changes continuously during type checking, and environment threading errors can cause subtle bugs that only manifest in complex nested scoping scenarios. The type environment serves as the authoritative source for variable type information, and any corruption or incorrect threading can cascade through the entire type checking process.\n\n![Type Environment Scoping](./diagrams/type-environment-scoping.svg)\n\n#### Lexical Scoping Violation Diagnosis\n\nLexical scoping requires that variable visibility follows the program's textual structure — inner scopes can access outer scope variables, but outer scopes cannot access inner scope variables, and variable shadowing should hide outer definitions without destroying them. Scoping violations typically result from incorrect environment extension, improper scope restoration, or variable lookup implementation errors.\n\n**Scoping Violation Symptom Analysis:**\n\n| Symptom | Environment Problem | Diagnostic Approach | Solution Strategy |\n|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Variables accessible outside their declared scope | Scope restoration failure | Trace environment state before and after scope exit | Implement proper scope stack management |\n| Inner scope variables shadow outer variables permanently | Environment restoration doesn't restore shadowed bindings | Examine environment extension and restoration logic | Use environment layering instead of destructive updates |\n| Variable lookups find stale type information | Environment threading carries outdated state | Trace environment threading through recursive calls | Fix environment parameter passing and result handling |\n| Let-bound variables invisible in their own body | Environment extension happens after body checking | Trace environment state during let-binding processing | Extend environment before checking let body |\n| Function parameters not visible in function body | Parameter binding environment not threaded to body checking | Examine function definition type checking | Add parameter bindings before checking function body |\n\nThe environment threading problem represents one of the most subtle debugging challenges. Environment threading requires that each type checking function receives the current environment state and returns an updated environment reflecting any new bindings introduced during checking. Threading errors occur when the environment flow doesn't properly reflect the program's execution semantics.\n\n**Environment Threading Debug Trace Process:**\n\n1. **Entry Point Verification**: At each function entry point, verify that the received environment contains all expected bindings from the calling context. Missing bindings indicate threading errors in the caller.\n\n2. **Modification Tracking**: Track all environment modifications during function execution. Verify that modifications correctly reflect the semantic effects of the constructs being checked.\n\n3. **Exit Point Validation**: At function exit points, verify that the returned environment contains appropriate modifications and that temporary bindings (like function parameters) are properly handled.\n\n4. **Recursive Call Environment Flow**: For recursive type checking calls, verify that environment updates from nested calls properly propagate back to the calling context.\n\n5. **Scope Boundary Handling**: At scope boundaries (function definitions, let expressions, block statements), verify that environment modifications correctly implement scoping semantics.\n\n#### Variable Lookup Implementation Debugging\n\nVariable lookup implementation must traverse environment layers in the correct order, handle variable shadowing properly, and distinguish between different binding types (monomorphic vs. polymorphic). Lookup failures can result from incorrect layer traversal, improper binding type handling, or environment corruption.\n\n**Variable Lookup Error Pattern Analysis:**\n\nThe `lookup` function searches environment layers from innermost to outermost, returning the first matching variable binding. This implementation must handle several edge cases: variables that aren't bound in any scope, variables bound in multiple scopes (shadowing), and variables bound with different binding types (monomorphic vs. polymorphic).\n\n**Lookup Implementation Debugging Table:**\n\n| Lookup Failure | Implementation Issue | Debug Investigation | Corrective Implementation |\n|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Variables not found despite being in scope | Layer traversal order incorrect | Print environment contents and traversal order | Implement inside-out layer traversal |\n| Wrong variable bindings returned from lookup | Shadowing logic incorrect | Trace lookup through nested scopes with same variable names | Return first match during inside-out traversal |\n| Polymorphic variables treated as monomorphic | Binding type handling wrong | Examine binding type discrimination in lookup | Properly handle `Monomorphic` vs `Polymorphic` binding constructors |\n| Variables found in wrong scopes | Environment layer structure incorrect | Examine environment extension and scope management | Fix environment layering to properly represent scope nesting |\n| Lookup performance degrades with nesting depth | Linear search through all layers | Profile lookup performance in deeply nested scopes | Optimize with scoped caching or hash-based lookup |\n\nThe distinction between `Monomorphic` and `Polymorphic` bindings represents a critical aspect of lookup implementation. Polymorphic bindings require instantiation at each use site (replacing quantified variables with fresh variables), while monomorphic bindings can be used directly. Mixing up these binding types leads to incorrect generalization behavior.\n\n> **Critical Implementation Detail**: The `lookup` function must distinguish between finding no binding (`None`) and finding a binding with an incorrect type. Type compatibility checking happens after successful lookup, not during the lookup process itself.\n\n#### Environment Extension and Restoration Patterns\n\nEnvironment extension adds new variable bindings to the innermost scope, while environment restoration removes temporary scopes when exiting scope boundaries. These operations must maintain environment invariants and properly handle the interaction between temporary bindings and permanent bindings.\n\n**Environment Lifecycle Management:**\n\nEnvironment extension using `extend_mono` and `extend_poly` adds bindings to the current innermost scope layer. The implementation must ensure that extension doesn't corrupt existing bindings and that new bindings properly shadow outer bindings with the same name. Environment restoration must remove temporary scope layers without affecting outer layers.\n\n**Scope Management Debugging Process:**\n\n1. **Extension Verification**: After each environment extension, verify that the new binding appears in the innermost layer and that existing bindings remain intact. Extension should not modify any existing layers.\n\n2. **Shadowing Behavior Checking**: When extending with a variable name that exists in outer scopes, verify that lookup returns the new binding and that the outer binding remains accessible after scope restoration.\n\n3. **Restoration Integrity Testing**: After scope restoration, verify that temporary bindings are removed and that previously shadowed bindings become accessible again. Restoration should be the exact inverse of extension.\n\n4. **Layer Structure Validation**: Throughout environment modifications, verify that the layer structure accurately reflects the program's scope nesting. Each layer should correspond to a specific syntactic scope boundary.\n\n5. **Binding Type Preservation**: Verify that environment operations preserve binding types (`Monomorphic` vs `Polymorphic`) and that binding type changes only occur through explicit generalization or instantiation operations.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Destructive Environment Updates**\nMany type checker implementations incorrectly implement environment extension through destructive updates that modify existing environment layers. This breaks environment restoration and causes variables to remain accessible outside their proper scopes. Always implement environment extension through non-destructive layering that preserves the ability to restore previous environment states.\n\n### Type Inference Problems\n\nThink of debugging type inference as **investigating detective reasoning failures** — much like how a detective's investigation can go wrong through missing evidence, incorrect deductions, or faulty reasoning processes, type inference can fail through inadequate constraint generation, flawed unification logic, or incorrect type generalization. The key to successful inference debugging lies in understanding which phase of the inference pipeline is producing unexpected results and why.\n\nType inference represents the most complex aspect of type checker implementation because it involves the coordinated interaction of multiple algorithmic components: constraint generation from program syntax, constraint solving through unification, and type generalization through let-polymorphism. Each component can fail independently, and failures often manifest as seemingly unrelated symptoms in the final inferred types.\n\n![Constraint Solving Sequence](./diagrams/constraint-solving-sequence.svg)\n\n#### Inference Result Analysis and Validation\n\nType inference should produce the most general correct types for program expressions — types that are as permissive as possible while still ensuring type safety. Inference problems manifest as overly specific types (lost generality), overly general types (incorrect inference), or completely wrong types (algorithmic failures).\n\n**Inference Quality Assessment Framework:**\n\nThe quality of inference results can be evaluated along several dimensions: correctness (do the inferred types prevent type errors), generality (are the types as polymorphic as possible), and consistency (do similar expressions receive similar inferred types). Each dimension requires different validation approaches.\n\n**Inference Result Validation Table:**\n\n| Quality Dimension | Expected Behavior | Validation Method | Failure Diagnosis |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Type Correctness | Inferred types prevent runtime type errors | Run programs with inferred types and verify no type violations | Examine constraint generation and solving for missed constraints |\n| Maximum Generality | Types are as polymorphic as the program allows | Compare inferred types with hand-written most general types | Investigate generalization algorithm and value restriction |\n| Inference Consistency | Similar expressions get similar types | Compare inferred types for structurally similar expressions | Examine constraint generation consistency and environment handling |\n| Error Locality | Type errors reported at actual error sites | Verify error locations correspond to actual type violations | Investigate error propagation and constraint solving |\n| Performance Scalability | Inference time grows reasonably with program size | Profile inference performance on programs of varying sizes | Optimize constraint generation and solving algorithms |\n\nThe most general type property represents the gold standard for type inference quality. Given a program expression, the inference algorithm should produce the most general type that allows the expression to be used in as many contexts as possible while maintaining type safety. Deviation from maximum generality often indicates problems with the generalization algorithm or constraint solving process.\n\n**Generality Verification Process:**\n\n1. **Manual Type Derivation**: For problematic expressions, manually derive the most general type using paper-and-pencil type inference rules. This provides the ground truth for comparison with algorithmic results.\n\n2. **Algorithmic Trace Comparison**: Compare the algorithmic inference steps with the manual derivation to identify where the algorithm diverges from optimal behavior.\n\n3. **Constraint Set Analysis**: Examine the generated constraint set to verify that it accurately captures all type requirements without introducing spurious constraints that limit generality.\n\n4. **Generalization Point Investigation**: For let-bound expressions, verify that generalization occurs at appropriate points and quantifies over all genuinely free variables.\n\n#### Constraint Generation Consistency Issues\n\nConstraint generation must produce consistent constraint sets that accurately reflect the program's type requirements. Inconsistency problems arise when similar language constructs generate different constraint patterns or when constraint generation doesn't properly handle context-dependent typing rules.\n\n**Constraint Generation Consistency Debugging:**\n\nThe constraint generation phase transforms program syntax into type equality requirements, and this transformation must be consistent across similar syntactic constructs. Inconsistency often results from incomplete case analysis in constraint generation functions or from failure to properly handle context-sensitive typing rules.\n\n**Common Constraint Generation Inconsistencies:**\n\n| Inconsistency Pattern | Manifestation | Root Cause Analysis | Resolution Strategy |\n|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Function calls generate different constraints for same argument patterns | Same function called with same argument types produces different constraints | Examine function call constraint generation for context dependencies | Standardize constraint generation to depend only on call site information |\n| Binary operators produce asymmetric constraints | `a + b` and `b + a` generate different constraint sets | Investigate binary operator constraint generation logic | Ensure operator constraints are symmetric when operators are commutative |\n| Let-binding generalization varies with expression complexity | Simple expressions generalize differently than complex expressions | Examine generalization criteria and value restriction implementation | Apply consistent generalization rules regardless of expression complexity |\n| Variable references produce inconsistent constraints in different contexts | Same variable reference generates different constraints depending on usage context | Investigate environment lookup and constraint generation interaction | Separate variable lookup from constraint generation context |\n| Nested function definitions lose type information | Inner functions can't access outer function type information | Examine environment threading through nested definitions | Fix environment scoping for nested function definitions |\n\nConstraint generation debugging requires systematic comparison of generated constraints for similar expressions. The constraint generation algorithm should be deterministic and context-independent — the same expression syntax should always generate the same constraint pattern regardless of where it appears in the program.\n\n> **Decision: Constraint Generation Architecture**\n> - **Context**: Constraint generation can be implemented as a single large function with pattern matching or as a collection of specialized functions per expression type\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   - Monolithic constraint generation with exhaustive pattern matching\n>   - Modular constraint generation with per-construct specialized functions\n>   - Visitor pattern-based constraint generation with traversal separation\n> - **Decision**: Use modular constraint generation with specialized functions per expression type\n> - **Rationale**: Modular approach provides better testability, easier debugging through isolated constraint generation for each construct, and clearer separation of concerns\n> - **Consequences**: Slightly more complex dispatch logic but significantly easier maintenance and debugging\n\n#### Polymorphism and Generalization Debugging\n\nPolymorphic type inference through let-polymorphism represents the most sophisticated aspect of type inference, and generalization bugs can be particularly subtle. Generalization must occur at appropriate syntactic points, quantify over the correct set of type variables, and respect value restriction requirements.\n\n**Let-Polymorphism Implementation Debugging:**\n\nLet-polymorphism allows expressions bound by let-constructs to be used polymorphically throughout their scope. The implementation requires careful coordination between type inference (determining what type to generalize), generalization (deciding which variables to quantify), and instantiation (creating fresh type variables at use sites).\n\n**Generalization Process Debug Analysis:**\n\n1. **Generalization Point Identification**: Verify that generalization occurs exactly at let-binding sites and not at other expression positions. Premature generalization leads to incorrect polymorphism, while delayed generalization loses polymorphic opportunities.\n\n2. **Free Variable Calculation**: For each generalization site, verify that the free variable calculation correctly identifies which type variables should be quantified. Variables free in the current environment should not be generalized.\n\n3. **Value Restriction Compliance**: Verify that value restriction properly prevents generalization of expressions that might contain mutable references or other side-effecting operations.\n\n4. **Instantiation Consistency**: At polymorphic variable use sites, verify that instantiation creates fresh type variables and properly substitutes them for quantified variables.\n\n5. **Type Scheme Representation**: Verify that type schemes correctly represent polymorphic types and that type scheme operations (instantiation, substitution application) preserve polymorphic type structure.\n\n**Polymorphism Debugging Error Patterns:**\n\n| Error Pattern | Symptom | Algorithmic Cause | Debugging Focus | Fix Strategy |\n|---------------|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Variables lose polymorphic types | Functions that should be polymorphic become monomorphic | Generalization not occurring or quantifying wrong variables | Examine generalization trigger conditions and free variable calculation | Fix generalization algorithm and variable scoping |\n| Invalid polymorphic generalization | Variables generalized that should remain monomorphic | Value restriction not applied or environment analysis incorrect | Investigate value restriction implementation and environment free variable analysis | Implement proper value restriction and environment analysis |\n| Instantiation creates wrong types | Polymorphic functions called with wrong inferred argument types | Instantiation algorithm creates incorrect fresh variables | Trace instantiation process and variable substitution | Fix instantiation to properly handle quantified variables |\n| Type scheme operations corrupt polymorphic types | Polymorphic types become malformed during constraint solving | Type scheme substitution or composition errors | Examine type scheme representation and operations | Implement correct type scheme operations with proper variable handling |\n| Polymorphic recursion fails | Recursive functions can't call themselves at different types | Recursive generalization or environment handling incorrect | Investigate recursive function type checking and environment threading | Handle recursive function generalization properly |\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Premature Generalization**\nA common error involves generalizing types too early in the inference process, before all constraints have been solved. This leads to polymorphic types that don't reflect the actual constraint requirements. Always perform generalization after complete constraint solving, and only at syntactic let-binding sites.\n\nThe value restriction represents a critical correctness requirement for generalization. Expressions that might contain mutable state or perform side effects cannot be safely generalized because polymorphic instantiation might violate type safety. The value restriction prevents generalization of non-syntactic values, ensuring that only genuinely pure expressions receive polymorphic types.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**Technology

foundation\n\nThink of future extensions as **architectural expansion plans for a well-built house** — much like how a solidly constructed home with good foundations, electrical, and plumbing can later be expanded with new rooms, smart home systems, or energy-efficient upgrades. Our type checker, once built with the four core milestones, provides a robust foundation that can support sophisticated type system features without requiring fundamental rewrites. Each extension leverages the existing infrastructure while adding new capabilities that enhance the language's expressiveness and safety guarantees.\n\nThe beauty of our constraint-based architecture is that it naturally accommodates extensions through additional constraint generation rules, new type constructors in the `ty` algebraic data type, and enhanced unification procedures. The modular design separating type representation, environment management, inference engine, and error reporting means that most extensions can be added incrementally without disrupting the core functionality.\n\nThis section explores the most impactful extensions that would transform our basic functional language type checker into a production-ready system comparable to languages like Haskell, Rust, or modern TypeScript. Each extension is presented with its conceptual foundation, integration approach, implementation complexity, and the new capabilities it unlocks for language users.\n\n### Algebraic Data Types and Pattern Matching\n\n**Algebraic data types (ADTs)** represent the next logical evolution beyond basic types — think of them as **structured data blueprints with multiple construction patterns**, much like how a vehicle can be constructed as either a car (with doors, engine, seats) or a motorcycle (with handlebars, engine, wheels) or a truck (with cargo bed, engine, cab). Each construction pattern, called a **constructor**, defines what data must be provided and how it's arranged.\n\nThe fundamental insight is that ADTs combine **product types** (structs/records that hold multiple pieces of data simultaneously) and **sum types** (unions that represent one of several possible alternatives). This creates a powerful type system feature that enables precise modeling of domain concepts while maintaining compile-time safety guarantees.\n\nConsider how we might represent a simple expression language within our typed language:\n\n| ADT Constructor | Parameters | Represents | Example Usage |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `Const` | `int` | Integer literal | `Const 42` |\n| `Add` | `expr * expr` | Addition operation | `Add(Const 1, Const 2)` |\n| `Mul` | `expr * expr` | Multiplication operation | `Mul(Const 3, Add(Const 1, Const 2))` |\n| `Var` | `string` | Variable reference | `Var \"x\"` |\n\nThe type system extension requires several new components in our `ty` representation:\n\n| New Type Constructor | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `TConstructor` | `TConstructor of string * ty list` | Represents a data constructor with parameter types |\n| `TSum` | `TSum of (string * ty list) list` | Represents a sum type with all possible constructors |\n| `TRecord` | `TRecord of (string * ty) list` | Represents a product type with named fields |\n\nThe constraint generation process must handle constructor applications by verifying that the provided arguments match the constructor's parameter types and then unifying the result with the expected ADT type. Pattern matching introduces **exhaustiveness checking** — the compiler must verify that all possible constructors are handled in match expressions.\n\n> **Decision: Constructor Type Checking Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Constructor applications need type checking, and pattern matches need exhaustiveness verification\n> - **Options Considered**: \n>   1. Treat constructors as regular functions with special typing rules\n>   2. Add dedicated constraint types for constructor applications and pattern matches\n>   3. Extend the unification algorithm with constructor-aware rules\n> - **Decision**: Treat constructors as special functions with ADT-specific constraint generation\n> - **Rationale**: Leverages existing function application infrastructure while enabling precise type checking for constructor patterns\n> - **Consequences**: Enables clean integration with existing inference engine but requires constructor environment management\n\nPattern matching introduces **coverage analysis** requirements:\n\n| Analysis Type | Purpose | Implementation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Exhaustiveness** | Ensure all constructors are matched | Generate constraint that match arms cover all constructors in sum type |\n| **Redundancy** | Detect unreachable match arms | Track which constructor patterns have been seen and warn on duplicates |\n| **Variable Binding** | Type variables bound in patterns | Extend environment with pattern variables during constraint generation |\n\nThe error reporting system needs enhancement to provide constructor-specific messages:\n\n| Error Type | Detection | Message Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Constructor Arity** | Wrong number of arguments to constructor | \"Constructor `Add` expects 2 arguments but got 1\" |\n| **Non-Exhaustive Match** | Missing constructor cases | \"Pattern match not exhaustive, missing cases: `Mul`, `Var`\" |\n| **Constructor Not Found** | Unknown constructor name | \"Constructor `Sub` not defined for type `expr`\" |\n\n### Type Classes and Interfaces\n\n**Type classes** provide **structured polymorphism with constraints** — think of them as **professional certification requirements** where certain functions can only be called on types that have been \"certified\" to support specific operations. Unlike simple polymorphism where `'a -> 'a` works with any type, type classes let us write `'a -> 'a` where `'a` must support equality comparison, arithmetic operations, or string conversion.\n\nThis extension transforms our type system from supporting only **parametric polymorphism** (generic over any type) to supporting **ad-hoc polymorphism** (generic over types that satisfy constraints). The classic example is a comparison function that works with any type supporting equality:\n\n```\nequal : forall 'a. Eq 'a => 'a -> 'a -> bool\n```\n\nThe type signature reads: \"for any type `'a` that implements the `Eq` type class, `equal` takes two values of type `'a` and returns a boolean.\"\n\nThe implementation requires extending our type representation with **qualified types**:\n\n| New Type Component | Purpose | Structure |\n|---|---|---|\n| `constraint_` | Represents type class membership | `constraint_` = `string * ty` (class name, type) |\n| `qualified_type` | Type with constraint requirements | `qualified_type` = `constraint_ list * ty` |\n| `TQualified` | Qualified type constructor | `TQualified of qualified_type` |\n\nType class definitions specify the **interface contract**:\n\n| Type Class Component | Purpose | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Class Name** | Unique identifier | `Eq`, `Ord`, `Show` |\n| **Type Parameter** | Type being constrained | `'a` in `class Eq 'a` |\n| **Method Signatures** | Required operations | `equal : 'a -> 'a -> bool` |\n| **Superclass Constraints** | Dependencies on other classes | `Ord` requires `Eq` |\n\n**Instance declarations** provide implementations for specific types:\n\n| Instance Component | Purpose | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Target Type** | Type receiving implementation | `int` for `instance Eq int` |\n| **Method Implementations** | Concrete function definitions | `let equal x y = x = y` |\n| **Context Requirements** | Constraints on type parameters | `Eq 'a` required for `instance Eq ('a list)` |\n\nThe constraint solving process becomes significantly more complex, requiring **instance resolution**:\n\n1. **Constraint Collection**: Gather all type class constraints from function calls\n2. **Instance Matching**: Find applicable instances for each constraint  \n3. **Context Reduction**: Simplify constraints using instance contexts\n4. **Coherence Checking**: Ensure unique instance resolution\n5. **Dictionary Construction**: Generate evidence for constraint satisfaction\n\n> **Decision: Instance Resolution Strategy**\n> - **Context**: Type class constraints need resolution to concrete instances during compilation\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Global instance table with simple lookup\n>   2. Constraint solving integrated with unification\n>   3. Separate constraint resolution pass after type inference\n> - **Decision**: Separate constraint resolution pass with instance environment\n> - **Rationale**: Separates type inference concerns from instance selection, enabling better error messages and debugging\n> - **Consequences**: Requires two-phase compilation but provides cleaner architecture and better extensibility\n\nThe error reporting system must handle type class-specific failures:\n\n| Error Category | Trigger | Message Format |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Missing Instance** | No instance found for constraint | \"No instance for `Show (int -> int)` arising from expression...\" |\n| **Ambiguous Instance** | Multiple matching instances | \"Ambiguous instance for `Num 'a`; candidates: `Int`, `Float`\" |\n| **Context Too Weak** | Function requires stronger constraints | \"Could not deduce `Ord 'a` from context `Eq 'a`\" |\n\n### Row Types and Extensible Records\n\n**Row types** enable **flexible record structures with compile-time safety** — think of them as **adaptive forms where you can add or remove fields** while ensuring that any function requiring specific fields will always find them present. This feature addresses the rigidity of traditional record types where every record must have exactly the fields defined in its type.\n\nThe key insight is representing record types as **rows of field-type pairs** with a **row variable** that can be instantiated with additional fields. A function that only needs a `name` field can work with any record containing at least that field, regardless of what other fields are present.\n\nRow types use the notation `{name: string | r}` where `r` is a row variable representing \"whatever other fields might be present.\" This enables **structural subtyping** for records — a record with more fields can be used where one with fewer fields is expected.\n\nThe type representation requires new constructors:\n\n| Row Type Component | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `TRow` | `TRow of (string * ty) list * ty option` | Row with fields and optional tail variable |\n| `TRecord` | `TRecord of ty` | Record type containing a row |\n| `field_constraint` | `field_constraint` = `ty * string * ty * ty` | Constraint that row contains field |\n\nRow unification becomes significantly more complex than simple type unification:\n\n| Unification Case | Challenge | Solution |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Field Presence** | Ensure required fields exist in row | Generate field constraints during unification |\n| **Row Extension** | Add new fields to existing row | Instantiate row variables with extended rows |\n| **Row Combination** | Merge multiple row constraints | Collect field requirements and check for conflicts |\n\nThe constraint generation process must handle **field access operations**:\n\n1. **Field Selection**: `record.field` generates constraint that record's row contains field\n2. **Record Construction**: `{field1 = v1, field2 = v2}` creates row with specified fields  \n3. **Record Extension**: `{record with field = value}` adds field to existing record's row\n4. **Record Restriction**: Pattern matching can remove fields from rows\n\n> **Decision: Row Variable Scoping**\n> - **Context**: Row variables need scoping rules to prevent capture and ensure proper generalization\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Treat row variables identically to type variables\n>   2. Use separate scoping rules for row variables\n>   3. Embed row variables within type variables\n> - **Decision**: Separate row variable namespace with similar scoping to type variables\n> - **Rationale**: Prevents confusion between type polymorphism and row polymorphism while enabling precise error messages\n> - **Consequences**: Requires separate generalization and instantiation logic for row variables\n\nField constraint solving requires specialized algorithms:\n\n| Algorithm | Purpose | Complexity |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Field Decomposition** | Break record constraints into field constraints | O(n) fields |\n| **Row Unification** | Unify two row types with different field sets | O(n log n) field comparison |\n| **Conflict Detection** | Find inconsistent field type assignments | O(n) field scan |\n\n### Effect Systems and Resource Tracking\n\n**Effect systems** provide **compile-time tracking of computational side effects** — think of them as **environmental impact labels** for functions that precisely describe what external resources they access, modify, or depend upon. Just as organic food labels help consumers understand production methods, effect types help developers understand what a function might do beyond computing its return value.\n\nTraditional type systems only track what data flows into and out of functions, but effect systems additionally track **computational effects** like file I/O, network access, memory allocation, exception throwing, or state modification. This enables compiler optimizations, better error handling, and architectural constraints (preventing I/O operations in pure computation contexts).\n\nThe fundamental concept extends function types from `input -> output` to `input -> output & effects` where effects describe the computational context required:\n\n| Effect Category | Examples | Type Annotation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Pure** | Mathematical computation | `int -> int & Pure` |\n| **IO** | File/network operations | `string -> string & IO` |\n| **State** | Mutable variable access | `unit -> int & State[Counter]` |\n| **Exception** | Error conditions | `string -> int & Throws[ParseError]` |\n\nEffect types require extending our type representation:\n\n| Effect Component | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `effect_type` | Algebraic type for effect kinds | Union of `Pure`, `IO`, `State`, `Exception` variants |\n| `effect_set` | `effect_type list` | Set of effects a computation might perform |\n| `TEffect` | `TEffect of ty * effect_set` | Function type with effect annotation |\n\nThe constraint generation process must **track effect accumulation** through function composition:\n\n1. **Effect Inheritance**: Function calls inherit callee's effects\n2. **Effect Combination**: Sequence operations combine their effect sets\n3. **Effect Masking**: Exception handling can mask throwing effects\n4. **Effect Polymorphism**: Generic functions can be polymorphic over effects\n\n> **Decision: Effect System Granularity**\n> - **Context**: Effect tracking can be fine-grained (specific resources) or coarse-grained (effect categories)\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Track specific resources (file handles, network connections)\n>   2. Track effect categories (IO, State, Exception)\n>   3. Track both with hierarchical effect types\n> - **Decision**: Start with effect categories, design for extensibility to resource-specific tracking\n> - **Rationale**: Provides immediate value while avoiding complexity of resource lifetime tracking\n> - **Consequences**: Enables effect-based reasoning and optimization while preserving implementation simplicity\n\nEffect subtyping enables **effect masking** and **capability restriction**:\n\n| Subtyping Rule | Purpose | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Effect Subsumption** | Pure code works in effectful contexts | `Pure` function usable where `IO` expected |\n| **Effect Strengthening** | Add effects to existing computation | `IO` computation can be viewed as `IO & Exception` |\n| **Effect Intersection** | Find common effect requirements | Function requiring both `IO` and `State` effects |\n\n### Higher-Kinded Types and Type Constructors\n\n**Higher-kinded types** enable **abstraction over type constructors** — think of them as **generic blueprints for container types** where you can write code that works uniformly over lists, options, trees, or any other \"wrapper\" type without knowing the specific container structure. This is like designing a universal packaging machine that can wrap items in boxes, bags, or tubes by accepting instructions for the specific wrapping process.\n\nThe key insight is that types have **kinds** (types of types) just as values have types. Regular types like `int` and `string` have kind `*` (pronounced \"type\"), while type constructors like `list` and `option` have kind `* -> *` (they take a type and produce a type). Higher-kinded polymorphism lets us write functions generic over any type constructor of a particular kind.\n\nThis enables powerful abstractions like **functors** (types supporting map operations) and **monads** (types supporting sequential composition with context):\n\n| Abstraction | Kind Signature | Common Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Functor** | `('a -> 'b) -> 'f 'a -> 'f 'b` | `list`, `option`, `result` |\n| **Monad** | `'a -> 'f 'a` and `'f 'a -> ('a -> 'f 'b) -> 'f 'b` | `option`, `list`, `io` |\n| **Traversable** | `('a -> 'f 'b) -> 't 'a -> 'f ('t 'b)` | `list`, `tree`, `array` |\n\nThe type representation requires **kind tracking**:\n\n| Kind Component | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `kind` | Algebraic type for kinds | `Star | KindArrow of kind * kind` |\n| `TKinded` | `TKinded of ty * kind` | Type with explicit kind annotation |\n| `kind_env` | `(string * kind) list` | Kind assignments for type constructors |\n\nKind inference proceeds alongside type inference:\n\n1. **Kind Assignment**: Assign kinds to type constructors based on their definitions\n2. **Kind Unification**: Ensure consistent kind usage in type applications\n3. **Kind Generalization**: Generalize over kind variables in polymorphic types\n4. **Kind Checking**: Verify that type constructor applications respect kind constraints\n\n> **Decision: Kind Inference vs Kind Annotation**\n> - **Context**: Higher-kinded polymorphism requires kind information for type constructor parameters\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Full kind inference similar to type inference\n>   2. Require explicit kind annotations on type parameters\n>   3. Hybrid approach with inference and optional annotations\n> - **Decision**: Kind inference with optional annotations for disambiguation\n> - **Rationale**: Reduces annotation burden while providing escape hatch for complex cases\n> - **Consequences**: Requires sophisticated kind inference algorithm but improves user experience\n\nHigher-kinded polymorphism enables **type constructor classes**:\n\n| Constructor Class | Purpose | Method Signatures |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Functor** | Uniform mapping over containers | `fmap : ('a -> 'b) -> 'f 'a -> 'f 'b` |\n| **Applicative** | Multi-argument function lifting | `apply : 'f ('a -> 'b) -> 'f 'a -> 'f 'b` |\n| **Monad** | Sequential composition with context | `bind : 'f 'a -> ('a -> 'f 'b) -> 'f 'b` |\n\n### Dependent Types and Refinement Types\n\n**Dependent types** allow **types to depend on runtime values** — think of them as **smart contracts for data** where the type system can express and verify precise properties like \"this list has exactly 10 elements\" or \"this integer is between 1 and 100.\" This transforms the type system from checking basic structural compatibility to proving mathematical properties about program behavior.\n\nThe fundamental shift is from **simple types** (which classify data by structure) to **precise types** (which classify data by properties). A dependent function type `(n: int) -> vector(n)` means \"given an integer n, return a vector of exactly n elements.\" The type system can verify that vector operations respect size requirements at compile time.\n\nRefinement types provide a gentler introduction to dependent typing by **constraining existing types with predicates**:\n\n| Refinement Pattern | Type Syntax | Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Range Constraint** | `{x: int | 0 <= x <= 100}` | Integer between 0 and 100 |\n| **Non-Null Constraint** | `{x: string | length(x) > 0}` | Non-empty string |\n| **Relationship Constraint** | `{x: int | x > n}` | Integer greater than parameter n |\n\nThe type representation requires **predicate embedding**:\n\n| Dependent Component | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `predicate` | Expression tree for type constraints | Logical formulas over values |\n| `TRefined` | `TRefined of ty * predicate` | Base type with constraint predicate |\n| `TDependent` | `TDependent of string * ty * ty` | Dependent function type |\n\nConstraint generation must **extract verification conditions**:\n\n1. **Precondition Generation**: Function calls must satisfy parameter constraints\n2. **Postcondition Verification**: Function results must satisfy return type constraints  \n3. **Invariant Maintenance**: Operations must preserve type invariants\n4. **Termination Checking**: Recursive functions must have decreasing measures\n\n> **Decision: SMT Solver Integration**\n> - **Context**: Dependent type checking requires automated theorem proving for constraint verification\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Simple pattern matching on constraint predicates\n>   2. Integration with SMT solver (Z3, CVC4) for automated proving\n>   3. Interactive theorem proving with user-provided proofs\n> - **Decision**: SMT solver integration with fallback to user annotations for unprovable constraints\n> - **Rationale**: Provides automation for common constraints while preserving expressiveness for complex properties\n> - **Consequences**: Requires external solver dependency but enables practical dependent typing\n\nThe verification pipeline becomes:\n\n| Phase | Purpose | Output |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Constraint Extraction** | Convert type constraints to logical formulas | SMT-LIB format constraints |\n| **Solver Query** | Check constraint satisfiability | Satisfiable/Unsatisfiable/Unknown |\n| **Counterexample Analysis** | Extract failure information from solver | Specific values violating constraints |\n| **Error Reporting** | Convert solver results to user messages | Type error with constraint violation details |\n\n### Module Systems and Namespace Management\n\n**Module systems** provide **large-scale code organization with controlled visibility** — think of them as **architectural blueprints for software libraries** where you can define public interfaces, hide implementation details, and compose functionality from multiple sources while preventing name conflicts and dependency cycles.\n\nOur basic type checker assumes a single global namespace, but production languages need **hierarchical namespaces** with **explicit import/export control**. Module systems address several scalability challenges simultaneously: name collision avoidance, interface abstraction, separate compilation, and dependency management.\n\nThe core abstraction is the **module signature** — an interface specification that declares what types, values, and sub-modules are available from a module without exposing implementation details:\n\n| Module Component | Purpose | Visibility Control |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Public Interface** | Types and functions exposed to clients | Declared in module signature |\n| **Private Implementation** | Internal helper functions and types | Hidden from clients |\n| **Sub-modules** | Nested modules for hierarchical organization | Controlled by signature inclusion |\n| **Type Abstraction** | Abstract types with hidden representations | Signature declares type without definition |\n\nModule type checking requires **signature matching**:\n\n1. **Interface Compliance**: Module implementation must provide all signature-declared items\n2. **Type Compatibility**: Implementation types must match or be more specific than signature types\n3. **Access Control**: Client code can only reference signature-visible items\n4. **Abstract Type Sealing**: Abstract types hide their concrete representations\n\nThe type representation needs **module-aware types**:\n\n| Module Component | OCaml Definition | Purpose |\n|---|---|---|\n| `module_path` | `string list` | Qualified module names like `Data.List.Utils` |\n| `TModulePath` | `TModulePath of module_path * string` | Type references across modules |\n| `signature_item` | Algebraic type for interface declarations | Types, values, modules in signatures |\n| `module_signature` | `signature_item list` | Complete module interface specification |\n\n> **Decision: Module System Complexity Level**\n> - **Context**: Module systems range from simple namespaces to sophisticated functors with type sharing\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Simple qualified namespaces with import/export\n>   2. ML-style modules with signatures and abstract types  \n>   3. Full functor system with parameterized modules\n> - **Decision**: ML-style modules without functors initially, designed for functor extension\n> - **Rationale**: Provides significant organizational benefits without the complexity of module-level polymorphism\n> - **Consequences**: Enables large-scale development while keeping type checker implementation manageable\n\nModule compilation requires **separate type checking** with **interface consistency**:\n\n| Compilation Phase | Input | Output | Verification |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Interface Compilation** | Module signature source | Compiled signature artifact | Syntax and kind checking |\n| **Implementation Compilation** | Module implementation + signature | Compiled module + type info | Signature compliance |\n| **Client Compilation** | Client code + imported signatures | Type-checked client code | Interface-only type checking |\n\n### Performance Optimizations and Incremental Checking\n\n**Incremental type checking** enables **fast development cycles through selective recomputation** — think of it as **smart caching for compilation** where changing one function doesn't require re-checking the entire codebase, similar to how modern build systems only rebuild changed components and their dependencies.\n\nThe fundamental challenge is **maintaining correctness while minimizing work**. When a function signature changes, we must re-check all its callers, but functions that don't depend on the change can reuse their previous type checking results. This requires tracking **type-level dependencies** with sufficient precision to enable safe incremental updates.\n\nIncremental checking builds on several optimization techniques:\n\n| Optimization Category | Technique | Benefit |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Memoization** | Cache constraint generation and solving results | Avoid recomputation of identical expressions |\n| **Dependency Tracking** | Record which types depend on which definitions | Enable minimal recomputation on changes |\n| **Early Termination** | Stop checking when errors make further progress impossible | Reduce work in error-heavy scenarios |\n| **Parallel Checking** | Check independent modules simultaneously | Utilize multiple CPU cores |\n\nThe incremental architecture requires **change impact analysis**:\n\n1. **Change Detection**: Identify which definitions have been modified\n2. **Dependency Resolution**: Find all code that might be affected by changes\n3. **Cache Invalidation**: Remove stale results that might now be incorrect\n4. **Minimal Recomputation**: Re-check only the affected components\n5. **Result Integration**: Combine new results with cached results\n\n> **Decision: Granularity of Incremental Checking**\n> - **Context**: Incremental checking can operate at different granularities from expression-level to module-level\n> - **Options Considered**:\n>   1. Function-level incremental checking with fine-grained dependency tracking\n>   2. Module-level incremental checking with interface-based dependencies\n>   3. Hybrid approach with module boundaries and intra-module function dependencies\n> - **Decision**: Module-level incremental checking with function-level dependencies within changed modules\n> - **Rationale**: Balances implementation complexity with performance gains, leveraging module system for coarse-grained caching\n> - **Consequences**: Requires module interface stability analysis but provides significant speedup for large codebases\n\nThe dependency tracking system needs several data structures:\n\n| Dependency Component | Purpose | Structure |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Type Dependency Graph** | Track which types reference other types | `(type_id * type_id list) list` |\n| **Function Dependency Graph** | Track function call relationships | `(function_id * function_id list) list` |\n| **Module Dependency Graph** | Track inter-module dependencies | `(module_id * module_id list) list` |\n| **Cache Validation Tags** | Detect when cached results are stale | Content hash + dependency hash |\n\nPerformance optimization also benefits from **constraint solving improvements**:\n\n| Algorithm Enhancement | Benefit | Implementation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Union-Find Unification** | Faster type variable unification | Path compression and union by rank |\n| **Constraint Simplification** | Reduce constraint set size before solving | Early constraint decomposition |\n| **Occurs Check Optimization** | Faster infinite type detection | Lazy occurs checking with memoization |\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\nThe future extensions represent significant undertakings that build upon the foundation established in the four core milestones. Each extension can be implemented incrementally, leveraging the existing architecture while adding new capabilities.\n\n**Technology Recommendations:**\n\n| Extension | Simple Approach | Advanced Approach |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Algebraic Data Types** | Extend `ty` with sum/product constructors | Full coverage analysis with decision trees |\n| **Type Classes** | Simple instance table with linear search | Constraint-based resolution with coherence checking |\n| **Row Types** | Basic field presence constraints | Full row polymorphism with kind system |\n| **Effect Systems** | Simple effect annotations | Regional effect inference with masking |\n| **Higher-Kinded Types** | Explicit kind annotations | Full kind inference with constructor classes |\n| **Dependent Types** | Basic refinement types with simple predicates | SMT integration with automated theorem proving |\n\n**Recommended Extension Order:**\n\nThe extensions have dependencies that suggest a natural implementation order:\n\n1. **Algebraic Data Types** - Foundation for structured data and pattern matching\n2. **Module Systems** - Essential for large-scale code organization  \n3. **Type Classes** - Builds on ADTs and modules for structured polymorphism\n4. **Row Types** - Independent feature that enhances record flexibility\n5. **Effect Systems** - Builds on type classes for computational context tracking\n6. **Higher-Kinded Types** - Advanced abstraction building on type classes\n7. **Dependent Types** - Most complex extension requiring sophisticated constraint solving\n8. **Performance Optimizations** - Cross-cutting improvements for production use\n\n**Extension Integration Points:**\n\nEach extension integrates with the existing architecture at specific points:\n\n| Extension | Type Representation Changes | Constraint Generation Changes | Unification Changes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **ADTs** | Add `TSum`, `TProduct` constructors | Constructor application constraints | Pattern exhaustiveness checking |\n| **Type Classes** | Add `TQualified` with constraints | Instance resolution constraints | Constraint solving phase |\n| **Row Types** | Add `TRow` with field types | Field access constraints | Row unification algorithm |\n| **Effect Systems** | Add `TEffect` with effect sets | Effect accumulation constraints | Effect subtyping rules |\n\n**Milestone Checkpoints for Extensions:**\n\nEach extension should be implemented with clear checkpoint verification:\n\n**Algebraic Data Types Checkpoint:**\n- Define simple sum type (e.g., `Option = None | Some of 'a`)\n- Implement pattern matching with exhaustiveness checking  \n- Verify constructor type checking works correctly\n- Test error messages for missing pattern cases\n\n**Type Classes Checkpoint:**\n- Define `Eq` type class with `equal` method\n- Implement instance for `int` type\n- Write polymorphic function using `Eq` constraint\n- Verify instance resolution produces correct types\n\n**Module System Checkpoint:**\n- Create module with signature hiding internal types\n- Import module in client code using qualified names\n- Verify abstract type safety (client cannot access representation)\n- Test module compilation and interface consistency\n\n**Common Pitfalls for Extensions:**\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Feature Interaction Complexity**\nWhen implementing multiple extensions simultaneously, their interactions can create unexpected complexity. For example, type classes with higher-kinded types require sophisticated constraint resolution, while dependent types with modules need careful abstraction boundary management. Implement extensions incrementally and test their interactions thoroughly.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Performance Regression**\nAdvanced type system features can significantly impact compilation performance. Constraint solving becomes more expensive with type classes, row unification is complex, and dependent type checking requires theorem proving. Profile your implementation and consider optimization strategies early.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Error Message Quality Degradation**\nSophisticated type system features often produce complex error messages that confuse users. Type class resolution failures, row type mismatches, and dependent type constraint violations need specially crafted error reporting to remain understandable.\n\n**Infrastructure for Extensions:**\n\nSeveral extensions benefit from shared infrastructure:\n\n```ocaml\n(* Extended type representation supporting multiple features *)\ntype extended_ty = \n  | TInt | TBool | TString \n  | TVar of string\n  | TFun of extended_ty * extended_ty\n  | TForall of string list * extended_ty\n  (* ADT support *)\n  | TSum of (string * extended_ty list) list\n  | TProduct of (string * extended_ty) list  \n  (* Type class support *)\n  | TQualified of constraint_ list * extended_ty\n  (* Row type support *)\n  | TRow of (string * extended_ty) list * extended_ty option\n  | TRecord of extended_ty\n  (* Effect system support *)\n  | TEffect of extended_ty * effect_set\n  (* Higher-kinded type support *)\n  | TApp of extended_ty * extended_ty\n  | TKindedVar of string * kind\n  (* Dependent type support *)  \n  | TRefined of extended_ty * predicate\n  | TDependent of string * extended_ty * extended_ty\n\n(* Unified constraint system supporting all extensions *)\ntype unified_constraint =\n  | Equal of extended_ty * extended_ty\n  | Instance of string * extended_ty  (* Type class constraint *)\n  | HasField of extended_ty * string * extended_ty  (* Row constraint *)\n  | Effect of extended_ty * effect_type  (* Effect constraint *)\n  | Kind of extended_ty * kind  (* Kind constraint *)\n  | Predicate of predicate * extended_ty  (* Dependent constraint *)\n\n(* Extended environment supporting modules and type classes *)\ntype extended_env = {\n  term_env: (string * binding) list list;\n  type_env: (string * kind) list list;  \n  class_env: (string * class_info) list;\n  instance_env: (constraint_ * instance_info) list;\n  module_env: (string * module_signature) list;\n}\n\n(* Unified constraint solver handling all constraint types *)\nlet solve_unified_constraints constraints =\n  (* TODO: Implement constraint solving for multiple extension types *)\n  (* TODO: Handle constraint interactions between different extensions *)\n  (* TODO: Provide unified error reporting across all constraint types *)\n  failwith \"Extended constraint solving not implemented\"\n```\n\nThe future extensions transform our basic type checker into a production-ready system supporting modern programming language features. Each extension builds upon the solid foundation of our core type system while adding new capabilities that enhance programmer productivity and program safety. The modular architecture ensures that extensions can be implemented incrementally without disrupting existing functionality.\n\n\n## Glossary\n\n> **Milestone(s):** Milestone 1 (Type Representation), Milestone 2 (Basic Type Checking), Milestone 3 (Type Inference), Milestone 4 (Polymorphism)\n\nThink of this glossary as a **comprehensive technical dictionary** — much like how a specialized medical dictionary defines every term precisely so that surgeons, nurses, and medical students all understand exactly what each procedure, organ, and condition means. In type theory, precision of language is critical because subtle differences in terminology often reflect important algorithmic or theoretical distinctions that can make or break an implementation.\n\nThe type checking domain draws from several academic fields including programming language theory, mathematical logic, and compiler design. Each field contributes specialized vocabulary that has evolved over decades of research. Understanding these terms precisely is essential for implementing a correct type checker, reading academic literature, communicating with other compiler engineers, and debugging complex type system issues.\n\nThis glossary organizes terms into logical categories to help you understand how concepts relate to each other.

Type checking verifies that explicit annotations match usage, while type inference determines types for unannotated expressions. Our system does both - it checks explicit annotations and infers types where they're missing.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Misunderstanding \"polymorphism\" scope**\nNot all polymorphism is the same. Parametric polymorphism (our focus) is different from ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading) and subtype polymorphism (inheritance). When discussing polymorphic types, be specific about which form you mean.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Conflating \"substitution\" and \"unification\"**\nSubstitution is a mapping from variables to types, while unification is the algorithm that finds substitutions. Unification produces substitutions as its result, but the two concepts are distinct and serve different roles in the type checking process.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Assuming \"fresh variables\" are optional**\nFresh variable generation is critical for correctness, not just convenience. Using non-fresh variables during instantiation can cause variable capture and incorrect type checking results. Always use `fresh_type_var()` when creating new unknowns.\n\n⚠️ **Pitfall: Treating \"generalization\" and \"instantiation\" as inverses**\nWhile related, these operations are not simple inverses. Generalization abstracts over specific type variables in specific contexts, while instantiation creates fresh variables. The relationship is more subtle than mathematical function inversion.\n\n### Implementation Guidance\n\n**A.

Language-Specific Hints:**\n\n- Use OCaml's Hashtbl for efficient term lookup in large glossaries\n- Pattern matching on term_category makes it easy to group related concepts\n- String.split_on_char and Str.regexp are useful for parsing source files to extract terminology\n- List.filter_map is perfect for collecting related terms that exist in the database\n- Printf.sprintf provides good control over documentation formatting\n- File I/O functions like open_in and input_line help process source files for validation\n\n**F. Milestone Checkpoint:**\n\nAfter building your glossary system:\n- Run `ocamlopt -o check_terms glossary.ml check_terms.ml` to build term validation\n- Execute `./check_terms src/` to scan your source code for terminology consistency\n- Expected output: \"Found 45 terms, 3 undefined: 'constraint_solving', 'bidirectional_checking', 'principal_type'\"\n- Verify manually: Open your .ml files and confirm that function names match glossary entries\n- Signs of issues: Many undefined terms suggests inconsistent naming; no undefined terms might mean glossary is incomplete\n\n**G. Debugging Tips:**\n\n| Symptom | Likely Cause | How to Diagnose | Fix |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----|\n| Term lookup returns None for known terms | Case sensitivity or exact string matching | Print the exact string being looked up vs database keys | Normalize case or use fuzzy matching |\n| Cross-references create circular loops | Bidirectional relationships not handled properly | Trace the related_terms chains manually | Use visited set to prevent infinite loops |\n| Documentation formatting looks inconsistent | Different formatting logic for different term types | Compare generated output for terms in same category | Standardize format_term_for_documentation logic |\n| Terminology validation reports false positives | Extracting code comments or string literals as terms | Check what text patterns the validation regex matches | Refine regex to match only actual identifier usage |\n| Related terms don't show useful connections | Related_terms lists built manually without systematic approach | Review which terms actually share concepts or algorithms | Rebuild relationships based on shared code references |\n"}
