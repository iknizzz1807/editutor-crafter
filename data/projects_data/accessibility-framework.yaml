  Build an automated accessibility testing framework that checks web applications
  against WCAG guidelines. Implement rule-based checking, automated remediation
  suggestions, and integration with testing pipelines.

difficulty: intermediate
estimated_hours: 35-50
domain: software-engineering

essence: >
  Accessibility compliance through automated rule checking against WCAG criteria,
  DOM analysis for semantic structure, color contrast calculations, keyboard
  navigation verification, and screen reader compatibility testing.
