description: >
  Build a differential privacy framework that provides mathematical privacy
  guarantees for data analysis. Implement noise mechanisms, privacy accounting,
  and composition theorems.

difficulty: advanced
estimated_hours: 45-60
domain: specialized

essence: >
  Mathematical privacy through calibrated noise addition (Laplace, Gaussian),
  privacy budget accounting across queries (epsilon-delta), composition theorems
  for multiple releases, and privacy-utility tradeoff analysis.

why_important: >
  Differential privacy is the gold standard for privacy-preserving data analysis,
  used by Apple, Google, and US Census. Understanding DP is valuable at
  $180K-320K+ for privacy engineers and data scientists.
