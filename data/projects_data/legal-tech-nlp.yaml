    name: Legal Document Parsing & Structure
    description: >
      Build robust parsing for legal documents extracting structure,
      sections, and hierarchical organization.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - PDF parsing extracts text while preserving structural elements (headers, paragraphs, lists)
      - DOCX parsing handles nested structures (sections, subsections, numbered lists)
      - Document section detection: recitals, definitions, terms, signatures
      - Table extraction from legal documents (schedules, defined terms tables)
      - Handles multi-column layouts common in legal documents
      - Page header/footer removal without losing document content
      - Extracts cross-references between sections ("as defined in Section 3.1")
    pitfalls:
      - PDF text extraction often loses reading order; use layout-aware extraction
      - Scanned documents require OCR with legal dictionary for accuracy
      - Numbered paragraphs vs section numbers can be confused
      - Definitions sections span multiple pages; track definition scope
      - Table structure in PDFs is implicit; inference is error-prone
    concepts:
      - Document structure recognition
      - Layout-aware text extraction
      - Section hierarchy parsing
      - Cross-reference extraction
    skills:
      - PDF/DOCX parsing
      - Structure detection
      - Table extraction
      - OCR integration
    deliverables:
      - Legal document parser supporting PDF and DOCX
      - Section detection and hierarchy builder
      - Table extractor for legal documents
      - Cross-reference extractor
      - Test suite with diverse legal document types

    name: Legal Named Entity Recognition
    description: >
      Implement NER for legal entities including parties, dates,
      jurisdictions, statutes, and monetary amounts.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Custom NER model for legal entities: parties, companies, jurisdictions, statutes, regulations
      - Date extraction handles legal date formats ("the 15th day of March, 2024")
      - Monetary amount extraction with currency normalization
      - Citation extraction: case citations, statute citations, regulation citations
      - Defined term recognition: tracks terms defined in document ("'Agreement' means...")
      - Performance: F1 > 0.80 on legal NER test set
      - Handles legal abbreviations (Corp., Inc., Ltd., et al.)
    pitfalls:
      - Legal names are complex: "John Doe, as Trustee of the Doe Family Trust"
      - Same entity referenced multiple ways: "the Company", "Buyer", "Acme Corp."
      - Citations have many formats: "123 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2024)", "§ 101", "17 CFR 240.10b-5"
      - Defined terms scope is document-local; general NER models miss them
      - Legal language uses archaic patterns ("said Party", "such Agreement")
    concepts:
      - Domain-specific NER
      - Legal entity types
      - Citation parsing
      - Defined term tracking
    skills:
      - Custom NER training
      - Citation parsing
      - Pattern matching for legal formats
      - Entity normalization
    deliverables:
      - Legal NER model with custom entity types

    name: Clause Classification & Extraction
    description: >
      Build a clause classification system for identifying and
      categorizing legal provisions in contracts.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Clause type classification: indemnification, termination, governing law, force majeure, etc. (15+ types)
      - Obligation detection: identifies which party has which obligation
      - Exception and limitation extraction from clauses
      - Missing clause detection: identifies standard clauses not present
      - Confidence scoring for each classification
      - Handles clause variations and non-standard language
      - Performance: accuracy > 0.85 on clause type classification
    pitfalls:
      - Clauses often span multiple paragraphs; sentence-level classification is insufficient
      - Same legal concept expressed in vastly different language
      - Nested exceptions ("except as provided in Section X, but not including...")
      - Ambiguous clause types: confidentiality vs non-disclosure, representations vs warranties
      - Domain shift between contract types: M&A vs employment vs SaaS agreements
    concepts:
      - Text classification for legal domain
      - Clause taxonomy
      - Obligation extraction
      - Exception handling
    skills:
      - Legal text classification
      - Multi-label classification
      - Obligation parsing
      - Handling legal variations
    deliverables:
      - Clause type classifier (15+ types)

    name: Semantic Search for Case Law
    description: >
      Implement semantic search for legal case retrieval using
      embeddings and legal domain understanding.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Document embedding for legal texts captures legal semantics
      - Query understanding for legal questions ("cases about wrongful termination")
      - Citation-based relevance: cases cited together are related
      - Jurisdiction filtering: results can be filtered by court/jurisdiction
      - Date filtering: find cases from specific time periods
      - Result ranking combines semantic similarity and citation authority
      - Handles legal synonyms ("termination" ≈ "firing" ≈ "dismissal")
      - Latency < 500ms for search over 100K case database
    pitfalls:
      - Legal terminology differs from common usage ("consideration", "execution")
      - Older cases use different language patterns than modern cases
      - Citation count is a poor authority proxy; use citation network analysis
      - Query length varies greatly: keyword search vs full question
      - Jurisdiction scope matters: federal vs state, circuit splits
    concepts:
      - Legal semantic embeddings
      - Citation network analysis
      - Legal query understanding
      - Multi-factor ranking
    skills:
      - Legal embedding models
      - Citation analysis
      - Search system design
      - Legal relevance ranking
    deliverables:
      - Legal text embedder
      - Semantic search index
      - Query parser for legal queries
      - Citation-based authority scorer
      - Search API with filters

    name: Contract Comparison & Summarization
    description: >
      Build tools for comparing contracts and generating summaries
      of legal documents.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Contract comparison identifies differences in clause language
      - Semantic diff: highlights meaning changes, not just text changes
      - Clause alignment: matches corresponding clauses across contracts
      - Summary generation: key terms, obligations, risks, dates
      - Extractive and abstractive summarization options
      - Risk highlighting: identifies unusual or aggressive provisions
      - Summary length configurable (executive vs detailed)
      - Faithfulness: summary accurately represents source document
    pitfalls:
      - Surface-level text diff misses semantic changes
      - Clause reordering breaks naive comparison
      - Summary hallucination: generated text not supported by source
      - Risk assessment is subjective; define clear criteria
      - Long contracts (>100 pages) challenge summarization models
    concepts:
      - Semantic text comparison
      - Clause alignment
      - Legal summarization
      - Risk assessment
    skills:
      - Text alignment algorithms
