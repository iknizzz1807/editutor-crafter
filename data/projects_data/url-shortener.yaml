name: URL Shortener (Microservices)
description: >
  A production-grade URL shortener built as a true microservices system. Four independently
  deployable Go services communicate via REST (sync) and RabbitMQ (async), each owning its
  own PostgreSQL database. The focus is correct service boundary design, async event flow,
  and operational concerns — not feature breadth.
difficulty: intermediate
estimated_hours: 40-60
essence: >
  Four bounded contexts — URL lifecycle, click analytics, identity, and notifications —
  each deployed as an independent Go binary with its own PostgreSQL schema, communicating
  synchronously via HTTP/JSON for reads and asynchronously via RabbitMQ domain events for
  side effects. An API Gateway provides the single client-facing entry point, enforcing
  JWT auth and routing without becoming a god component.
why_important: >
  Microservices architecture is trivially easy to get wrong: shared databases, synchronous
  call chains, and god services are the three most common failure modes and they all look
  fine until the system needs to scale or change. Building a URL shortener forces you to
  confront every one of these pitfalls in a domain simple enough that the right answer is
  always obvious — making the anti-patterns impossible to rationalize.
learning_outcomes:
  - Design service boundaries using domain-driven bounded contexts
  - Implement database-per-service with no cross-service DB access
  - Build an API Gateway that routes and authenticates without business logic
  - Produce and consume domain events via RabbitMQ without tight coupling
  - Apply the outbox pattern to guarantee at-least-once event delivery
  - Implement circuit breaker for resilient inter-service HTTP calls
  - Trace requests across services using correlation IDs and structured logging
  - Containerize all services with Docker Compose for local development
  - Distinguish when to use sync REST vs async events for each interaction
  - Avoid the distributed monolith anti-pattern in chain calls

  - id: url-shortener-m1
    name: "Foundation: Repo Layout, Shared Contracts, Local Dev Stack"
    description: >
      Establish the monorepo structure, define the shared domain event schema,
      wire up Docker Compose with one PostgreSQL instance per service and one
      RabbitMQ instance, and verify all containers start and can reach each other.
      No business logic yet — this milestone is entirely about the skeleton that
      every subsequent milestone builds on.
    estimated_hours: 4-6

    acceptance_criteria:
      - >
        Monorepo layout exists: services/{url,analytics,user,notification}-service/,
        gateway/, shared/events/, docker-compose.yml at root
      - >
        Each service directory contains: main.go, Dockerfile, go.mod with module path
        github.com/yourhandle/url-shortener/{service-name}
      - >
        docker-compose.yml declares five services (4 app + 1 gateway stub), four
        PostgreSQL containers (url_db, analytics_db, user_db, notification_db) each
        on separate ports (5432-5435), and one RabbitMQ container with management UI
      - >
        Each app service connects to its own DB on startup and logs "connected to DB"
        — fails to start (non-zero exit) if DB is unreachable (no silent fallback)
      - >
        RabbitMQ exchange "url-shortener" of type "topic" is declared on startup by
        url-service; queues "analytics.clicks" and "notifications.events" are declared
        and bound by their respective consumers
      - >
        shared/events/ package defines Go structs for all domain events:
        URLCreatedEvent, URLClickedEvent, URLDeletedEvent, MilestoneReachedEvent —
        each with EventType string, OccurredAt time.Time, and payload fields
      - >
        `docker compose up` brings everything healthy; `docker compose down -v` tears
        it down cleanly; README documents both commands
      - >
        Each service has a GET /health endpoint returning {"status":"ok","service":"<name>"}
        with 200 — gateway health-checks all four services on startup

    pitfalls:
      - >
        Hardcoding localhost instead of Docker service name (e.g., "url_db") in
        connection strings — services can't reach each other inside Docker network
      - >
        Single shared PostgreSQL instance with multiple databases — violates
        database-per-service; each service needs its own container
      - >
        Declaring RabbitMQ queues only in the producer — consumer must declare its
        own queue and binding or messages are lost if consumer starts first
      - >
        Not adding depends_on + healthcheck in docker-compose — services crash-loop
        because DB isn't ready when the app starts

    concepts:
      - Monorepo layout for microservices
      - Database-per-service pattern
      - AMQP exchange/queue/binding topology
      - Docker Compose service dependencies and healthchecks
      - Domain event schema design

    deliverables:
      - Monorepo directory structure with all service skeletons
      - docker-compose.yml with 4 PostgreSQL + 1 RabbitMQ + 5 app containers
      - shared/events/ package with all domain event structs
      - /health endpoint on each service
      - README with setup and run instructions

  - id: url-shortener-m2
    name: "User Service: Registration, Login, JWT Issuance"
    description: >
      Implement the User Service as a self-contained auth provider. It stores
      users in its own PostgreSQL table, hashes passwords with bcrypt, and issues
      signed JWT tokens. It does NOT call any other service. Other services verify
      tokens locally using the shared secret — they never call User Service per request.
    estimated_hours: 6-8

    acceptance_criteria:
      - >
        users table: id UUID PK, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
      - >
        POST /register accepts {email, password}, validates email format and
        password length >= 8, hashes with bcrypt cost=12, returns 201 {user_id, email}
        — never returns the hash
      - >
        POST /login accepts {email, password}, verifies bcrypt hash, returns 200
        {token, expires_at} or 401 with no detail (do not reveal whether email exists)
      - >
        JWT payload contains: sub (user_id UUID), email, iat, exp (24h), iss "url-shortener"
      - >
        JWT is signed with HS256 using secret from environment variable JWT_SECRET —
        no hardcoded secrets anywhere in source code
      - >
        GET /me requires Authorization: Bearer <token> header, verifies signature and
        expiry locally (no DB lookup), returns {user_id, email} or 401
      - >
        Duplicate email on /register returns 409 Conflict, not 500
      - >
        All passwords rejected with 400 if < 8 chars; no other password complexity rules
      - >
        Integration test: register → login → GET /me round trip passes end-to-end

    pitfalls:
      - >
        Storing plain-text passwords or using MD5/SHA — use bcrypt; cost < 10 is
        acceptable for testing but document it
      - >
        Calling user-service from other services to validate tokens on every request —
        stateless JWT means each service verifies the signature locally with the shared
        secret; no inter-service call needed
      - >
        Returning 404 "user not found" on failed login — reveals email enumeration;
        always return 401 with a generic message
      - >
        Putting user_id in JWT without making it a UUID — integer IDs are enumerable
        and leak user count

    concepts:
      - Stateless JWT authentication
      - bcrypt password hashing
      - Token issuance vs token verification separation
      - Email enumeration prevention
      - Environment-based secret management

    deliverables:
      - users PostgreSQL schema with migration file
      - POST /register, POST /login, GET /me handlers
      - JWT signing and local verification middleware (reusable in other services)
      - Integration test covering full auth round trip

  - id: url-shortener-m3
    name: "URL Service: Shorten, Redirect, CRUD + Domain Event Publishing"
    description: >
      Core business logic: accept a long URL, generate a collision-resistant 7-character
      short code, store it, and redirect on lookup. On every redirect, publish a
      URLClickedEvent to RabbitMQ using the outbox pattern so analytics is updated
      asynchronously without coupling the redirect hot path to analytics availability.
    estimated_hours: 10-12

    acceptance_criteria:
      - >
        urls table: id UUID PK, short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        original_url TEXT NOT NULL, user_id UUID NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
        expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULLABLE, is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
      - >
        outbox table: id UUID PK, event_type TEXT, payload JSONB, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
        published_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULLABLE — same DB as urls, same transaction
      - >
        POST /shorten requires valid JWT (verified locally); accepts {url, custom_code?,
        expires_at?}; validates URL format (must have scheme + host); generates 7-char
        base62 code if custom_code not provided; returns 201 {short_code, short_url,
        original_url, expires_at}
      - >
        Short code generation uses crypto/rand for randomness — not math/rand; collision
        retry up to 5 times before returning 503
      - >
        GET /:code performs redirect: looks up short_code, checks is_active and
        expires_at, writes URLClickedEvent to outbox table IN THE SAME DB TRANSACTION
        as any click counter update, returns 301 with Location header
      - >
        Outbox poller goroutine runs every 2 seconds: reads unpublished outbox rows,
        publishes each to RabbitMQ exchange with routing key "url.clicked", marks
        published_at on success — handles RabbitMQ unavailability gracefully (retry
        next poll cycle, do not crash)
      - >
        GET /urls (auth required) returns paginated list of caller's URLs with
        {short_code, original_url, created_at, expires_at, is_active}
      - >
        DELETE /urls/:code (auth required, owner only) sets is_active=false, publishes
        URLDeletedEvent via outbox
      - >
        Expired URLs (expires_at < now) return 410 Gone, not 404
      - >
        GET /:code for non-existent code returns 404; for inactive URL returns 410

    pitfalls:
      - >
        Writing click event to outbox in a separate transaction from the URL lookup —
        if the service crashes between the two transactions, the event is lost; they
        must be one atomic transaction
      - >
        Calling analytics-service synchronously on redirect — this couples availability
        of analytics to the redirect hot path; a slow analytics service will slow down
        every redirect
      - >
        Using math/rand for short code generation — predictable codes can be enumerated;
        use crypto/rand
      - >
        Not checking URL ownership on DELETE — any authenticated user could delete
        another user's URL
      - >
        Polling outbox too aggressively (every 10ms) hammers the DB; too slowly (every
        60s) means stale analytics; 2-5s is the right balance for this project

    concepts:
      - Outbox pattern (guaranteed at-least-once event delivery)
      - Atomic write + event in single transaction
      - Base62 encoding for short codes
      - Async decoupling via domain events
      - Redirect semantics (301 vs 302, expires_at → 410)

    deliverables:
      - urls and outbox PostgreSQL schema with migration files
      - POST /shorten, GET /:code (redirect), GET /urls, DELETE /urls/:code
      - Outbox poller goroutine with RabbitMQ publish and retry logic
      - JWT middleware for protected routes (reuse from M2 package)
      - Unit tests for short code generation (collision, base62 alphabet)

  # ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: url-shortener-m4
    name: "Analytics Service: Click Ingestion + Stats API"
    description: >
      Consume URLClickedEvent from RabbitMQ, store click records, and expose
      a stats API. Analytics service never calls URL Service — it only reads from
      its own DB populated by events. This milestone demonstrates the read-side of
      event-driven architecture and the query responsibility of a downstream consumer.
    estimated_hours: 8-10

    acceptance_criteria:
      - >
        clicks table: id UUID PK, short_code TEXT NOT NULL, clicked_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
        ip_hash TEXT (SHA-256 of IP, not raw IP — privacy), user_agent TEXT,
        referer TEXT NULLABLE
      - >
        milestones table: id UUID PK, short_code TEXT, milestone INT,
        triggered_at TIMESTAMPTZ — records when 10, 100, 1000 click thresholds are crossed
      - >
        RabbitMQ consumer subscribes to queue "analytics.clicks", bound to exchange
        "url-shortener" with routing key "url.clicked"; processes URLClickedEvent,
        inserts click row, checks milestone thresholds, publishes MilestoneReachedEvent
        if threshold crossed — all in one DB transaction
      - >
        GET /stats/:code returns {short_code, total_clicks, clicks_last_24h,
        clicks_last_7d, top_referers: [{referer, count}] top 5} — no auth required
        (public stats)
      - >
        GET /stats/:code/timeline?interval=day|hour returns [{period, clicks}] array
        — use PostgreSQL date_trunc for bucketing
      - >
        Consumer is idempotent: duplicate URLClickedEvent (same event id) is ignored
        using event_id deduplication table; reprocessing the same message does not
        double-count clicks
      - >
        Consumer handles poison messages (malformed JSON) by logging and acking —
        does not crash the consumer loop or block the queue
      - >
        GET /health returns healthy even when RabbitMQ is temporarily down (consumer
        pauses, service stays up)

    pitfalls:
      - >
        Storing raw IP addresses — a GDPR violation; store SHA-256(IP+salt) or just
        drop it; the spec uses ip_hash
      - >
        Calling url-service to validate short_code existence before inserting click —
        creates sync dependency; trust the event, insert unconditionally
      - >
        Not implementing idempotency — RabbitMQ delivers at-least-once; the same click
        event can arrive twice (broker restart, consumer crash during ack); without
        deduplication, clicks are double-counted
      - >
        Panicking on malformed message body — always recover; log and ack or nack
        to dead-letter queue; never crash the consumer goroutine

    concepts:
      - Event consumer idempotency
      - At-least-once delivery semantics
      - Privacy-preserving analytics (IP hashing)
      - Downstream read model populated by events
      - PostgreSQL date_trunc for time-series bucketing

    deliverables:
      - clicks, milestones, processed_events (dedup) PostgreSQL schema
      - RabbitMQ consumer goroutine with idempotency check
      - GET /stats/:code and GET /stats/:code/timeline handlers
      - MilestoneReachedEvent publishing when thresholds crossed
      - Test: send duplicate URLClickedEvent, verify click count = 1

  # ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: url-shortener-m5
    name: "Notification Service + API Gateway + Circuit Breaker"
    description: >
      Wire up the last two infrastructure pieces: the Notification Service consumes
      URLCreatedEvent and MilestoneReachedEvent and logs (or sends) alerts; the API
      Gateway provides the single client entry point with JWT verification, routing,
      and a circuit breaker protecting the URL Service redirect path. This milestone
      completes the full end-to-end system.
    estimated_hours: 10-12

    acceptance_criteria:
      - >
        notifications table: id UUID PK, user_id UUID, event_type TEXT, payload JSONB,
        status TEXT (pending|sent|failed), created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULLABLE
      - >
        Notification Service consumes routing keys "url.created", "url.deleted",
        "milestone.reached" from queue "notifications.events"; for each event inserts
        a notification row with status=pending, logs the notification (email sending
        is mocked — log "would send email to <user>: <message>"), updates status=sent
      - >
        GET /notifications (auth required) returns caller's notifications sorted by
        created_at DESC, paginated — notification service verifies JWT locally
      - >
        API Gateway routes: POST /api/shorten → url-service, GET /api/urls → url-service,
        DELETE /api/urls/:code → url-service, GET /r/:code → url-service (redirect),
        GET /api/stats/:code → analytics-service, POST /api/auth/register → user-service,
        POST /api/auth/login → user-service, GET /api/notifications → notification-service
      - >
        Gateway validates JWT on all /api/* routes except /api/auth/*; rejects with
        401 before forwarding — downstream services also validate but gateway is first line
      - >
        Gateway implements circuit breaker on url-service proxy: after 5 consecutive
        failures within 10s, opens circuit and returns 503 {"error":"service unavailable"}
        for 30s before attempting half-open probe; uses a simple state machine
        (closed → open → half-open → closed)
      - >
        Gateway adds X-Correlation-ID header (UUID, generated if not present) to every
        forwarded request; all services log this ID in every log line for that request
      - >
        All services use structured JSON logging: {"level","time","service","correlation_id",
        "method","path","status","duration_ms","msg"} — no fmt.Println in handlers
      - >
        End-to-end test: register user → login → shorten URL → GET redirect → check
        /stats → check /notifications — all pass through gateway, correlation ID
        appears in logs of every service involved

    pitfalls:
      - >
        Putting business logic in the gateway (e.g., checking URL ownership, computing
        stats) — gateway must only route, auth, and protect; zero domain logic
      - >
        Implementing circuit breaker as sleep/retry — a real circuit breaker has three
        states (closed/open/half-open) and a state machine; a retry loop is not a
        circuit breaker
      - >
        Notification service calling user-service to look up email — it should receive
        the user context it needs in the event payload; if URLCreatedEvent includes
        user_id and email, no cross-service call is needed
      - >
        Not propagating X-Correlation-ID through async events — event payloads should
        include correlation_id so log traces can be followed across the message broker

    concepts:
      - API Gateway pattern (routing, auth, cross-cutting concerns only)
      - Circuit breaker state machine (closed → open → half-open)
      - Correlation ID propagation across sync and async boundaries
      - Structured JSON logging for distributed systems
      - Event payload design (include enough context to avoid callbacks)

    deliverables:
      - Notification Service with RabbitMQ consumer and GET /notifications
      - API Gateway with routing table, JWT middleware, circuit breaker
      - Structured JSON logger shared across all services (shared/logger package)
      - X-Correlation-ID middleware in gateway and propagation in all services
      - End-to-end integration test through gateway

# ─── ANTI-PATTERNS EXPLICITLY BANNED ─────────────────────────────────────────
anti_patterns:
  - name: Shared Database
    description: >
      Any two services pointing at the same PostgreSQL instance or schema.
      Each service owns its data; cross-service data needs come from events or
      API calls, never direct DB joins.
  - name: Synchronous Call Chain
    description: >
      Gateway calls URL Service which calls Analytics Service which calls
      Notification Service. A chain of depth > 1 is a distributed monolith.
